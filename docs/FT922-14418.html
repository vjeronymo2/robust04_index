			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Mr Major's new passion Mr John Major must know something about the British people that the rest of us have failed to grasp. That is one explanation for what seems to be his eccentric choice of topic over the past few days. Another is that he has been addressing a subject that he believes to be important, with little thought for the electoral bottom line. It beats me. Perhaps he suspects he has nothing left to lose. The story began on Sunday. Labour was at least two percentage points ahead. The Conservatives faced probable defeat. What did our prime minister do? He spoke about Scotland - at a meeting in London. He warned of the danger of the break-up of the United Kingdom. This is an important subject. Half of Scotland and at least 2 per cent of England must have found it fascinating. To my mind, which may be cluttered with the orthodoxies of the campaign, that wasted a day. This may not matter. Many Conservatives believe that you cannot gain by politicking on a Sunday. Let us say that little advantage was lost. Yesterday was harder to understand. I had been in touch with Labour on Sunday. 'What will you concentrate on this week?' The answer came smoothly - 'the recession, the health service - and, as a sleeper, poll tax'. Sharp on 7.45 yesterday morning, the Labour team sauntered in to their press conference, their dark suits enlivened by red roses freshly pinned in place. Mr Neil Kinnock was there. So was Mr John Smith. They were accompanied by Mrs Margaret Beckett, Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair. Mr Jack Cunningham took the chair. One after another the members of this proto-cabinet read out smooth prepared statements on the recession and how Labour proposed to get the country out of it. The press corps - including representatives of pro-Conservative newspapers - appeared to be charmed. Mr Kinnock, glowing in the artificial aura of authority bestowed upon him by his opinion poll lead, put on his special low, slow, serious voice to answer questions. He was not given any trouble. Over to the Conservative session. In came the prime minister, accompanied by Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. They looked dolorous. Prepared statements were read out. The prime minister spoke about Scotland and the danger of the break-up of the United Kingdom, Mr Hurd about how 'a hung parliament would hang the recovery'. The questioning was brisk, and sceptical. This is baffling. The hung parliament warning makes some sort of tactical sense. The Conservatives do need to convince their supporters that voting Liberal Democrat could give victory to Labour. Against that, the very mention of an outcome with no overall majority is a contradiction in terms for a party that insists that it will win outright. It is a high-risk strategy to keep the constitutional debate, arcane to many voters, on the agenda. The warnings about Scotland may appeal to Tory party workers for whom the preservation of the union and the sanctity of parliament are articles of faith, but can they tempt English floating voters rightwards? 'It would have been better if he had warned about mortgages going up under Labour,' muttered a prominent Thatcherite as we left. It is difficult to see how negative campaigning on constitutional reform at this late stage will help the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats are fighting a single-issue campaign, but they have little choice. Electoral reform is their principal reason for existence. Labour deploys its Scottish and general constitutional proposals from time to time but this is explicable as an effort to win the voters' trust by professing a willingness to share power. It is directly threatened by the Scottish nationalists. It must respond. It does so - in Scotland. The Tories have nothing to bring to this debate. They would be better off saying nothing. It is a fair bet that Mr Major has been made aware of this opinion as held by some of his colleagues, but he has disregarded it. His mission as he sees it is to save the constitution from those who would ravage it. This is a recent development. It has three strands. Following his exertions at the Maastricht summit he came to regard the threat to Britain inherent in a federal Europe as of overriding importance. As prime minister, he has developed a strong awareness of what he sees as the threat to the union implicit in Scottish separatism. Latterly, the campaign has released in him a powerful historical sense of the importance of parliament in its traditional form. The strength of this particular feeling came as a surprise to everybody, including, just possibly, Mr Major himself. These are all serious matters. Mr Major has alluded to them before, but his words have not been satisfactorily reported. On Sunday, and again yesterday, he felt he just had to speak out. Perhaps it will help his image. His previously unsuspected passion may not win him the election, but it is no less noble for that.</p>

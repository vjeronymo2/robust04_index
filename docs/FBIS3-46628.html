			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], in an interview with YOMIURI  SHIMBUN on 27 December, said it was highly possible that if the  political reform bills failed to pass the current special Diet  session, either the lower house would be dissolved or the  cabinet would resign en masse.    He added emphatically: "Judging from the way the economy  looks now, unemployment will peak around February or March. We  must not create a governmental vacuum now by dissolving the  Diet. We must think of a way to avoid such a situation."    "That is one of the reasons why I say the bill to prevent  corruption must be acted on first," he said.    Murayama's remarks made it clear that he wants the ruling  and  opposition parties to reach agreement.</p>

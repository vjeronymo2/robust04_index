			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Analysts await word on BTR strategy - The Week Ahead BTR is expected to report lower annual pre-tax profits on Wednesday, but most interest will focus on how the industrial conglomerate is digesting its latest acquisition, Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, which it bought for Pounds 1.55bn in November after a bitterly-contested takeover battle. BTR is unlikely to give anything away about possible disposals, but analysts will want to hear what the enlarged group has to say about its trading outlook. The impact of recession is expected to have cut last year's pre-tax profits from Pounds 966m to below Pounds 900m. As the world's largest mining group, the RTZ Corporation could not be expected to escape the problems associated with recession in the US and the UK and present low metals prices. Analysts expect the group to report on Thursday a fall of about 35 per cent in net attributable profits for 1991. This would take them down from last year's Pounds 507m to between Pounds 295m and Pounds 340m. Most commentators suggest that RTZ will maintain its dividend payment at 19.5p because an increase to, say, 20p, would send the wrong signals about prospects for the current year. Standard Chartered Bank will announce on Wednesday pre-tax profits of Pounds 200m to Pounds 220m, a marked improvement on 1990's Pounds 150m after heavy provisions. It has had relatively few lending problems in the UK other than to Brent Walker, while its Asia Pacific region had a good year and is thought to have made a strong contribution. Last year's 20p dividend at is expected to be maintained. Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer, should turn in 1991 pre-tax profits of around Pounds 182m on Wednesday, down a little from Pounds 191.2m a year earlier. A final dividend of around 6.4p, up 7 per cent, is expected. Poultry will again peck away at group profits, contributing only Pounds 28m (Pounds 59.4m) with a small loss in the UK offset by profits abroad. On the positive side, Maple Leaf, its Canadian subsidiary, has performed well. Encouraging developments include the recent purchase of Unigate's poultry business which should help bring rationalisation to the industry and an upturn in Hillsdown's profits this year to around Pounds 235m. United Biscuits is expected to report on Thursday a small increase in 1991 pre-tax profits to Pounds 205m from Pounds 197.7m. Given the group's confidence in its long term prospects, the final dividend could be raised 3 per cent to 9.4p. McVities biscuits and Terry's chocolates have held their own but KP snack foods have been disappointing. Bright spots last year were the growing European operations and the Keebler biscuit business in the US. Saatchi and Saatchi, feeling the pinch of the recession in advertising, is likely to report on Tuesday a loss of around Pounds 50m for the 15 months ended December. This will included provisions for unused office space and restructuring costs. Even without those, it probably ran up a small loss of Pounds 8.6m as it struggles to create a vibrant business after the swingeing organisational and financial restructurings of last year.</p>

It further codifies the practice of Immigration Judges conducting telephone hearings in deportation, exclusion, or rescission cases, and codifies the authority of the Immigration Judge to hold video teleconferenced hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule also clarifies regulatory language to conform with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in absentia  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> hearing provisions under the Immigration and Nationality Act (the ``Act''). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received no later than June 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to Gerald S.

The requirements that the Immigration Judge enter the order without a hearing is limited to cases in which the applicant or respondent was represented at the time of the stipulation. The stipulation must be signed on behalf of the government and by both the applicant or respondent and his or her attorney or other representative qualified under part 292 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This procedure codifies the litigation practice in some jurisdictions where, if a party enters into a stipulated request for a deportation or exclusion order with a written waiver of his or her appearance and rights, the Immigration Judge may sign the order of deportation or exclusion based upon the written record. This practice facilitates judicial efficiency in uncontested cases. For example, it has been used to expedite departure shortly after the sentencing of aliens convicted of offenses rendering them immediately deportable or excludable. Whereas this practice currently occurs at the discretion of the Immigration Judge, the proposed rule would make it mandatory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedure also has been used by imprisoned criminal aliens having no apparent avenue of relief from deportation or exclusion who, after consultation with counsel, wish to avoid further detention pending deportation or exclusion proceedings following release from prison. While protecting the rights of the parties, the rule also implements the statutory requirement of expeditious deportation of criminal aliens under 8 U.S.C. 1252(i), 1252a(d). If used more widely by litigants and criminal prosecutors, the procedure could alleviate overcrowded federal, state, and local detention facilities and eliminate the need to calendar such uncontested cases on crowded immigration court dockets. The procedure is not limited to cases arising from the criminal context and can be used in other appropriate settings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New subparagraph (c) establishes the authority of Immigration Judges to hold telephonic hearings. Although the proposal is meant to be applicable nationwide,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purba <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> INS, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  884 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1988), holds that telephonic deportation hearings may only be conducted with the consent of the parties. This is in conflict with the proposed regulation, which permits telephonic hearings to be conducted at the discretion of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judges in the geographical confines the Ninth Circuit currently follow  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purba <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and will continue to follow the law of the circuit if the proposed rule is finally adopted. In all areas outside the Ninth Circuit the regulation would be effective and telephonic hearings would be conducted when an Immigration Judge, in his or her sound discretion, deems it appropriate. Subparagraph (c) also codifies the authority of Immigration Judges to hold video teleconferenced hearings. This practice increases administrative efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also makes minor technical changes in subparagraph (a) to conform with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in absentia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1252. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

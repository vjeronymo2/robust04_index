			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hamas, Islamic Resistance Movement, official </F> spokesman engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah by KEYHAN correspondent  Hasan Khamehyar; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Khamehyar] Some believe that the train carrying  the solution to the Middle East dispute has reached the first  station and that normalization of relations between Arabs and  the Zionist regime in the political, economic, and cultural  fields is imminent. How does Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] view these changes?    [Ghawshah] Permit me to state that what is being described  as  the peace train is a mere falsehood. What has really happened  is that the Zionist enemy has managed to sign an agreement in  the form of a "principled accord." This accord does not include  a clause mandating its implementation and that implementation  has been postponed. In lieu of this accord, the Zionist regime  has practiced extortion on the Palestinians, the Arabs, and the  countries of the world. It wants the Arabs to lift economic  embargoes on Israel and to normalize relations. It demands  economic assistance from Western countries. Therefore, what has  happened up to now is not peace but a complete lie. On the  other hand, the accord has been evaluated and it has been proven  to everyone that the elements of weakness and discord are  greater than those for attaining power and prosperity.    [Khamehyar] As you have stated, we also concur that the  accord is one of surrender and compromise. What is your concept  of peace?    [Ghawshah] This accord is one-sided and the rights of one of  the sides has not been taken into consideration. The  Palestinian side signed the accord when it did not have any  freedom of action. It can be said that the accord was dictated  to it and it was forced to accept it. [passage omitted]    [Khamehyar] In view of the people's opposition to the  Gaza-Jericho accord, what program do you have to defuse such  opposition?    [Ghawshah] Following the reports on such an accord, the  Palestinians were engulfed by a wave of astonishment. However,  they soon recovered and the nation woke up to the treacherous  nature of the plot and began to oppose it. On 13 September  armed operations, especially martyrdom-seeking operations,  proliferated among the combatant Palestinian youth.    In addition, many supporters of the Fatah movement also  joined the fray in opposing the mounting suppression of the  Palestinian revolutionaries by the Zionist soldiers and security  forces. In the past three days anti-Zionist operations have  risen noticeably; in just one day one of the mujahidin was  martyred and 80 others were wounded. Therefore, it can be said  that the people's opposition to the Gaza-Jericho accord has  proliferated remarkably.    However, with regard to the 10 Palestinian factions, their  current activities in the occupied areas are more in the fields  of publications and politics rather than operations. Outside  the occupied areas, no serious measure has been taken to create  solidarity and political coordination. Nevertheless, all these  groups should not be viewed in the same light as those, such as  Hamas, that have never stopped their activities and do not wait  for any unified or concerted decisions by the 10 factions. They  continue their jihad and strategic struggle. [passage omitted]    [Khamehyar] 'Arafat is now seeking to mitigate the intense  opposition of the various Palestinian groups to the Gaza-Jericho  accord, and it is for this purpose that he met leader of the  Muslim Brotherhood Mustafa Mashhur in Egypt and requested his  mediation between you and him. The head of the Palestinian  delegation to Madrid, Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, also played the same  role. How does Hamas view these efforts?    [Ghawshah] These are political tactics that the beleaguered  'Arafat resorts to constantly. The aware Islamic movements  never fall prey to these deceptions. After signing the  Gaza-Jericho accord on 20 August 1993, 'Arafat officially  recognized the Zionist enemy and went to Yemen. He requested  that the president arrange a meeting between himself and Hamas,  after which a Yemeni faction tried to mediate but Hamas rejected  the overtures and announced that it would not meet 'Arafat.  [passage omitted]    Unfortunately, our Muslim Egyptian brothers met 'Arafat.  Perhaps this meeting was arranged under certain circumstances  that were imposed or merely conformed to the nature of the  Egyptian regime. [sentence as published]. It is also possible  that the Egyptian regime created the conditions for such a  meeting. It is well known that Hamas officially conveyed its  displeasure about this meeting to the Muslim Brotherhood. We  told them that such a meeting was not necessary and that 'Arafat  should not be given the opportunity to benefit from the support  and cover of Islamists. [passage omitted]    [Khamehyar] The second Islamic Peoples' Conference is being  convened in Khartoum because of the efforts of Hasan al-Turabi  and some reports say that 'Arafat will participate. In view of  the fact that the Sudanese have not adopted a clear stance on  the 'Arafat-Rabin compromise, what is the Hamas position on this  conference, especially on Hasan al-Turabi?    [Ghawshah] Allow me to speak clearly on this subject. Hamas  was invited to participate in this conference. We were the  founding members of this congress in April 1991, and I remember  that the Islamic Republic of Iran was also a founding member.  Hamas assessed the invitation in light of Sudan's political  posture. There was a difference of opinion in the Hamas  political bureau. One was that the conference should be  boycotted because the Sudanese Government had tacitly supported  the accord. In addition, the Sudanese Foreign Minister, as well  as the director of the political desk at the Sudanese Foreign  Ministry, had declared their support of the 'Arafat-Rabin  compromise. Similarly, the Sudanese representative to the Arab  League had supported the compromise.    Al-Turabi statements have been conflicting. On the one hand  he directly supported 'Arafat, but on the other he criticized  many of the clauses in the accord. It was on this basis that  some of the Hamas members opposed our participation in the Sudan  conference.    Another group [in Hamas] believed that for the sake of  expediency, after obtaining the actual stance of the Sudanese,  we should participate in the conference, and a message was sent  to Hasan al-Turabi by Hamas.    The other point is that Hasan al-Turabi assured us that the  issue of the Gaza-Jericho accord would not be on the  conference's agenda and that this issue would be delegated to  the participating teams. It was on this basis that the Hamas  political bureau decided to participate in this conference and  to condemn the Gaza-Jericho accord at the Islamic Peoples'  Conference in Sudan. We also agreed that if 'Arafat planned to  participate we would boycott the conference. [passage omitted]    [Khamehyar] Will you participate in the autonomous elections  scheduled for next year? What is your opinion on Shim'on Peres'  remarks that if Hamas gains votes in the next elections they  will be annulled?    [Ghawshah] These offensive remarks are a trait of the filthy  and strategic propaganda of the Zionists. The PLO is also  seeking to propound similar premises to deceive Hamas so that it  can be dragged into the elections. The Hamas position is as  follows:    First, as all are aware, the agreement on Gaza and Jericho  has been signed for limited autonomy. It is possible that in  the future it would include the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas  rejects the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord. It basically rejects  the mechanism [preceding word in English] of autonomy since the  elections are part of this mechanism for the implementation of  autonomy. No movement can tolerate its principles being  trampled underfoot and accept this mechanism. It is for this  reason that Hamas has officially declared its opposition to the  elections and has asked the people to boycott them, but not with  violence. This is the final stance of Hamas, which has been  adopted especially on the elections for autonomy, after  extensive discussions among the movement's leaders.    [Khamehyar] It is feared that if the opponents of this  compromise continue their course of action and support the  intifadah, they will be hounded and suppressed. How do you see  the future?    [Ghawshah] When one carries the banner of the jihad, he does  not fear anything and has considered the consequences. He knows  what price he will pay for his lawful obligations. [passage  omitted]    We are aware that the United States is seeking to scorch the  roots of Hamas. It is exerting pressure on Saudi Arabia to  prevent the Saudi people's zakat [alms] from reaching Hamas. It  has also asked Jordan to pressure Hamas and prevent its  political and propaganda activities on Jordanian soil. It is  also clear that the United States is pressuring Syria to limit  the activities of the 10 factions.    We are confident that the noble countries and governments  will not succumb to such pressure and blackmail and that the  Muslim nations will continue to support the struggling Islamic  movements of Palestine.    [Khamehyar] In your interview with the Beirut newspaper  AL-DIYAR, you announced that a conference would be convened with  the extensive participation of Islamic groups and factions so  that a strategic stance for combating this plot could be  adopted. In view of the fact that a conference like this was  convened last year, what are your expectations of this kind of  conference?    [Ghawshah] When I was interviewed by AL-DIYAR newspaper, I  was very aware that, in cooperation with the 10 Palestinian  factions, Hamas would be able to establish a national and  Islamic coalition for counteracting the Gaza-Jericho accord. It  was suggested that the conference should be held in Yemen or  Syria, but it was postponed after some of the groups reviewed  their decisions. We are optimistic that we can eliminate the  obstacles in the near future and that, under the aegis of our  common denominators, we will be able to attain complete cohesion  and coordination.    I believe that this conference will be extremely important.  In this manner, we will be able to prove to the world that the  Palestinian nation is alive and can elect the leadership it  wants.    [Khamehyar] Last week, King Husayn presented the Jordanian  parliament with a plan to normalize relations with Israel, and  the deputies unanimously supported this plan. If this plan is  approved, will your position in Jordan be endangered?    [Ghawshah] Perhaps a majority of the deputies who were  recently elected to the parliament agree with this plan, but one  must await the outcome of the debates over the qualifications of  these deputies. Don't forget that there is intense opposition  to the normalization of relations with the Zionist regime among  the people and the parliament of that country. Half of the  people in Jordan are Palestinians, and recent polls prove that  most of the people are opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord. We  are aware that the Jordanian regime has accepted this accord  because of pressure from the United States.    The Jordanians initially declared their opposition to the  accord. But when Clinton's message, which mentioned economic  pressure, reached the hands of the Jordanian officials, Jordan  agreed to accept the accord.    Let us not forget that the Gaza-Jericho accord also  threatens  the interests of Jordan, which has been referred to as the  substitute homeland for Palestine and as the ultimate homeland  of the Palestinians, and the people are very aware of these  threats.    What is your opinion of the recent letters and guidance  that Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin sent from prison? He has  agreed to participate in the legislative body that will be  established after the elections. What is your appraisal of the  matter?    [Ghawshah] We have received three letters from Shaykh Ahmad  Yasin that were sent from prison. In the first letter, he gave  the details of his meeting with Israeli legislator Talab  al-Sani' [name as published]. In the second, he listed guidance  for the Hamas forces and combatants. The third letter--which  has generated a great deal of controversy--dealt with the  current situation, the Gaza-Jericho accord, the PLO, and the  fate of the Palestine issue. In this letter, Shaykh Yasin  stressed that the Gaza-Jericho accord is an accord of  degradation and surrender and that the PLO has destroyed the  hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian nation. He refers to  the so-called legislative body and accepts participation in  elections. It is for this reason that this letter has plunged  us into doubt and ambivalence. Everyone is aware that Ahmad  Yasin rejects autonomy and that he is paralyzed and cannot write  letters. He needs another person to write what he dictates. The  Hamas councils are currently investigating the letters to  establish their authenticity.</p>

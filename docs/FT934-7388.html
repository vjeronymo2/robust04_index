			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report The GOLD price rose sharply in London but proved unable to better its recent peak on Dollars 378.50 a troy ounce and closed at Dollars 377.25, up Dollars 5.25 on the day. Dealers said the rise was sparked off on New York's Comex and then fuelled by London-based short-covering. 'We're seeing US fund and trade demand, and London was a little short anyway and has had to cover,' one explained. SILVER prices were similarly firmer, with cash metal climbing 15 cents to Dollars 4.68 an ounce after breaking through long-standing resistance at Dollars 4.60. At the London Metal Exchange the NICKEL market's failure to build on an early advance above Dollars 4,700 a tonne for three months metal prompted selling back down to Dollars 4,640, a loss of Dollars 60 from Wednesday, although some late commission house buying cushioned the fall. The London Commodity Exchange March COCOA futures price proved unable to make further ground after edging to a new second position peak of Pounds 1,028 a tonne in the morning, although the rise did not attract substantial producer selling, dealers said. The price closed at Pounds 1,019 a tonne, down Pounds 2 on balance. Compiled from Reuters</p>

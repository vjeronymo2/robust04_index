			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Minister of Railways K. Salatov by </F> GUDOK correspondent Viktor Peremyshlev: "Maximum Convenience and  Service for the Passenger"]    [Text] Passenger transportation is continuously in  the ministry's field of vision. Three times as many collegium  sessions were devoted to it last year alone. Specific measures  were outlined, and the railroads were given instructions on  improving the organization and quality of passenger services at  terminals and on trains. A special government decree on suburban  services was issued at the initiative of the MPS [Ministry of  Railways]. However, it was noted at the last collegium meeting  (December 1993) that the gain expected from the measures  outlined was not received. Our correspondent talks with Deputy  Minister K. Salatov today about the problems facing the  passenger transportation complex and the steps that need to be  taken to improve its work.    [Peremyshlev] Kim Khamitovich, it has been about 3 months  since you began studying passenger service problems, and after  these 100 days, it is assumed that a report will be made to the  public on what you have managed to accomplish. Can we expect  somthing such as this from you at the forthcoming collegium at  the beginning of April?    [Salatov] This period--100 days--is not long enough to be  able to introduce radical changes in the work of this complex.  Without repeating what has been approved in the collegium  meetings, I will note one feature: their decisions were  predominantly oriented toward the passengers' interests in many  respects. But look at what is taking place on the trains, in the  terminals, in our entire area of service. The attitude toward  passengers has been callous, and it remains that way. But after  all, if a person pays more for a fare than he did before, he  should receive more in the form of attention, services, and  simply a respectful attitude.    [Peremyshlev] Frankly speaking, I did not expect that our  conversation would begin in precisely this way. Although not  everything is simple here. The same crudeness by the  conductor--this is not only a display of bad behavior, but a  result of the poor condition of the rolling stock and economic  disorders. Today, as an example, a dishonest conductor "has"  much more than an honest one--for carrying extra baggage,  "stowaways," and other "services."    [Salatov] Well, every family has its black sheep. But a  conductor's wage is not bad at all--an average of 200,000  rubles, besides the out-of-town assignment and other payments.  Add to this the stability of his social position based on the  wage agreement. And it is becoming apparent that the problem is  not with his economic status, and not even in the peculiarities  of his character, although there is reason to think there has  been poor personnel selection.    Look at the flight attendant on an airplane. She radiates  kindness and respect. The flight attendant undergoes testing and  takes a special training course. They follow roughly the same  procedure on American railroads, by the way. If we tested for  occupational suitability and studied personnel selection... I am  certain that the human factor comes into action before the  economic factor or any other factor. We have become accustomed  to boorishness, I believe. But after all, we are standing on the  threshold of competition for transport services. There are huge  "Icaruses" today at the Kursk and the Kazan terminals. And their  invitations guarantee that they will take passengers quickly and  comfortably to Ryazan and other cities. And the buses are  crowded as well.    We are talking about financial losses in the billions. But  some trains are half-empty today. The railroads do not want to  cut back the amount of traffic. Then they should look for an  opportunity to fill up the railcars! We cannot make up for  financial losses by rate indexing alone. We have to respect the  laws of economics: the relative expenditures can only be reduced  by an increase in transport volume. So we have to fight for the  passenger. By giving him more comfort. So this year we have set  the target of 70 company trains.    [Peremyshlev] We have 52 now.    [Salatov] Yes. Nearly 200 consists. The company trains  differ  sharply from the normal trains. They are filled, even though a  ticket on them is 1.5 times more expensive. You automatically  begin thinking about what the passenger needs. He needs comfort,  convenience, and good service.    We cannot make 100 percent of the trains company trains, of  course. And this is not necessary, either: we have a  responsibility to keep trains less expensive. But we have to  raise the level of normal trains up to the level of company  trains.    [Peremyshlev] Should I interpret your words to mean that  service is the most important element which can raise passenger  transportation to a new level?    [Salatov] Absolutely correct. Creating conditions for the  passenger which suit him completely. I think this is the key to  success.    [Peremyshlev] I would like to ask a more specific question:  if we find fine people who put their heart into their work, put  them in a dilapidated railcar where the heating does not work,  the boiler is broken, on a train that is always late, won't this  brutalize even the most good-natured person under such  conditions? And he will have to hear a great deal that is  unpleasant from the passengers as well.    [Salatov] A complaint we received recently spoke of just  such  a situation. In February, we took 184 children on vacation from  a special school in Moscow. The railcars had no belts on the  generators, and hence there was no light. They are not heated.  There was no tea or anything. I asked the railroad that made up  the train: how could such a thing happen? This is irresponsible!  Of those who prepared these three railcars and those who gave  the order to connect them up. And of the conductors as well.    Irresponsibility and carelessness--this is the problem of  problems today. A sanitary inspector forbids the railcars from  being used, but there is a slipshod individual who does not  respond to his reprimands and puts a railcar in the train  anyway. And such actions cannot be justified by our poverty or  any shortages--we are more irresponsible than we are poor.    Our attention to the traveler should begin at the cashier's  window in the terminal. But why is there no advertisement: "Dear  passengers! To ensure your safety, we cannot carry more than 36  kilograms of baggage. Turn the rest over to the baggage car."  No, the ministry order on this is read over the terminal radio,  at best.    [Peremyshlev] So good decisions are being made, but they are  not being carried out. One of the reasons you cited was  carelessness. What else?    [Salatov] You are right, it would be too obvious if  everything were explained by this. Passenger problems require  constant and continuous attention. But at times we lose sight of  them. This inattentiveness stems from the inertia in our  thinking: when there was a huge volume of freight being carried,  the passenger runs were given credit at their own expense and  attention was given to them in accordance with the residual  principle, so to speak. Today, when the freight runs have  declined, we should turn our attention to passenger services.  But the dispatchers still give first attention to the freight  trains. Just as before, they are encouraged to let the freight  runs pass through first of all.    The last collegium meeting approved a new schedule in which  priority is given to passenger trains. So the mental  reorientation is under way, all the same.    [Peremyshlev] You said that decisions were made at the  collegium meetings on services for passengers, based mainly on  their interests. I had occasion to attend practically all the  meetings mentioned, but in the documents presented at them I did  not see any results of the sociological study of the phenomenon  which is called passenger flow in official language. The  migration by people, passengers' preferences, the social status  of the average passenger--a million questions arise. But where  are the answers? Didn't you reach that point?    [Salatov] I cannot agree that we did not reach this point.  Obviously, the residual principle is being discussed here as  well. There are no services on the railroads which have really  devoted study to marketing. Ask the commander of the appropriate  service how the passenger flow is studied, and you will hear: it  increases or decreases. But they will not say why. They do not  know.    A department for this has been formed in the Passenger Main  Administration. But I personally do not see the amount of work I  am describing. In any event, they are not conducting any surveys  or studying...    [Peremyshlev] Have they postponed it for the future?    [Salatov] We are putting off too much until the future. As  an  example, the railcar problem... In order to provide good service  for the passenger, as you noted, a properly equipped railcar is  needed.    But what can we give the passenger when there aren't enough  railcars even for the company trains, which should meet the  sectorial standard for a "firm."    Deliveries from Germany are being cut back under the slogan  of the need to develop domestic passenger railcar manufacturing.  At the same time, it is planned to allocate funds from the  budget to purchase the Tver railcars for exactly one-third of  the target given to the plant. We are trying to help the Tver  workers to obtain materials for production, but they also need  money to survive. Railroads will continue to be the predominant  form of transportation in the future in Russia. And this must be  considered the principal social task for railroad workers. And  the organs which are obliged to bear this in mind should not  tell us: "These are your problems!"    The priorities should not simply be declared, but provided  for financially. But for the present... The rates are monitored  by the state and regulated by it. They do not provide for the  sums to obtain railcars. This would require the cost of a fare  to be substantially increased, which is simply impossible under  current conditions.    But how do we provide for quality in passenger services when  they are unprofitable and there are no subsidies? It is becoming  more and more difficult for us every day to keep our form of  transportation the most accessible and widely used.    In addition to the rolling stock, there are the tracks, the  technical structures, the terminals... Our comrades stopped at  the terminal in Washington at one time and could not understand  whether it was a terminal or a concert hall: there were exhibits  and concerts on the upper floors... You published a good series  on the terminals in Moscow. We have to look throughout Russia  for what is good and bad and provide the passenger with the  maximum amount of service which he needs. I repeat--we must  fight for the passenger!    [Peremyshlev] Kim Khamitovich, are you a realist?    [Salatov] Both a realist and an optimist.    [Peremyshlev] So much of what has been mentioned today will  be done?    [Salatov] A great deal has already been done today. And  without large capital investments. We have to develop what we  have. We have good reserves to carry out the collegium  decisions. We have to set ourselves the task of fulfilling them  to the maximum extent possible. This is the key to success.    We have many ideas. We have to work. I am confident that the  forthcoming collegium meeting will take place with this attitude  as well. Passenger services are a major aspect of our work. And  we all must apply ourselves to it with responsibility.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Minister urges more Swans talks Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, yesterday invited the sole prospective bidder for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, to last-minute talks about its future. Mr Freeman said he was very disappointed that Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie had rejected the Ministry of Defence's latest proposals, concerning the price at which Swans' existing MoD frigates contract would be transferred to CMN. The MoD said: 'Mr Freeman hopes that, in the interests of the future of the yard, CMN will be prepared to meet him shortly.' Mr Iskandar Safa, principal shareholder in CMN's parent company, Soffia, said yesterday he was willing to take up Mr Freeman's offer of a meeting but would first reach a decision on whether to pursue his acquisition of Swans. 'I think it's more logical,' said Mr Safa. 'We will make our position clear today.' Receiver Price Waterhouse has set a deadline of tomorrow for CMN to start paying the wages of Swan Hunter's remaining 100-strong design and technical team. If the company does not start doing so the team will be made redundant immediately. Without them, the yard, which will finish its last vessel this autumn, will be unable to tender for more work, ending hopes of a sale as a going concern. CMN, which insists that it will buy Swans only if the yard has a two-year workload, has proposed a deal under which it would take on the existing frigates contract and sub-contract work on the last vessel to the receiver. It would use the balance to pay the Pounds 200,000 a month wage bill of the design team until the end of the year in the hope of securing more work. CMN wants Pounds 57.7m from the MoD for the frigates contract, the price agreed last month. The MoD, saying that passing time has reduced the risk, last week offered Pounds 57m, then raised its offer by Pounds 350,000. Mr Safa yesterday denied that CMN had rejected the compromise deal, but again said that he believed the frigates contract price should be Pounds 57.7m. 'In this deal we happen to be the purchaser and people shouldn't forget it,' he said. 'We have to really assess the risk to be taken.'</p>

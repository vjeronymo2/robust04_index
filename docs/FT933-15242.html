			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Looking to computer technology for growth - After centuries of papermaking, Portals sees a future in electronics PORTALS has been producing banknote paper since 1712 when Henri de Portal, a French refugee, set up a paper mill in Hampshire. Twelve years later the company was supplying the Bank of England with its banknote paper, a contract which it still holds today. After the first world war the Bank of England allowed Portals to manufacture paper for other banking and trade authorities and the group won its first foreign government contract in 1921. This century the demand for security paper has been fuelled by monetary inflation, the emergence of post-colonial independent nations and most recently the break-up of the Soviet bloc. Security papermaking, augmented more recently by other specialist papermaking activities such as teabag manufacturing, has proved an appropriately mature niche business, delivering a steady performance. Last year the division generated just over half of Portals' Pounds 194m turnover and 70 per cent of profits. But since 1988, when Portals acquired the Paragon electrical engineering group and a new chief executive, Mr Michael Morley along with it, the management has looked increasingly to the emerging protection and control division to provide future growth. This relatively new division groups together a handful of environmental services, engineering and computer technology businesses. It has grown quickly over the past five years although its profit contribution has lagged, mainly because of of Airol-Flaregas, the lossmaking manufacturer of low-emission burners for the petrochemical industry which was finally sold in January. That sale should enable Mr John Cope, a main-board director since September, to pursue the goal of turning the division, and the Portals Computer Technology businesses in particular, into Portals' 'engine for growth'. Servalec, a small company based south of Sheffield, symbolises this aspiration. The company which employs 220 people, three-quarters of them engineers, provides its customers with highly sophisticated software products and fully integrated systems built around a core software package called 'Scope', which runs on desktop computers and workstations. Servalec's products 'enable its customers to better control and manage their businesses', says Mr Cope, one of the company's founder shareholders. That means not only providing them with the information tools to improve cost effectiveness and efficiency, but also enabling companies to meet the growing burden of legislative, environmental and safety requirements. Servalec, which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.56m) on turnover of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 12.2m) last year, began in the late 1970s designing and building process control systems for British Steel - an industrial heritage which Mr Cope believes gives the small company a distinct advantage over some of its larger rivals which include Logica and EDS Scion. Since then it has substantially broadened its customer base to include many blue chip customers in the water, oil and gas, and food industries as well as those in more traditional industrial sectors. Building integrated systems around standard computer hardware platforms, together with specialised microprocessor-based equipment supplied by two smaller sister companies - Seprol and Technolog - Servalec has been particularly successful winning customers for its telemetry systems in the water industry. All of the regional water authorities already have computer-based telemetry systems, which enable managers and supervisors to monitor and control remote sites like pumping stations or water treatment plants. However, the need to upgrade and refurbish these systems provides a continuing source of business. More importantly in terms of growth, Servalec won a Pounds 2.8m contract last year from Anglia National Rivers Authority for a regional telemetry system which is integrated with a flood forecasting system. Other river authorities are expected to follow suit and some analysts, including Mr David McCrossan of Kleinwort Benson research, have estimated that this market alone could be worth between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m over the next 10 years. However Servalec's information gathering, control and analysis systems potentially have many other applications. Under one new contract worth Pounds 3m the company is building a 'supervisory control and data acquisition' system for the BBC which is designed to monitor automatically almost 400 transmitter sites throughout the UK. The system contains predictive facilities to enable the BBC to anticipate technical, security and other problems at transmitter sites and take precautionary action. Under another large contract Servalec is designing a replacement control and monitoring system which will cover all the main utility services - including the runway lights - at Heathrow airport. Both Mr Cope and Mr Alan Gilby, Servalec's managing director, believe there is a substantial pent-up demand for systems which combine the features of traditional process control with management information systems. These can then be integrated with other computer-based systems like financial accounting and database systems to provide managers with a more comprehensive view of their business. But by designing the system from bottom-up, rather than from top-down, Mr Cope insists Servalec can provide more effective products than many of its competitors. However, he accepts that if Servalec has a weakness it is 'in terms of our marketing skills.' This, he says, is now being corrected. Driven by recession-resistant factors like environmental and safety concerns, as well as the desire for greater efficiency, Mr Cope believes Servalec and Portals Computer Technology can deliver the kind of accelerated growth Portals is seeking to offset its maturing papermaking business.</p>

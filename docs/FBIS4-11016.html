			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susy Castillo; from the "Extravision" newscast; </F> passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] [Castillo] For the first time, and before a battery  of journalists, former President Daniel Ortega, FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front] secretary general, has commented on  the so-called currents of opinion that have emerged within  Sandinism in anticipation of the upcoming FSLN congress in May:    [Ortega] "Sandinism is the most democratic expression among  this country's political forces, as clearly reflected by the  many compatriots voicing views that are even contradictory. It  is democracy at work."    [Castillo] The media have termed the differences among the  various groups as currents within Sandinism, but Ortega has  called them opinions [estados de opinion].    [Ortega] "We do not call them currents. I call them  established opinions. There are no currents established in the  FSLN. There are established opinions, established groups. I  think these positions are part of the democratic game that has  emerged with great force within Sandinism. I think nobody  should feel ashamed for his position.    "I would be ashamed if I stopped fighting along with the  people and the poor, if I became an instrument of Capitalists,  of the rich, and the bourgeoisie, and if I surrendered and knelt  before imperialism. I would be ashamed by those things."    [Castillo] Why is there talk of establishing a new FSLN, a  more democratic FSLN? Is the FSLN undemocratic?    [Ortega] "This is a new kind of democratic process that  started with the previous FSLN congress. We held an election;  it was a normal election, normal for political parties,  revolutionary as well as Social Democratic ones; it was an  election based on tickets [eleccion por plancha].    "Thus, we established democratic mechanisms. For the first  time, in 1991, the FSLN discussed a program and statutes; it  approved programs and statutes. That had never happened in FSLN  history. This was done democratically; that is, democracy made  its appearance within Sandinism in a new form in 1991. We must  now continue to strengthen democracy.    "In closing the 1991 congress, speaking on behalf of the  FSLN  directorate, I told participants that at the next congress we  would have to become more democratic. I added that this would  entail incorporating women in all groups of leadership,  including the National Directorate, that the elections for all  posts should be done by secret ballots, and that there should be  individual candidates, not tickets.    "Thus, this is nothing new. These are issues we already  discussed and announced. We called a congress precisely because  we want to renew and increase democracy within Sandinism. This  was my initiative. I consulted it with my fellow directorate  members on 19 July and announced it in the square, and the  Sandinist Assembly approved it later."    [Castillo] For the first time, Ortega admitted differences  within Sandinism that stem from a confusing position toward the  government.    [Unidentified reporter] "What is the main difference?    [Ortega] "I think the main difference concerns the fact that  in 1990, with the change of government, we defined a policy  toward this government that was not very clear, a policy that  bred confusion. This position prompted a sector of Sandinism to  follow one line and another sector to follow another; in other  words, our position toward the government has, in fact, divided  Sandinists.    "This is why when we say that during the congress we must  reach a consensus regarding our position toward the government,  we must do so with the conviction that it will reunify and  strengthen us.    Concerning the United States, Sandinists must reach a single  position toward this country regarding our methods of struggle.  I am talking about very specific aspects that lead to the  emergence of different positions, even contradictions, as the  ones we have seen.    "Thus, we must not overlook contradictions. The way to  confront contradictions is through organized and orderly  discussions through a (?special) congress, which we already  summoned."</p>

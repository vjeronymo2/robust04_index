			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE FAST SHUFFLE;  </P> <P> WANT TO BE A DEALER? IT'S NO BIG DEAL  </P> <P> It sounds like an orchestra made up of nothing but castanets.  </P> <P> Resonant, ceaseless clicking, clicking. Rhythmic, staccato, measured, constant.  </P> <P> Close your eyes and listen to it and before long a primal urge takes over and  you begin to reach for your wallet. Because there's something about the sound  of clattering poker chips that makes you want to get a bet down.  </P> <P> But at Hai Trinh's school, the chips don't represent real money, at least not  in the short run. They are props, teaching aids, used to train a roomful of men  and women in the precise art of card-dealing.  </P> <P> Trinh is co-owner of the Casino Card Dealers School in Westminster, a one-room  launching pad for local card fanciers who want to deal in the card clubs of  California (the closest such clubs are in Gardena and Bell Gardens). Graduates  of the school are skilled in dealing super pan 9 (a form of baccarat), Asian  poker and three other forms of poker: Texas hold 'em, five-card draw and  seven-card stud.  </P> <P> They come to the school, Trinh said, whenever they have time to spend in  practice. At almost any time of the day, he said, students are working at one  of the room's four tables topped by green felt, repeating again and again the  moves they'll use daily as professional dealers. Students not dealing often act  as players.  </P> <P> The action at the tables is quick and efficient. But is it difficult?  </P> <P> "Not at all," said Trinh, 27, who lives in Garden Grove and deals  professionally at the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens. "It does take practice, and  some people learn faster than others. It's easier for people who have gambled  before and know how it works. Usually, it takes about three months, but some  people can do it in three weeks."  </P> <P> Physical skill with the cards and the chips is not as important, Trinh said, as  the mental ability to know which bets to pay off, which to rake in, which hands  win, which hands lose.  </P> <P> "No, no, there's not much physical skill at all," he said. "You have to be neat  and careful and alert. The hardest thing to do is to try to stay awake and  alert late at night, because that's when most of your business is. And there  are all types of people in casinos, the good and the bad. So you have to stay  alert all the time."  </P> <P> However, he said, basic physical moves must be mastered absolutely. Students  begin with the most elementary action, the actual dealing out, one by one, of  the cards (called pitching). They then progress to learning how to spot winning  and losing hands, how to shuffle and finally how to oversee each of the games.  </P> <P> Most of his students, he said, either are unemployed or are unsatisfied with  their current jobs and want to become professional dealers.  </P> <P> Trinh, who said he used to make his living gambling in Las Vegas, quit his  studies as an electrical engineering major at Cal State Long Beach to become a  dealer. His sister, a former electrical engineer, quit that profession and now  also deals at a card club.  </P> <P> The money comes mostly from tips and tends to be erratic, but "you can live  fairly comfortably," Trinh said.  </P> <P> That is one of the prime motivations for Tinh Nguyen, 20, a student who lives  in Westminster. He has been practicing at Trinh's school for five months and  said he will continue until next July when he turns 21 and becomes eligible to  work in a card club.  </P> <P> "You make a lot of good money," said Nguyen, "and it's exciting and  challenging. It's fun for me because of working with numbers."  </P> <P> A facile dealer, Nguyen handles stacks of chips with the aplomb of a veteran,  quickly stacking and unstacking groups of four at a time, the professional  dealer's way of making quick change at the table.  </P> <P> However, Trinh said, great speed is not encouraged.  </P> <P> "We don't need speed," he said. "We need accuracy. After a while, if you go  fast, you can see what's happening, but the customers who come in maybe once a  week can't see what's happening. You have to let them see."  </P> <P> Smoothness is the rule. Even the simple act of pitching the cards should be  evenly paced and graceful, and the dealer must, above all, not expose any of  the cards in the process, Trinh said.  </P> <P> "They call it poetry in motion," said Joe Allenby, 32, of Downey, a  professional dealer and friend of Trinh's who is spending time at the school  learning to deal Asian poker in preparation for an "audition" at a card club.  "To be smooth, it takes hours of practice. But it's better than working."  </P> <P> And the students do practice. If they aren't dealing a game or acting as  players, they may simply sit at the edge of one of the tables and pitch the  cards into a stack on the other side, one after the other, first face down,  then face up. Over and over.  </P> <P> It is all done, Trinh said, to develop the professional dealer's most important  asset: confidence.  </P> <P> "You must be friendly with the customers," he said, "but you must always stay  one step ahead. You have to always be sure of yourself. Sometimes a player  tries to get away with something and makes you nervous. But it doesn't matter  what they say. You're always right."  </P></p>

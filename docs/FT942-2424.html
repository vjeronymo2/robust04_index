			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Countries plan Aids summit Health ministers and officials from industrialised nations pledged at the weekend to assist developing nations in their fight against the spread of Aids but fell short of a specific commitment of funds. Representatives from about 40 countries attending a two-day conference in Paris agreed, however, to take part in a summit of heads of state and government aimed at curbing the spread of Aids. The summit is scheduled for December. In a joint statement participating nations emphasised the need for a combined effort by rich and poor nations. Political leaders must ensure, they said, that 'no continent, no country, or population group is marginalised or stigmatised'. Mr Hiroshi Nakajima, director of the World Health Organisation, urged governments to make a concrete commitment to tackle the spread of Aids.</p>

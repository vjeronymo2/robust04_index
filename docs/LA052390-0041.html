			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 42ND 'TORA-SAN' EXAMINES FIRST LOVE  </P> <P> With "Tora-san, My Uncle" (at the Little Tokyo Cinemas), writer-director Yoji  Yamada makes something of a departure in No. 42 in the world's longest-running  film series.  </P> <P> Usually, Tora (Kiyoshi Atsumi), that short-tempered but kindly and lovable  itinerant peddler, plays Mary Worth to an individual or a couple he meets on  the road.  </P> <P> This time, his advice to the lovelorn is directed toward his nephew Mitsuo  (Hidetaka Yoshioka), a recent high school graduate whose all-important  preparation for Japan's stiff college entrance exam is threatened by the throes  of first love.  </P> <P> This Tora-san, like all the others, in its depiction of warm family life and  natural beauty, exudes a strong nostalgic pull for a Japan that was more  spacious, beautiful and personal than it is today.  </P> <P> Also at Little Tokyo is a revival of the near-three-hour version of Kon  Ichikawa's splendid "Tokyo Olympiad."KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

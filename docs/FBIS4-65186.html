			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rosa Paz report: "Almunia Elected Spokesman With Support </F> of Almost 70 Percent of His Group"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Joaquin Almunia was elected chairman  and spokesman of the Socialist group in parliament yesterday  with the support of over 67 percent of the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] deputies and the Guerraists' blank  votes. The secret ballot produced a result of 91 votes in  favor, 42 blank, and one against. 25 deputies were absent from  the meeting, including several members of the government and  Felipe Gonzalez himself, and the three replacements in the seats  of Carlos Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Baltasar Garzon, who  did not regularize their status as members of parliament until  yesterday afternoon. Alfonso Guerra did not attend, either.    This result, in which the Guerraists did not reach 33  percent  of the vote, is quite different from that recorded at Carlos  Solchaga's election as spokesman 10 months ago, when the former  economy minister's candidacy won 89 votes against the 66 of  Guerraist Eduardo Martin Toval. This fact means that Guerraism  has lost almost 11 percent of its support in the Socialist group  in parliament during the past year.    Afterward, Almunia played down the poll's significance and  stated that he would not have minded if voting had also taken  place at Monday's Executive Committee meeting, at which Guerra  advised seeking a candidate who would attract greater consensus.  However, government sources deemed it "especially undesirable"  to force a vote at this time of grave political crisis.  [passage omitted]</p>

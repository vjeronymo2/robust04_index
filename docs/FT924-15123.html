			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (8): A minefield of uncertainty - Simon Davies reviews the complex and challenging Asian market IT IS somewhat ironic that Asia's only pan-continental satellite broadcaster, was born and bred in Hong Kong, and nourished with the colony's capital, yet it is scarcely watched there. The reason is one of the factors that makes regional broadcasting in Asia such a minefield of uncertainty: regulation. Since Star Television, a joint venture between Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa and its controlling shareholder Mr Li Ka-shing, commenced broadcasting in 1991, its focus has slowly shifted from the main market on which it had been expected to concentrate, south-east Asia, and on to the poorer sub-continent. In many cases, this is because it has had no choice. In Malaysia, satellite broadcasting has been effectively banned; in Singapore, the only access is through programme sales to the terrestrial broadcasters; in Hong Kong, regulations on subscription and Cantonese broadcasting have restricted viewing; while in Korea, it has sparked a whole debate over cultural imperialism. In fact there are only three markets where Star's regional broadcasting can be considered to have made a substantial impact: India, Taiwan and Israel, which account for 90 per cent of the 3.03m validated homes capable of watching Star. Of these markets, Taiwan was the only expected success. The attractions of satellite broadcasting in the Asian continent are obvious. Star's five channels are transmitted by the AsiaSat 1 satellite, which has two footprints, one covering Japan and China, the other stretching from Indonesia to Turkey: they cover a population of 2.75bn, or more than half the world's people. Asia contains many of the fastest-growing economies in the world and it is a region where most viewers are subjected to minimal choice from terrestrial broadcasters. In India, for example, the government channels have long been lambasted by the world's second most populated nation. The reaction to Star has been apocalyptic and the broadcaster has already spawned more than 10,000 cable television operators, providing a validated audience of 1.3m homes. Star claims this will exceed 2m by the end of the year. The attractions of Asia have not gone unnoticed internationally. CNN has recently moved to use Indonesia's Palappa satellite and there is talk of the Australasian broadcasters launching regional services. Groups such as Time Warner and Millicom have also been attracted to the region and are discussing broadcasting plans. But most of the Asian satellites are more oriented towards telecommunications than television and none can offer the range of AsiaSat's footprint to provide regional competition. Japan already has broadcasting on the two KU-band Japan Communications Satellites, but transmission only spills over to Korea and Taiwan and separate dishes would be required to receive both JCSat and AsiaSat, since the latter broadcasts on C-band. Further C-band channels are to be launched in Thailand, while plans are being discussed in Malaysia, South Korea and Pakistan, but these will all be primarily localised broadcasting, compared with Star's BBC news service, international sport, general entertainment, MTV and Mandarin channels. Since Asia represents a very difficult market, because it offers no homogeneity of language, culture, regulations, or spending patterns, new local satellite channels should primarily complement the regional broadcasters. Star is offering a free-to-air service, relying almost exclusively on advertising revenue. Potential annual advertising revenue, assuming full utilisation at current prices, would amount to Dollars US872m. At present it is believed to be getting less than 10 per cent of that, although it has picked up substantial accounts such as Nike and Coca Cola. But while advertisers are not over the moon about the opportunities offered by Star, there is growing confidence that it represents an extremely exciting long-term medium. 'Our view is that Star is going to be a major player in the Asian broadcast scene,' argued Mr Garry Brown, media director of Leo Burnett. 'The thing that has overcome our initial scepticism is not what has happened in the last 12 months, but what will happen in the next five years,' he said. He sees it offering new channels which will provide a more focused audience, but it will also shake up the existing broadcasters and force them to improve their product. Star has been forced to take a flexible approach in expanding distribution. In Singapore it will provide some programming for cable TV, while in the Philippines, one of the television channels has started re-broadcasting Star's MTV channel. In India, it has effectively sub-leased a transponder to an outside operator which is launching a mass market Hindi channel, to capitalise on Star's successes in India. But wherever is has been launched, it is acting as a catalyst both in the quality of programming on offer, and in the regulatory environment. It has effectively forced Asian governments to focus on issues such as the intrusion of foreign language and foreign culture and to develop broadcasting policies which reflect global advances. Mr John Ure, research associate at the Hong Kong University, argued that 'even if wasn't inevitably for reasons such as the difficulty of policing and the march of technology, the demand from within these countries is going to require greater flows of information and programming'. At present Star is relying principally on cable distribution to create its audience. Given the lack of competition, it has succeeded in building up close relationships with the operators. However, as satellite broadcasting gains greater acceptance in Asia, competition is inevitable. At present, Star has exclusivity rights to AsiaSat 1, with six transponders on each footprint. It will be aided by the latest digital compression and encription technology, which will enable broadcasters to offer more than one channel per transponder and to scramble the broadcast to beat the pirates and make it a more attractive option for programme sellers. AsiaSat 2 will offer further potential for expansion. The second satellite is due to be launched in 1994. It is not known whether Star will enjoy the exclusivity rights it took for broadcasting from the first satellite. But even if another broadcaster were to use the satellite, this would further establish AsiaSat as the obvious choice for cable operators. The costs of setting up a satellite are also fairly prohibitive - Star had an initial budget of Dollars US300m - while the medium's track record in Europe is likely to substantially restrict the number of new entrants. In spite of these difficulties, Star accepts that competition is inevitable. But with more than 2bn potential viewers, there is clearly room for a number of niche operators.</p>

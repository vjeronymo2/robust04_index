			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR BRADLEY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE  </P> <P> After weeks of planning, meetings with his closest political, media and legal  advisers and countless rewrites of what was arguably the most important speech  in his 26-year political career, Mayor Tom Bradley strode into his conference  room.  </P> <P> The room had been transformed, like a Hollywood set, to resemble the chief  executive's office. Using a tissue to pat beads of sweat on his balding head  and being careful to not smudge his make-up, Bradley waited for his cue from  Press Secretary William Chandler at precisely 5:02 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Bill, Bill, give me the countdown," Bradley said.  </P> <P> With seconds to go, Chandler flashed his fingers for the final countdown.  </P> <P> Bradley then embarked on an unprecedented 40-minute speech, broadcast live  during the prime television news hour, and answered questions for another 20  minutes from reporters about City Atty. James K. Hahn's scathing 1,650-page  report on conflict-of-interest allegations.  </P> <P> To take his case "to the people," as the mayor said he wanted to do, was a  calculated risk. On one hand, the live broadcast had the advantage of allowing  Bradley an unfiltered appeal directly to the people, according to political  consultants and experts. But the tactic required that the mayor convincingly  tell his version of a complex series of transactions.  </P> <P> Every detail, from the three flags and blue velvet curtains hung behind him to  the massive desk moved into the conference room, was designed to set a tone and  send a message to what the mayor and his staff hoped would be an audience of  hundreds of thousands of Los Angelenos.  </P> <P> While some media consultants on Thursday were applauding the mayor's ability to  manipulate the media into providing him with uninterrupted prime television  news time on the three largest stations in the market, aides to the mayor  acknowledged that they really planned on getting just 10 minutes of coverage.  </P> <P> And some consultants said that extended performance may have cost him some  audience and some credibility.  </P> <P> "The speech was in two parts," said one mayoral aide who asked not to be  identified. "There was a 10-minute opening statement" and then the mayor  digressed into a somber recitation of his responses to the city attorney's  report.  </P> <P> "We figured the stations would cut out after the first 10 or 15 minutes," the  aide said.  </P> <P> But due to what television officials said was competitive pressures -- "we're  all waiting to see who blinks first," said one producer -- and a sense of good  public affairs programming, all three network affiliates in Los Angeles stayed  on with the entire address and much of the question-and-answer period.  </P> <P> "The problem is, that can cut two ways," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran speech  writer who has written for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon and  for Gov. George Deukmejian. "The live speech allows you to tell your side of  the story. But it also ties a big red ribbon around it that says, 'This is a  big deal and if you don't believe it, here's 40 minutes of television about  it.' "  </P> <P> Khachigian said the politician can appear to "protest too much when struggling  to explain the thing. . . . The common man then thinks, 'This guy stepped in a  pile of it and he is trying to get out. . . . It's like quicksand: the more you  struggle, the more you're in it." And that impression, he said, "is a major,  negative down side."  </P> <P> Still, media consultants said Bradley's strategists staged an impressive show  and managed to get exactly the context they wanted for the mayor's long-awaited  address.  </P> <P> "The idea of going live, rather than through a filter (reporters and editors)  was very, very smart," said one Los Angeles-based media consultant who did not  want to be identified.  </P> <P> And the make-believe office setting -- "the flag, the desk, the blue" -- was  intended to "look presidential, and it did," he said.  </P> <P> The desk, and absence of reporters from the screen "made it look like 'let me  sit down and talk to you man to man. . . . We don't need these other folks to  get in the way,' " the consultant said.  </P> <P> The set, and the tone -- to explain rather than apologize -- were both  conditions set by Bradley, over some staff objections, according to aides.  </P> <P> Bradley wanted to walk viewers through each of the controversial financial  transactions, while some aides argued, "don't give (the press) anything to poke  holes in," said another aide.  </P> <P> The television stations -- KNBC, KABC and KCBS -- took risks of their own.  </P> <P> The stations, in staying live with the complete address, gave up valuable  advertising time and viewership.  </P> <P> At KNBC, for instance, only 27% of viewers actually live in Los Angeles,  officials said. And many viewers were not interested in the topic or got bored  with the length of the speech, overnight ratings figures show.  </P> <P> KNBC, which normally has about 20% of the viewing market between 5 and 6 p.m.,  fell to about 13% during Bradley's address.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Glenn F. Bunting contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Bank of Japan (BOJ)  Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday [8 March] the central bank  needs to keep a close watch on rising trends in long-term  open-market interest rates.    Short-term interest rates have stayed at low levels while  long- term rates keep rising, Mieno was quoted as telling  cabinet ministers concerned with the economy.    His remarks were quoted at a press conference by Manae  Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA),  at which she announced the agency's monthly economic report.    She quoted Mieno as saying that market yields on long-term  government bonds are on the rise, reflecting diminishing  expectations of a fall in interest rates, the global uptrend in  money market rates and the deteriorating supply-demand situation  in the domestic bond market.    Long-term government bond yields are also climbing in  response to pickups in some parts of the nation's economy, Mieno  was also quoted as saying.    The latest EPA economic report described the current  economic  state as "generally sluggish although showing some brighter  signs," an improvement from "general sluggishness" in the  previous report.    Mieno was also quoted as saying plus and minus factors are  still conflicting in the Japanese economy. The BOJ will thus  keep closely monitoring the trend in interest rates in steering  the nation's monetary policy, he said.    On Japan's money supply, Mieno said the key money supply  growth gauge is staying at low levels.    Meanwhile, EPA chief Kubota, referring to the latest  economic  report, said Japan's economy is heading in "a better direction."    But she warned against excessive optimism on the outlook,  saying the EPA will cautiously watch developments.    Last summer, the EPA withdrew a statement that the economy  had bottomed out. She said, "burgeoning buds in some part of  the economy should be nurtured so that they become full blown."</p>

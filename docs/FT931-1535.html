			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Spanish socialists reel from a body blow: Finance allegations by tax inspectors embarrass the party as election looms SPAIN'S RULING socialist party was yesterday struggling to ride a political body blow, after Spanish tax inspectors confirmed reports that the party had systematically financed itself illegally in the late 1980s by selling phantom consulting services to big business. The revelations come as polls show the socialists already slipping badly ahead of a general election later this year. They are suffering the effects of a deepening recession and the knock-on effect of last weekend's Socialist defeat in France. Legal confirmation of illicit financing, after two years of vehement denials by the party leadership, has renewed opposition hopes that corruption will become a decisive issue ahead of the election. The inspectors, on secondment from the Finance Ministry to a judge investigating socialist party financing, said late on Monday that consulting companies operated by senior party officials had taken receipts of some Pta1bn (Pounds 5.75m) from some of Spain's largest banks and industrial companies between 1987 and 1990. For the past two years, newspapers have been alleging that these companies - including Banco Central, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Asea Brown Boveri's Spanish subsidiary, Catalana de Gas and the Pryca supermarket chain - paid money to two companies in return for expensive reports on their sectors of business. Hardly any of the companies have since been able to produce reports for which they paid, on occasion, more than Pta100m, some saying they have been lost. The inspectors implied that those reports which had been produced had been hastily cobbled together by the business clients. They said these clients owed about Pta437m in unpaid taxes. The 'consulting' companies involved, Filesa and Time Export, were controlled by Mr Carlos Navarro, the former treasurer of the socialist parliamentary party, and Mr Josep Maria Sala, administrative secretary of the Catalan socialist party and a member of the party's national executive. The two men, said the inspectors, excercised 'active de jure and/or de facto ownership and management' of the companies. Money taken from business 'clients' was then used to pay socialist election expenses and, to disguise that, they took receipts not from party suppliers but from companies run by Ms Aida Alvarez, the socialist party's national financial co-ordinator until 1986. The socialist party said yesterday that it would not try to protect the parliamentary immunity of anyone implicated in the scandal, but it is not clear whether the investigating judge, Mr Marino Barbero, will now begin trial proceedings. If he does so before an election, the political cost to the socialists could be huge. The Filesa report is embarrassing for Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who has sharply criticised Judge Barbero for making searches of party headquarters in Madrid, implying that the probe is politically motivated. The report marks probably the lowest point socialist fortunes have reached since the last election in 1989. Mr Gonzalez is likely to try to regain some political ground in a state of the nation address next month in which he is widely expected to announce an anti-corruption drive. With polls now showing the socialists level-pegging with the conservative opposition, the Partido Popular, it is far from certain, though, that he has not already lost too much momentum.</p>

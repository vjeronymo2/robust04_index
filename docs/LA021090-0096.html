			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSED FREE THROWS IN FINAL SECONDS COST LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> It was only fitting that Los Alamitos center Robert Conlisk stood at the  free-throw line with five seconds remaining and his team trailing Esperanza by  one point Friday night.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-10 senior already had done everything and then some, scoring 28  points and playing dominating defense, to give the sixth-ranked Griffins a  chance to win the regular-season finale for both teams.  </P> <P> But, with some fans stomping on the bleachers and others yelling in  anticipation in the Esperanza gym, Conlisk missed the first of two shots. He  then missed again, allowing Esperanza to win, 68-67, and denying his team an  undefeated Empire League record.  </P> <P> "I tried to be calm," said Conlisk, a 60% free-throw shooter. "Some guys go up  there shaking and you know they're going to miss. I just missed them. It's my  fault. I'll take responsibility."  </P> <P> Los Alamitos (19-6 overall, 9-1 in league play) and Esperanza (8-2, 16-10) will  continue into the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs next week, but  Esperanza will carry the momentum.  </P> <P> "We knew they were beatable," Esperanza forward Joe Foss said. "We didn't want  them to go through undefeated, and we wanted to get some momentum for  ourselves."  </P> <P> Conlisk's misses made a hero of Esperanza's Brett Evans, who converted two free  throws with 16 seconds left to give the Aztecs the 68-67 lead. Just 10 seconds  earlier, Los Alamitos guard Jason Cunningham had put his team ahead, 67-66,  with two free throws.  </P> <P> Esperanza coach Mark Hill said his team's late strategy worked perfectly. "He  (Conlisk) is unstoppable in the post," said Hill. "We told the guys to just  foul him when he got the ball inside. He has trouble at the line."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> El Dorado 68, Loara 66 -- Forward Jerome Facione hit a 10-foot jumpshot with  one second remaining to give host El Dorado the victory over Loara (15-7, 4-6)  and a spot in the playoffs. He finished with 16 points in the game. Guard Mike  Brabach led El Dorado (14-10, 5-5) in scoring with 27 points. Loara guard Tes  Whitlock led all scorers with 31 points.  </P> <P> Cypress 77, Katella 60 -- Forward Kevin Smith had a triple-double with 10  points, 12 assists and 12 rebounds to pace host Cypress (9-15, 2-8) Friday.  Forward Courtney Smith added 17 and guard Jared Rice scored 16 for Cypress.  Katella dropped to 6-17 overall and 2-8 in league.  </P></p>

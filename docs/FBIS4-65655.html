			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/47: "Press Statement by The </F> Presidency on Behalf of the European Union on The Signing of the  Latvian-Russian Agreements on The Withdrawal of Russian Troops  From Latvia"]    [Text] The European Union welcomes the signing of the  Latvian-Russian agreements which guarantee the complete  withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia no later than 31 August  1994 and which stipulate that the Skrunda radar is not a  military base but an installation under civilian authority.    The Union wishes to emphasise that these agreements do not  limit Latvia's sovereignty and will not delay the development of  closer ties between Latvia and the European institutions, for  which the Union has often demonstrated its support.    The signing of these agreements represents an important  event  in the history of independent Latvia and removes a major  obstacle in the development of bilateral relations with Russia,  based on good neighbourly relations and mutual respect.  Followed by early ratification on both sides, the signature  will form a tangible contribution to overall stability in the  Baltic region and thus form part of the perspective created by  the European Union initiative on a stability pact in Europe.</p>

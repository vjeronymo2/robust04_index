			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUCHO IS SECRET WORD FOR ACTOR FERRANTE  </P> <P> Frank Ferrante has a thing for Groucho Marx.  </P> <P> "I was almost weaned on tapes and records of him," said the 26-year-old actor.  "I knew his inflections, I knew his rhythms. I read everything I could on him.  And I think my love for the subject comes through."  </P> <P> Ferrante's tribute -- and impersonation -- is at the core of "Groucho: A Life  in Revue," a musical bio/character study written by Arthur Marx (Groucho's son)  and Robert Fisher. Under Marx's direction, it opens Sunday at the Pasadena  Playhouse.  </P> <P> It all began in 1984, when Ferrante decided to mount a one-man Groucho show in  a church hall in his hometown of Pasadena. It went so well that, the next year,  he replicated it for his senior project at USC.  </P> <P> "I figured I might as well capitalize on it -- combine my drama degree and my  interest in the Marx Brothers," he reasoned. This time, however, he invited  Groucho's offspring, Arthur and Miriam. And they loved it. But mostly, they  loved him.  </P> <P> "Arthur said, 'If I ever do a show about the Marx Brothers, I'd like to use  you,' " Ferrante recalled. The year after he graduated, they began workshopping  the show. In the resulting version (completely different from Ferrante's  original piece), the actor plays Groucho at four stages in his life: as a  15-year-old innocent; a the-other-morning-I-shot-an-elephant-in-my-pajamas  comedy and film star; the older "You Bet Your Life" Groucho, and the  85-year-old cynic.  </P> <P> A Kansas City production came first, followed by an 11-month New York run  (culminating in a 1987 Theatre World Award) -- and last year, a London  engagement.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of humanity in the show," Ferrante said. "It's more than a  couple of guys doing the Marx Brothers. There are 10 songs, a plot, a story.  It's about his relationship with his brothers, his wives. Les Marsden plays  Chico -- and he also plays the harp as Harpo. Anastasia Barzee plays 13  different roles: chorus girls, wives, reporters, a USO girl. . . ."  </P> <P> Ferrante is convinced the fascination with Groucho is ever-strong.  </P> <P> "Look at his movies -- they've never left the public scene," he said. "You  still see his TV reruns. At this show, we get audiences from 7 to 90. Little  kids come up saying, 'I love Harpo.' I can't tell you how many letters I got  from people in Europe when I was in London. There are Marx Brothers fans  everywhere. I really think he touched a nerve: He was the funniest man America  ever produced."  </P> <P> Ferrante traces his own Groucho attraction to early childhood.  </P> <P> "When I was 10, I was watching 'A Day at the Races,' " he said. "It really  appealed to me visually; they were so undisciplined and irreverent."  </P> <P> Besides dressing up as Groucho on Halloween, Ferrante fostered a Groucho  memorabilia collection that included posters, books, records, films and a  scrapbook of clippings.  </P> <P> "Then two years ago, Arthur took me to a Bekins warehouse and there (were) 85  years of Groucho's life: awards and scripts, photographs, wigs, props. He gave  me the glasses Groucho wore, a cigar box, some hats. . . ."  </P> <P> He also cherishes the memory of a 1976 meeting with Groucho (a year before the  comedian's death), when Marx held a book-signing session at the Ambassador  Hotel.  </P> <P> "(Groucho) shuffled up to the podium, his eyes were glassy, he was slurring his  words," Ferrante said, wincing. "I thought, 'My God, my hero from "Duck Soup"  -- and he's ancient. How could this happen?' " Yet within minutes, the  familiar, wisecracking Groucho bubbled to the surface.  </P> <P> "He was able to muster up those reserves of energy and perform. Then he just  shuffled off. It's that memory of him that I think of when I'm playing him  old."  </P> <P> Despite his obvious affection for his subject, Ferrante thinks the show is more  than a glossy tribute.  </P> <P> "It's not a 'Mommie Dearest,' " he said. "But it's not a whitewash of his life,  either. It's honest. See, I know all of his flaws. There were obviously severe  problems with women -- he had three divorces -- stemming from his relationship  with his mother.  </P> <P> "He was very eccentric with his money, probably because he'd lost $250,000 in  1929. And he wasn't always apt to give love freely. But he was an extremely  loyal friend, a hard worker. His kids say he was a great father when they were  young. But he had a very insecure streak."  </P> <P> The actor denies any insecurities about work that requires submerging his own  identity to Groucho's.  </P> <P> "I know he's the focus," Ferrante said. "That's OK. If audiences go away with a  respect for the work, that's what's important. I don't sit around saying,  'Gosh, I wish I were like Groucho.' That's never been a problem. I like myself  too much to give myself over to that.  </P> <P> "But this is the perfect time to do this; I'm at an age where it's good, not  destructive. And when I get home, I don't do Groucho. I almost make a point of  avoiding the wisecracks. I don't care about being 'on.' It doesn't matter to  me."  </P> <P> He's convinced that there'll be life after Groucho.  </P> <P> "If this production goes well, I'd like to do it in Boston, San Francisco,  Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington -- and then move on to the next job,"  Ferrante said. "Oh, I wouldn't mind doing the film version, because his story's  never been told."  </P> <P> There are no regrets for the detour: "When I graduated from USC, I was about to  enter UCLA's theater production program -- and this show came up. I figured it  was too good an opportunity to miss. And I was absolutely right."  </P></p>

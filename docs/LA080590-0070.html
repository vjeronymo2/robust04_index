ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> As far as the rest of the country is concerned Orange County is nothing, nil,  zero, zilch.  </P> <P> Plain and simple it does not exist. This country revolves around two cities:  New York and L.A. Sorry, but that's the way it is.  </P> <P> If one can put up with a sea of provincial mental midgets, Orange County is a  pleasant place to live.  </P> <P> ROBERT HUNT  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

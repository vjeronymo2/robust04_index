The VOC content of the last pesticide needed to achieve 40%&hyph;70% of the total base-year VOC emissions becomes the ``VOC limit.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed further in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the range of 40% to 70% reflects the target range of 20%&hyph;45% reductions in emissions from pesticide application. This range was selected for consistency with the VOC cap rules proposed as 40 CFR 52.2952 through 52.2954. Based on planned modeling and inventory analysis and comments received during the comment period, EPA hopes to select a specific reduction target from within this range for use in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (vi) EPA will promulgate the VOC limit with a summary of the assumptions and results from paragraphs (c)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Restrictions on pesticides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) On and after 1 (one) year after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from distribution within the affected area of pesticides with VOC contents in excess of the VOC limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) On and after 2 (two) years after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from application and/or storage within the affected area of pesticides with VOC contents in excess of the VOC limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Revisions to the VOC limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) EPA may, at any time, require producer(s) to reanalyze their pesticides according to the methodology described in paragraph (f) of this section and to submit the new data according to paragraph (d) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) EPA may, at any time, revise the VOC limit consistent with the methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and based on information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or elsewhere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Producers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reports submitted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(4)(i) of this section must include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Name, address, name of contact person, and telephone number of producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Name and description of pesticide product, including a copy of the pesticide product label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Name, address and telephone number of the laboratory performing analysis; name of analyst; and date and time of analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) All raw data collected during analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. If, for example, TGA analysis is performed as described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, all thermograms produced must be submitted, as well as justification for rejecting any unacceptable thermogram.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Summary and results of analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. If, for example, TGA analysis is performed, the summary of analysis shall include uncorrected weight percent VOC content (i.e., kg VOC per kg pesticide), weight percent water content, weight percent exempt solvents content, and weight percent VOC content corrected for water and exempt solvents, as applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Certification signed and dated by a responsible official of the producer stating the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Refitted Bond flagship nears relaunch - Kevin Brown examines the new-look, slimmed-down, renamed Southern Equities Bond Corporation Holdings, Mr Alan Bond's quoted flagship, is likely to be relaunched later this year following approval from the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) for a change of name to Southern Equities. The company's impending re-emergence contrasts starkly with the fate of Mr Bond, the best known of Australia's 1980s entrepreneurs, who was declared bankrupt last month after losing a year-long court battle. Mr Peter Lucas, chairman of Bond Corp from September 1990 until last month, says Southern Equities will bear little resemblance to Mr Bond's company. 'We have sold many of the assets to repay debts, and the group is obviously much smaller than it was, but the really important thing is that despite all the things that happened, we are still here,' he says. 'Sure, it is with the good grace of our creditors, but nevertheless we were able to convince them that this was the best way forward. That is very different to what happened to some of the other entrepreneurial groups.' Mr Lucas, a Sydney lawyer, resigned last month after steering the group through the traumatic 18 months since Mr Bond quit under pressure from shareholders and creditors. Mr Lucas's resignation clears the way for a new management team to take over after the completion of a financial reconstruction which will transfer 90 per cent of the company's equity to creditors and bondholders. The distribution of shares is expected to take place as soon as the administrators of the company's scheme of arrangement finish investigating claims from creditors, probably by the end of June. The principal shareholder is expected to be Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil), formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources, which will emerge with 11 per cent of the expanded equity. Mr Bond's shareholding will fall from 52 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Shortly after the redistribution, the company will be renamed and its ADollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.43bn) debt burden will be written off in return for a payment of ADollars 190m to creditors - an effective payout of 10 cents in the dollar. Mr Lucas, who remains a consultant to Bond Corp and a member of the management committee which has run the company for the last year, says completion of the reconstruction will be the trigger for a fresh start, following the disposal of much of the group's former ADollars 10bn in assets. The disposals included Bond Media, the group's television and radio arm which was sold to Mr Kerry Packer, and Bond Brewing, once Australia's biggest brewer, which is now controlled by Lion Nathan of New Zealand. The value of the group's remaining assets will remain unclear until the 1991/92 accounts are published, probably in the second half of the year. But its main assets are: A 1.5 per cent shareholding in BSkyB, the UK satellite television business, and convertible loan stock worth Pounds 350m (USDollars 619m). The shareholding is mortgaged, but Bond Corp says it hopes for some return as BSkyB moves into profit. A 5.3 per cent stake in G. Heileman, the US brewery once owned by Bond Corp, which was placed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable to service its debts. About ADollars 25m in cash, mostly held by Bond Corp subsidiaries, which the group is unable to access until the redistribution of shares has taken place. Land in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, some of which could be sub-divided for property development. The group also retains small investments in a handful of public companies. Potential tax losses of several hundred millions of dollars as a result of its ADollars 2.2bn loss in 1990, although it is unclear how the losses will be treated by the taxation office. A ADollars 500m claim for damages against the Western Australian government and two local politicians over a failed attempt to establish a petrochemical industry in the state. Mr Lucas says Bond Corp remains interested in the petrochemical project, which collapsed in September 1989 when the state government withdrew its support following local criticism of the deal. Bond Corp, which paid ADollars 400m to buy Petrochemical Industries (Picl) from the Western Australian entrepreneurs Mr Laurie Connell and Mr Dallas Dempster, claims the government acted in bad faith. However, Mr Lucas says the group believes the project remains viable, and wants to help the state tap the strong demand expected to develop in Asia for the caustic soda, ethylene di-chloride and PVC the plant would produce. 'I believe Australia has got a window of opportunity in the next five years to get this thing up and away. Sooner or later, industrial expansion in China, Korea and Indonesia will create a huge demand for these products,' Mr Lucas says. 'Whether Bond Corporation Holdings could be involved would depend on the Western Australian government and the other joint venture partners. But our discussions with potential investors indicate it could be viable.' Mr Lucas says Bond Corp has substantial expertise which could be made available to the Western Australian government, together with 'the capacity to influence the potential participants'. The state government is also believed to be considering a revival of the project, but is unlikely to want Bond Corp to play any part unless an out-of-court settlement of the damages claim can be reached. Both sides deny suggestions a settlement is being prepared. Mr Lucas says Bond Corp is 'open to compromise, but will not retire without proper compensation'.</p>

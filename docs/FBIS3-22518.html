They stated that  at least 18 cases have been confirmed in Barranca and that there  are another 500 cases where dengue fever is suspected (400 in  Puntarenas and 100 in Liberia, Province of Guanacaste).    This announcement by the Costa Rican Institute for Research  and Education in Nutrition and Health (INCIENSA) led authorities  in the Ministry of Health to reconfirm the emergency which was  declared on 27 September, when it was reported for the first  time that there was a possibility that the disease -- which was  supposedly eradicated 50 years ago -- was reappearing.    Although the first samples [of suspected material] have been  sent to the Reference Center of Honduras, a diagnosis has not  been made, because of the medical strike called in that country  at least two weeks ago.    Due to the epidemic, the first action taken was to establish  health quarantines in Puntarenas, Liberia, and Valle Central,  according to Emilia Leon, acting minister of health.    In the port of Pacifico the disease spread rapidly. The  first  case was identified on 14 October in Barranca. From there it  spread to Esparza -- where there are at least two persons ill  with the disease -- and to other places in the province.    Ana Gabriela Ross, director of the South Central Region of  the Ministry of Health, stated that mosquitoes have been  detected in the Cantons of Desamparados, Goicoechea, Alajuelita,  Coronado, Tibas, Moravia, and Montes de Oca, as well as in the  Districts of Hatillo and San Sebastian.    She added: "In June several suspected cases were reported in  Barrio Mexico, Ciudad Colon, and Tibas." Ross did not specify  the number of persons affected, but she said that they showed  symptoms of dengue fever: headaches and pains in the joints of  the body, skin rashes, general discomfort, and feelings of  tiredness around the eyes.    Health authorities stated: "Mosquitoes transmitting dengue  and yellow fever are found throughout the country." They  confirmed that they are taking emergency action to prevent the  outbreak from spreading to a larger number of people.    Unofficial calculations indicate that if the pace at which  the disease has spread continues as it has up to the present, it  could affect between 250,000 and 500,000 people.    The government has allocated 30 million Costa Rican colones  for the purchase of insecticides to fumigate the areas of  greatest danger and especially those homes where symptoms of the  disease have been detected.    Panama will loan to Costa Rica two machines equipped to  fumigate the streets with "Malathion," a powerful agrochemical  which is soluble in water and which is lethal for the "Aedes  Aegyptis" mosquito [which transmits the disease].    According to Acting Minister of Health Leon, the 200  containers of "Malathion" in storage in the warehouses and the  eight fumigators on hand (including the two machines which  Panama is providing) are enough for a considerable period of  time. Five of the fumigators will be sent to Puntarenas, and the  remaining three, to Guanacaste.    For his part Jose Luis Garces, director of the Malaria  Department of the Ministry of Health, said that 14 technicians  experienced in primary care have been sent from Limon to  Puntarenas.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 24 Jan (TANJUG) -- The new dinar has  not yet arrived in Montenegro, Todor Cicmil, director of the  Treasury Department of the Montenegrin National Bank, told a  TANJUG reporter this morning. According to him, the first  delivery of the "super" dinar is expected during the day, in  sufficient quantities for the pensions of about 70,000  Montenegrin pensioners. [passage omitted]    Mirko Paroski, the manager of the central post office in  Novi  Sad, has said that postmen could not distribute pensions to more  than 15,000 pensioners today because the Financial Transaction  Service has not yet sent out the new dinars. The service should  have sent out 585,000 new dinars today and tomorrow.  Consequently, Paroski says, the post office will only start  delivering pensions tomorrow. [passage omitted]    The new dinars have not yet appeared in the busiest post  office in Belgrade either, and the payment of pensions has been  postponed until further notice, a TANJUG reporter was told today  by Milan Radulovic, the manager of the Belgrade-3 post office.  According to him, transactions in old dinars function as  normal. [passage omitted]    The initial implementation of the federal government's new  measures failed to meet the expectations in eastern Serbia too.  This is the inevitable conclusion resulting from reports from  commercial banks in Zajecar, Bor, Pozarevac, and Smederevo,  which stress that this morning they could not pay part of  January pensions due to a shortage of cash.

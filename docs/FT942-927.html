			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Personal View: Design for an environmental agency The recent row surrounding Ofgas, the UK gas industry regulator, over funding for The Energy Saving Trust has highlighted a central tension at the heart of the government's environmental policy. Having boldly committed the Conservative government to addressing the environmental agenda in 1988, Mrs Thatcher's government failed to resolve the problem of who should pay the bill. Ofgas's director general, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, rightly pointed out to the environment select committee that it was not her job to raise taxation from gas consumers to pay for energy efficiency measures: tax, and therefore environmental policy, was the government's job, she said. Such problems are not confined to gas. Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, sees his job as being to curb the price escalator in water bills. In a politically brilliant campaign, he has out-smarted the water quality regulators, particularly the National Rivers Authority, and manipulated public opinion through his emphasis on the costs (but not the benefits) of the water industry's environmental spending. These examples illustrate a core problem: the institutional separation of environmental and economic regulation has left the balance heavily biased against the former. For the utilities - which are at the centre of environmental pollution - the costs of environmental clean-ups conflict with the objective of holding down consumers' bills. Fortunately, the government has a good opportunity to sort out the current muddle. One commitment made as a result of Mrs Thatcher's initiative, included in the 1990 White Paper, This Common Inheritance, is the creation of a single environmental agency, to bring together the various strands of environmental policy under a single umbrella to promote integrated pollution control. That commitment is finally coming to fruition: the deregulation bill currently going through parliament paves the way, ahead of primary legislation. However good the idea in theory, its practical effect will depend upon its design and the purposes to which it is put. Initial steps have been dogged by Whitehall infighting, and a battle over jobs and functions between the pollution regulators and bodies with pollution responsibilities. The real issue, however, is not about the precise institutional jigsaw. It is about the new agency's rationale: what is it for? To the traditional environmental regulators, the environment agency is effectively a 'gathered fields' exercise, creating an umbrella under which technical regulation by experts will be co-ordinated. It is an institutional tidying-up exercise. To critics, however, the agency provides the opportunity for thorough-going reforms of environmental policy. Their agenda includes separation of regulation from productive activities, and adoption of a more economic approach to setting targets and the use of market instruments. They see the break-up of the NRA through separation of flood-defence from water quality regulation, integration of cost-benefit analysis into the current techniques-driven rules, and introduction of pollution charges and permits. The arguments for an environment agency based upon sound economic principles go beyond institutional purity. They offer real hope for resolving many current impasses. First, the introduction of cost-benefit analysis would tackle head-on issues raised by Ms Spottiswoode and Mr Byatt. Cost-benefit analysis would help identify whether, for example, energy efficiency schemes were economic in the wider sense, once pollution had been properly incorporated, rather than on merely private calculations. Broad attacks on environmental concerns by regulators would no longer be so crudely effective. Second, environmental charges would raise revenue. While purists argue about primacy of the Treasury, recent experience indicates that government funding for environmental clean-ups is unlikely to be forthcoming. To tackle pollution, a degree of hypothecation is essential. Charges are the mechanism. An environmental agency, soundly based, with a clear answer to those who focus only on the costs and with a system of pollution charges to support it, is within the government's grasp. But if traditionalists stick to their conventional tools, if the Treasury stands in the way of pollution charges on grounds of its unique responsibilities, and if utility regulators are allowed pre-eminence of costs over benefits, then the new agency may prove not only a missed opportunity, but an expensive exercise in rearranging the institutional jigsaw.

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW LEAR  </P> <P> As it pertains to your article on Norman Lear, he is not a "political maven,"  which in Yiddish or Hebrew means an expert. Lear is a political maverick, a  nonconformist.  </P> <P> As to the merits of what Lear "begat," if it gave him 10 acres and a  12,300-square-foot home, even without the mule, it is an unequivocal proof of  his success.  </P> <P> However, in his quest, at 68, for the meaning of life, he won't find the  answer, nor happiness, in a palatial dwelling. Marie Antoinette tried it in  Versailles, and you know how that story ended. For the holidays I wish Lear  wisdom; that is the most valuable, but also the most elusive, of life's gifts.  At the end if we take enough of it with us we are guaranteed a long and  pleasant sleep, and wonderful dreams.  </P> <P> PHIL M. ISLAS  </P> <P> Paso Robles  </P></p>

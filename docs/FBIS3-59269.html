			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Regulations Promulgated by the PRC MOFTEC (Ministry of </F> Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation) Customs Office:  "Regulations To Control Small-Scale Trade With the Taiwan  Region"]    [Text] Article 1 These regulations have been  specially drawn up to facilitate commodity exchange between  mainland coastal provinces and cities and the Taiwan region, by  guiding small-scale private trade across the Taiwan Strait to  normal growth.    Article 2 Small-scale trade with the Taiwan Region  (abbreviated hereafter as small-scale trade with Taiwan) refers  to commodity trade carried out according to the pertinent  provisions between residents of the Taiwan Region and designated  mainland coastal ports (in Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu,  Shandong, and Shanghai).    Article 3 Small-scale trade with Taiwan may be  conducted only between residents of the Taiwan Region and  mainland companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan.    Taiwanese residents refer to those who hold the pertinent  status identification, such as valid and complete Taiwanese  fishing licenses and ID cards.    Article 4 Companies engaged in small-scale trade  with Taiwan should be approved by responsible foreign trade  organs in coastal provinces and cities authorized by the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (abbreviated  hereafter as MOFTEC), as well as being registered with the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce.    Companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan are  permitted to conduct only small-scale trade with the Taiwan  Region, not ordinary import-export business.    Article 5 The import-export quota for small-scale  trade with Taiwan is $100,000 per ship per trip.    Article 6 The commodities involved in small-scale  trade with Taiwan are limited to those not subject to state  franchise, prohibition or import-export restrictions, and  those not under import-export quota licensing control.    As to the few commodities under quota licensing control that  must be exported, companies engaged in small-scale trade with  Taiwan should submit them to the higher-level MOFTEC organ for  examination and approval formalities according to the pertinent  regulations on ordinary trade and trade with Taiwan and, after  approval and consent, apply for and receive export licenses and  customs-document releases.    Article 7 Imports involved in small-scale trade  with Taiwan are restricted to commodities whose place of origin  is Taiwan. Customs should when necessary check and approve  product-origin certificates for imported commodities.    Article 8 Small-scale trade with Taiwan may be  carried out only on Taiwanese ships under 100 tons (including  100-ton ships). Taiwanese ships refer to carriers officially  registered in the Taiwan region that can carry out normal  operations and navigation at sea.    Commodities carried on ships engaged in small-scale trade  with Taiwan that are not sold should be returned on the original  ship.    Article 9 Small-scale trade with Taiwan may be  carried out only in the designated ports.    The ports for small-scale trade with Taiwan will be  designated by responsible foreign trade agencies in coastal  provinces and cities authorized by MOFTEC, such as local public  security, border inspection, customs, communications, and Taiwan  affairs.    The authorized responsible foreign trade organs in coastal  provinces and cities should promptly report to MOFTEC for the  record their locally designated companies and ports involved in  small-scale trade with Taiwan, as well as notifying the Customs  Office and State Council Taiwan Affairs Office. Unless MOFTEC  objects within 30 days of receiving all data on companies and  ports involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan, the reported  cases will automatically go into effect.    Article 10 Small-scale trade with Taiwan should be  conducted mainly in the form of barter, with the prices of all  bartered commodities being calculated in U.S. dollars.    Small-scale trade with Taiwan conducted in cash should be  settled with foreign currency converted with the approval of the  state. All cash earned by both sides should be handled  according to the pertinent state foreign-exchange control  provisions.    All export-earnings foreign exchange will be retained by  companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan.    Article 11 All import-export commodities, ships,  and sailors involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan must  accept supervision and control by local customs, border  inspections, and other joint port-inspection departments, as  well as paying taxes and fees per regulation.    No commodities or ships involved in small-scale trade with  Taiwan may display symbols that violate the "one China" (the  PRC) principle, such as words, flags, insignias, or names.    The articles for personal use carried by individual sailors  should be limited to reasonable amounts for personal use.  Sailors may not carry articles which under provisions are  prohibited entry or exit, and individuals may not use ships to  carry articles for others. Equipment, fuel, and materials  necessary for navigation by ships that are brought in should be  taken out on the original ship. Such articles may not be  involved in commodity exchange.    Commodities not declared to customs or given inspection  releases may not be loaded or unloaded.    Article 12 Except as the state provides otherwise,  import-export commodities involved in small-scale trade with  Taiwan are subject to preferential customs tariffs in line with  the "PRC Customs Import-Export Tariffs" and taxation according  to the "PRC Product-Tax Regulations" and "PRC Value-Added Tax  Regulations," as well as being subject to control by the  pertinent customs tax provisions.    Article 13 When companies engaged in small-scale  trade with Taiwan violate these regulations, the original organs  that examined and approved them can penalize them based on the  seriousness of the case by warnings, severe warnings, and  revocations of their operating authority. Penalties involving  revocations of operating authority should be reported promptly  for the record to MOFTEC and the Customs Office.    As to companies and ports involved in small-scale trade with  Taiwan that are not qualified for such trade, MOFTEC is  authorized to revoke their operating authority.    Violations of customs provisions will be investigated and  prosecuted by customs according to the "PRC Customs Law" and  pertinent laws and regulations. And such violations that  constitute crimes will be turned over to judicial organs for  investigation and fixing of criminal liability.    Article 14 The responsible foreign trade organs in  provinces and cities engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan  should, prior to the end of January each year, sum up and report  to MOFTEC their previous year's small-scale trade with Taiwan.    Article 15 These regulations are subject to MOFTEC  and Customs Office interpretation, oversight, and enforcement.    Article 16 These regulations take effect the day  on which they are promulgated. Where there are inconsistencies  between these regulations and pertinent ones written previously,  these regulations will be the standard.</p>

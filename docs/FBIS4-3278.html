			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kuo Yu-lan (6753 3768 5695) in Hong Kong: "U.S. </F> Consulate Statement Regrets Action That Stifles and Threatens  Press Freedom"]    [Excerpts] The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong issued a  statement yesterday, commenting on Xi Yang for the first time.  The statement said that Xi merely used customary and reasonable  professional means to gather news, but the sentence given to him  was far out of proportion to the acts he allegedly committed.  [passage omitted]    In response to the U.S. Consulate statement, Cheng Yiu-tong,  a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC], said that each  country has its own judicial system, which brooks no "indiscreet  remarks" from other countries. Similarly, if Beijing had made  similar remarks about the U.S. judicial system, it would  probably lead to "great disorder under heaven."    Cheng said that the statement would complicate the matter  rather than help Xi Yang, because Beijing may further tighten  its policies in this regard. Moreover, the United States has  politicized the issue. He asked: The United States also has a  record of arresting Soviet spies -- why haven't they made this  public? [passage omitted]</p>

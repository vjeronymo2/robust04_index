			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Labour 'finds Pounds 1bn' from Grid sale to plug finances Labour last night claimed that today's mini-budget is unnecessary after it emerged that the government has made no specific allowance for up to Pounds 1bn in tax receipts due from the planned flotation of the National Grid. Labour believes that the disclosure will embarrass Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who will announce a tax and spending package to plug the hole in the Budget caused by Tuesday's Commons defeat on value added tax. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'Instead of penalising middle and lower income Britain, these figures show that the government is able to raise the resources it needs by tackling the excesses its own polices have created.' Labour's claims were queried by the Treasury, which said that the regional electricity companies had not yet finalised proposals for the flotation of the Grid. It added: 'We do not know the tax consequences.' However, City estimates suggest that the government will receive between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn in capital gains tax on the Pounds 4bn flotation of the grid. The regional companies are planning to float the grid in May or June. The tax bill arises because the companies were given the grid when they were floated four years ago. At that time it was valued in the the companies' balance sheets at just over Pounds 1bn. The Treasury said capital gains tax receipts from flotations would normally be included in corporation tax estimates in the red book, the Budget statement published last week for public finances next year. The red book shows that estimates for corporation tax will rise from Pounds 20.1bn this year to Pounds 26.4bn next year. It says that the rise reflects increasing company profitability but makes no reference to the grid sale. The disclosure will give a further boost to the morale of Labour backbenchers, many of whom have waited 15 years for a victory over the government on an important issue. Much of the credit will go to Mr Brown, who masterminded the parliamentary manoeuvring involved, and campaigned against the VAT changes in the constituencies of potential Tory rebels. Officials said that Mr Brown and his shadow treasury colleagues wrote more than 900 letters to local newspapers in target constituencies in the last week in a deliberate attempt to increase the pressure on the rebels. The whips' office, recently reinvigorated by an infusion of young MPs, also achieved a maximum turnout of Labour members. However, aides of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, were warning strongly against complacency, urging MPs to remember that Labour lost the 1992 election after expecting an easy victory. Party strategists are keenly aware that there will be few opportunities in the coming session to foment a further Tory revolt on this week's scale, increasing the pressure on Labour to put more flesh on its own policies. Nevertheless, Labour MPs showed little sign of easing the celebrations. Mrs Margaret Hodge (Barking) said: 'Some of us are going round smiling like Cheshire cats.' Older hands were less optimistic, greeting the vote as a morale booster, but urging colleagues not to raise their hopes of a rapid government collapse. Mr David Winnick (Wallsall North) said: 'We are under no illusions. We recognise that as long as they maintain a majority in the Commons they can drag on somehow until 1997.'</p>

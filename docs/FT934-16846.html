			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Mexican pact boosts wages MEXICO'S government, unions and private sector signed yesterday a new social pact whereby the budget surplus would be eliminated and wages increased before the presidential election next August. The pact is to raise the minimum wage by at least 15 per cent, eliminate a formal ceiling on contractual wages, and give farmers the equivalent of about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) in cash. The prices of industrial fuels and rail travel, and airport charges, are to be slashed. Corporation tax is to be cut from 35 to 34 per cent. The government plans to achieve all this next year with a balanced budget and an inflation rate of 5 per cent. Exchange rate policy will be unchanged, with the daily maximum devaluation against the US dollar kept at 0.04 pesos (about 5 per cent a year). A government official said the measures would help lift economic growth to about 3.5 per cent next year, from a consensus forecast of less than 2 per cent this year. He said the government would use the budget surplus this year - now expected at 1.1 per cent of GDP - to retire domestic debt. The government will also scrap price supports for basic grains such as maize and introduce direct cash subsidies according to the amount - and the fertility - of land a farmer owns.</p>

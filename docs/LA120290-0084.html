			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE POLITICAL THEATRICS OF THATCHER'S JAZZY LONDON;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: BRITAIN WAS FAR DIFFERENT WHEN THATCHER TOOK OFFICE IN 1979, THE  CURRENT FLASH AND DAZZLE OF LONDON TYPIFY HOW SHE REVVED UP THE SOCIETY.  </P> <P> It is, as Margaret Thatcher said ruefully the day she decided to resign as  Britain's prime minister, a funny old world. Less than a week later, there she  was, looking pleased as punch, all smiles, saying she was "thrilled" with the  result of the election for leader of Britain's Conservative Party -- who  automatically became Britain's new prime minister.  </P> <P> Well she might be. Thatcher watchers have known since 1987 that John Major, who  now moves into 10 Downing St., has long been her anointed heir. When all is  said and done, the last few remarkable weeks in Britain add up to this:  Thatcher has handed over the baton of leadership to exactly the person she  always wanted to succeed her, but has done so a couple of years earlier than  she would have wished. There are worse ways to go.  </P> <P> Why was she so keen on Major? Principally, because he comes from a similar  background to hers: the respectable lower-middle class, though in his case not  from the provinces but from London -- in Britain, an important distinction. He  is a self-made man of the kind she likes best: He left school at 16, and worked  on construction sites before he became a clerk in the City of London. He has  the same kind of commitment to market economics she has, and the same kind of  belief that hard work and determination never hurt anybody. He is friendly and  approachable: The British would say there is no "side" to him.  </P> <P> Beyond that, he is a bit of an enigma. He is said to have a fine political  nose, but I can exclusively reveal to readers of The Times that last year I won  10 off him by betting that two Cabinet ministers would not survive a government  reshuffle. He was adamant they would. They didn't.  </P> <P> Major is thought to be less opposed to European integration than Thatcher was,  but if he is, he is keeping his true feelings to himself. Just last week, he  dismissed a single European currency as an economic folly -- not what they  think in Brussels at all. When foreign secretary for three months, in 1989, he  looked -- to the uncharitable -- out of his depth, and -- to the kindly -- a  man still mastering his brief. Those close to him say that he is a man of  deeply felt convictions; but they have not been made obvious to the rest of us.  </P> <P> Not that much of this mattered last week. The real story of Major's elevation  to the premiership is what it says about modern Britain, and how it has emerged  from its most amazing decade of the century. Consider the performance of  Douglas Hurd, one of the two defeated candidates. An excellent foreign  secretary, a man with a fine record in government, intelligent and cultured, he  spent the campaign trying to live down that he had gone to Eton and Trinity  College, Cambridge. This, remember, was an election for the leader of the  Conservative Party; repeat, the Conservative Party.  </P> <P> Neither Hurd nor Michael Heseltine, the other contender, could match Major's  "classlessness." (He went to a local high school, hated it and never attended  university.) Hugo Young, Thatcher's biographer, put his finger on the pulse, as  usual, when he said the election's central question was: "Who would you rather  drink a pint with?" When conviviality in a bar counts for more in high British  politics than attendance at Eton, you know something wonderful has happened.  </P> <P> This was Thatcher's doing. Though a bundle of contradictions -- she married a  wealthy man and awarded hereditary peerages -- she is, at heart, a meritocrat.  She had spent years being patronized for her sex; in her last interview as  prime minister she said, "If a woman is strong, she is strident. If a man is  strong, gosh, he's a good guy."  </P> <P> Those memories meant that she could not endorse any form of preferment -- such  as birth, or schooling -- that did not turn on individual accomplishment. She  left behind a society that was more meritocratic than the one she found in  1979. It is far from perfect -- if it had been, the men in gray suits who took  such delight in stabbing a jumped-up woman in the back would have stayed their  hand. But, ye gods, it is a better place in which to be clever and able than it  was. Perhaps, the most touching epitaph to Thatcher came from Julie Burchill, a  rebellious young punk-rock journalist in 1979, and now best-selling author 11  years later. Our Julie, when asked for her reaction to the prime minister's  resignation, said the Thatcher years "made me bloody rich. I feel like  someone's banged me over the head with a hammer."  </P> <P> Now there was the authentic voice of 1980s London. The 1980s, for the capital,  were a golden age, a time when anything was possible -- something like the  1920s must have been in New York. London, under Thatcher, became jagged, edgy,  entrepreneurial, international, sleazy, rich and fun. Its drink of choice was  champagne; its hot businesses were music, media and fashion.  </P> <P> I thought it was wonderful. And back here for three days for the first time in  a year, I felt how marvelous a backdrop to the drama London provided. It is  precisely because London is not just a government town that it provides  unexpected seasoning to political dishes. Everyone was talking about the race,  everyone glued to the television, devouring newspapers. In the trendy Groucho  Club, black-clad women ad-executives smoked and drank bubbly, turning the  leadership options this way and that. When the result was announced, a porter  at my tube stop rushed to chalk it on a blackboard; the late editions of the  papers were snatched from news-sellers hands.  </P> <P> The contrast with Washington's narcolepsy could not have been more clear. Just  think: This whole business was started a few weeks ago by Sir Geoffrey Howe's  resignation speech to the House of Commons. Can you imagine any speech, by any  member of Congress, having such a devastating effect? Can you imagine  Washington men appearing unprompted, unrehearsed, unadvised, in front of the  cameras as often as our three lads did? Can you imagine Washingtonians using  bubbly to lubricate a political argument, when most don't know which end of a  champagne bottle goes "pop"?  </P> <P> There are those who say we British spend far too much time on partisan  politics, far too much time in our clubby, unexportable political institutions  like the House of Commons, far too little time being serious about such worthy  matters as a European currency. All true. But -- oh my! -- for those who love  politics, the intrigue, the theater, the lies and cheating, the sheer vulgar  thrill of it all, the old town was the place to be last week.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Hillsdown takes Pounds 92m shake-up provision HILLSDOWN Holdings yesterday announced a Pounds 92.3m extraordinary provision within its 1992 results to cover a wide-ranging reorganisation of the food group. Group pre-tax profits fell 17.5 per cent to Pounds 154.1m. However, Hillsdown said that in spite of the 'disappointing' results, it was maintaining the dividend at 8.8p for the year. The shares were unchanged at 163p, having doubled since the group's interim results and sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism last September. Investors have been encouraged by the management's new attitude to selling or closing less profitable parts of the group. Around 30 companies, with a turnover representing about 10 per cent of the group total, are being sold or closed. Hillsdown also announced a shake-up of its management structure. Sir John Nott, who takes over as chairman at next month's annual meeting, said yesterday that Hillsdown was not looking at any acquisitions. This is seen as a marked change from the group's one-time policy of rapid expansion through takeovers. Hillsdown said it was closing its property trading business with immediate effect, and had decided to accelerate the reduction in its red meat activities where there was 'chronic overcapacity', according to Mr David Newton, chief executive. He said Hillsdown had decided on 'an even more significant reduction in our exposure to the sector' than had been indicated earlier. In the 1992 figures there was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 59.9m, compared with a retained profit of Pounds 5.9m. Hillsdown also wrote Pounds 103m of goodwill off reserves. The combined effect of the deficit on the profit and loss account and the goodwill write-off was to cut reserves from Pounds 738.9m to Pounds 562.5m. If Hillsdown had applied new accounting standards, taking the provision above the line, the pre-tax profit would have been Pounds 94.5m, down from Pounds 149.6m. As well as the red meat and the property trading activities, the provision covers rationalisation of the poultry division, and other activities such as a Spanish meat business, a German canning operation, a North American fish business, and 'a raft of tidying up items' said Mr Simon Moffat, finance director.

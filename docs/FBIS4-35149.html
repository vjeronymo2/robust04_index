			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Edith Diaz] </F>   [Text] Tegucigalpa -- President Carlos Roberto Reina  yesterday evaded giving a direct answer to a question on whether  talks have begun on the possible transfer of "gringo" troops in  Panama to Honduras, as was hinted by U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry. "To open a discussion on the operation of that  base in Honduras, a forum [foro] is needed because Palmerola is  under Honduran jurisdiction. It is based on an agreement that  never went to (the National) Congress, that is why it must be  rectified," he said.    According to Reina, the agreement was not sent to Congress  because at that time world tensions were very great, but now  that there is a time of peace, international cooperation must be  used to defend the national interests and to defend the country  from such scourges as drug trafficking in the world.    The president affirmed that during U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry's recent visit to Honduras, the most important  topic discussed was the role the country will have at the  regional level in the fight against drug trafficking, an area of  action in which the nation is at the forefront and serves as an  example.    He denied the action means a greater presence of foreign  troops in the country. He said there will be more dialogue,  adding that on other occasions, Cubans have come to the country  even though Honduras does not have diplomatic relations with  their country and no one complained, as it is being planned now  with the possible arrival of the Southern Command Marines [as  published].    "I think drug traffickers have been gradually increasing  their presence in Honduras. This is a very grave and serious  problem. All countries need help and the Central American  isthmus, with an important geopolitical position, needs a lot of  aid in this regard," Reina added.    Reina attributed to "a misunderstanding" the fact that the  statements by Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar and William  Perry did not coincide on the issue of the transfer of troops  from Panama to Honduras. While Perry said this possibility is  being considered, Paz Aguilar said this issue "was not  addressed" in the recent meeting they held in Palmerola.    Asked whether Honduras would support an invasion of Haiti, a  topic which it was speculated he discussed with Perry, Reina  said "I will never express support for an invasion of any Latin  American country, take my word." He said he would not support  the measure, even if the United Nations decided on it, because  he does not agree with the invasion of countries.</p>

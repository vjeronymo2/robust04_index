			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Bosnia-Herzegovina alarmed at vice-president's remarks YUGOSLAV Vice-President Branko Kostic has said he would never allow the Yugoslav army to withdraw from the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina while he remained a member of the federal presidency, Reuter reports from Belgrade. His comments will alarm the ethnically-mixed republic which is due to hold a referendum on independence on February 29 and March 1. Bosnia-Herzegovina has a mixed population of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Its politicians fear that fighting between Croat militias and Serb irregulars backed by the Yugoslav army could spill over into their republic.</p>

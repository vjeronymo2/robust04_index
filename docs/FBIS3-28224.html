			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japanese Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki and U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor failed to bridge a gap in trade  framework talks on Friday [4 February], a posts ministry  official said.    Kanzaki and Kantor expressed basic stances mainly on two  areas -- whether to include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.  (NTT) in the scope of government procurement and ways to  increase foreign access to Japan's mobile phone market -- the  official told a press conference. But he declined to give  further details, saying both sides agreed to make no comment.    After the press conference, the official told KYODO news  service that the discussion basically "went in parallel" during  the 60-minute meeting.    Neither side yielded on key points in the two areas, though  Kanzaki and Kantor agreed to continue talks, he said.    Subcabinet-level talks are to resume on Monday in  Washington.    Kantor, apparently skeptical about Japanese bureaucrats'  ability to settle issues, is visiting Japan in a search of a  breakthrough in the stalled framework talks through direct  meetings with cabinet ministers.    He has already met with the foreign minister, the trade  minister and the finance minister. But these meetings appeared  to have no tangible results, casting doubt over the settlement  of framework issues before the February 11 meeting between  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton.    The U.S. trade negotiator is to hold a press conference at 2  P.M. [0500 GMT], wrapping up his trip to Tokyo.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELFARE MOTHER 'BREAKS THE ICE' FOR DIANA;  </P> <P> A HUMBLE HOME -- BUT FIT FOR A PRINCESS  </P> <P> Linda Correa had a few folks over to her small, temporary apartment in Lower  Manhattan after breakfast Thursday for coffee and a nice friendly chat --  Princess Diana, her guides and security guards.  </P> <P> The Princess of Wales leaned against a kitchen wall, talking to her hostess  about school and sharing the experience of being a parent.  </P> <P> "After I broke the ice, the words just came out," said Correa, a homeless  mother who is being housed and counseled at the Henry Street Settlement's Urban  Family Center. "I felt very comfortable. She is a very soft person to talk to .  . . . She said all her children liked dogs and museums and outings. She did not  come all this way for nothing. Her visit gave me a lot of dignity."  </P> <P> Smiling, Correa said Diana sat down on a bed and the couch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'How I Became Homeless'  </P> <P> "I told how I became homeless and where I plan on moving after this," she said.  </P> <P> "She asked how the kids are, how they are in school, what grades they are in  and what they want to be when they grow up. She asked do we do a lot of  cooking. How did we spend our time? She was telling about her kids, what they  like, their toys and what grade they are in."  </P> <P> Someone asked Correa, who lost her home when her landlord died and his son sold  the building, if she had ever thought she would meet royalty.  </P> <P> "It's like a dollar and a dream -- like a lottery," she replied.  </P> <P> Princess Diana, cheered by ordinary people and jeered by demonstrators  demanding an end to British rule in Northern Ireland, visited both New Yorks  Thursday -- the world of the homeless and the black-tie world of the rich at a  gala benefit for the Welsh National Opera.  </P> <P> In this city where poverty and plenty rule side by side, the residents of a  welfare hotel just down the block watched the audience emerge from their black  limousines and enter the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the princess,  splendid in a white sequined gown, presided over the performance.  </P> <P> Just before the Welsh National Opera made its American debut, performing  Verdi's "Falstaff," Mayor Edward I. Koch entered -- stage left.  </P> <P> His honor, dressed in a rumpled business suit, addressed the princess, and the  audience in evening gowns and tuxedoes.  </P> <P> "Your royal highness, I am out of dress code because I have a town hall meeting  in the Bronx tonight," Koch said. "The city is graced with your presence."  </P> <P> The mayor said that he hopes everything goes well because "when you go home,  you will say you will have had a royal New York welcome."  </P> <P> Koch then exited -- faster than an extra in the chorus.  </P> <P> The mayor, who faces re-election this year, had been accused by some critics of  being "a turncoat in a redcoat" for agreeing to greet the princess at all. And  his welcome in a city where Irish-Americans make up a potent voting group,  could be graded as a minimal salutation.  </P> <P> Outside the Brooklyn Academy of Music, several hundred pro-Irish demonstrators  shouted their dislike of Britain's presence in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "Princess Di, go home," they cried as she arrived in a motorcade guarded by  police and federal agents carrying submachine guns.  </P> <P> After the three-hour performance, Diana traveled to the Winter Garden at the  World Financial Center, where she and more than 800 guests ranging from Happy  Rockefeller, the widow of former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, to Bianca Jagger  to Donald and Ivana Trump dined on a menu including breast of capon stuffed  with morel mousse, baby winter vegetables and a tri-colored sorbet.  </P> <P> Wherever Diana appeared Thursday, she received a royal welcome from  royalty-hungry New Yorkers.  </P> <P> "She left me the perfume," said Josephine Coll, sniffing her hand after the  princess had approached her in the crowd outside the Henry Street Settlement  and had shaken her hand. "She's very pretty and very nice."  </P> <P> Jim Lister also shook hands with Diana. "Wanna shake my hand -- $5," he told  friends. "She has a beautiful face, nice hair."  </P> <P> About 400 well-wishers cheered when Diana arrived at lunchtime at F.A.O.  Schwarz, the huge 5th Avenue toy store, to promote a new high-priced line of  British toys. When she departed, Allison Edwards, 15, of Rumson, N.J., handed  her a bouquet of carnations.  </P> <P> "I was so ecstatic, I could barely stand up," said the school girl who had  waited outside the store since 7:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Diana received tulips from Quoc Tran, 10, a 5th-grader at an elementary school  near the Henry Street Settlement.  </P> <P> Why did you give her the flowers, the youngster was asked. "My art teacher told  me to," he replied.  </P> <P> Of all the day's events, the princess's visit to the settlement house was the  most poignant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Real Princess'  </P> <P> Diana, who had worked in a preschool before her marriage, met 11 children, aged  2 to 5, at a branch of the shelter called The Family School. Many of the  youngsters have been abused and are from homeless families. She tied the  shoelaces of a little boy named Johnny. She looked at a valentine made by  little Christopher and commented: "I love the Cupid in the heart. Is that for  your mommie?"  </P> <P> Before Diana walked into the room, Janet Holmes, the teacher, told one of the  children: "She's a real princess, not a fairy tale, not Sleeping Beauty, not  Cinderella."  </P></p>

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange seeks to discount its transaction, comparison and floor brokerage transaction and assessment fees encompassing all transactions executed on the Phlx in equities, equity options, index options and foreign currency options on the Phlx for the billing cycle beginning settlement date November 29, 1993, to settlement date December 31, 1993.

In this regard, discounts will not apply to non-transaction related fees and charges such as the floor facilities fees, booth and post rental fees, as well as membership dues, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

The proposed fee schedule change also aligns service fees more closely to the cost of providing those services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHOEMAKER GETS HIS FIRST GRADED STAKES WIN AS TRAINER  </P> <P> Baldomero gave retired jockey Bill Shoemaker his first graded-stakes victory as  a trainer by capturing Sunday's Grade II, $200,000 Golden Harvest Handicap at  Louisiana Downs.  </P> <P> Baldomero, a five-year-old mare ridden by Gary Stevens, got through along the  rail and held on for a head victory in the 1 3/8-mile event over the Sawyer  Turf Course. Nine 3-year-old and older fillies and mares competed in what ended  as a three-horse photo finish with Freya Stark and Foresta.  </P> <P> Shoemaker, who retired in February as the world's winningest jockey, won the  Golden Harvest three consecutive times as a jockey, taking both divisions in  1982 and then in 1983.  </P></p>

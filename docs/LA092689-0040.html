			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Ex-convict Tyrone Robinson, 25, pleaded not guilty to charges that he shot and  killed Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton on Aug. 22. Oakland  Municipal Judge Horace Wheatley set Nov. 17 for a preliminary hearing to  determine whether Robinson will be bound over to Alameda County Superior Court  for trial. Alfons Wagner, Robinson's lawyer, told reporters that he was having  difficulty getting information on Newton's violent past. Robinson told  investigators that he exchanged gunfire with Newton in self-defense. Oakland  police said they found the gun used to kill Newton, but no other weapons were  found at the scene. Wagner said it was "not uncommon" for a weapon to disappear  from a crime scene in Oakland.  </P></p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (3): Decision day looms - Future of scheme to dam Mersey is in the balance THE TIDE of opinion favouring a barrage across the river Mersey seems to have ebbed. It is not clear whether it will flood back in. Mooted 10 years ago, the barrage has been the subject of three ever more comprehensive studies since 1987. It seemed that the barrage would be built when the Pounds 2m Stage 1 pre-feasibility study - which was joint-funded by the Mersey Barrage Company and the then Department of Energy - reported at the end of 1988. The imminent privatisation of the electricity companies imposed a Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (Noffo) on supply companies which would, in time, be required to buy 20 per cent of their power from nuclear or renewable energy sources. The study envisaged a fixed barrage across the River Mersey between Liverpool and the Wirral. There would be 46 sluices driving 28 turbines, providing 700MW of electricity, operating 12 hours daily. The barrage would provide half of Liverpool's electricity requirement during its expected 120-year life. The cost would be Pounds 1bn. But two of the most serious objections were hydraulic and environmental: what effect will the barrage have on sedimentation within and beyond the estuary and what are the consequences for the wildfowl which winter on the mudflats and sandbanks? These two issues were not fully resolved by stage 1. Thus, stage 2 of the feasibility studies was set in motion. Again, it was funded by the Mersey Barrage Company and the DE (at a cost of Pounds 1.3m). But by this time the government was beginning to have doubts, so it asked the MDC to launch further studies and ask specific questions. Fearing that it might have another Channel tunnel on its hands with costs escalating into the stratosphere, the government wanted a guaranteed maximum price for the project. It asked for a detailed cost benefit analysis which would cost the non-energy benefits of the barrage. It also wanted a dialogue with the shipping interests to allay their fears about access to the Manchester Ship Canal, and to look closely at the size and times when locks could be open. Stage 3 studies were set up and this time funded by some of the MBC's shareholders including Tarmac, Costain Civil Engineering, Northern Engineering Industries, and Trafalgar House. Stage 3 cost Pounds 3m and the report appeared in summer 1991. Mr James McCormack, general manager of the MBC, says: 'We have answered all the government's questions. We have come up with a cost envelope which gives a guaranteed maximum price of Pounds 1bn. Our detailed cost benefit analysis covers everything: environmental costs, congestion costs, tourism benefits and so on. 'We estimate there could be a net economic benefit of Pounds 308m at 1991 prices. We have had prolonged talks with the shipping interests, and have done detailed environmental studies. The sedimentation could be resolved by dredging. Still, the government has not given us an answer.' The MBC feels it must have a government response so that it can press ahead with stage 4 which would be a full developmental study costing Pounds 16m. It also needs an answer so that a bill can be put through parliament and, not least, so that finance can be raised. The government's hesitation makes raising finance even for development studies more difficult. However, some critics are not sure the doubts have been stifled by the stage 3 report. One businessman formerly connected with Manchester Ship Canal says: 'It is nonsense to say that shipping would not be affected, when they would have to spend time passing through a lock in the barrage. 'Ships already have to go through one lock to get into the canal at Eastham and this already restricts the use they can make of the tide. I am not sure either whether the sedimentation is as easily resolved as the MBC thinks: one will not know until the barrage is built. 'Also, the cost is too high. If it's jobs you want to create, there are better ways to spend Pounds 1bn in Liverpool. Finally there is the environmental argument. At a time when there is an attempt to clean up the Mersey, the barrage would be impounding dirty water.' Another shipping businessman, who also does not want his name revealed says: 'The suggested line is close to where Shell's oil tankers unload at Tranmere: construction would interfere with that. Also, these tankers have to be unloaded at high tide, when there is enough depth of water for them when full. It would not be ideal to have oil being unloaded close to turbines going full blast.' Mr McCormack says that the MBC is slowly gaining the confidence of the shipping interests and waxes enthusiastic about the barrage. 'Apart from the environmental benefits, a Pounds 1bn investment would give a terrific boost to Liverpool. There would be 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in construction in building the barrage,' he says. He admits to a sense of frustration, however. 'As the government drags its feet, the backers start to look for other projects to build. People in the street start believing that the barrage will never take place. People here in this office begin to think their careers are going out on a limb. 'We have asked the government to give us an answer by the summer about stage 4.' Given the government's doubts, whether the company will get one is debatable.</p>

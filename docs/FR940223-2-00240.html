			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 5.1&blank;Direct Funding from DOT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Funds appropriated to DOT agencies will be available to partially finance initial national and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community service projects in some of the five DOT programs in fiscal year 1994 (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual discussions on funding in the individual DOT Program descriptions set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2). These funds also may be allocated to finance portions of projects involving activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in more than one program area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appropriations for fiscal year 1995, which begins October 1, 1994, are not expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted until September 1994, and it is not possible to verify the availability of follow-on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding at this time. However, it is anticipated that direct funding of all DOT national and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community service Programs identified in this RFP may be available from DOT in future years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Depending on the nature of the proposal and the DOT Program to be implemented, it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for DOT funding to be given to State or local agencies, which will in turn pass the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding through to the service organization implementing the projects. DOT officials will advise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and assist a service organization in arranging such coordination if its proposal is selected, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this coordination should not be viewed as an obstacle to the submission of an application at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other restrictions on the use of Federal funds are discussed in Section 5.4 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 5.2&blank;National Service Corporation Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOT will submit a multi-program application containing all of the selected proposals and related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partnership agreements to the National Service Corporation in order to request funding for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining program costs that cannot be covered by direct funding from DOT and matching funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the service organization. Any funding provided by the National Service Corporation will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come from the funds earmarked for Federal agencies. Since there is no guarantee that DOT will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive funding from the National Service Corporation, a proposal accepted by DOT ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be fully funded or funded at all if DOT's request for funding from the National Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation is not granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 5.3&blank;Matching Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Each selected applicant must provide matching funds equal to at least 25% of the cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Where authorized, other federal, state or local sources (not including funds provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly by DOT or the National Service Corporation) may be counted as matching funds. In-kind contributions, including facilities, equipment, goods or services, may also be counted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matching funds. (In-kind contributions to be used as a match in more that one program must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be divided between the programs in proportion to use.) Note that a preference will be given to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals that provide the match through non-federal sources and matches that exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum match requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 5.4&blank;Restrictions on Use of Federal and Corporation Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> a. Restrictions on Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No more than 85% of the living stipend for participants may be paid from federal sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including funds received from the National Service Corporation and any other federal funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received, including DOT funds). No more than 85% of the costs of the most affordable health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care policy that provides minimum benefits may be paid from with National Service Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds. Payment of the 15% of the living stipend from non-federal sources and 15% of health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care benefits from non-Corporation sources will be included as part of the overall match for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> b. Restrictions on Administrative Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Not more than 5% of the National Service Corporation funds may be used to pay for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative costs. Administrative costs are costs associated with the overall administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the program. Such costs include the following: (1) Indirect costs (i.e., costs identified with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two or more cost objectives but not identified with a particular cost objective) as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable provisions of Office of Management and Budget Circulars that relate to indirect costs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) costs for financial, accounting, or contracting functions; (3) costs for insurance that protects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entity that operates the program; and (4) costs related to the evaluation of the program; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) costs for salaries and benefits of staff who recruit, train, place, or supervise participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Particular costs such as those associated with staff who perform both administrative and program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions may be prorated between administrative costs and costs directly related to program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> c. Restrictions on Equipment Purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Not more than 10% of National Service Corporation funds may be used to purchase equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used for programmatic operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> d. Compliance with OMB Circulars <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Programs must comply with all applicable Office of Management and Budget circulars for grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management, including Circulars A&hyph;133, A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;110, and with all applicable Federal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

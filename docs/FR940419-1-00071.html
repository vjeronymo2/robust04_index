			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) The term ``resident,'' as used throughout this part, is interchangeable with the term ``tenant,'' to reflect the fact that local resident organizations have differing preferences for the terms. Terms such as ``resident council'' and ``tenant council'' and ``resident management'' and ``tenant management'' are interchangeable. Hereafter, for ease of discussion, the proposed rule will use the terms resident, resident council and resident management corporation, as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;964.7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A contract (in the form prescribed by HUD) under which HUD agrees to provide financial assistance, and the HA agrees to comply with HUD requirements for the development and operation of the public housing project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible Residents for FIC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A participating resident of a participating HA.

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Moscow may use troops to aid Russians: Shift in policy RUSSIAN troops for the first time engaged in combat operations against the forces of other former Soviet republics at the weekend - in one case, against troops of a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. These conflicts mark a decisive and not easily reversible shift in Russian policy and may mark Russia's decision openly to defend its kith and kin outside its own borders. On his arrival back in Moscow yesterday morning from his trip to the US and Canada, President Boris Yeltsin said that in the case of wars on Russian borders 'we cannot remain idle. . . we must react to defend people and to stop the bloodshed. We have the strength to do that.' Two conflicts are of immediate concern. The first, to which Mr Yeltsin was reacting, is in the self-declared TransDnestrian Soviet Socialist Republic. The territory, part of the Moldovan republic, is bounded by the Dnestr River to its west and the Moldovan border with Ukraine to its east. Here, most of the population are Russian or Ukrainian: and here, for nine months, fighting has been going on between the local forces and the Moldovan National Guard. According to the latest reports the Moldovan forces took the town of Bendery  -the second centre in Trans-Dnestr - on Saturday, but were repulsed later. Estimated casualties run into the hundreds, according to General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president. On Saturday, as reports came in of what seemed to be a massacre by the Moldovan forces, the Russian government went into emergency session, from which it issued a call to all army units to return fire if attacked. Yesterday the Defence Ministry said the decision had allowed the Russian 14th army, based in Trans-Dnestr in spite of Mr Yeltsin's promise to remove it, to defend itself. The second conflict is in South Ossetia, a region in the north of Georgia beset by conflict since it declared autonomy from Georgia 18 months ago. In the past month it has called for a union with North Ossetia, which would mean in effect with Russia (since North Ossetia is a Russian autonomous republic). The Russian parliament has reacted 'with sympathy' to the claim. Over the weekend the Georgians made what appears to have been a successful assault on Tskinvali, the Ossetian capital, which was reported to be almost destroyed. On Thursday, Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze accused Russian helicopters of having attacked Georgian tanks - a charge which the Russians acknowledged, saying they were protecting their installations. The relations between the Georgians and Russia have worsened suddenly in the past week. Georgian military forces attacked a Russian tank regiment in the town of Gori, and fire was returned. In the absence of Mr Yeltsin, Gen Rutskoi - attracted to nationalist themes  -went on television on Saturday looking almost like a national leader declaring war. He said there were hundreds of dead in both Bendery and Tskinvali, that both Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, and Mr Shevardnadze were guilty of the most 'cynical' deceptions, and that 'Russia will not permit a settlement of the Dnestr and South Ossetian conflicts from the position of strength. We are going to put an end to the massive extermination of the civilian population.'</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney There was always likely to be profit-taking in Euro Disney in the run up to last weekend's opening in Paris, whether or not it was sparked off by cultural antagonism to Mickey Mouse. The project, after all, has reached that inconvenient stage where actuarial modelling starts to be tested by experience. The question for investors is whether the shares have fallen far enough, having dropped 15 per cent since their peak earlier this year. In the short term it would be unwise to count on it, especially since those who subscribed for the issue in late 1989 can get out and still double their money. Longer term the price will presumably fluctuate with attendance figures and spending behaviour, and how these match up with already well discounted expectations. Investors should be prepared, incidentally. for a rollercoaster of market rumours given that official information in the early months is likely to be sparse. Notwithstanding the prospect of a full financial year with operational profits, yardsticks like the earnings multiple and yield will remain unhelpful well into the mid 1990s. In the meantime, sentiment about the north European weather and the capacity of family budgets to finance the Disney experience will be more important.</p>

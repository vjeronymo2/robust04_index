			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government [ANPP], asserted at the conclusion of  his visit to the UK that he had perceived an atmosphere of  friendship towards Cuba in his contact with government  authorities, parliamentarians, and businessmen. Alarcon headed  an ANPP delegation integrated by Lidia Tablada, who presides  over the Friendship with Great Britain group of the ANPP, and  Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Economic Affairs Commission  of the ANPP.    Upon his return to Cuba, Alarcon commented on the interest  that the British Parliament expressed towards Cuba. Alarcon's  visit to Great Britain included meetings with the top leaders of  the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Alarcon informed  this newscast that on 27 May, the agenda of the British  Parliament included British-Cuban relations.    [Begin Alarcon recording] There was a very interesting  debate  in the parliament regarding relations with Cuba. A government  minister took part in this debate and very clearly reaffirmed  Great Britain's policy of continuing and developing economic and  commercial relations with Cuba. [end recording]    Alarcon asserted that he had witnessed, in parliament, Great  Britain's position with regard to the U.S. blockade against Cuba.    [Begin Alarcon recording] In the parliamentary debate that I  mentioned, MP Arnold, who is a leader of the Conservative Party  and the one who brought up the issue, and the minister of  commerce, who replied on behalf of the government, both clearly  expressed Britain's disagreement with the blockade policy. A  commitment to noncompliance with the blockade was clear, as was  the intent to strengthen ties with Cuba. [end recording]    Alarcon stated the British minister of commerce will visit  Cuba in September.    The same flight that brought the Cuban delegation back home  carried Marcelino dos Santos, president of the National Assembly  of Mozambique, who asserted that he came to learn, profoundly  and scientifically, about the revolutionary process in Cuba.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / French Senate backs treaty PROSPECTS for French ratification of the Maastricht treaty strengthened sharply yesterday when a Gaullist attempt to reject it outright was defeated in the Senate by a comfortable margin. All 91 Gaullist senators, as well as all 16 Communist senators, voted to throw out the Maastricht treaty without further debate, but their motion was defeated by 196 votes to 120. Detailed voting on the necessary revision of the French constitution will now resume in the Senate next Tuesday. The Senate vote is particularly encouraging for the government, because it indicates that there is still a clear parliamentary majority in favour of the Maastricht treaty, despite the destabilising effects of the No vote in the recent Danish referendum. Following last month's vote in the National Assembly, yesterday's preliminary vote in the Senate indicates that the government can probably count on the various majorities it requires for revising the French constitution. Before ratification proper, which is scheduled to take place in the autumn in a popular referendum, the National Assembly and the Senate are both required to revise the Constitution, first in separate votes and then in a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament. The joint sitting of the two houses, in a so-called Congress, requires a three-fifths majority for final revision of the constitution. Yesterday's Senate vote of 196 in favour of Maastricht, coupled with last month's National Assembly vote of 398 in favour, give a combined total which is comfortably over the required three-fifths threshold. At the same time, the Senate vote shows that the Maastricht debate is continuing to deepen the split between the Gaullists and their normal allies.</p>

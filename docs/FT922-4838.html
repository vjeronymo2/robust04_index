			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Radioactive waste repository delayed UK NIREX, the nuclear-waste consortium, yesterday an-nounced a one-year delay in submitting its planning application for Britain's first underground repository for radio-active waste. Nirex said the delay was because it had insufficient information on the hydro-geology of the Sellafield area of Cumbria, its preferred site. The delay is not expected to increase the cost on the Pounds 2.5bn project significantly. Nirex had expected that its first four test boreholes would provide enough information for it to submit a planning application late this year. But water flows at deep levels seemed to be 'slow and sluggish', Mr Michael Folger, Nirex managing director, said yesterday. This made it much more important to obtain information from two proposed test boreholes on fellsides in the Lake District National Park. The Lake District Special Planning Board has refused permission for drilling because of fears of harm to the landscape, noise and disturbance. Nirex is lodging an appeal, which may trigger a public inquiry by the Department of the Environment. Nirex said it did not expect to drill the boreholes before the first half of next year. It now aims to make a decision on a planning application for the repository by autumn next year. The revised target date for the 800-metre-deep repository to begin operating is 2006. Cumbria County Council, which is pressing for a more wide-ranging inquiry, welcomed the delay. Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, said Nirex must now realise it had the wrong design in the wrong place, and should back down. Britain is to approach the Commonwealth of Independent States for permission to send a research vessel to the Kara Sea, south of the Arctic Ocean, where radioactive waste was dumped by the former Soviet Union. British officials want to study the movement of radioactivity from the dump area. Radioactivity has been detected in the sea around Greenland, and scientists believe contamination may be spreading.</p>

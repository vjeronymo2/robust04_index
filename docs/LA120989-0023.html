Was the Soviet liner Maxim Gorky selected as a backdrop for any symbolic  reason? I've heard complimentary reports about it as a cruise ship from  Americans who have been its delighted passengers. But more importantly, the  great Russian writer, after whom the ship is named, held out for hope and  sustenance despite the sordid surroundings he depicted in czarist Russia. "The  Lower Depths," as an example.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

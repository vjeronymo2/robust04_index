			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Manufacturing industry  investment is expected to increase 17.4 percent in 1994, the  greatest increase in five years, the government reported  Saturday [26 March].    According to a report released by the Directorate General of  Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), key projects, those  worth at least NT$200 million (US$7.58 million), will be the  primary contributors to the expected boost in investment  willingness. The report was based on a survey of 1,800 private  enterprises.    Investments by large enterprises are predicted to surge by  [figure indistinct] percent, but those by small- and  medium-sized enterprises will fall by 7.5 percent and 14.4  percent respectively, according to survey results.    "The anticipated drop in investment willingness among small  businesses is the result of a combination of negative factors  such as the lingering business slowdown, stringent pollution  control requirements and a dearth of capital," a DGBAS official  explained.    Nearly all sectors of the manufacturing industry indicated a  strong desire to invest, the survey found. Machinery equipment  investment, an index often used to gauge investment willingness,  was predicted to increase to a record high of 20.3 percent over  1993 levels.    The metal industry is projected to lead the investment  spree,  surging 64.3 percent over 1993. Just as dynamic will be  electrical accessories and appliances, which are predicted to  jump 53.9 percent.    The report also forecast a 9.3 percent growth in revenues  for  the manufacturing industry as compared with the 6.9 percent  growth rate registered in 1993.</p>

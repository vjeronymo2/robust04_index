But these unsuccessful efforts prove that the option  of dividing Bosnia will not help stop the war there, which is  aggravating confrontation, the crisis in the Balkans, insecurity  in the region, contradictions and opposition in the  international community. Therefore, I think that this option  should be replaced with another which will be in accord with all  international laws and rules, on which the peace and security of  each country is based and which does not compensate the  aggressor. There is only one option which is based on this  principle, which may prove to be successful and will put an end,  in the international aspect, to the numerous approaches and  practices which have so far been an obstacle. This option will  impose agreement on belligerent factions and withdrawal on the  aggressor. But, Mr. Berisha said, besides Bosnia, Kosova is  still a major problem to be solved in the context of the Balkan  crisis. To this end, a meeting of Belgrade authorities with the  legitimate representative of Kosova, Mr. Rugova, in the presence  of a third party, would be welcome and useful. It would also be  of a special value if in the documents of the European Union,  along with the resolution of the question of Bosnia, a "modus  vivendi" be also found for Kosova. With regard to the lifting  of the embargo against Serbia, it should be totally linked with  the solution of this problem because any facilitation of the  embargo may lead to a spillover of the Balkan conflict towards  the south.    Further on, President Berisha underlined that the relations  of Albania with Macedonia are strengthening continuously. We  have been and are for a close cooperation with Macedonia. The  question of arms trafficking is an old matter with which the  Albanian democratic government has no connection at all and all  necessary documents exist to prove it. In the mean time, we  have welcome the decision of the Macedonian Government for the  census in a near future. Signs of progress have also been  noticed in our relations with Montenegro," Mr. Berisha said in  conclusion.    In his address, Lord Owen presented a panorama of the  efforts  of negotiators to find an acceptable solution for all sides. He  considered peace an indispensability for the region and for  Albania. It is high time, he said, that the question of Kosova  be treated in the talks as a part of this crisis.    In the context of the efforts to find out a solution, Lord  Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg stressed the need of a regional  conference with the participation of all countries which are  slightly or largely affected by this crisis.    President Berisha supported the idea for the regional  meeting  in the framework of the Geneva Conference and emphasized that  Albania will always be open to dialogue and interested to  contribute to peace and stability in the region.</p>

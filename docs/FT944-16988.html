			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Sceptical Saatchi warns on slogans The mastermind behind the Conservative advertising campaigns since 1979 has given the first public insight into the strategy behind the snappy electoral slogans which helped ensure the party's four general election victories. In a speech on the black arts of political propaganda Mr Maurice Saatchi delivered a timely warning to the Tories that the slogans are useless unless they are built on political substance. Speaking at a dinner hosted by Mr Richard Ryder, the Conservative chief whip, Mr Saatchi dismissed the idea that the creative skills of the advertising industry's copywriters could provide a substitute for cogent political argument. Mr Saatchi, who has in the past avoided public comment on the thinking behind such images as 'Labour isn't working' and 'Labour's tax bombshell', said the campaigns had not worked by tricking the electorate. The Conservatives had been successful because the party had recognised that political campaigning was an adverse activity - a world of 'trial by combat' in which, instead of behaving like an incumbent government, the party behaved as if it was the opposition. The slogans had worked because they encapsulated a basic truth. In a process which ensured that 'only honest thought, as only honest merchandise, can stand the limelight of organised publicity for any length of time', advertising became reductio ad verite.' But the ability to speak 'over the head' of the media directly to the voters had dangers as well as advantages. If sufficiently wide and continuing, advertising forced politicians to be exact or it annihilated them. In what may be taken as a warning to the government to demonstrate a clearer sense of purpose, Mr Saatchi said the political strategy behind the advertising had to be as clear as the slogans: 'There's nothing fine about a long-winded rambling argument that goes nowhere and never gets to the point'. Instead: 'If you can't reduce your argument to a few crisp words of phrases, there's something wrong with your argument'.</p>

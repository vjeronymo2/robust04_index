			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 79. We also affirm the Commission's decision to apply existing enhanced service safeguards to BOC and GTE provision of nonregulated level-two video dialtone services. No party offers any new evidence or argument that would persuade us that this decision should be revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80. We also reject arguments that we should adopt more stringent requirements at this time, such as requiring LECs to offer all level-two services through a separate subsidiary. Here again, commenters have raised no new issues or arguments. We have found that separate subsidiary requirements for enhanced services impose inefficiencies and other costs, and that discrimination and cross-subsidization can be policed adequately through less onerous means. No party has shown that provision of video-related enhanced services, which at this time do not include video programming itself, is so fundamentally different from provision of other enhanced services as to require a different regulatory regime. We do, however, make one minor change to our nonstructural safeguards. Currently, the BOCs and GTE must file nondiscrimination reports on their installation and maintenance of 49 categories of basic services. To adapt this requirement to video dialtone, we require the BOCs and GTE to add an additional service category for video dialtone delivery service. We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently vacated in part and remanded the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BOC Safeguards Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on the ground that the Commission had not adequately explained how, without full unbundling of BOC networks under ONA, discrimination could be prevented in the absence of structural safeguards. We delegate to the Common Carrier Bureau authority to establish interim measures to govern BOC provision of enhanced services, including video dialtone-related enhanced services, if and when this decision becomes effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 81. Finally, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we stated that we would review our video dialtone rules and policies in 1995. Such review no longer appears to be necessary in light of the detailed examination we have undertaken in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of those rules and policies, as well as our continuing work on major video dialtone issues through the CPNI data request and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Indeed, we are concerned that the regulatory uncertainty that could stem from another comprehensive review of video dialtone rules and policies could discourage video dialtone deployment pending that review. For these reasons, we will not initiate a formal review of our video dialtone rules and policies in 1995. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor the evolution of video dialtone and oversee its implementation in specific applications through the Section 214 process and the tariff review process. In addition, if in the future it becomes apparent that we should modify aspects of our video dialtone rules and policies, we will initiate a proceeding to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Joint Marketing and Customer Proprietary Network Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 82. We affirm our decision to permit LECs to engage in joint marketing of basic and enhanced video dialtone services, as well as of basic video and nonvideo services. We also affirm our decision to apply existing CPNI rules to video dialtone at this time. Nevertheless, we direct the BOCs and GTE, the carriers to which our CPNI rules currently apply, to provide us with additional information about the kinds of CPNI to which they will have access as a result of providing video dialtone service so that we may obtain a better record in assessing whether existing CPNI rules best balance the various interests that are implicated by the use of CPNI in the video dialtone context. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 83. We permit LECs to engage in joint marketing of basic and enhanced video services, and of basic video and nonvideo services, because we believe that the benefits of permitting joint marketing outweigh any adverse effect on competition. Joint marketing can offer consumers the convenience of one-stop shopping both for basic telephone and video dialtone services and for basic and enhanced video dialtone services. Through joint marketing, LECs will be able to increase customer awareness not only of the video dialtone system generally, but of enhanced features and functions available on that system. This awareness will benefit programmer-customers as well as end users and result in greater usage of the video dialtone platform. At the same time, LECs will be able to market video dialtone services in the most efficient manner possible, avoiding the costs imposed by structural separation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 84. The record in this proceeding does not support a finding that joint marketing of video and telephony services will have an anticompetitive impact on the provision of video programming services to end users. While consumers moving to a new residence typically arrange for telephone service prior to or immediately after the move, they also will be arranging for other services at that time, including video programming services. No one has shown that the first call placed is necessarily to the telephone company. More significantly, the cable operator, not the telephone company, will be the incumbent video programming provider in the market. We believe that consumers today are likely to be aware that they may order video programming services from the local cable operator. We also believe that they will do so if the cable operator's rates and programming are preferable to those offered by programmers on the video dialtone network. Simply because telephone companies may sometimes have an initial contact with consumers changing residences in our view does not demonstrate a likely anticompetitive effect or warrant a prohibition on joint marketing. We also note that the extent to which LECs will market basic video dialtone service to end users is unclear, particularly since in some video dialtone applications, LECs have proposed to charge their programmer-customers, but not end users, for basic video dialtone service. Moreover, since telephone companies, as common carriers, are prohibited from favoring a particular video programmer's product, the ability of LECs to market video dialtone services to consumers will be constrained in any event. By contrast, cable companies with authorization to provide telephone service can jointly market video and telephony services without restrictions on favoring particular video programmers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85. We also apply to video dialtone, at this time, our existing CPNI rules, which were recently upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> California  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FCC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No party has provided evidence that existing CPNI rules do not properly balance our CPNI goals relating to privacy, efficiency, and competitive equity in the video dialtone context. Nevertheless, because of the significant privacy issues that are potentially implicated by video dialtone-related CPNI, we believe we should obtain additional information about such CPNI so that we may carefully assess whether existing CPNI rules sufficiently protect customer privacy in the video dialtone context. For example, we seek information as to whether LECs, in providing video dialtone, will have access to information about the types of programming that each customer views. This information would raise greater privacy concerns than other CPNI, which does not generally include information about the content of customer communications. We are also interested in assessing the competitive value of CPNI obtained from video dialtone, as well as the extent to which access to this information promotes the efficient provision of regulated and nonregulated services by LECs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

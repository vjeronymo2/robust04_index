			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Baseline.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the final revised rule, a substitution unit's allowance allocation is calculated by multiplying the lower of the above-discussed emissions rates by the baseline, which reflects 1985&hyph;87 utilization. The January 11, 1993 regulations used baseline (and only the 1985 actual or allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate) to calculate the allowance allocation. In the November 18, 1993 preamble, the Agency discussed the options of basing allocations on utilization at the time a permit application is submitted or requiring utilities to project what future utilization of the substitution units would be in Phase I without the substitution plan and using the projected utilization to allocate allowances. No commenters supported the use of projected utilization, and those that specifically addressed the matter preferred continued use of baseline. For the reasons set forth in the preamble (58 FR 60956&hyph;57), the Agency concludes that a substitution unit's baseline should continue to be used to calculate the allowance allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Limiting the Number of Substitution Units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency rejects modifications of the January 11, 1993 regulations making upfront approval of the designation of substitution units and allocation of allowances to such units contingent on an end-of-year review of the need for such units for each year that the plan was in effect. Under such an approach, the Agency would allow only those designations of substitution units that actually proved to be needed. No commenters supported that approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because allowance allocations for substitution units are limited as discussed above, the Agency concludes that requiring end-of-year review of the need for substitution units and thereby limiting the number of such units is unnecessary. If a substitution unit is not allocated allowances for emissions rate reductions that would have occurred without a substitution plan, then the unit will use up all or most of its allocated allowances unless the unit made new emissions rate reductions that would not otherwise have been made. To the extent that a substitution unit frees up allowances by making such new emissions rate reductions, section 404(b)(1)(5) is not violated.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60957. In short, because today's final rule prevents any substitution unit from creating new, excess allowances, there is no need to impose further requirements limiting the number of substitution units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Requirement That the Substitution Unit Be Under Control of the Table A Unit's Owner or Operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that the statutory requirement that the substitution unit be under the control of the Table A unit's owner or operator is satisfied where such units have only a common designated representative. This was based on the determination that a common designated representative qualifies, in such cases as an operator. 40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). In the November 18, 1993 preamble, the Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having a common designated representative, without more, meets this statutory requirement and to revise the regulations accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. The Agency today adopts the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and in the preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;55), that a designated representative is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Agency stated that, under some circumstances, a designated representative's ``duties and level of responsibility can be equivalent to that of an operator.'' 58 FR 3600. One such case, identified by the Agency, was where a designated representative represents multiple sources participating in a substitution plan and otherwise lacking the same owner or operator. In that case, the designated representative's responsibilities are allegedly ``broad enough to bring him or her within the definition of operator.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the November 18, 1993 proposal and the March 22, 1994 final NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rule, a designated representative's responsibilities in a multi-source substitution plan are not actually any broader or more complex than they are under other compliance options. Therefore, there is no basis for treating a designated representative in such a substitution plan any differently than a designated representative under any other compliance option. In all such cases, a designated representative is not an operator. The final revised rule reflects this conclusion by eliminating language from the January 11, 1993 regulations that provided that units with a common designated representative, and nothing more, could participate in a substitution plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters note that, although &sect;72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have ``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) itself states that the substitution unit must be ``under the control of the owner or operator'' of the Table A unit. They argue that, in implementing section 404 (b) and (c), the Agency should focus on whether there is such control. They suggest that the ownership of the units is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They allege that, on one hand, where the units have multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met. On the other hand, where the units lack the same owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual arrangements under which the owner and operator of the substitution unit commit,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule, the Agency is not addressing these additional issues concerning under what circumstances a proposed substitution unit is considered to be under the control of the owners or operator of a Phase I unit. EPA is addressing these issues, and the related comments, in a separate direct final rule in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In order to preserve these issues for resolution, the Agency is adopting, in today's final rule, the statutory language requiring that the owner or operator of the Phase I unit ``control'' the substitution unit that it designates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Other Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has adopted several other minor changes to clarify the current &sect;72.41. For example, as discussed above, a substitution plan may distribute allowances between the substitution unit and the Table A unit. The final rule makes it clear in &sect;72.41(c)(4)(ii) that, where there is more than one Table A unit in a plan, allowances may be distributed from a substitution unit only to the Table A unit that designated that substitution unit. The final rule also eliminates the superfluous, but potentially confusing, final sentence in that section of the January 11, 1993 rules because the sentence simply repeats the limitation in &sect;72.41(c)(3)(ii) on the total number of allowances available under a substitution plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 72.41(c)(4)(ii) (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

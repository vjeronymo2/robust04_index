			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL AGREES TO CONDITIONAL GUILTY PLEAS ON OVERBILLING AF  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. agreed Wednesday to enter conditional guilty pleas  to two felony counts charging that the company conspired to defraud the Air  Force by overbilling on contracts for the NAVSTAR satellite navigation system.  </P> <P> The agreement, reached on the eve of trial on the charges in Los Angeles  federal court, leaves the company open to a fine well in excess of $500,000 and  the possibility of suspension from future government contracts.  </P> <P> But the agreement also allows Rockwell to retain the right to withdraw its  guilty pleas should the company prevail on appeal in its claim that it never  should have been prosecuted for wrongdoing that its own company officials  voluntarily disclosed to the government.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner said Wednesday that the Justice Department will  seek a "very substantial fine" when the company is sentenced on the charges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Underscore the Efforts'  </P> <P> "I think it's necessary in order to underscore the efforts of the U.S.  attorney's office and the Justice Department in the area of procurement fraud  to the industry generally and, of course, hopefully to get the attention of the  defense industry," Bonner said.  </P> <P> In a hearing scheduled for 1:30 p.m. today, Rockwell is expected to plead  guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government in connection  with the NAVSTAR global positioning system and one count of criminal contempt.  </P> <P> The contempt count stems from a 1982 court injunction prohibiting the company  from submitting false claims to the government, an order issued in response to  a government suit accusing the company of fraudulently shifting costs to the  space shuttle program.  </P> <P> As part of the Department of Defense's voluntary disclosure program, a Reagan  Administration effort to encourage contractors to report suspected fraud,  Rockwell lawyers turned over evidence of the alleged double-billing, repaid the  amount of the overbilling and fired one of the employees involved in the  scheme.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall has already rejected the company's motion  to dismiss the indictment on that basis, and Bonner predicted that Rockwell's  appeal will be unsuccessful as well.  </P> <P> "The Defense Department's voluntary disclosure program requires that a company  make a full disclosure of its fraudulent activities before, and I underscore  before, any government investigation or audit has started," Bonner said. "In  this case, an investigation into possible mischarging and defective pricing  with respect to the contract in question had started fully 10 months before  Rockwell made any disclosure to the government."  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Rockwell said Wednesday that the company has  maintained it never should have been indicted and has also "consistently  agreed" that the two employees who were also indicted in the case, Donald  Carter, former material division director at the company's Satellite Systems  Division in Downey and Seal Beach, and Robert Zavodnick, 46, former manager of  major subcontracts for the division, "violated company policies and  procedures."  </P> <P> "When the company discovered what had occurred, it conducted an intensive  internal investigation, disciplined the employees involved, offered full  restitution to the Air Force, and disclosed the results of its investigation to  the government," the company's statement said.  </P> <P> Zavodnick, a Fountain Valley resident, pleaded guilty in September. Carter, 60,  of Temecula was acquitted last month.  </P> <P> Bonner denied that the acquittal prompted the government to accept a plea  bargain in the case, noting that the company has agreed to plead guilty to the  most serious charges in the indictment and faces a potentially unlimited fine  on the contempt count.  </P> <P> Rockwell said it agreed to the plea in order to proceed with the appeal on the  voluntary disclosure issue and "to avoid a costly trial for both the company  and the federal government."  </P></p>

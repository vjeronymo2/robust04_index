			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Chase raises stakes in T&amp;N battle Chase Manhattan, the US bank, has raised the stakes in its legal battle with T&amp;N over asbestos contamination of its New York headquarters by appointing one of the country's leading lawyers to prepare its case. The bank said that Mr Arthur Liman, senior partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, would head the legal team overseeing its Dollars 185m damages case against T&amp;N, which as Turner &amp; Newall was formerly UK's leading asbestos supplier. Mr Liman, regarded as one of the country's most combative lawyers, acted previously as chief counsel to the US senate committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair. In that role he questioned former officials from the Reagan administration including Col Oliver North and Mr Robert Mcfarlane. He also represented Mr Michael Milken, the former head of the junk-bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert, who was jailed in 1990 for securities fraud. The T&amp;N case centres on allegations that the British company knew that asbestos spray installed in Chase Manhattan's New York offices was hazardous. T&amp;N, which denies liability, declined to comment yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Xue Li </F> (5641 5461) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 21 May (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee  for Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS] held  its 12th Plenary Session in the Great Hall of the People this  morning to study measures for improving the comprehensive  management of public security in rural areas in accordance with  the guidelines of the central rural work conference. Ren  Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and  chairman of the CCCMPS, pointed out: Vigorously and  conscientiously implementing the central authorities' policy,  party committees, governments, and various departments at all  levels have adopted many realistic and effective measures and  done a large amount of difficult and painstaking work in  maintaining stability. Judging from the present situation, we  think it is possible to maintain sustained social stability so  long as we conscientiously make unremitting efforts to handle  the task.    CCCMPS Vice Chairmen Luo Gan and Cao Zhi, CCCMPS members in  Beijing, and comrades in charge of all the relevant departments  of the central authorities participated in the plenary session.  CCCMPS member and concurrently CCCMPS General Office Director  Chen Jiping [7115 0370 1627] gave a briefing on a tentative plan  to hold a national work conference on the comprehensive  management of public security in rural areas; comrades attending  the plenary session expressed their views on how to successfully  hold the conference and on the various tasks and measures to be  proposed during the conference.    In his speech, Ren Jianxin stressed the importance and  necessity of improving comprehensive management of public  security in rural areas. He said: The situation of public  security nationwide remains very grim since early this year.  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach a  high degree of importance to the issue. On the one hand,  judicial and public security departments must step up their  crackdown on serious criminal activities and serious economic  crimes; on the other hand, other measures for the comprehensive  management of public security must be conscientiously  implemented. At present, the number of public security problems  has greatly increased in some rural areas. The masses strongly  complain about this. We must under no circumstances  underestimate the impact that rural areas' public security  problems will have on the situation nationwide. We must proceed  from the overall situation of the work of the whole party and  the whole nation to understand this issue.    Ren Jianxin emphasized that while continuing to do a good  job in harshly dealing with serious crimes, waging a  thoroughgoing struggle to strike severe blows at serious  economic crimes, and making greater, more comprehensive efforts  to improve public order in large- and medium-sized cities, it is  necessary to launch a unified and concentrated struggle to  improve social order in rural areas. He demanded: The party  committees and governments at all levels should attach great  importance to improving the social order in rural areas through  comprehensive measures. All central departments concerned and  all quarters concerned should take an active part in the  struggle, vigorously support it, truly place the work on daily  agenda, and concentrate strength on doing it well. Great efforts  should be made to implement the system of leaders assuming full  responsibility for improving public order through comprehensive  measures, promote the implementation of the measures, safeguard  social stability, and create a good social environment for  reform, opening up, and economic development.    Ren Jianxin pointed out: This year is very crucial to the  deepening of reform. In light of the characteristics of this  year's situation, the party Central Committee has put forward  the main points of the work of the whole party and the whole  country. It has particularly emphasized the great importance of  understanding correctly and handling well the relationship among  reform, development, and stability. He called on the leading  cadres of party and government organizations at various levels  to immerse themselves among the masses at grass-roots units,  understand the masses' demands, and proceed from improving the  people's living standards and solving practical problems -- the  problems about which the people are concerned -- to resolve  social contradictions.    It is reported that the CCCMPS, after serious study, has  decided to take effective, comprehensive measures and make great  efforts to improve social order in rural areas.    According to today's meeting, the improvement of social  order  in rural areas needs the following efforts: 1) it is necessary  to combat crimes with greater force, ensure the implementation  of various measures at grass-roots units to impose severe  punishment on serious criminals following swift trials according  to law, and deal harsh blows against those who commit serious  crimes in rural areas; 2) people who commit minor crimes in  disrupting public order should have their bad behavior corrected  by listening to lectures on the legal system; 3) it is necessary  to rectify any paralyzed or semi- paralyzed village party  branches, villagers' committees, and mass preventive  organizations, strengthen the force for improving public  security through comprehensive measures in townships and towns,  implement the system of leaders assuming full responsibility for  maintaining law and order, truly "have someone in charge of the  work of maintaining law and order," and ensure peace and  stability in the area; and 4) it is necessary to manage villages  according to law and correct the unhealthy social climate of  "bad people always getting away with bullying good people." We  must strive to improve remarkably the social order in rural  areas within a fairly short period of time.</p>

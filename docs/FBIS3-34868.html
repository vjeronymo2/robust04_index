			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nairobi, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Sudan's Islamic  fundamentalist military government is allegedly massing child  soldiers in neighbouring Zaire and the Central African Republic  [CAR] to attack southern rebels, relief officials said Monday  [14 February].    A major government offensive against the black and mainly  Christian rebels, weakened by internal divisions, has driven  more than 100,000 southerners towards the Ugandan border. "We  have had reports of a massive military buildup along the border  with the Central African Republic, and there are similar reports  from Zaire," Michael Semmler of the German relief agency Action  Africa in Need told a news conference in the Kenyan capital  Nairobi after a two-day visit to rebel-held territory in  southern Sudan.    Justin arop Yac of the relief wing of the rebel Sudan  People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum had "bribed local  officials" to turn a blind eye to the massing of Sudanese troops  in remote, notoriously lawless areas of Zaire and the Central  African Republic bordering Sudan. "Most of the soldiers are  just young boys, aged 12 to 15," Yac told AFP. Several foreign  relief agencies said they had also received persistent reports  of child soldiers grouped just over the borders ready to attack  the rebels from behind. The number of troops reportedly poised  to attack was unknown.    UN officials said aid to millions of Sudanese verging on  starvation in the drought-hit south has been disrupted by a  recent government ban on relief flights to key areas along the  border. The ban was apparently timed to cut off food to  southerners as the government offensive gathered momentum,  private relief officials said.    The onslaught by government warplanes and tens of thousands  of troops could be Khartoum's final push to crush the southern  rebellion, diplomats and aid workers said.    The United Nations has warned foreign aid workers and  missionaries around Yambio, near the southern border with Zaire,  that they may be endangered by fighting as the government  presses on with a major offensive against the rebels. Most aid  workers have already withdrawn from areas near the Ugandan  border.    Four nuns and three priests of the Comboni order have been  told to leave Nzara, a few kilometres (miles) west of Yambio,  Semmler said.    He confirmed a claim by John Garang's mainstream SPLA  faction  to have recaptured the southern town of Mundri, near the Zairean  border, last weekend, only hours after it fell to government  troops.    Semmler appealed to the UN security council to enforce a  "no-fly zone" over southern Sudan to stop the government bombing  civilians and force it to allow in food aid. "The war is no  longer a military war where armies fight each other," Semmler  said. "It is a war where the government of Sudan fights the  civilian population in the south. This war is an ongoing human  rights violation."    The US government has protested against the bombing of  civilians in rebel-held areas by government warplanes, and UN  secretary-general Butros Butros-Ghali has also expressed concern.    Khartoum denies the offensive and blames unrest in the south  on fighting between Garang's faction and an SPLA splinter group  led by Riak Machar who broke with Garang in 1991.    An AFP correspondent, however, witnessed a government  bombing  raid last week on Pageri village, near the town of Nimule on the  Ugandan border, that killed seven people.    Yac said the Arabic-speaking northerners were waging "a  genocidal war, a war of ethnic cleansing" against the black  southerners, and were deliberately trying to starve civilians.    He backed Mashar's recent accusation that the government was  organising slave raids on southern villages, and settling  Arabic- speaking northerners on land seized from the largely  Christian and animist Africans.    Relief officials said dozens of Sudanese boys had recently  returned to Sudan from a refugee camp in northern Kenya  sheltering more than 10,000 boys separated from their families  by the decade-old war. There was speculation that they had gone  to join rebel fighters, the officials said.</p>

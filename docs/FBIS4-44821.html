			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Loubiere: "Major Step Forward For European </F> Silicon Chips"]    [Text] France Telecom and the CEA (Atomic Energy  Commission) have developed a new engraving technique for  electronic silicon chips which should allow Europe catch up in  this strategic sector.    The end of the European inferiority complex in  semiconductors, an area largely dominated by Japan, the United  States, and South East Asia, is in sight. The CEA and France  Telecom, who are jointly conducting research on electronic  components, have just developed a new engraving technique on  logic silicon circuits, an essential technique for the  industrial production of chips.    This progress is important because Europe has been very much  missing from the technological battle being waged between the  United States, Japan, and the rest of Asia. At the end of the  eighties, Europe was even becoming totally dependent on foreign  supply for its electronic components. This situation was all  the more serious because electronic components are becoming a  major element in all industrial sectors from nuclear plants to  aircraft, from watches to washing machines, from computers to  automobiles. In a nutshell, the share of chips in consumerables  is constantly growing.    The European Commission reacted a little late in the day in  1990 when it created JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon  Initiative), a research program grouping together the main  manufacturers in the sector (Philips, SGS-Thomson, Siemens,  Matra). A year later, in 1991, the CEA and France Telecom  joined forces to form an EIG [Economic Investment Grouping]  working within the framework of Jessi. The task of the EIG was  straightforward: to provide Europe, within three years or less,  with sophisticated silicon engraving technology. Both public  bodies managed to meet this demand within the given deadline.    So what are we talking about? In simple terms, silicon chips  are subject to two conditions: They must have increasingly  large capacities and be increasingly small in size. "Think of a  book," Xavier Dariel, an engineer at the CEA, explained. "If  you want to increase the number of chapters without increasing  the number of pages, then you have to reduce the typeface. This  is somewhat similar to what we are doing with components. We  are engraving logical circuits on to small squares of silicon.  To reduce their size, we have to develop techniques to enable  increasingly finer circuits to be engraved."    Currently the chips have micron-sized engravings, in other  words the size of a hair divided by 50. France Telecom and the  CEA have overcome the micron barrier to reach 0.35 microns, and  will soon reach 0.25. "Our innovations have enabled 1.5 million  transistor test memories to be manufactured which were perfect  right from the first production batches," the EIG director  explained.    Teams working in CNET [National Telecommunications Study  Center] in Grenoble (France Telecom) and Leti (CEA) managed to  succeed in the feasibility demonstration of this new technique,  the so-called CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semi-Conductor) in  0.35 micron technology. The validation of results should be  carried out immediately at the Crolles (Isere) industrial plant  and would enable the development of a 0.35 CMOS micron facility  there from 1995 onwards.    The main innovations remain the use of deep ultraviolet  photoengraving and mechanical-chemical polishing techniques to  completely level the dielectrics (insulation) after depositing.  They also involve the structure of the drains and transistor  sources, the use of ultra-fine oxide grids or the definition of  doping transistor channels. The interconnecting network  includes three layers of aluminum alloys. The feasibility of a  new deposition method of nitride-titanium distribution barriers  has also been demonstrated. Specialists will value this.    "This technological progress opens up the way to future  generations of 0.25 micron technology and less," the director  said. "They will contribute to Europe continuing in the race  towards the miniaturization of electronic components which, we  know, will influence the competitiveness of a large number of  constantly expanding industrial sectors."    Semiconductors are a strategic technological challenge and  should be worth some 600 billion French francs in 1994,  according to Dataquest (a bureau specialized in the study of and  prospects for technology). The number of applications is  constantly growing and the market could be worth a thousand  billion French francs by 1998.    The geographical distribution of semiconductor consumption  proves revealing. Consumption in the Asia-Pacific region should  exceed that of Japan in 1995, Dataquest predicts, with an  expenditure of $28.09 billion in 1995 for the purchase of  semiconductors compared to $22.83 billion in 1994, and $27.32  billion against $26.61 billion for Japan.    "We have raised our estimates for the Asia-Pacific region  because we anticipate a continuation in the explosive growth  experienced in 1993," Gene Norrett, who is responsible for  semiconductors at Dataquest, said. The Asia-Pacific region  should represent 28 percent of the semiconductors market by  1998, or $26.72 billion, with China being the main consumer in  this region.</p>

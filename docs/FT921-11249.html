			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When can I count my losses? I HOLD a block of Maxwell Communication shares and worked for Pergamon Press. From what date will the Inland Revenue recognise this block as a total loss with respect to my ability to write off capital gains against it? If, by the end of March, you have made capital gains for the year exceeding Pounds 5,500 (and you consider the Maxwell shares of negligible value) you should write to your tax inspector (the letter should reach the tax office by Sunday April 5): 'In accordance with section 22(2) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, I claim that the value of my holding of . . . Maxwell Communication Corporation ordinary shares has become negligible, namely . . . ,and that I should therefore be treated as if I had sold that holding today, April . . . 1992, for that sum and had had immediately reacquired it for that same sum, in circumstances falling outside section 66(1) of that Act'. If your 1991-92 capital gains are only slightly over Pounds 5,500, you will have to weigh up the pros and cons of making a claim this April (rather than in April 1993 or later). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14: Capital gains tax - an introduction. I HAVE had a number of BES investments which went into receivership. I have deliberately not so far filed negligible value claims because I have no immediate utilisation losses, although it is possible that they could be of use in later years. You have implied that a negligible value claim should only be filed when you can use the loss. I have no allowable loss on the original investment as they are BES investments, but indexation relief is available. If I wait until I have a taxable CGT gain, after allowing for the exemption relief, can I claim indexation CGT losses right up to the date of my election or only to the date of the receivership? Indexation relief (on the incidental expenses of acquisition) will run up to the month in which you make your negligible-value claim, unless the company is struck off. On the day the company is struck off, there will be an automatic deemed disposal under section 22(l) of the CGT Act, making any subsequent section 22(2) claim void. Although, for practical purposes, the deemed sale-and-reacquisition under a section 22(2) claim can be regarded as taking place on the day on which the claim is made (as indicated in the preamble to extrastatutory concession D28 in the free booklet of concessions, IRI), section 22(2) actually says that when the claim is allowed by the inspector the deemed sale-and-reacquisition shall be treated as taking place 'thereupon', viz on the day the inspector allows the claim. It may be worth insisting on the strict letter of the law where, for example, the inspector takes a year or two to make a decision and the enhanced loss can be used in the year in which he or she finally gets around to allowing the claim. We take it that your questions do not relate to section 574 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 - income tax relief on certain allowable losses accruing to subscribers in unlisted companies. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

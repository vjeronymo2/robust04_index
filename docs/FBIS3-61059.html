			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Petr Altunin, </F> under the rubric: "Timely Topic": "Roads -- For Russia"]    [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Dossier:  Lieutenant-General Ivan Dmitriyevich Marchuk was born in 1944.  He graduated from Leningrad Military Transport Communications  Command School and the Military Academy of Rear Services and  Transportation. He passed through all of the levels in the  railroad troops from platoon commander to rail corps deputy  commander. From 1988 -- he was deputy chief of the Central Road  Construction Directorate and then its first deputy. He has been  chief of the Federal Road Construction Directorate under the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defense since December 1992.    He is married. His son is an officer.    In 1988, a state road construction and reconstruction  program in the RSFSR Non-Chernozem Zone was adopted. The Central  Road Construction Directorate was created at that time. On 8  December 1992, a Russian Federation Presidential Edict  reorganized it into the Federal Road Construction Directorate  under the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. And, finally,  the Statute that regulates its activities, legal bases, and the  obligations of officials was approved by a Russian government  decree on 10 August 1993.    The editorial staff asked Lieutenant-General Ivan  Marchuk, chief of the Federal Road Construction Directorate  under the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, to discuss the  new structure's affairs and plans.    [Marchuk] Based upon the big picture, you can't call our  road  structure new. The general-wagon master service that consisted  of subunits to prepare and maintain the roads needed by the  troops had already been created in the era of Peter I. Later,  staging troops subordinate to the military communications organs  existed for the operation of military roads. And the road  service worked along the entire front from the Barents to the  Black Seas in the Great Patriotic War. The song "Ekh, dorogi..."  [Ah, the roads] was certainly about it. As in the infantry, they  experienced cold, alerts, and bombing each day. According to a  State Committee for Defense decision, dozens of road troops  formations were formed at that time and their mission consisted  of the restoration of highway lines of communications. After the  war, the military road builders turned over to the national  economy 5,500 kilometers of restored, very important roads and  hundreds of high-water bridges that had been built. Today many  people, when they drive along the Moscow-Simferopol,  Moscow-Leningrad, and Irkutsk-Ulan-Ude main highways and around  Moscow's ring road, do not even suspect that the military road  builders made a decisive contribution to their construction.    [Altunin] 1988 was, of course, an event for military road  builders?    [Marchuk] Yes, as a matter of fact, a qualitatively new  military organization appeared that was directed toward the  fulfillment of a purely civilian task. And I think that it was  then and is now an extremely important task. There are still no  roads in the depth of Russia. After the rain, there is  impassable mud and motor vehicles have to ford small rivers. A  third of the harvest is lost and agricultural equipment is  ruined because of this.    [Altunin] And what have you managed to do in five years?    [Marchuk] Quite a bit. We have built 3,320 kilometers of  highways (2,555 under the plan) and also 115 military garrisons,  75 asphalt-concrete plants, 19 rail dead-end sidings and  open-pits, and more than 500 cultural and consumer-services  facilities. During the first ten months of this year alone,  1,584 million rubles worth of construction-erection work has  been completed. I need to say that a kray is transformed after a  road is laid. Residents return to previously abandoned villages  from the cities and refugees from the CIS countries arrive to  bring the earth "back to life".    [Altunin] Ivan Dmitriyevich, how would you sort out your  current status? You are not part of the Armed Forces but at the  same time you are "under the Ministry of Defense"?    [Marchuk] Yes, we are not part of the army's strength. The  Presidential Edict and the Russian Federation Council of  Ministers decree state that the Federal Road Building  Directorate (FDSU) functions as a state institution. The  Ministry of the Economy allocates a separate line of investment  to us that is financed at the expense of the Russian Federation  budget. And at the same time the Ministry of Defense has been  tasked to supply the Federal Road Building Directorate with all  types of allowances and services in accordance with and based  upon the standards that are in effect in the Russian Federation  Armed Forces but for payment. We are guided by presidential  edicts, military regulations and minister of defense orders.  Units and subunits have both daily routines, details, reveille,  taps and liberty. Indeed, weapons are used only to guard  facilities.    [Altunin] Right now, what is the geography of the work being  conducted by you?    [Marchuk] Previously, we were concentrated in the  Non-Chernozem Zone. In Nizhniy Novgorod, Ryazan, Vologda, Kirov,  Orel, Perm and other oblasts and in Udmurtiya. We have had "our  own people" in these areas for a long time now. Many former  10th-form girls have long ago become the wives of our officers  and warrant officers and they have given birth to children...  After the formation of the Federal Road Building Directorate,  new oblasts -- Tula, Tambov, Chita, and Amur oblasts and  Khabarovsk Kray -- are summoning us to them. Right now we are  going there not only according to orders as we did before but  while concluding economic contracts beforehand where both the  time periods, salaries and the quality of the subcontracted work  are stipulated.    Cost-accounting and cost recovery are penetrating into all  of  our activities. By way of illustration, we are building housing  for ourselves, we are selling real estate ourselves during  moves, and our salary depends on output.    [Altunin] Incidentally, how much are your road builders  paid?    [Marchuk] Everything depends on the fulfillment of  standards,  on the quality of work and even on initiative. For example, in  current money, a private road builder receives a minimum of  R30,000. But such specialists as excavator and crane operators  receive R100,000 each or more. There are also bonuses. Officers  receive them when a facility is turned over.    During the time of their service at training combines,  soldiers obtain and later reinforce in practice "hard"  specialties: Bulldozer operators, electro-gas welders, asphalt  layers and others that are highly valued in the civilian sector  today. We also have quite a few civilian personnel. We have  4,500 women -- skilled specialists. Among them are kindergarten  workers, general education and music school teachers, doctors  and nurses.    [Altunin] Ivan Dmitriyevich, today officers certainly go  unwillingly to their duty locations at the other end of the  earth?    [Marchuk] Imagine, the situation is poor with officer cadre  manning. It seems to me that even the romantic appeal has not  disappeared. Of course, there are difficulties. Approximately  60&percnt; of the officers have been provided apartments and the  rest  are in hotels, in the private sector and, like we in our youth,  in trailers... But at the same time there is a change in those  areas where it is appropriate and there is a bonus and years  served coefficient in the salary. Pensions are the same as for  all servicemen. Compulsory service personnel manning is worse.  We receive augmentation according to the what's left principle.  We hope that the law on alternative service will be adopted. We  are also beginning to conclude contracts.    But for the time being -- we are looking for manpower. Here  are the latest examples. Several months ago, we began  construction of the uncompleted 1,200 kilometer sector of the  Chita-Khabarovsk-Nakhodka super highway. According to another  agreement, Federal Road Building Directorate subunits will  participate in the program to conquer Tyumen Oblast's gas-oil  producing regions. This is a large mission of state importance  and we have a backbone of specialists to resolve it. But we will  hire workers locally in those regions. There are civilian  personnel and extended service military personnel there.    [Altunin] But what can you say about the military road  building equipment that you need? Has it been adapted for  construction of "civilian" roads? Is anything being imported?    [Marchuk] We are utilizing our own, domestically-produced,  military road building equipment in our formations and units. Of  course, it is reliable but, since it was obtained from the  military districts after prolonged storage or after major  overhaul, it requires large expenditures for maintenance and  repair.    As for imported equipment, simply speaking, we don't have  any  yet. The primary reason is the absence of hard currency to  acquire it. And the need is increasing to equip them with  imported equipment with the withdrawal of our formations to the  Far East, to the Transbaykal Region and to Tyumen Oblast. The  work there is in rocky and frozen ground and at low  temperatures. I think that we need to resolve this problem  immediately. The end result of our work in these regions is many  times more valuable than the expenditures on equipment.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHTING UP U.S.-MEXICO BORDER AREA  </P> <P> I read your article "Tactic of Lighting Up Border Raises Tensions" (Part A, May  26) with great disgust. I can't believe that there are actually people who will  go so far as to degrade Latino men, women and children trying to come to the  United States and have a decent life. They're coming from countries -- whether  it's Mexico or El Salvador -- where they have nothing. They have no chance of  giving their children a decent education or even enough to eat. What else are  they supposed to do? The United States is the land of freedom and jobs.  </P> <P> I want to take Muriel Watson's statement, "Something has to be done. We are in  a crisis situation," and change it a little. We are not in "crisis situation,"  the Latin American people are in a crisis situation. But, she is right about  one thing. Something does have to be done. We need to change the United States  foreign policy. We need to persuade our government to stop spending so much of  our tax dollars on war in Latin America, and help create jobs and better social  programs there. We need to help rebuild those countries instead of destroying  them.  </P> <P> It makes me sick to see all of those United States citizens at the border  shining their lights on the people trying to come here. Then they go and blame  drugs, traffic and pollution on them too? They have to be kidding! Why don't we  ask our dear President Bush about his involvement with drugs, or let's ask the  oil companies about the chemicals that they send to Colombia in order to make  cocaine.  </P> <P> Come on already! It is time to stop trying to put blame on immigrants for all  of our country's problems and do something.  </P> <P> To all the Anglos out there on the border -- get off your high horse and start  taking responsibility for our country's problems as well as for other  countries' problems.  </P> <P> NEILE RISSMILLER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Caught in the log-jam Tony Bevan would have been happier if he had never heard of Coloroll. But his employer, Mills Associates, a Monmouth-based computer data processor, decided to shut down its pension scheme in June 1990 - just one month after the historic Barber judgment - and he was trapped. With more than 25 years' service in the company scheme, Bevan was alarmed to discover that his future pension was entangled in a legal process that extended from Monmouth to Luxembourg, home of the European Court of Justice. Only now, more than four years later, will Bevan find out just how much his pension benefits are worth - and be able take control of the money to invest in a pension plan of his choice. 'The worst part has been the endless delays and not knowing who to go to for help,' he says. 'We have been passed from pillar to post and, finally, our concern over the fund value led us to appoint a firm of consulting actuaries to investigate on our behalf.' In Bevan's case, the delays were nothing to do with his employer and everything to do with a tortuous pensions system. Late in the 1980s, and despite its generous benefits, the final salary scheme at Mills Associates was attracting few new members because of the massive publicity promoting personal pension plans. When it became uneconomic to maintain the scheme, the company decided to close it and advised members to take out personal pensions. Unlike many employers in this position, however, Mills Associates continued to pay substantial contributions into employees' individual plans. When the scheme was closed it had 70 members, excluding pensioners. Of these, only 25 were still employed by Mills Associates; the rest had changed jobs and left their pension benefits behind. The company scheme was run by Legal &amp; General, which advised members to sit tight until the outcome of the Coloroll case was known. If the court decision on Wednesday had led to extra costs, the scheme would have been obliged to adjust members' benefits. In the interim period, several members reached retirement age and, naturally, wanted to draw their pensions. Legal &amp; General agreed to pay these, but at a reduced rate. Bevan, meanwhile, tried to accelerate the wind-up. As he explains: 'The Occupational Pensions Board didn't clear the scheme until 1992, and then the Department of Social Security took ages to complete its examination due to what appears to be a permanent backlog. We tried the pensions ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, but they said they could do nothing to speed things up. We then discovered that the average time it takes to wind up a scheme is four to five years - and this has nothing to do with the Coloroll case.' For Bevan and his colleagues, the long wait is over at last. Legal &amp; General confirmed that the effect of the court's decision is negligible on the Mills Associates scheme and that the funds are ready to distribute. Once the actuaries finish their investigation, members will receive their benefits - including back payments to pensioners who had received a reduced rate since 1990. Footnote: Some schemes waiting to wind up following the Coloroll ruling will have good news for members. Where a scheme has a surplus of funds, and once the extra costs imposed by Coloroll are met, it can use the balance to increase members' benefits. In the case of the British Shipbuilders' pension scheme, run by Legal &amp; General, the surplus is Pounds 50m.</p>

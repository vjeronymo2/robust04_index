			<p>BFN     [Text] The first session of the new parliament has opened  with procedures to elect speakers for the Chamber of Deputies  and the Senate. The majority parties' candidates are Carlo  Scognamiglio (Forza Italia) for the Senate, and Irene Pivetti  (Northern League) for the Chamber of Deputies. Pivetti will be  challenged by Anna Finocchiaro [Democratic Party of the Left],  and Scognamiglio will be challenged by Spadolini, who is the  opposition choice and officially became a candidate this morning.    For the first two ballots in the Senate 164 votes are  required. In the Chamber of Deputies two thirds of MP's -- ie.  420 -- must vote in the first three ballots.</p>

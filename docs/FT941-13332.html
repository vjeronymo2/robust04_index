			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No problem with UK aerospace Sir, On December 14 you printed a letter from Dr Michael Cross who, after three years' research, concluded that the UK 'has a long way to go if the UK manufacturing base is to become world class'. His study could not have focused on the UK's aerospace industry, about which we at Lockheed hold a different view. You might like to know that Lockheed is undertaking a major commercial venture to modernise the C-130 Hercules aircraft and we have conducted a worldwide competition to identify suppliers: 1) with the most modern technologies; 2) meeting or exceeding established quality standards; 3) capable of meeting stringent delivery schedules; 4) offering the best prices; and 5) willing to invest their own money in the programme. As of today, 18 UK companies have won positions on the Hercules team - far more than any other nation outside the US, representing exports for the UK economy which over the next 10 years alone will amount to well above Pounds 1.2bn. Moreover, we should be quite clear that their contribution in terms of technological expertise and competitiveness has been a significant factor in ensuring we are able to offer a more affordable, reliable and capable aircraft than any prior model in the 40-year history of the Lockheed Hercules aircraft line. I appreciate the point Dr Cross was trying to make with regard to the overall UK manufacturing picture. However, from our perspective, and based not on academic analysis but on hard commercial experience, UK aerospace companies with which we are now partners hold verifiable world-class credentials.

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Top judge backs right to jury trial LORD TAYLOR, the Lord Chief Justice, said yesterday he was opposed to abolition of the defendant's right to choose trial by jury. Removing the defendant's right to elect for jury trial in cases which can be tried either by magistrates or at the Crown Court was the most controversial of 352 recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice earlier this month. Giving his first public response to the commission's report at a conference in London, Lord Taylor said it was essential not only for justice to be done but for those concerned to have confidence in the process. 'We must have regard to our history, our culture and the perception of many that trial by jury is a fundamental right,' he said. If limits were to be placed on the right it would be better to increase the categories of less serious cases which should automatically by tried by magistrates. This might involve removing the right for low-value thefts, for example. But this was 'surely preferable to the socially divisive regime which may well result from the commission's more sweeping proposal'. The Lord Chief Justice said he welcomed the commission's report in general.</p>

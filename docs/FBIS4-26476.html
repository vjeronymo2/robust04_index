			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup"] </F>   [Text] Moscow, June 22 (XINHUA) -- After a half year of  arduous bargaining, Russia, the major heir to the former Soviet  Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finally  achieved the compromises necessary to enable Moscow to join  NATO's Partnership for Peace program.    On Tuesday [21 June], Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev  flew to Brussels, headquarters of the treaty organization, to  sign the Partnership for Peace program originally proposed by  U.S. President Bill Clinton in response to some eastern European  countries' desire for NATO memberships.    Shortly after the signing ceremony, Kozyrev and NATO Deputy  Secretary General Sergio Balanzino announced at a press  conference a cooperation protocol between Russia and NATO  setting forth general principles for their future relations.    The protocol, put forward by Moscow as a precondition for  joining the Partnership for Peace program, acknowledges Russia's  major power status and its influence in Europe, stating that  Russia and NATO will have extensive dialogue and cooperation and  conduct political consultations on European and global security  and peacekeeping missions.    NATO has placed some restrictions on Russia's request for  more political consultation on security issues. Both sides will  remain independent in their decision making, the NATO leadership  pointed out today.    In fact, the two documents reflect the concessions made by  both sides after six months of bargaining.    Their differences focused on whether a special relationship  would be established between them.    Since U.S. President Clinton proposed the program in  January,  Russia had repeatedly changed its position on the issue in an  effort to gain special relations with NATO commensurate with its  status as a world power.    NATO, however, insisted that all participants in the  Partnership for Peace plan be equal and demanded that Russia  first join the program before discussing any special  relationship.    At a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels on May  25,  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev announced that Russia  would join the Partnership for Peace plan "unconditionally."    But he proposed that in the meantime Russia and NATO  establish more extensive cooperation in military and security  matters and urged NATO to sign a separate cooperation agreement  with Russia on European and global security.    Evidently, special ties between Russia and NATO remained the  cornerstone of the new conception proposed by Grachev.    Essentially, Russia wanted greater say in international  affairs, specifically, the right of veto on international issues  within the framework of the treaty organization.    The dilemma facing NATO was that it could neither neglect  Russia's request nor meet it.    On the one hand, NATO hoped Russia would join the program  because a new security mechanism in Europe could hardly work  without Russia's participation, and NATO did not want to  irritate the nuclear power by disregarding its request.    On the other hand, NATO worried that other countries would  be  displeased if special relations were established with Russia.    The treaty organization was also trying to prevent Russia  from taking advantage of special relations in order to  strengthen its role in NATO.    As a compromise, NATO was ready to take Russia's world power  status into consideration without conceding the right of veto.    In light of NATO's tough stance, Russia readjusted its  policy. At a NATO meeting in Istanbul on June 10, Kozyrev  announced that Russia would soon sign the partnership for peace  plan.    Russia based this decision on the following considerations:    First, Russia wants to end its dispute with NATO for fear  the  quarrel could deepen mistrust between the two sides.    Second, Russia worries that it will become isolated when  other eastern European countries and former Soviet republics  join the program one after the other.    Third, Russia sees many uncertain factors in the program and  should join in order to develop the situation in a direction  favorable to the interests of the former Soviet republic.    With these compromises, Russia and NATO have finally signed  the two documents. But differences remain over Russia's role in  NATO and NATO's future role in general.    Therefore, both cooperation and disagreement will continue  to  dominate relations between Russia and NATO, and this  relationship will, to a large extent, determine the future  pattern of security in Europe.</p>

On the  agenda were talks on the repatriation of hijackers, illegal  immigrants, and the settlement of fishery disputes in the Taiwan  Strait. However, bickering was the common point throughout the  negotiation, according to local media reports.    Sun Yafu, the chief negotiator for the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], accused Taipei of  swallowing promises made during the previous round of talks in  February. He said SEF Secretary General Chao Jen-ho had  verbally agreed that hijackers would not be legally viewed as  criminal suspects when they were repatriated. However, SEF  Deputy Secretary and Taipei's chief negotiator H.Y. Hsu [Hsu  Hui-yu] said that ARATS was confused over what Chao had said and  that Taipei would recognize only promises written in black and  white. Hsu claimed that the mainland delegation had been  insincere throughout the talks.</p>

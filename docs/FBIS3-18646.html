			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 12 February Lisbon daily PUBLICO  reports the results of a PUBLICO-NORMA political preference poll  conducted in continental Portugal between 19 and 28 January  among 995 individuals over 18, with a commentary by Joaquim  Trigo de Negreiros. The poll carried a 2.3 percent margin of  error. Results showed that the Socialist Party (PS) improved its  score from last December, going from 34.83 percent to 37.7  percent. It thus narrowed the gap with the Social Democratic  Party (PSD), whose score dropped from 48.91 percent in December  to 45.9 percent. While the PSD still maintains a "comfortable"  lead of 8 percentage points over the PS, Trigo de Negreiros  points out that a month ago, the gap between the two parties was  nearly 14 percent. The scores of the Communist Party (PCP)  remained practically unchanged (9.99 percent in December to the  present 10.2 percent), as did those of the Social Democratic  Center Party (CDS) (3.59 percent to 4.2 percent).</p>

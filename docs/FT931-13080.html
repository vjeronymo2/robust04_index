			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar remains under pressure THE DOLLAR fell nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as dealers continued to revise forecasts for likely changes in short-term German and US interest rates this year, writes James Blitz. After closing in London at DM1.5900 on Friday night, the US currency tumbled to a low of DM1.5690, before closing at DM1.5725, some 1.75 pfennigs down on the day. That close put it more than 7 pfennigs lower than its levels in the first week of this year. Recently, the market has become more pessimistic about how quickly US and German rates will converge, a factor which continues to underpin the D-Mark. At the start of the year, interest rate futures markets appeared to think that the gap between German and US rates would come down by 350 basis points by the end of the year. Last night they were discounting a narrowing of the order of 280 basis points. The last two days, in particular, have brought several indications that US interest rates will remain low and German rates high. Dealers voiced concern yesterday that weekend talks between German trade unions and the Bonn government had broken down, fuelling fears that German wage inflation would continue to climb. Yesterday's 1.0 percentage point monthly rise in December's rate of inflation in North-Rhine Westphalia also appears to have depressed some investors, raising fears that the Bundesbank will find it difficult to ease policy as quickly as expected. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, believes that the upshot of the breakdown in wage talks is that the Bundesbank will not ease policy at its next meeting on February 4, as some have suggested. There are also growing indications that the Federal Reserve will not raise short-term interest rates as quickly as expected, either. At the weekend, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US Treasury secretary, said that Mr Bill Clinton's administration was likely to propose increased taxes on consumption. This quashed expectations that the administration is determined to introduce a fiscal stimulus which would have to be accompanied by higher US interest rates. One sign of the new strength of the exchange rate mechanism was the absence of pressures in Europe despite the D-Mark's strength against the US currency. The French franc lost a little ground against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.385 to the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.386. The Irish authorities were also able to cut their secured advances rate from 15 per cent to 14 per cent. Sterling consolidated against the D-Mark following last week's sharp fall. It closed at DM2.4525 up 1 1/4 pfennigs in the day, helped by a report from the CBI on business confidence.</p>

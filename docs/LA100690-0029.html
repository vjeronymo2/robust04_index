			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: 38 SOVIETS TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS  </P> <P> Track and field athletes Natalya Yermolovich and Yelena Podkopayeva were among  38 Soviets who tested positive for drugs, including steroids, a sports official  said in an article published in the newspaper Sovietsky Sport.  </P> <P> It did not say if any action was taken against the athletes, 16 of whom were  track and field competitors.  </P> <P> But because the story was given prominence on the front page of the newspaper,  some disciplinary action against Yermolovich and Podkopayeva is almost certain.  </P> <P> N. Ivanov, a member of the anti-doping committee of the Soviet Olympic  Committee, reported that a false medical certificate had been made out for  Yermolovich, who finished sixth in the javelin throw at the 1988 Olympics.  </P> <P> The medical certificate, apparently drawn up by Yermolovich's trainer,  identified only as Medvedev, stated that she had been undergoing medical  treatment that included the use of the anabolic steroid narabol. The trainer  had prevailed upon a doctor to sign the document, the report said, adding that  other documents also were falsified.  </P> <P> The report also said that Podkopayeva, a middle-distance runner, participated  in the European Championships at Split, Yugoslavia, Aug. 27-Sept. 1, even  though a preliminary test before the Goodwill Games at Seattle in July showed  the presence of a steroid in her blood.  </P></p>

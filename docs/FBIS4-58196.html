			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Nasr Yusuf, Palestinian police </F> chief, by unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not  given--first two paragraphs are AL-MAJALLAH introduction]    [Text] While Palestinian-Israeli negotiations continue in  Cairo in an effort to solve disputes, preparatory to the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Palestinian  police forces have completed their preparations and training as  they await the handover of the security of those areas after the  withdrawal of Israeli forces.    In an effort to find out more about the Palestinian security  arrangements in Gaza and Jericho, and the mission of the  Palestinian police, AL-MAJALLAH conducted this interview with  Major General Nasr Yusuf, chief of the Palestinian Police Force,  who also took part in the negotiations with the Israelis.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What are the security arrangements being  adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Gaza and  Jericho after the signing of the agreement?    [Yusuf] For our part, all measures and all preparations have  been made for complete control of security conditions. There is  a precise plan, already adopted, to fill the security vacuum  that will occur in the regions as soon as the Israeli forces  withdraw, and to prevent any chaos or tension. The Palestinian  deployment forces have been instructed to carry out their duties  immediately. All that remains is that we be permitted to enter  the areas. This is at the core of the present dispute in the  negotiations with the Israelis.    [AL-MAJALLAH] How many Palestinian policemen have you and  the  Israelis agreed to deploy to undertake law and order duties in  Gaza and Jericho?    [Yusuf] That step is still the subject of dispute between us  and the Israelis. The Israelis have not set the final number.  Every time they agree with us on specific numbers, they back  away from that commitment. For our part, we attach importance  only to the numbers that will be agreed upon inside the  negotiation chambers.    [AL-MAJALLAH] Have the Palestinian security cadres  responsible for intelligence and the protection of senior  Palestinian commanders in Gaza and Jericho--such as President  Yasir 'Arafat and his top aides--now actually been formed?    [Yusuf] Yes. This matter was concluded finally, and all the  special forces for these objectives have been assembled. The  security forces working with intelligence have been appointed  and equipped. Their mission, the areas of their deployment, the  format for their cooperation with intelligence--domestically and  abroad, with the Arab and European states cooperating with the  Palestinian autonomous authority--have all been defined. The  same is the case with the forces that will guard and protect  senior PLO commanders, the officials of the Palestinian  authority in Jericho, and all the members of civil defense  forces, the central security forces, bodyguards, and others. The  areas of their deployment have already been set out on maps, and  the mode of cooperation among them has been defined as well. All  that remains is for them to be permitted to enter the Gaza and  Jericho areas to take over their total responsibility on the  ground.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What about the agreement on protecting  crossing  points? Is it true that Israel will have complete control, while  the Palestinians will merely be permitted to monitor from a  distance inside rooms of their own?    [Yusuf] I don't think this is true. We will not consent to  any such arrangements; we will have a permanent and effective  presence. We will have many specialized tasks and duties, just  like the Israelis, only more. In any case, we won't be able to  say anything about this issue until after the final signature of  the agreement and the natural conclusion of the matter through  the actual deployment at the crossing points.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What about the agreement on the weapons the  Palestinian police will use?    [Yusuf] This question is linked to the first one. The  Israelis say they will be light arms. We are asking to use the  arms and equipment that any police force in the world would use,  in order to enforce law and order in the areas subject to  Palestinian control.    [AL-MAJALLAH] Why was the dispatch of the first contingent  of  the Palestinian police force to Gaza and Jericho cancelled?    [Yusuf] The delay was not from our side, of course, but the  Israelis are being asked about it. After we made all the  preparations, at the last minute we were told of the  postponement of the sending of the first batch, which should  have preceded the greater number of police forces. The same is  true of the team of Palestinian observers.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What will be the nature of the security  cooperation between you and the Israeli security forces deployed  in Gaza and Jericho to protect the Israeli settlements?    [Yusuf] There should be a supreme coordinating committee  between the two sides to oversee this. But so far this committee  has not been formed, and we have not been informed of the names  of the Israeli participants. We are still waiting for a solution  to major issues pending between us and the other side.</p>

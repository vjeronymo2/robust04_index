			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by L. Fomicheva and Yu. Trefilov: "A Rayon for </F> Three"]    [Text] The protracted struggle to merge three St.  Petersburg rayons--Smolninskiy, Dzerzhinskiy, and  Kuybyshevskiy--is over. At a meeting of rayon activists, which  took place in the district Officers House yesterday, the city  mayor introduced the head of administration of the  new--Central--rayon. The person appointed to this job is  47-year-old Anatoliy Borisovich Chaus, who until recently was  head of the Smolninskiy Rayon administration.    "In creating the Central Rayon," said A.A. Sobchak, "we are  bringing it closer to city standards. It will have a population  of 330,000, which is in line with other rayons. The main point  of this merger is the communality of interests typical of the  center of the city. This involves first and foremost the  restoration and reconstruction of residential housing and  engineering communications. The rayon's enlargement is also  dictated by the need to carry out large-scale projects--such as  the reconstruction of St. Petersburg's historic center, the  Apraksin Mart, and the creation of a tourist center."    There are 44,360 families needing improvement of their  living  conditions currently residing in the central part of the city.  Practically no new housing is being built. If one old quarter  after another undergoes reconstruction, however, this problem  may be solved: this way, the refurbished housing stock may be  increased two- to threefold.    Anatoliy Aleksandrovich answered many questions, including  on  particular subjects. Regarding the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo Higher  Navy Engineering School located in the Admiralty building, the  mayor said that the initiative of moving the school out of it  comes from the Leningrad Navy Base Commander V. Grishanov. After  the notorious fire in the Admiralty, he appealed to the Russian  Ministry of Defense to move the school to Pushkino.    City residents asked the mayor about rumors of the imminent  resignation of GUVD [City Administration of Internal Affairs]  chief Arkadiy Kramarev. The mayor said that he does not have any  personal dislike for the major general and considers him a good  professional and a worthy person. However, in Anatoliy Sobchak's  opinion, with all his positive qualities, the GUVD chief lacked  the firmness to remove "old school" staff from the main  administration's apparat, which affects the work of law  enforcement organs.    One of the mayor's negative comments was that, in selecting  his cadres, he frequently prefers those who previously worked in  party structures.    "I hear both this sort of accusations, and the opposite. I  select professionals for their business qualities on the premise  that they leave all their old beliefs outside the door of their  new offices and work honestly and conscientiously in the new  environment."</p>

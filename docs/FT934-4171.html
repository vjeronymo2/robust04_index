			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: A taste of Givenchy Tonight in the Metropole Palace Hotel, Monte Carlo Christie's is selling furniture, silver and art works belonging to fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, one of France's great collectors. Both to prepare for retirement in two years' time and cater for his aged labrador which finds the stairs too much, the 66-year-old couturier recently sold his town house and is now auctioning its contents, which are estimated at FFr200m. Even this fraction of Givenchy's possessions represents the sort of sale seen once in a generation - 95 lots collected over a period of some 30 years with exquisite taste from galleries and salerooms all over the world. Everything was flown out to Christie's Park Avenue showroom in New York in October and also exhibited in the sumptuous Mona Bismarck Foundation in Paris - Charles Cator of Christie's said he had never seen so many big collectors turn up at viewings. Most of the items are supremely elegant, Louis XV pieces. They include a pair of gilt-bronze, three light 'girandoles' estimated FFr3-5m - candlesticks supported on dragons, their tails sculpted to writhe down the sides of a fireplace - a pair of exceptional large porphyry vases (est. FFr2.5-3m) and a Regence gilt-bronze mirror attributed to Charles Cressent (est. FFr4-5m). Well before it became so fashionable Givenchy collected furniture by the Parisian cabinet-maker Andre-Charles Boulle, famous for his elaborate inlays of brass and tortoiseshell. Tonight's sale includes a pair of Louis XIV medalliers by Boulle estimated FFr6-800,000, similar to a pair owned by the Bibliotheque Nationale. ,The last lot, the Hanover Chandelier, has a catalogue all to itself. Designed by Yorkshire architect William Kent and one of five commissioned from Hanover silversmith Balthasar Behrens in 1736-1737 by George II, it once hung in Windsor Castle, weighs 52 kilos and is estimated at FFr18-22m.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTER GAINS 3 VOTES; PANEL'S OK IS ASSURED  </P> <P> Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter gained three more votes Wednesday on the  Senate Judiciary Committee, assuring his approval by the panel when it votes  today.  </P> <P> The endorsements by Sens.  </P> <P> Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) and Patrick J. Leahy  (D-Vt.) brought to 10 the number on the 14-member panel publicly in favor of  Souter's nomination. None had come out against him by late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Grassley was the last of the committee's six Republicans to announce his  support. He said he was concerned about Souter's testimony on activism by the  courts.  </P> <P> During his confirmation hearings, Souter said there were instances where the  court might step in to fill a "vacuum" if the other branches of government fail  to act.  </P> <P> Leahy and Kohl were the third and fourth of the committee Democrats to support  Souter. Other Democrats on the committee have withheld their endorsement,  largely because Souter refused to state a position on abortion rights.  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was pushing for a quick vote by the  full Senate to put Souter on the bench Monday, the start of the court's fall  session.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, three liberal senators who are not on the committee joined Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) in opposing Souter's nomination. The three are Sens. Bill  Bradley (D-N.J.), Frank R.Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.).  </P></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: Survival of the Travelcard after bus deregulation Sir, I was extremely concerned to read your report (April 22) that the new chief executive of London Transport was predicting the death of the Travelcard in London once buses are deregulated. I was responsible at London Transport for the launch of the Travelcard and the marketing of it for the first three years of its existence. I think it is useful to remember the main objectives of the Travelcard's introduction. to provide a period ticket that would be more economic for the commuter than paying the single journey fare every day, thereby encouraging people to pre-purchase for one week, four weeks or longer, meaning fewer transactions and hence fewer queues at booking offices as well as providing a cashflow advantage to London Transport. to promote public transport in off-peak hours when the Underground and buses have extra capacity. This encourages not only additional journeys, particularly in central London to destinations such as Oxford Street with the resulting benefits to retailers there, but also encourages general use of public transport when the alternative is to stay at home or use the car. The tickets proved and still prove to be extremely popular and have done a lot to maintain public transport's market share in London (markedly different to experiences in conurbations outside London where bus deregulation has now been in place for nearly seven years). They have resulted in a higher proportion of the population not only using public transport on a regular basis but being aware of a greater part of the public transport network than that required just for their journey to work. If people really believe in public transport and wish to see its market share increased, then on no account should they create the conditions under which multioperator and multimodal tickets would cease to be available to the travelling public.

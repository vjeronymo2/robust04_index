			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Books: Partisans of the pitch - Behind every kick Peter Aspden finds raging debates on nationhood FOOTBALL AGAINST THE ENEMY by Simon Kuper Orion Pounds 14.99, 223 pages Sport, as the coming weeks will remind us, is one of the last refuges of the knee-jerk, politically incorrect national labelling which used to be the staple of TV sitcoms and post-prandial discussions in any gentleman's club of your choice. In no other field of activity can one get away with references to languid Africans, jumpy Italians, cynical Uruguayans and those determined, never-say-die Germans who will keep spoiling the carnival. Yet where would today's football commentator be without access to this priceless database of cheap stereotypes? Simon Kuper's perceptive and highly entertaining account of his travels round the soccer world puts some of these fervently-held beliefs about national behaviour to the test, and finds that behind every kick of a football, there lies a raging existential debate on citizenship and nationhood. Bill Shankly's pallid aphorism on life, death and Pele's beautiful game would find some unlikely followers among Kuper's animated cast of characters: there is Professor Dr L. de Jong, sober historian of the Netherlands during the second world war, happily admitting to dancing round the room when the Dutch side score; on a summer night in 1988, he watched nine million of his 'staid' compatriots - more than 60 per cent of the population - parade round the streets to celebrate the nation's 2-1 victory over West Germany in a European Championship semi-final. In the centre of Amsterdam, bikes were thrown into the air in symbolic revenge for the theft, during the Occupation, of all the city's cycles by the German army. After the match, the Dutch captain, Ronald Koeman, admitted to using his opponent's swapped shirt as toilet paper; the beautiful game, indeed. Travelling to Africa, Kuper meets Professor Paul Nkwi, a Cameroonian anthropologist, who floats his theory that Anglophone Africans are much more likely to succeed in European clubs than their Francophone counterparts as they are more used to the overt racism of British colonisation and have not been deceived by the French rhetoric of equality. Less sophisticated analysts argue that the raw talent of home-grown stars is dissipated in the wealthy North by the over-emphasis on organisation. The country, in the meantime, continues to bask bizarrely in the glories of Italia '90; a rare clothes emporium in Yaounde is called 'Bobby Robson' after the man who engineered - well, stood on the sidelines and watched - their exit from the tournament. It is no great surprise that Kuper finds the most skilful football (as well as another extemporising anthropologist) in Brazil. 'When our national team plays, we feel that the identity of our country is being played out on the field. Our values are being shown to the world,' theorises his reflective academic, Luis Eduardo Soares. While Graham Taylor waits until he can look another turnip in the eye, he may do well to ruminate on the fate of some of his Brazilian counterparts: Claudio Coutinho, for example, whose effigy was burned by fans on the very day Brazil reached the second round of the 1978 World Cup, for playing sacreligiously boring football. Kuper's most extraordinary encounter is with a fan; a very serious fan indeed. Helmut Klopfleisch was a 13-year-old supporter of Hertha Berlin when the Wall went up and separated him from his beloved team. At first, he joined a group of East Berlin Hertha fans next to the wall, listening to, and echoing, the cheers from across the great divide. But when the club moved westwards and out of earshot, he and his fellow non-travellers had to content themselves with clandestine monthly meetings of the 'Hertha Society' in the back rooms of cafes. Soon, the boundaries between supporting a Western team in the East and becoming an outright political dissident became irrevocably blurred. Klopfleisch's activities attracted the attentions of the Stasi, who opened a file. '(Klopfleisch's) family tries to use all opportunities to experience Bundesliga teams live,' it warned ominously. Klopfleisch, resentful and more subversive by the day, began to extend his support for any Western club playing in the Eastern bloc; 'K. possesses a politically labile stance,' countered the file. Friendly 'discussions' soon turned into arrests; once, for presenting a toy Berlin bear to a bemused Franz Beckenbauer, and again, for sending a good-luck telegram to the West German team. Klopfleisch was allowed to emigrate in 1989. Months later, the Wall came down. He now watches Hertha, but with half the passion he felt during his years of ostracisation. It is a sad, grey story, a million miles from the screaming colours of Rio or the ticker-tape snowfalls of Buenos Aires, and on a different planet altogether from the commercial frenzy of the next four weeks; a football story, nonetheless.</p>

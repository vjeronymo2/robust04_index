This event will take place from 9:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 25, and Sunday, June 26, 1994, and will close all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius from the center of two fireworks barges anchored together 200 yards north of Pier 45, Manhattan, at a point approximately 1000 feet off the Manhattan shoreline. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the Hudson River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is effective from 9:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 25, and Sunday, June 26, 1994, unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port, New York. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> LT.

Interested persons were requested to submit comments by May 31, 1994. No comments were received. A public hearing was not requested during this comment period and one was not held. The Captain of the Port, New York is promulgating the temporary final rule as proposed. Good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication. Due to the length of the comment period deemed necessary to provide the public with adequate notice, there is insufficient time to publish this rule 30 days before the event. Making this rule effective in less than 30 days after publication is in the public interest as any delay would effectively cause cancellation of the event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 27, 1993, Heritage of Pride Incorporated submitted a request to hold a fireworks program in the Hudson River, New York. following the notice and comment period described above, the Captain of the Port, New York now promulgates this temporary final rule as proposed. The purpose of this regulation is to establish a safety zone in all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius from the center of two fireworks barges anchored together 200 yards north of Pier 45, Manhattan, at a point approximately 1000 feet off the Manhattan shoreline at or near 40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;44 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;07 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;N latitude and 074 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;01 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;03 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;W longitude. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting this small portion of the Hudson River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of the Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Although there is a regular flow of traffic through this area, there is not likely to be a significant impact on recreational or commercial traffic for several reasons. Due to the limited duration of the event, that the event is at a late hour, that extensive, advance advisories will be made to the maritime community so that mariners' plans may be adjusted accordingly, and that traffic can safely transit to the west of this safety zone, the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

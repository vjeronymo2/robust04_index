He stressed,  however, that the decision came late.    In an exclusive statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, 'Abd-al-Rashid  said: Most countries in the world, if not all, have companies  and offices that deal with foreign currencies in a regular way  and are subject to the control and supervision of the competent  authorities. It is difficult to predict the extent of the  success that will come from applying this decision, which every  citizen that cares for his people and nation wishes to see. We  are certain that the experience and insight of leaders of the  competent state agencies will ensure the success of this  decision, which will produce positive results for the national  economy and for all the parties that have an interest in the  decision.    He stressed that the primary indicator of the success of  this  decision will be the stabilization of the dinar's exchange rate.  He explained that the long-term objective of the decision is to  improve the exchange rate against foreign currencies so that we  can buy more for one Iraqi dinar than we can buy now.    Asked by AL-JUMHURIYAH about the reasons for the sharp  fluctuations in the exchange rate, the director of the Financial  Control Bureau said the main reason is the deliberate subversive  attempts carried out by foreign and domestic parties, who took  advantage of the circumstances of the unjust economic blockade  and the weak points of the Iraqi economy, which used to rely  heavily on oil exports and on importing commodities and services  from abroad. These parties, he said, succeeded in bringing about  fluctuations in the Iraqi dinar's exchange rate against the U.S.  dollar and other foreign currencies. They have also succeeded  in producing price hikes on commodities and services, thus  laying a heavy burden on the shoulders of citizens with limited  incomes.    He added that the remedy for the current inflation is based  on maintaining prices at their current level, or even bringing  them down to a lower, constant level, and on long-term action.  The action should start now to lower prices to the previous  levels in Iraq or to the international levels, as well as  keeping the inflation rate below 20 percent, as is the case in  advanced industrial countries.    Regarding the price hikes on commodities, Dahham  'Abd-al-Rashid said that they are due to speculation, gambling,  rumors, and psychological warfare staged against Iraqi citizens.  The main reason for price hikes, he said, is the low supply of  commodities compared to the demand and the purchasing power  created by the surplus cash liquidity. He said the imbalance  between the supply of commodities and the real demand is due to  the low output of local products of commodities and services,  including the industrial and agricultural products and so forth.  The imbalance is also due to the fact that Iraq has lost all of  its foreign currency assets and the revenues it used to make out  of its oil exports before 2 August 1990. Thus, the country lost  the ability to import basic commodities and services needed by  its citizens.    Dahham stressed that the solution requires increasing  production first, and then organizing the increase in real  income to correspond to the increase in production. He  explained that Iraq, from the 1970's, should have adopted an  organized policy of income and prices. Income is not limited to  wages and salaries, he said, but should also include profits and  their distribution, whether in individual enterprises or  companies. Taxes and other financial and monetary instruments  must be used to implement this policy to achieve a balance  between prices and incomes and improve their levels to ensure a  fair distribution of wealth among the various individuals,  groups, and segments of society.</p>

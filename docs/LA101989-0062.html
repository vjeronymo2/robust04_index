			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE SAYS THE NHL IS BECOMING A BIT DRAFTY  </P> <P> Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford Courant on the National Hockey League's waiver  draft: "It is designed to help weak teams. It is supposed to free young players  trapped in the minors.  </P> <P> "But the waiver draft actually is a used-car sale with only the lemons and aged  gas-guzzlers available. For a while, it was a way for teams to stock up on  goons at the last minute. Now that the NHL finally has taken steps to curb  brawling, even that avenue has dried up.  </P> <P> "Only about 10 players actually move each year. But if you are a veteran with a  wife, a kid starting the first grade, and own a home in the city you play in,  how would you feel? A player accepts the capriciousness of the trading game  when he enters hockey, but systematically uprooting guys two days before the  season to send them to Winnipeg often strikes one as inhumane.  </P> <P> "What the draft does is give general managers until the last minute to play  games with their rosters. It gives the media three days to write about how a  team no longer wants a fading player with a big salary. And, then, only a few  players actually move. It needlessly embarrasses professionals."  </P> <P> Face in the crowd: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, in a story on the  obscurity of the Capitals' lineup, conducted a random survey during which he  asked respondents to name two players on the club's roster.  </P> <P> Washington Redskin lineman Dexter Manley said he only knew two Capitals: "Rob  Langway, and that guy they shipped out, the guy whose father is an actor, the  guy who does Mazda commercials." James Garner? Manley nodded. You mean Mike  Gartner? "Yeah," he said, "isn't his dad an actor?"  </P> <P> Trivia time: What was the only National League team to win four consecutive  pennants?  </P> <P> Curtain call: Sandy Keenan of Newsday quotes Coach Lou Carnesecca of St. John's  on the Big East's experiment with six personal fouls instead of five for all  league basketball games this season: "Now we can keep them in until they get  three (first-half) fouls. It's like an insurance policy for the better players,  a luxury. Let's face it, we're in the entertainment business. People want to  see the best players."  </P> <P> Big Sky: After Idaho beat Northern Arizona, 41-31, on Oct. 7, the plane taking  the Vandals back to Idaho was forced to make an emergency landing at San  Francisco International Airport because of hydraulic problems.  </P> <P> Passengers braced for a crash landing, but the plane landed safely.  </P> <P> "We finally get a game where I don't lose too much hair and then I lose a bunch  on the flight home," Idaho Coach John Smith said.  </P> <P> Sole man: Said former Kentucky basketball coach Eddie Sutton, now working for  Nike: "I've talked to other people and they say how nice it would be to take a  year off from their regular job. That's basically what I'm doing."  </P> <P> Sutton's job includes watching practices and games involving college teams that  wear Nike shoes this season. But don't look for him at Kentucky; the Wildcats'  new coach, Rick Pitino, switched the team to Converse shoes.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The New York Giants, 1921 through 1924.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Portland State Coach Pokey Allen, on quarterback Darren Del'Andrae  of Calabasas: "Darren does a lot of things wrong. And most of them work." GARR  KLUENDER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Mr. Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of  Moldova, denied that relations between the Republic of Moldova  and Romania have cooled down of late. In an interview granted  to Radio Free Europe, he said that this idea, which is being  intensively aired, does not correspond with reality. We will  squash this idea very soon, President Snegur said.    Positively assessing the post-electoral social and political  situation in the Republic of Moldova, he said that it enabled  the country's leadership to start a dialogue with the Tiraspol  authorities. Referring to the issue of granting a special  status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester River,  President Snegur said that a possible draft bill in this respect  will take into consideration a decentralization and the  assignment of functions to local self-administration bodies, but  within the framework of a single state, the Republic of Moldova,  with a single constitution and foreign policy and a single Army  and police force. Mircea Snegur said that the negotiations will  be difficult, because the Dniester side insists upon the idea of  federalization or confederalization. He also emphasized the  need to solve all differences by political means.    At the same time, President Snegur reiterated that the  withdrawal of the 14th Army of the Russian Federation from the  territory of the Republic of Moldova should not be synchronized  with the granting of a special legal status to the rayons on the  left bank of the Dniester.    In the aforementioned interview, President Mircea Snegur  reiterated that, within the CIS bodies, the leadership of the  Republic of Moldova only participates in the discussion of  economic problems and does not participate in the discussion of  military issues.</p>

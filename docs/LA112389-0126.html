			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> CITY HALL PACKING FOR MOVE  </P> <P> City Hall employees have begun packing up to move one mile down the road to  temporary quarters.  </P> <P> On Dec. 1, the city clerk, city attorney, Engineering Department, Planning  Department and all other City Hall offices will be moved to portable buildings  at 4095 Overland Ave. while a new city hall is built. Office telephone numbers  will remain the same.  </P> <P> The move and interim quarters will cost $2.8 million, said Debbie Rich, deputy  director of redevelopment.  </P> <P> The $25-million building will occupy the sites of the present City Hall at 9770  Culver Blvd. and the adjacent fire station and a few residential properties,  Rich said. It is being paid for largely by city-issued bonds. The project is  expected to take about four years.  </P> <P> At 80,000 square feet, almost double the size of the existing City Hall, the  new building will be large enough to accommodate the Housing Department,  Redevelopment Agency and other offices that are now in other buildings. The old  building, constructed in the 1920s, is too small and considered structurally  and seismically unsafe.  </P> <P> Three architectural firms, competing to design the building, will submit plans  in February, Rich said.  </P></p>

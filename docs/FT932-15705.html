			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Dow Jones income up at Dollars 30.9m for quarter LOWER interest expenses and improved advertising revenue at the Wall Street Journal helped Dow Jones, the newspaper's owner, post net income of Dollars 30.9m in the first quarter, up from Dollars 16.1m a year ago. The comparable 1992 earnings, however, were affected by a restated one-off net charge of Dollars 10.8m, taken because of changes in accounting for taxes and employee post-retirement benefits. Excluding the special charge, Dow Jones' first-quarter earnings this year were up 15 per cent on 1992. Consolidated operating income for the first quarter rose 4.6 per cent to Dollars 65.3m, on revenues of Dollars 463.4m. Operating income from the company's business publications jumped 37.6 per cent to Dollars 31.8m. At the flagship Wall Street Journal, advertising lineage rose 5 per cent in the January-to-March period. Increased spending on technical product development, however, meant operating income from the information services division, which includes the Dow Jones/ Telerate electronic news service, fell 12.9 per cent to Dollars 34.5m. Earnings were also lower at Ottaway Newspapers, Dow Jones' regional community newspaper division, where income fell almost 6 per cent during the quarter to Dollars 3.7m. The company said that income at a number of Ottaway titles was hit by the big storm that struck large sections of the eastern US in mid-March.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 GOP CANDIDATES TRADE MUDSLINGING CHARGES;  </P> <P> POLITICS: 31ST STATE SENATE DISTRICT HOPEFUL FERGUSON ACCUSES ISLES OF SLANDER  IN MAILER. A PLEDGE NOT TO MAKE PERSONAL ATTACKS PROVES SHORT-LIVED.  </P> <P> Two Republican candidates in the 31st state Senate District race traded barbs  and allegations of misconduct Tuesday, accusing each other of mudslinging in a  hotly contested race entering its home stretch.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) kicked off the day's volleys with a  morning press conference during which he accused Brea City Councilman Ron  Isles, another Republican vying for the seat, of slandering him in a recent  mailing.  </P> <P> Ferguson has asked the local Republican Party to censure Isles, but the  councilman retorted by defending the mailing and saying that Ferguson had "shot  himself in the mouth."  </P> <P> The mailing, which describes Ferguson and another candidate, Assemblyman Frank  Hill (R-Whittier), as the "two best legislators that money can buy," states  that Ferguson is under investigation by the Fair Political Practices Commission  for mistakes he made in reporting 1987 campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Ferguson vigorously denied that he is under investigation, but FPPC spokeswoman  Sandra Michioku said Tuesday that the commission continues to have an  unresolved case against the assemblyman. She would not elaborate.  </P> <P> When told that the FPPC had confirmed the investigation, Ferguson's aides  produced a Dec. 4 letter indicating that the FPPC proposed fining Ferguson  $2,000 for allegedly failing to report in 1987 four contributions totaling  $10,000, including $1,500 in non-monetary contributions. The aides said  Ferguson intends to contest the proposed settlement.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ferguson has asked the Republican Party of Orange County to censure  Isles for the mailing and for violating a written pledge in which Republican  candidates agreed to refrain from personal attacks.  </P> <P> "If I'm going to abide by that pledge, I expect (my opponents) to abide by that  pledge," Ferguson said.  </P> <P> The Ethics Committee of the county Republican Party has scheduled a meeting  tonight to review Ferguson's request for censure. The committee can recommend  censure or other disciplinary action if Isles is found to have violated the  pledge, said Greg Haskin, the party's executive director.  </P> <P> Isles quickly launched a broadside of his own.  </P> <P> "I never cease to be amazed at the mental processes that go on in some people,"  Isles said. He supplied voluminous documents -- newspaper and magazine articles  -- to support most of the claims he makes in his mailing and said the  allegation that Ferguson is under investigation by the FPPC came from FPPC  officials themselves.  </P> <P> Isles drew a distinction between a "hit piece" and one "pointing out a person's  record."  </P> <P> "After all, we're not selling soap here," he said.  </P> <P> Eight candidates are vying for the state Senate seat in the 31st District,  which includes parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties and was vacated in  December when Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) resigned. The special  election has been set for Feb. 6, but most experts predict that none of the  candidates will win an outright majority, so a runoff election is expected on  April 10.  </P></p>

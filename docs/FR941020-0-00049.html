			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA provides notice of its approval of State programs in 40 CFR part 272, and incorporates by reference therein the State statutes and regulations that it will enforce under section 3008 of RCRA. This effort will provide clearer notice to the public of the authorized program in Arizona. Such notice is particularly important in light of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), Public Law 98&hyph;618. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal statutory or regulatory authority is modified. Because HSWA extensively amended RCRA, State programs must be modified to reflect those amendments. By incorporating by reference the authorized Arizona program and by amending the Code of Federal Regulations whenever a new or different set of requirements is authorized in Arizona, the status of Federally approved requirements of the Arizona program will be readily discernible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will only incorporate by reference for enforcement purposes those provisions of the Arizona hazardous waste management program for which authorization approval has been granted by EPA. Concerning HSWA, some State requirements may be similar to HSWA requirements that are in effect under Federal statutory authority in that State. However, a State's HSWA-type requirements are not authorized and will not be codified into the CFR until the Regional Administrator publishes her final decision to authorize the State for specific HSWA requirements. Until such time, EPA will enforce the HSWA requirements and not the State analogs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Arizona Authorized Hazardous Waste Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To incorporate by reference the Arizona authorized hazardous waste program, EPA has added Subpart D to 40 CFR part 272. The State statutes and regulations are incorporated by reference at 40 CFR 272.151(b)(1); and the Memorandum of Agreement, the Attorney General's Statement and the Program Description are referenced at 40 CFR 272.151(b) (4), (5), and (6), respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency retains the authority under sections 3007, 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA to undertake enforcement actions in authorized States. With respect to such enforcement actions, the Agency will rely on Federal sanctions, Federal inspection authorities, and the Federal Administrative Procedure Act rather than the State authorized analogs to these requirements. Therefore, the Agency does not intend to incorporate by reference for purposes of enforcement such particular, authorized Arizona enforcement authorities. Section 272.151(b)(2) lists those authorized Arizona authorities that are part of the authorized program but are not incorporated by reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some provisions of the State's hazardous waste management program are not part of the Federally authorized State program. These non-authorized provisions are not part of the RCRA Subtitle C program because they are ``broader in scope'' than RCRA Subtitle C (see 40 CFR 271.1(i)). As a result, State provisions which are ``broader in scope'' than the Federal program are not incorporated by reference for purposes of enforcement in 40 CFR part 272. Section 272.151(b)(3) of 40 CFR lists for reference and clarity the Arizona statutory and regulatory provisions which are ``broader in scope'' than the Federal program and which are not, therefore, part of the authorized program being incorporated by reference today. ``Broader in scope'' provisions will not be enforced by EPA; the State, however, will continue to enforce such provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1987, Arizona renumbered its hazardous waste statutes while transferring the statutes from Title 36, Arizona Revised Statutes, to Title 49, Arizona Revised Statutes. The table immediately below provides the analogs between the former and renumbered provisions of the Arizona hazardous waste statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

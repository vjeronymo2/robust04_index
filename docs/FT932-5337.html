			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Headteachers slam ministers' pay policy THE National Association of Head Teachers yesterday condemned the government's approach to public-sector pay as 'inequitable, short-sighted and potentially damaging'. But concern surfaced at the association's conference at Newcastle upon Tyne about delegates' hostile reception to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, on Wednesday. Delegates were alarmed by the morning's press coverage, much of which was strongly unfavourable. Mr Peter Baldwin, a former president of the association, suggested that dignified silence would have been more effective than jeers and hisses. 'I'm a believer in silence speaking volumes.' But others felt it was justified. Mrs Patricia Moss, head of an infant school in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said Lord Joseph when education secretary had been greeted by silence and had regarded it as a 'warm reception'. Head teachers were also pleased to have demonstrated to their staff that they opposed Mr Patten's stance on the publication of school-by-school 'league tables'. Mrs Diane Darwin, a NAHT member from Newcastle upon Tyne, said an adverse reaction from the more rightwing newspapers could be expected, but that heads would now find it much easier to work with the support of their staff. Mr David Hart, NAHT general secretary, emphasised that an article written by Mr Patten for yesterday's Financial Times left the gap between the sides on league tables as wide as ever. 'Clearly the government has the right to know whether quality is being delivered by the state education system. But the key issue is whether we have to arrive at the conclusion that we have to do that using league tables. 'The NAHT is categorically of the opinion that we do not. There are other ways in which the information can be sent to government without using crude league tables.' The Secondary Heads Association will decide next week whether to follow the NAHT policy of advising its members to call on governors not to forward league table information to the Department for Education. The SHA said: 'We are not convinced that the raw statistics in these tables tell parents what they need to know.'</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (9): Mobile phones, the weight of things to come - John Williamson looks at an area where the UK is in the forefront of technological developments WHEN they were launched in the UK in 1987, portable cellular telephones cost over Pounds 2,500 apiece. They were brick-like in size and sorely lacking in visual charm. As such, their appeal was largely limited to those whose business and professional lives depended on the ability to make and receive calls when a wireline telephone was not to hand. Today, the unit retail price of a portable telephone is generally below Pounds 300, and can be very much lower if the product is subsidised by a network or service provider. Average dimensions have shrunk to those of a typical video cassette recorder remote control. Leading manu- facturers such as Motorola and Nokia are now talking of terminals as fashion access- ories of the future, with user-changeable colours and shapes. Unusually for practically any field of endeavour, the UK is at the forefront of developments in this technology worldwide, thanks in large part to the Thatcher government's creation of a highly competitive market regulatory regime. In the popular imagination cellular phones are closely identified with the go-getting 1980s, being one of the essential accoutrements of the young and upwardly mobile. The first UK cellular pilot system was installed by Cellnet to support a world economic summit held in London in 1984. Thereafter, car phones and transportable terminals quickly lost ground in popularity to devices which could be carried in a briefcase or handbag. At present, says Mr Mike Short, Cellnet's director of external affairs, portables account for around 60 per cent of the 1.75m mobile telephones in use in the UK, and up to 80 per cent of all new sales. The latter compares with a figure of around 45 per cent for the US, the birthplace of cellular telephony. Over the last few years technological advances have resulted in analogue cellular telephones which, in the case of Motorola's MicroTAC II, weigh in at as little as 167 grams. Size-wise, a new model being launched by Sony this month has, at 64.2mm x 85.5mm x 24.4mm, virtually the same dimensions as a pack of playing cards. In spite of dramatic reductions in mass and price, national penetration rates for cellular telephones remain modest in the extreme. In the UK, cellular ownership amounts to no more than three phones per 100 head of population. Even Sweden, with the world's highest density of mobile telephones, has only 8.6 units for every 100 inhabitants. In reality, the overwhelming majority of cell phone users are still drawn from the ranks of the business and prof- essional communities. But this is set to change, and a move from what Motorola terms 'the classes to the masses' is already in progress in many parts of the developed world. This enlargement of the cellular industry's remit is due to three main factors: The established corporate and commercial market is approaching saturation in some locations. Additional competition is entering the cellular arena in some countries such as the UK, Germany and the US. While the so-called personal communication network (PCN) operators will inevitably attack some of the incumbent cellular operators' customer base, to survive they will have to grow the market constituency overall. The advent of digital cellular provides a means to support true mass market subscriber populations for the first time. As a rule of thumb, digital networks can accom- modate around 10 times more subscribers than their analogue counterparts for a given chunk of radio spectrum. This new environment presents the phone manufacturers with some stiff challenges. As is generally acknowledged, portable phones of all types will need to become even less obtrusive then at present. The ideal, says Mr Bob Weisshappel, senior vice president and general manager of Motorola's worldwide cellular subscriber group, is to make terminals 'wearable' to the point where users carry them as naturally as they now do pens or watches. This does not necessarily mean drastically smaller terminals since there are certain fixed values for 'face- and finger-friendliness' to be taken into account. Motorola, the world's leading cellular phone vendor with around 30 per cent of the market, believes that terminal weight will be of more consequence than size. However Nokia, the second largest supplier with 20 per cent of the global business, reckons that weight reduction can reach a point of diminishing returns. Mr Anssi Vanjoki, vice president of sales at Nokia Mobile Phones, cites market research which indicates that, below a certain mass, there is a reluctance to pay a premium for further weight reduction. 'It doesn't feel like it's worth the money you paid for it,' he says. However, there is a consensus that the larger and heavier digital cell phones now appearing on the market will have to slim down in record time to the size and weight of the best case analogue telephones currently available. 'Whenever you come out with something that's new, it will always be compared with what is already there,' says Mr Weisshappel. 'That's the standard market reference.' With volume sales of digital terminals, industry calculates that pricing should likewise be comparable. 'It's called when,' says Mr Weisshappel. Greater simplicity of operation will be another factor shaping the cell phone business of the future. 'To really hit the mass market, the phone has to be simple to use and easy to understand,' says Mr Don Burns, general manager and vice-president of Motorola's European cellular subscriber division. Continuing the VCR remote control analogy, Mr Peter Radley, Alcatel's vice president for mobile communications, says that many phones currently on the market virtually require the application of low-level programming skills before their full functional repertoire can be accessed. Devoting resources to build capabilities which are not used instead of using resources to build facilities which are is a lost cost. 'It doesn't take the industry forward as far as it might go,' he argues. It is now also an article of faith in the mobile business that the dawning of consumer cellular will be attended by a sizeable proliferation in the variety and types of terminal offered for sale. This will be a consequence partly of the need to accommodate the huge number of user profiles resident in the consumer sector. 'If the phone is going to be with you all the time, and be of value to you, it's got to fit your life-style,' comments Mr Radley, 'and all our life-styles are different.' Sometimes, as in the case of Swatch's deal to brand-name Nokia equipment, companies outside the mobile field will try their hand at popularising the mobile phone. Further stimulating product variety will be the desire by both incumbent and incoming operators to differentiate their services. A current example of this is the One-2-One PCN phone built by Motorola with styling, including a distinctive 'thumb print' master control button, contributed by the operator Mercury. It is clear though, that the convenience, utility and styling of the portable phone are only one part of the mass market story. Four years ago a survey in the US revealed that terminal price was a key consideration in the decision to subscribe to a cellular service. This is unlikely to be true today in many places. Current and would-be subscribers are now aware of, and concerned about, the relatively high cost of actually using a mobile phone. Initiatives such as off-peak, domestic and volume discounts are designed to address these concerns, and in the UK service provider The People's Phone will discontinue outgoing calls once a limit agreed beforehand with the customer is reached. In the final analysis, though, cheaper calls are needed across the board to spark a true mass mobile revolution. 'They're definitely required to take the market to its next level of maturity,' concludes Motorola's Mr Burns. The writer is senior editor of Global Telephony magazine</p>

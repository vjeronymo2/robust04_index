			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ford's petition indicates that its proposed change to the language of S6.2(d) would consistently locate the test place one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening, thereby reducing test variability and ensuring that the test plate is positioned ahead of the roof's leading edge. NHTSA notes that while this would position the test plate over the leading edge of the roof, it would not necessarily load the roof at the rearmost windshield opening. Ford's proposed change retained the same test plate angles currently specified in Standard No. 216, which means the initial contact point for the test plate on the roof would be the same as at present. In other words, it appears to NHTSA that Ford's proposal would ensure the consistent orientation of the test plate over the front of the roof, but would not ensure that area of the roof would be tested. Further, the agency is uncertain whether the proposed test plate positioning one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening would be an improved test for all vehicles with uncommon roof shapes or whether it would reduce the stringency of the current test procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Areas in Which the Public's Ideas and Information Are Requested <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is interested in comments on the changes requested in both the Ford and RVIA petitions. Therefore, the agency is seeking from all interested parties comments on the two proposals along with any available test data to substantiate or refute those proposals. The agency is also interested in other ways to accommodate aerodynamically sloped and raised roof vehicles. For instance, should the angles at which the test plate is applied and/or the size and shape of the test plate itself be changed? If the plate size were reduced or if the plate shape were changed to circular, the test plate could be placed over the A-pillar region on raised roof vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 216 currently provides that the test plate shall be angled 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; toward the front of the vehicle, when viewed from the side of the test vehicle. This angle could be changed sufficiently to ensure the test plate would contact the A-pillar region, with the new angle based on an analysis of real world crashes and roof geometries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is also interested in any other approaches the public might wish to suggest in this area. As always, the most helpful comments will be those that set forth data to substantiate the position taken in the comment. NHTSA would like to alert commenters that the agency will not propose any changes to Standard No. 216 test procedures until the agency is satisfied that data and analysis show the changes will not reduce real world safety protection for vehicle occupants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Submission of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments in response to this request for comments.

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / The Long View: Damaging your wealth INVESTMENT regulation is having a hard time. This week's latest problems included attacks by big pension schemes on the compensation proposals of the National Association of Pension Funds; and protests by small investors in Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance, a friendly society in a mess. The bigger picture is that attempts by retail investment institutions and brokers to restructure their regulatory organisations into a single body, called the Personal Investment Authority, are quite likely to prove abortive. Senior industry figures are calling for a tougher statutory framework, cutting back on the self-regulatory approach. The new investor protection framework, embodied in the Financial Services Act 1986, began as a simple way of looking after private investors following small scandals such as the Norton Warburg collapse of 1981. But it soon became complicated as the government became concerned about the Big Bang stock market restructuring, and the legislation was extended to take in professional wholesale markets as well as investment retailing. Ironically, the wholesale side works quite well, but retail regulation is a minefield. Hard cases make bad law, and investor protection legislation is too often driven by the reflex reactions of politicians to queues of impoverished demonstrators outside the houses of parliament. Whether Barlow Clowes investors or Maxwell pension scheme members or BCCI depositors or Lloyd's Names, they will have hired the best lawyers and some pushy public relations advisers. The short-termist solution is always to give them the money. But, inevitably, there will be another queue along soon. Somebody must accept the risk within the system. Investors who seek above-average returns must understand that they accept above-average risks. Any regulator, meanwhile, must make it crystal-clear where the limits of his responsibility lie. But there is much ignorance here. The public cannot really understand the difference between regulation and providing a guarantee. The Bank of England, for instance, operates a statutory regulation framework which assists honestly-run banks to operate more safely because they must observe certain prudential ratios and rules. On the other hand, dishonest banks can fool regulators with phoney figures, as BCCI did. To protect the public against fraud, however, is vastly more ambitious. In the end, it can be achieved only by the imposition of a draconian rulebook; the risks will have been nationalised. To a large extent this has happened already because it is inconceivable that a major British bank would be allowed to fail. This argument over compensation is now causing turmoil among occupational pension schemes. There is a recognition by the pensions industry that, in the wake of the Maxwell disaster, there should be a pre-emptive response to the politicians. The NAPF has sent a discussion document to members. The immediate question is: why should sound schemes bail out those that are run badly? The answer is that even good schemes will depend for their continued existence upon minimum levels of security; otherwise, they may soon have few members left. The greatest internal protest, however, has been generated by the suggestion from the NAPF's council that there should be compensation for bad investment performance as well as fraud. There is an obvious concern that unscrupulous employers would be encouraged to adopt highly risky investment strategies. Compensation rows are also at the heart of the financial difficulties of Fimbra, the regulator of independent financial advisers. Fimbra members have imposed a disproportionate burden on the Investors' Compensation Scheme, the industry-wide arrangement which also covers life company salesmen and stock exchange firms. Again, a subtle shift in the basis for compensation has taken place. Early claims on the scheme were dominated by the misdeeds of crooks like the jailed Robert Miller, whose victims at Dunsdale Securities received Pounds 5m. But now the emphasis is on the victims of salesmen of home equity plans, schemes which were designed to convert pensioners' house values safely into extra income during their remaining lifetimes but which, in thousands of cases went horribly wrong, putting their homes at risk. Nobody exactly ran off with their money, but the pensioners argue that they were sold unsuitable plans and should be compensated. If this principle is accepted widely by the courts, the cost could be vast. Ultimately, this unwillingness by individuals to accept responsibility for their investment decisions could force a restructuring of the whole investment industry. Until now, the UK has been notable for the large number of its investment institutions and the rapid rate of innovation of products. But the logic now is that we will move in the direction of the German framework, in which a comparatively small number of giant institutions are dominant. Product innovation and new companies are generally frowned upon (Germany has tried to insist upon very large minimum capital requirements during the negotiations over the EC's Investment Services Directive). In these circumstances, investment clients gain great security but get poor choice and value for their money. If we are not to go in this direction, the public must receive an education in risk. This will hardly be welcomed by the investment industry. Your shiny new car does not come with a breakdown warning. Financial health warnings are not regarded positively by life insurance marketing men. But they may provide the only way out. In the end, we all have to accept part of the risks ourselves. To cope with them, we will have to modify our behaviour. To give you an example which the members of the NAPF will hate, it might be prudent to be a member of two or three pension schemes rather than one. Just in case.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: English China makes Dollars 45.4m chemicals buy English China Clays, the minerals and chemicals group, is making its first acquisition since its decision earlier this year to demerge Camas, its construction materials arm, and expand the speciality chemicals division In the first stage of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m) acquisition strategy, the group said it was paying Dollars 45.4m for EZE Products, the US supplier of speciality chemicals to the paper and surface-treatment industries. The deal will strengthen ECC's presence in the North American chemicals industry, where it established a foothold last year with the Pounds 202m acquisition of Calgon, the former Merck subsidiary. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, predicted the group would also make a similar sized purchase in continental Europe, although a deal was not imminent. 'We're pleased to get a decent size acquisition under our belts, and we will now focus the business on production for the paper industry,' he said. City analysts, however, said the move looked expensive given that EZE's net assets were valued at Dollars 7.4m, a sixth of the purchase price, at the end of last year. 'On a pro forma basis, it would have made a negligible profit contribution,' said one analyst. 'Chemicals will remain only a small part of ECC, and I think it will be 1996 before we see a sizeable profits increase from speciality chemicals.' EZE last year made profits of Dollars 1.2m, before tax and interest, on turnover of Dollars 33.7m. In the same period, Calgon contributed Pounds 7.2m to ECC's Pounds 105.2m operating profits. Mr Teare, however, said the business would not only improve ECC's exposure to the fast-growing paper chemicals market, but would give it an important presence on the west coast and in the southern US. The company would also achieve annual cost savings of Dollars 3.1m following its integration into Calgon, he added. Although Calgon's paper operations will be relocated from Pittsburgh to EZE's manufacturing base in South Carolina, the new subsidiary was warned that up to 20 per cent of its 235 staff would be made redundant. The acquisition is being funded from cash resources, and is expected to push net borrowings up to Pounds 190m for gearing of about 35 per cent. It is expected to use further borrowing to finance its next chemicals acquisition, but gearing should remain modest while ECC continues to sell its land bank, which is worth up to Pounds 70m at present market prices. Analysts applauded the industrial logic behind the diversification into speciality chemicals, but predicted it could be earnings dilutive in the short-term. The shares closed down 2p at 365p.</p>

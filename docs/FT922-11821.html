			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / English school-leavers prefer employment to study ENGLISH school-leavers would rather get a job than train for qualifications, unlike their German counterparts, according to a study by the Anglo-German Foundation. A research project funded by the foundation compared the career routes of 160 young people aged 16 to 19 in Bremen and Paderborn, Germany, with their peers in Liverpool and Swindon. The Germans, whether they had left education or not, saw themselves as students or apprentices and postponed entry into jobs at least two years later than their English counterparts. The English saw Youth Training, the training scheme for 16 to 18-year-olds, as a poor alternative to a job and placed little value on vocational qualifications. 'Jobs in England paid, on average, twice the YT allowance, so there was little incentive to complete training once a job became available,' said Professor John Bynner of City University in the foundation's newsletter. 'There was much movement in and out of jobs, unemployment and training schemes, especially in Swindon, where jobs were plentiful.' In contrast the Germans knew it was necessary to complete an apprenticeship because entry to a trade was impossible without qualifications. The English expressed more confidence in their ability to get jobs and retain them, even if that meant moving away from home. Germans felt more uncertain about their future. Prof Bynner said reform and improvement was needed in both countries. The German system needed to be more flexible to give young people a wider range of occupational experience and the English system needed to regulate entry into employment more effectively and build more educational and general training experience into employment.

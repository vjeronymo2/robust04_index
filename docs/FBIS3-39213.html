			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov in Brussels on </F> Zhelev's news conference before his departure for Sofia -- live  or recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] President Zhelev signed a framework  agreement on cooperation with NATO in Brussels today. Before  departing for Bulgaria, he gave a news conference for Bulgarian  and foreign journalists. Let us hear the following report by  our West Europe correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov.    [Vladkov] The Bulgarian president described the signing of  the Partnership for Peace [PFP] agreement as an essential  element in a very important process. He described the agreement  as an introductory stage to the future integration of Bulgaria  and the other East European countries as full members, on the  one hand, and as the beginning of NATO's transformation into a  collective, continental security structure, on the other hand.    The agreement is a challenge for speeding up the reforms in  our country under a military-political aspect and under purely  economic and social aspects. However, it is also a challenge  for NATO in connection with the adjustment of the organization  to the new realities in Europe and the world in the direction of  a universal collective security structure, rather than in the  direction of isolated military-political blocs.    Dwelling on the crisis in Yugoslavia and on the war in  Bosnia, President Zhelev pointed out as follows: The conflicts  in the immediate vicinity of our border are directly challenging  our national security and are causing immeasurable difficulties  for our economic reform, because of the international sanctions.    Nevertheless, Bulgaria's policy remains well-intentioned,  peace-loving, and based on moral principles. I am sure that all  civilized, democratic countries will duly appreciate it.</p>

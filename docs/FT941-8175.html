			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Making up Just how far will US President Bill Clinton go to mend fences when he meets Britain's prime minister next week? After the rows over Ireland and Bosnia, there is plenty of groundwork in need of urgent repair. An invitation to sleep for one night in the White House sounds jolly generous, especially since the last British prime minister to do it was Sir Winston Churchill. But the US administration's eagerness to rebuild the special relationship has its limits - notably supporting the UK's nominee for the head of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Major put Lord Lawson up for the job, but word is that Washington, which picks up much of the tab for the Pounds 125,000-a-year post, is preparing to veto that idea. The Americans believe that the OECD, after a decade in the hands of the monetarists, would benefit from a secretary-general who made economic growth, not obsessive control of inflation, his priority. Clearly no one told them about the Lawson boom.</p>

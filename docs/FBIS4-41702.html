			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Pachegina report in the "Northern Caucasus" column: </F> "Galazov and Aushev Have Signed an Accord. Today 12,000 Ingushi  Live in North Ossetia"]    [Excerpt] Although, contrary to Ruslan Aushev's wishes,  the document signed the evening of 26 June in Beslan,  (Vladikavkaz Airport) "On Procedures for the Return of Refugees  and Forced Resettlers to Places of their Former Residence," did  not become a full-scale treaty "resolving all the urgent  problems between North Ossetia and Ingushetia," it definitely  not only filled a temporary pause in the Vladikavkaz-Nazran  dialogue but, with both sides willing, can be accepted as  guidance for action.    Coordinated in detail at the level of conciliation  commissions from both republics and with the participation of  officials from the Provisional Administration, the document  envisions an extended preparatory stage, part of which, it needs  to be recognized, has already been completed: Lists have been  made up of Ingushi citizens who earlier lived in North Ossetia  (the starting point is 31 October 1992 or -- here Vladikavkaz  showed flexibility -- on the basis of any other documents  confirming residence registration in the republic). Public  security on resettlement territories is entrusted to the forces  attached to the Provisional Administration and the Internal  Affairs Ministry of North Ossetia. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  correspondent was told, if any of the newly arriving Ingushi  citizens express the wish to join North Ossetian law enforcement  bodies, this wish will be granted immediately. The problem of  "screening" -- so painful in the previous talks -- has been  resolved quite happily in the document: The sides agreed that  the return of the refugees must not depend on the presence of  criminal elements among them, while the extent of their guilt  will be established by the relevant bodies.    Under the document signed, development of the social  infrastructure in Prigorodnyy Rayon villages is to begin on 1  July. The first to return to their homes will be the owners of  houses that are still intact. The "prime contractor" will be  the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations; its  representatives will ensure the building of temporary structures  for people who lost their homes and property to fire. In  accordance with the agreement, work related to the return of  Ingushi citizens will be financed by federal power bodies which,  as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent understands, have not up  to now unduly forced their attention on either side.  Coordination (transportation, communication, and escorting) has  been assigned to a special department formed in the Provisional  Administration, which is to draw up a schedule for the  transportation of citizens by 5 July.    Vladikavkaz hopes that the newly arriving Ingushi citizens  will not only recognize the republic's territorial integrity and  its laws and renounce any attempts to propagate interethnic  strife, but will also show an example of obeying the law to all  other citizens of North Ossetia. According to statistical  reports by the Republic of North Ossetia, since November 1992,  12,000 Ingushi have retuned to the republic for permanent  residence. [passage omitted]</p>

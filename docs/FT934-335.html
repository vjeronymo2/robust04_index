			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Fiddles' in jobless statistics Sir, The renewed line in official unemployment - those unemployed and claiming benefit - in recent months has enabled government spokesmen to rubbish all talk of administrative fiddles, which greeted the initial downturn in unemployment in March. Such 'fiddles' could result from the targets set the employment service in respect of both inflows on to and outflows from the claimant count. Food for thought, however, is provided by the recently published results of this summer's household-based labour force survey, which estimates unemployment using an entirely different approach based on internationally agreed guidelines; the so-called International Labour Organisation unemployed are those without a job, who were available to start work during the two weeks following their LFS interview and had looked for work during the previous four. One result is that ILO unemployment, seasonally adjusted, rose between spring and summer, when claimant unemployment was falling. Of even greater interest is the divergent movement in the two components of ILO unemployment. The number of ILO unemployed claimants (those unemployed on both definitions) has fallen by the same extent as the official claimant count. On the other hand, the numbers of ILO unemployed non-claimants - those who are ILO unemployed but are eligible for benefit - rose by 130,000 between spring and summer. Although these figures are not seasonally adjusted, ILO unemployed non-claimants now stand at 1.08m - the highest since the series began in 1983. The divergent behaviour of these two components of ILO unemployment may mean that it is premature to dismiss talk of administrative fiddles affecting the value of the claimant count either as an indicator of labour market performance or as a measure of social welfare.

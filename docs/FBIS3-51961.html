			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 27  January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item:    The U.S. company CDE Chilean Mining Corporation, a  subsidiary  of Coeur d'Alene Mines, signed a contract with the Chilean  Government for the investment of $52 million in a project to tap  gold and silver deposits in Fachinal, a village in the 11th  Region. Commercial production is expected to begin during the  first half of 1995. It is estimated that daily production will  be 1,500 metric tons. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 13 Jan 94  p 6)    The National State Railroad Company announced that it will  put its freight subsidiary up for bids. Ignacio Echavarria,  chairman of the National State Railroad Company, explained that  the objective is to decentralize the national railroad system,  improve its facilities, and expedite operations. The subsidiary  was created in 1993 to handle freight in central and southern  Chile. Echavarria stated that both Chilean and foreign  investors will be able to bid for 51 percent of the subsidiary's  shares, adding that this is the first and probably the only  privatization of a sound and operational company that will be  carried out under the current administration. The bidding terms  will be available on 31 January. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa  Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 22 Jan 94)</p>

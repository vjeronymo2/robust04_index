			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: ALL GOOD AD CAMPAIGNS MUST COME TO AN END SOMEDAY -- BUT WHEN?  </P> <P> For a couple years, the "dancing" California raisins seemed invincible, didn't  they? Those rhythmic raisins ranked among the best-loved ads in the business.  The raisins boogied across everything from pencils to pennants to pajama tops.  </P> <P> But today, the raisin rage has all but dried up. Domestic raisin sales are off.  And the campaign no longer even ranks among the nation's Top 10. "We can see  the popularity of what they do has been waning," said Clyde Nef, manager of the  Fresno-based California Raisin Advisory Board. "Things like Batman and the  Ninja Turtles really jumped in as replacements."  </P> <P> So what's a wrinkled raisin to do? That is the question that the California  Raisin Advisory Board will ask itself this week. Should it banish the raisins  to the advertising graveyard? Or is there a way to salvage the familiar image  and use it in a fresh way?  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Isuzu announced that it was putting the slicked-back liar  "Joe Isuzu" out to pasture. And one recent poll even suggests that the macho  Marlboro Man is slipping noticeably in popularity. Eventually, the creators of  all successful ad campaigns must ask themselves this agonizing question: When  do you pull the plug on a popular campaign?  </P> <P> "You don't want to blow it by killing a campaign too soon," said Peter  Stranger, president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS,  the agency that created the "liar" campaign for American Isuzu Motor Co. nearly  four years ago. "The only thing worse than that is keeping a campaign for too  long."  </P> <P> In fact, Isuzu officials debated killing the "liar" campaign for nearly three  years before making the fateful decision a few weeks ago. "Every year we looked  at the campaign with and without Joe," said Stranger. Now, with plans to  introduce three new vehicles in the fall, Isuzu officials decided that, while  the Joe Isuzu character is great at getting people to remember the Isuzu name,  he isn't so hot at selling product attributes.  </P> <P> Rick Carpenter, the guy who invented Joe Isuzu, isn't at the agency anymore.  But Carpenter, now senior creative director at the Los Angeles office of DDB  Needham Worldwide, agrees that it was probably time for Joe to go.  </P> <P> "It's kind of sad. A chapter is closing in advertising," said Carpenter, who  got the idea for Isuzu while in a conference with two other agency executives.  "But this has to happen to every great campaign." The real problem the car  maker now faces is how to follow an act such as Joe Isuzu. "It's not easy to  come up with a memorable hook that puts you in the Top 10," Carpenter said.  </P> <P> Sometimes, executives say, when the copywriter or artist who created a popular  ad theme leaves an agency, there is no one left to really fight for it. At  other times, the popularity alone of a commercial character is enough to keep  it alive. For example, Gerald McGee, managing director of the Los Angeles  office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, adapted the Pink Panther character for  Owens-Corning Fiberglas more than a decade ago.  </P> <P> At the time, he worked at Ogilvy's New York office. "I can't imagine someone  coming to my door and telling me the panther has been painted out of the  picture," he said. "I'd feel like a member of my family was taken away."  </P> <P> About four years ago, American Express dropped its often-quoted campaign "Do  you know me?" and replaced it with the current "Membership has its privileges."  That, however, was a very tough decision for the client -- -- and the agency.  "There was a feeling, borne out by research, that 'Do You Know Me?' wasn't  doing as good a job as it had been," said Robert Neuman, senior vice president  and creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather's New York office, which created  both campaigns. "But it was obviously painful leaving it."  </P> <P> Far less painful was the decision by Jack in the Box in 1980 to literally blow  its familiar clown to smithereens in a TV commercial. "Blowing up the clown was  a very clear symbol that things were changing at Jack in the Box," said Howard  Cohen, chairman of the Los Angeles ad agency Cohen/Johnson, which continues to  create ads for the fast-food chain. "When you're up against the McDonald's of  the world, you have to do something different."  </P> <P> Would Marlboro ever give the Marlboro Man the heave-ho? Not any time soon. But  a snout-nosed camel with a goofy grin appears to have knocked him off his high  horse. Camel's cartoon-like "Smooth Character" was the best remembered  cigarette print ad campaign of 1989, according to a survey of 24,000 people by  the New York research firm, Video Storyboard Tests.  </P> <P> In 1983 and 1984, Marlboro ranked as the No. 1 print ad campaign, according to  Video Storyboard. By 1985, it had dropped to No. 3, and in 1989, it fell to No.  5. A Philip Morris spokesman, Andrew White, said Marlboro won't drop the macho  cowboy. "Marlboro's share of the market continues to grow," White said. "That's  the only consumer survey that counts."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ad Agencies Jumping Through NBA Hoops  </P> <P> The National Basketball Assn. is playing hoops with several West Coast  agencies.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, NBA officials have had discussions with West Coast agencies  about creating TV spots for the league when it switches from CBS to NBC next  season.  </P> <P> "The project is being generated by our new network agreement with NBC," said  Judy Shoemaker, vice president of marketing for the NBA. She said the NBA has  interviewed agencies nationwide, even though the league is still undecided if  it will hire any of them. She declined to name any of the West Coast agencies  under consideration. But industry executives say the two Los Angeles agencies,  Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates and Chiat/Day/Mojo, as well as San Francisco  agency Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein, are all under consideration.  </P> <P> Said one top agency executive, "On an account like this, it's not the money  that matters, it's the exposure. Imagine what you could do for a client like  this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mendelsohn/Zien Tunes in KABC Radio  </P> <P> As radio stations increasingly advertise in other media, their ad business has  become more coveted. Last week, Mendelsohn/Zien Advertising won one of the most  sought-after radio accounts in Los Angeles: the $2-million KABC TalkRadio AM  790 account.  </P> <P> The win is a big one for the agency, which recently lost the $5-million Acura  Advertising Assn. of Southern California business. Although Western  International Media will continue to buy media time for the station,  Mendelsohn/Zien will create ads and help devise a marketing strategy.  </P> <P> "We hope to bring a more consistent and concentrated marketing program to the  station," said Richard Zien, president of the agency. The Shalek Agency  formerly created ads for KABC.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, KABC executives hope the advertising helps to boost ratings. "L.A.  is probably the most competitive radio market in the country," said George  Green, president and general manager of KABC. "Advertising can make a  significant difference."Bonos in This 'Bo Knows' Spot?  </P> <P> Bo knows Bo. That, at least, is the theme of the next Nike TV commercial  starring the sports superstar. It will air next month during the Wimbledon  tennis tournament.  </P> <P> In the commercial, Jackson -- who plays a number of roles -- keeps running into  athletes who look like him. In fact, they are him. Among those he comes across  are a surfboard-toting Bo, who greets him with, "Hey, dude." Then, there's the  croquet-playing Bo who greets him with a distinctly British accent.  </P> <P> But perhaps the most unexpected appearance in the spot is by Sonny Bono, the  former singer and mayor of Palm Springs. When Bo asks Bono what he's doing in  the commercial, Bono replies, "I thought this was another 'Bo Knows' (Bonos)  commercial."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experts to Debate Advertising Morality  </P> <P> How much advertising is hogwash? The answer depends on whom you ask. Next week,  the advertising industry's chief spokesman will debate "Morality in  Advertising" with the person some say could be the industry's most vociferous  critic.  </P> <P> At the Beverly Hilton Hotel, at noon on June 27, the Advertising Club of Los  Angeles will sponsor a debate between John O'Toole, president of the American  Assn. of Advertising Agencies, and Bruce Silverglade, legal affairs director of  the Washington-based lobby, Center for Science in the Public Interest. The  debate, which will be broadcast on KABC TalkRadio, will also be moderated by  on-air personality Michael Jackson.  </P></p>

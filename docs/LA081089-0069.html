			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: HANDLE TOMATOES WITH KID GLOVES  </P> <P> Tomatoes aren't something most of us would dream of microwaving. Yet they  microwave just fine if given kid-glove care.  </P> <P> If you intend to microwave fresh tomato halves, be sure to choose those that  are of medium size (about six ounces apiece) and are firm-ripe. Juicier  tomatoes will simply disintegrate.  </P> <P> Of course, there's no point in microwaving tasteless tomatoes, the kind that  are bred more for firmness than flavor then picked green, packaged in plastic  and shipped cross-country.  </P> <P> The tomatoes to microwave are those from your own garden or from the nearest  farmer's market. Home-grown tomatoes are coming into season, and here are just  a few ways to microwave them with perfect results.  </P> <P> BEEFSTEAK TOMATOES AU GRATIN  </P> <P> 4 (about 6-ounce) firm-ripe beefsteak tomatoes  </P> <P> 8 (1/8-inch) slices sharp Cheddar, Swiss or Gruyere cheese  </P> <P> Halve tomatoes crosswise, but do not peel. Arrange tomato halves in circle on  microwave-safe 12-inch platter, cut-sides up and not touching.  </P> <P> Cover with plastic wrap, vented at 1 corner, and microwave on HIGH (100% power)  5 to 6 minutes, rotating platter 180 degrees at half time, until tomatoes are  slightly softened.  </P> <P> Cut cheese slices slightly smaller than tomato halves. Top each tomato half  with 1 cheese slice and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 1 1/2  to 2 minutes until cheese melts. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> STEWED TOMATOES  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds medium, firm-ripe tomatoes, peeled, cored and quartered  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons grated onion  </P> <P> 1 large clove garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 1/4 cup minced sweet red pepper or celery  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon minced fresh basil or oregano or 1/4 teaspoon crushed dried  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> 1 bay leaf  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon celery salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> Mix tomatoes, onion, garlic, sweet red pepper, basil and sugar in  microwave-safe 2-quart casserole. Add bay leaf.  </P> <P> Cover with tight-fitting lid (wax paper between dish and lid works well) and  microwave on HIGH (100% power) 3 to 6 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes, until  just soft. (Don't overcook. Time will vary according to variety and ripeness of  tomatoes, so check often.)  </P> <P> Discard bay leaf, sprinkle tomatoes with celery salt and pepper and serve warm,  at room temperature, or chilled. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> RICE AND CHEDDAR-STUFFED TOMATOES  </P> <P> 4 (2 1/2- to 3-inch diameter) firm-ripe tomatoes  </P> <P> 1 small onion, peeled and minced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 cup cooked rice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons minced canned green chiles  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt, about  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> Slice 1/4 inch off stem ends of tomatoes and discard. Scoop seeds and pulp into  bowl, drain tomatoes upside-down on several thicknesses of paper towel. Discard  tomato seeds, drain pulp and coarsely chop. Set aside.  </P> <P> Microwave onion and butter in wax-paper-covered microwave-safe, 1-quart  casserole, on HIGH (100% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until transparent. Mix in  tomato pulp, rice, cheese, chiles, salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Stuff tomatoes with rice mixture, dividing evenly. Arrange tomatoes in 9-inch  pie plate, 1 inch apart, leaving empty space in center.  </P> <P> Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 7 to 9 minutes, rotating pie  plate 180 degrees at half time, until tomatoes are just soft. Check for  doneness after 7 minutes (don't pierce or tomatoes will lose juice and shape).  Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Because tomatoes microwave fast, cooked stuffings that only require  reheating work best. In microwave ovens of 700 watts or more, vine-ripened  tomatoes may cook more evenly on MEDIUM (50% power), but time may need to be  increased 1 to 2 minutes.  </P> <P> In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

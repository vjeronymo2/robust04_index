			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, by </F> Natalya Gorodetskaya; place and date not given: "The Defense  Shield of the USSR Should Be Restored Urgently"]    [Text] The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Territory:  16,000 square km. Population: approximately 1.2 million. Main  industrial sectors: oil production and refining, production of  drilling rigs and automated control systems. Decline in  industrial production in 1993: 25.7 percent, in the  agro-industrial complex, 10 percent. The budget in 1993--R500  billion--was deficit-free. Main difficulties: the economic  blockade on the part of Russia--frozen bank accounts, Chechnya  has not received a single ruble for two years, and the Russian  Federation's arrears for oil in 1993 constituted R30 billion. A  government program, the emphasis in which was placed on  self-reliance, was drawn up last year.    Previously the oil industry constituted up to 80  percent of the total volume. Now approximately 3 million tonnes  are being produced, and virtually no oil is being received for  refining currently (potential for 20 million tonnes a year). The  question of the temporary closedown of certain types of  operations like, for example, the production of polyethylene,  phenol, and certain types of oils is being studied. It is  contemplated switching production to the manufacture of fuel ($6  million of equipment has been purchased). On account of the loss  of sales markets, the Molot Plant, which used to supply all of  Russia with drills, is switching to the manufacture of mini-rigs  (trials are under way in the republic). The production of  building materials and consumer goods in the republic has  increased, which has afforded an opportunity, generally, to slow  the decline in production.    Agriculture. An increase in the numbers of livestock,  poultry, and so forth is being stimulated in the private sector.  The prices of agricultural products are free. In order to secure  state supplies of grain, meat, milk, and vegetables the  government has undertaken to pay up to an additional 30 percent  per ruble of the price asked by the seller. The agro-industrial  complex is in a reform phase--it is contemplated creating state  farms in place of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes (there will be no  private ownership of the land).    Average wages are R60,000 (payment has been held up for  several months), pensions, R42,000. Of the R25 billion received  by the National Bank in 1994, R17 billion have been channeled  into the payment of pensions. But many retirees have received no  money since August-September of 1993. The rational consumer  basket costs R42,000. Officially registered unemployed: 200.    From a SEGODNYA interview with Taymaz Abubakarov,  minister of economics and finance of the Chechen Republic of  Ichkeria.    "The foundations of the USSR are in Chechnya, and  Gorbachev and Lukyanov, who were unlawfully removed from power,  could embark on the discharge of their duties here,  therefore."    [Gorodetskaya] Mr. President, how do you feel in the role of  victor? Sergey Shakhray's resignation is being linked with his  incorrect policy in the North Caucasus, in Chechnya particularly.    [Dudayev] I do not feel that I am in the role of victor  because I have never linked any issues with Shakhray either as a  leader or as a politician or as a man. As you know, Chechnya has  stated that we will negotiate with Russia only as a sovereign  state--via the Foreign Ministry or between the presidents  directly.    [Gorodetskaya] Do you have prior conditions for such a  meeting?    [Dudayev] None. But groups of specialists should, naturally,  meet in advance to prepare the meeting, particularly in respect  to matters of protocol.    [Gorodetskaya] What would you expect from a meeting with  Boris Yeltsin?    [Dudayev] Everything would, most likely, culminate in a  communique, a joint statement. I do not believe that Yeltsin is  ready as yet. More precisely, he himself is ready, perhaps, to  make a decision, but his entourage and the branches of power are  not yet prepared to adopt an unequivocal decision, and Yeltsin  is not prepared to stand up for it. Today he has too many  opponents who are prepared to destroy and make trouble, and no  one has any desire to create.    [Gorodetskaya] What economic questions specifically would  you  like to discuss at the negotiations?    [Dudayev] We have a firm economic program. We have grabbed  hold of the basis under the present conditions of the  transitional period. We have substantiated production and the  economy mathematically.    [Gorodetskaya] Could you provide a little more detail?    [Dudayev] Fragments of this program are now being considered  overseas and have already been discussed with the top  industrialists and billionaires.    [Gorodetskaya] With possible investors, that is?    [Dudayev] Yes, with possible investors that have taken the  initiative and have already begun to embody it. The main issues  are land, water, and oil. The Arab East is totally without  water, and a liter of gasoline is now 2.5 times cheaper than a  liter of water. We have water--eternal glaciers. I proposed that  they run a pipeline from our glaciers. They agreed. Further, why  should oil belong to the strong alone. It should belong to all  regions and should be affordable at uniform prices to all  regions and peoples. Armenia and Stavropol and so forth. I, as  premier, have already taken control of the oil and am now  protecting it against the petty thieves.    [Gorodetskaya] Of what significance is the program for the  North Caucasus?    [Dudayev] It is of great significance for the entire former  Soviet Union. All will have to repeat this. Everything should  have a price, then there would be production. We should stop  being lazy, therefore, and value everything: a cubic meter of  sand in a quarry used for raw material, a cubic meter of oil,  each tree, and only then calculate the finished product.  Further, conduct a complete stock-taking, draw up the government  contract, revise the taxation policy, and change the formula of  formation of the budget. Only then will there be a normal  economy and production in the primary phase.    [Gorodetskaya] The Chechen opposition declares that the  republic's economy has been completely destroyed.    [Dudayev] You should not listen to the opposition because  there simply is none. In order to guzzle down what they have  plundered, commonplace petty thieves and looters, who committed  crimes and took to their heels, have found a nice slot beneath  the word "opposition." At the negotiations with the Russian  Federation I shall attempt to raise the matter of the  extradition of criminals that have become ensconced in Moscow  and Russia.    Two and a half years ago I myself made the statement that I  would like to have a radical opposition that had its own program  and engaged in political struggle by civilized methods. I missed  such an opposition. The next day a statement was made to the  effect that, well, you asked, we are born. Now, however, all the  so-called members of the opposition have scattered.    [Gorodetskaya] What about the opposition's claims that the  Provisional Council completely controls Nadterechnyy Rayon.    [Dudayev] I cannot say this. They make many claims, and  there  is a great deal that they want, but they have no programs, no  vision of constitutional arrangement or legal base. Their desire  is to push their people into the executive in order to grab an  appetizing piece and run. They operate by wolves'  methods--roundup, capture, pullback.    [Gorodetskaya] Of what does your idea of the creation of a  common Caucasus home consist?    [Dudayev] I do not divide the Caucasus into either north or  south or east.    [Gorodetskaya] Regardless of religious belief?    [Dudayev] Regardless of religious belief, of language. The  Caucasus is one. The Almighty has already divided up the Earth,  the peoples have settled apart. Man is the direct accessory of  this land, its attribute. There are peoples that cannot settle,  like the Gypsies, for example. But they once had their own land,  Atlantis, maybe, which became submerged. They will wander until  that land rises from the water to dry land or is released from  beneath the ice. The Caucasus is a geopolitical point of the  world. The Almighty did not create on this green sphere more  favorable climatic or geopolitical conditions than in the  Caucasus. There are here the most ancient civilizations and  culture, and we need to reckon with this, not destroy but find  the sources of man's real development. This is why I have a  program for the integration of the economy.    [Gorodetskaya] What is the reason for you choosing so  distinctive a form of the solution of the land question--the  land and its resources belong to the Almighty?    [Dudayev] The land truly does not belong to man. Nothing  would ever satisfy us. We must reconcile ourselves to the fact  that nothing in this world belongs to us. Only the regulation of  property relationships. Dividing up the land--man has not  thought up anything more absurd.    [Gorodetskaya] I was told that a lieutenant general of the  Russian Air Force came and offered you his services. Is this  true?    [Dudayev] Yes, I have had such offers. I believe that there  are gifted generals in Russia, we need merely to appreciate  them, not kill off aviation and generals for politicking petty  thieves. But I am convinced and have stated that restoring the  defense shield of the USSR is not only essential but urgently  necessary to prevent everything sliding into total collapse and  utter hopelessness.    [Gorodetskaya] It is said that you were, for all that,  invited to restore this shield, that is, to head the CIS forces,  and you have not declined?    [Dudayev] No, I have not declined to head the CIS forces.  But  I do not want to be the head, it would suit me were such a  leitmotiv to be put on a legal basis, and I would be merely a  participant. It is not a matter of command, it is a matter of  self-esteem, a matter of the need to restore the defense shield.    [Gorodetskaya] How do you see the operations of a Russian or  joint peacekeeping force, in Karabakh or in Yugoslavia, for  example?    [Dudayev] This is my profession, I know how to perform them.  Withdraw all the troops, all the blues and greens, I would with  a single regiment of mine without a single weapon ensure an end  to the war in Yugoslavia, for example.    [Gorodetskaya] How?    [Dudayev] There is no need to commit there desperadoes in  masks and helmets or to dangle trinkets if we have come to help  and restore balance on humane, legal foundations. We need to go  with the intent to make peace, but were just one of my  subordinates to be killed, 100 heads in response.    [Gorodetskaya] You constantly speak out against the United  Nations, the Security Council. Are you not afraid of Chechnya  finding itself isolated?    [Dudayev] Of course it is isolated. International  institutions of the United Nations type know full well that the  Chechen have for 300 years now been a proving ground. Who has  said a sympathetic word about us, not to mention words of  protection. If they would at least leave out the vilification  and provocations. It will reach the point where I also permit  myself to reveal the mechanisms of international incidents. The  present status of the United Nations is one of an entirely  illegitimate formation organizing its activity on an unlawful  basis. Let us start with the name--United Nations--but not all  states are members. The UN Charter still contains the "hostile  states" concept.    [Gorodetskaya] Which states have recognized Chechnya?    [Dudayev] Georgia was the first. We do not want to publicize  these states as yet. Were I to need the recognition that the  world community needs, I can assure you that I would obtain 10  acts of recognition in 10 days. But we do not need such  recognition. Everyone at one time recognized Georgia. Where is  the first lawfully elected president now?    [Gorodetskaya] How do you view the fact that Ruslan  Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament, is  not only living in Chechnya but canvassing the people for the  rapprochement of Chechnya and Russia?    [Dudayev] If the people accept his campaign, I have nothing  against such campaigning.    [Gorodetskaya] I was told that approximately 200,000  Russians  have left Groznyy.    [Dudayev] Everyone is entitled. They have left, they are  coming.    [Gorodetskaya] But there are, after all, problems when it  comes to skilled personnel.    [Dudayev] A nation should be taught via difficulties. The  main thing is that the right path be chosen. Spare me a legacy  where all are scholars, and no one wants to work.    [Gorodetskaya] Russia has been assailed as of late not only  for what it has done but for unrepentance also. Were Russia to  apologize to the peoples, the Chechen included, and give  assurances that this would not recur, how would mutual relations  be built?    [Dudayev] How would it apologize, and what would  follow--crocodile tears? Russia must cure itself. It must first  guarantee its own state, its own statutes, and its own law and  their efficacy and the viability and effectiveness of the  branches of power. The State Duma is an illegitimate organ of  power, no one knows what the Duma is, they thought up a Duma and  went and dashed off to think. The Federation Council is a  hybrid, and it is not known where this comes from. The  authorities are not working, no branch of power is in control of  the situation. There is collapse, robbery, and chaos, the  economy has been completely destroyed, production has been  halted. And Russia would guarantee? What? It cannot guarantee  anything at home--they shot up the White House from  large-caliber machine guns. There is no constitution. There is  no law on citizenship, but everyone votes. Citizenship was taken  away overnight. I have the right to say: "I am a citizen of the  USSR, here is my USSR passport, by what right have I been  deprived of it?"    [Gorodetskaya] You believe that the USSR can be restored?    [Dudayev] Restored, no, but renewing it and creating a new  union is a real necessity.    [Gorodetskaya] Would Chechnya join such a union?    [Dudayev] We would join a legal union, but not an  adventurist  union. I believe that all the former republics would join.    [Gorodetskaya] There was a fleeting report that Mikhail  Gorbachev was invited to Groznyy to discharge the duties of  president of the USSR. This was a false report, surely?    [Dudayev] It was not. A research center placed documentary  material on my desk. The government studied this material and  concluded that the Chechen Republic is today the sole exponent  of the legal base of the former USSR. Some 92 percent of  citizens voted for preservation of the Union. We respect the  right of the citizens. We rejected the ballot in the Russian  Federation, we did not take part. The USSR passports have been  preserved. We are guided by Union laws where they do not  conflict with the laws of the republic. We are preparing a  currency, and exclusively the notes issued on the territory of  the Soviet Union will be valid on our territory. All the  attributes of the USSR--the coat of arms and the anthem and the  flag--are present in the office of the president and will soon  be introduced as the official attributes of dual citizenship--of  the USSR and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. The foundations  of the USSR are in Chechnya, and Gorbachev and Lukyanov, who  were unlawfully removed from office, could embark on the  discharge of their duties here, therefore. We have not made  official inquiries, merely made an offer. If they agree, we will  remain the sole guarantors of the succession of the USSR. If  they decline, even better. We could then assume the debts of the  USSR. By all means, and we would guarantee that we would divide  them equably among all republics and peoples of the USSR and pay  them off.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Low turnout in Ukraine poll Repeat elections yesterday failed to fill the remaining quarter of Ukraine's new parliament because of a low turnout. Preliminary results showed that only 57 of the 112 districts surpassed the 50 per cent turnout threshold. 'It was a beautiful day. People were at their dachas concentrating on their garden plots.' said Mr Yaropolk Kulchyckyj, Kiev head of the Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems. 'This is the fifth time, they're tired of elections. Many people didn't even know that elections were taking place.' Ukraine has been conducting a complete democratic transfer of leadership from president down to councillors. The result crushed hopes that democrats and moderates might be able to wrest control of the 450-seat body from the Communists and their left-wing allies. The empty seats are a result of Ukraine's inefficient electoral law, which only managed to elect 338 deputies in two rounds of voting last March and April. Further repeat elections for the invalid districts will need to be rescheduled for later this year. In most of the 57 valid districts, elections will still have to go to a second round run-off on August 7.</p>

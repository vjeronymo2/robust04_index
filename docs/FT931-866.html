			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Steel price drop behind LFr3bn loss at Arbed ARBED, the Luxembourg steel-maker, yesterday announced it lost LFr3.3bn (Dollars 97.9m) last year, as the drop in EC steel prices took its toll on profits. The company recorded a consolidated profit of LFr6bn in 1991. Arbed's share of last year's loss excluding minorities was LFr2.9bn, compared with a profit of LFr4.3bn in 1991. The company said the 1992 result included provisions of LFr700m to cover the restructuring of non-steelmaking activities. Arbed, which will announce detailed figures at the end of next month, has been hit hard by the decline in west European steel prices, under pressure from cheap non-EC imports. In September, the group announced it had recorded a profit of only LFr364m for the first half of the year, against LFr3.2bn in the equivalent period. A spokesman for the Luxembourg company said the group had already reduced the number of daily shifts at its Differdange heavy beams plant from three to two to cope with the slump in EC demand. Arbed's turnover slipped from LFr198bn to LFr188.5bn in the year, and 7.1m tonnes of steel were produced, down 12.8 per cent on the 1991 figure.</p>

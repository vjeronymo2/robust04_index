			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Dividends No less than 12 UK companies with a stock market capitalisation of more than Pounds 100m - including five Footsie constituents - reported interim figures yesterday. Not one of them cut their dividend. The average increase in their payouts, indeed, was broadly in line with inflation at 3.8 per cent. On the view that dividends are one expression of a company's confidence over the medium term, the trend must be mildly encouraging. It is worth pointing out, however, that while yesterday's sample reflected a wide spectrum of businesses, the only representative from the stricken building sector was a small housebuilder of proven quality.</p>

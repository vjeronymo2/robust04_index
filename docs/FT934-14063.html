			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Women, Space, Light and Dance / Review of Sara Rudner and others in the Dance Umbrella season A lone woman invading space. This idea, this image of a female pioneer, goes deep in American modern dance, and it is as old as the century - it goes back to Isadora. American women at the turn of the century were asking questions, posing challenges, thrusting into the unknown. American modern dance has had its great male dancers too, but they have demonstrated a less investigative, more secure, attitude to space. For some American women, even now, unoccupied space is an opportunity for adventure and drama. To make stage space dramatic, however, you also need light. Even before Isadora, the American dancer Loie Fuller was a pioneer of lighting. And Many great dances by George Balanchine and by Martha Graham were lit, famously, by a woman - Jean Rosenthal, who, by all accounts, made as much out of unadorned space as Wieland Wagner. Today, the leading lighting designer in dance is Jennifer Tipton; and last weekend at Riverside Studios Sara Rudner and Dana Reitz danced, in silence, barefoot, to her lighting. 'The divine Sara' as she has been nicknamed (with her beautiful mane and striking cheekbones, there is a Bernhardt resemblance), Rudner is mainly famed as the greatest dancer to belong to Twyla Tharp's company, inspiring roles in great Tharp dances from The Fugue (1970) to The Catherine Wheel (1980), and she still returns to dance with Tharp at regular intervals. But Rudner has long been also a soloist in her own choreography. Moving alone in light, she is always sensuous and rich-toned. She uses her own weight powerfully - much about her dancing reminds me of Lynn Seymour - and with luscious complexity: shimmying, arching, rippling, falling. As she addresses the light, or discovers it, or turns her back on it, she is, by turns, innocent, merry, heroic, bleak. The many moods her dancing has are as marvellous to behold today as when I first saw her in 1980, and what is most beautiful of all is her utter absorption in them. Dana Reitz, whose career has been chiefly as a soloist, has a quieter and more ironic style. She may be proceeding slowly in waves and curves in one direction, when suddenly the sharp flip of a wrist behind her back will register as a gesture of contradiction. She is an elegant dancer, but part of her elegance lies in being somewhat detached. Her whole physical tone is cooler than Rudner's, and the way she carries her head adds a quality of intellectual commentary. This weekend, these two soloists shared the stage, and the light, with perfect accord. As for Tipton's lighting, it was astounding. A dancer might be lit from a high white light behind, or silhouetted against a suddenly azure backdrop, or apparently suspended in warm light with no floor visible. One dancer might be a two-dimensional shape against the glowing backdrop, while the other dancer might be a three-dimensional figure against the encompassing void. At one point Reitz walked on, wearing a straw hat; when she took it off and held it centre-stage, a burning spotlight so illumined it that it looked like a burning orb, a miniature sun. The dance lasted over an hour, and towards the end some of Tipton's effects became too virtuosic. Circles within circles of light, colours against colours, darkness against brightness, until Reitz and even Rudner began to seem incidental. The performance, however, was always enthralling - and reminded me that when the history of American dance in our century is written, the names of Tipton and Rudner should loom large in it. The British attitude to space is, of course, a different matter. We do not invade it, we occupy it discreetly, and what authority we exert in it is terribly correct. Still, certain dancers and choreographers make movement in space a matter of personal drama. Look at Siobhan Davies, whose company (three women, three men) was dancing last weekend at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Davies's style is lyrical, lambent, sensitive, discreet - frightfully British. Again and again you see dancers stretching out into space - but they do not step out into it, the American way. They hold their own, they view the terrain, they express themselves. Nor does space here have any character of the great unknown. Space with Davies, as with any British choreographer, is something already charted. The drama of a dancer entering space is simply the Virgina Woolf drama: staking out a room of one's own. When one dancer partners another, there is no sense of conflict, or struggle for power; but supportiveness galore. Of the pieces Davies showed this weekend, Wanting to Tell Stories - which I reviewed from Brighton this May - was having its London premiere, and was the second half of both double-bills; the first half was either White Bird Featherless or Make-Make, both of which have been seen here before. She is fortunate in having the brilliant lighting of Peter Mumford, who achieves marvels comparable to Tipton's - and, in White Bird Featherless, likewise produces too many bravura effects. Each of these Davies works has its own interesting character, but each is so devoid of progress or climax that it is impossible to remain absorbed. Davies is, no doubt, one of the most important British artists today, she has made works I would love to see again (the most recent being the 1989 Sounding and the 1990 Different Trains), and her choreography is currently reaching new peaks of stylistic sophistication. Yet how I wish the impulse at their heart were simpler. Everyone in a Davies work is endlessly sensitive, but to what end? Behind all the lyricism, you begin to sense a kind of depressing passivity and an artful love of contrivance. What a lot of subtle craft has gone into creating this collage of people in their different ways - with all their refinement of feelings and manners getting nowhere lyrically. Curiously, a third Dance Umbrella event last weekend was also an affair of light and the female choreographer. Miranda Tufnell was her own solo dancer, and the lighting was by David Ward. The lighting - bulbs hanging low above the floor, black-and-white patterns projected over the whole stage, and more  -was an interesting enough stage environment. But Tufnell, never much of a dancer, has become a slow, laborious bore. Mainly she rolled or lay slumped, and sometimes she set the bulbs swinging through the air. The image her work conveys is the most somnolent brand of solipsism.</p>

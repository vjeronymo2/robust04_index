			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Wednesday [15 June] expressed his government's determination  to reform Japan's economic system "drastically."    Speaking at the 16th trade conference, Hata said, "the  reform  will likely involve pain. But the government's goal of  upgrading the overall standard of the Japanese people cannot be  achieved without such efforts," according to an official of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    The conference took place at the prime minister's official  residence, with foreign businesspeople attending a meeting of  the highest trade body of the government for the first time.    The meeting is designed to receive views and opinions from  government officials and business leaders on deregulation and  other market-opening measures announced at the end of March, the  official told reporters.    Horst Kramp, the head of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said most of the trade barriers that afflicted  foreigners in the past have been successfully removed.    But Japan should make further efforts to get rid of  remaining  barriers, such as administrative guidance that effectively  limits foreign business activity and complex business licensing  procedures, Kramp said, according to the official.    James Wogsland, vice chairman of Caterpillar Inc. of the  United States, urged the Japanese Government to identify and  remove trade barriers on a sector-by-sector basis.    He also demanded that Japan reform its distribution system  to  facilitate penetration of imports.    Suvit Wanglee, the head of the Board of Trade of Thailand,  voiced hope the Japanese business community, especially  corporations operating in Thailand, will cooperate with local  companies in order to foster Thai industries.    "Japan should serve as a locomotive for world economic  growth," the official quoted Suvit as saying.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- For the past two days  Abkhaz separatists have been conducting intense artillery  shelling of the environs of the village of Ajara, along with  carrying out provocative sorties against Georgian people's  voluntary corps, thus violating the Moscow cease-fire agreement.  Gudauta militants carry out armed raids on peaceful villages of  the area, later accusing the Georgian side in order to gain over  public opinion.    Yesterday [25 May], Abkhazian mercenaries units attempted to  attack Georgian positions. Georgian Armed Forces units and the  local population, who until then had refrained from any  retaliatory actions, had to open fire. The opposite side  retreated suffering casualties. Six attackers were killed and  two taken prisoner.    Embittered by this failure, Abkhaz separatists dropped four  bombs on the village of Ajara yesterday at one p.m.; luckily,  there were no casualties.</p>

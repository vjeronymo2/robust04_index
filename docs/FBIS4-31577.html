			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Gazdag, director of the Strategy and </F> Defense Research Institute, by unidentified correspondent; place  and date not given--first paragraph is PESTI HIRLAP introduction]    [Text] According to Ferenc Gazdag, director of the Strategy  and Defense Research Institute [SVKI], the change of political  systems has demonstrated the need for research institutes in the  social sciences, institutes that promote the flow of  comprehensive information and are also able to provide  background analyses and forecasts quickly and accurately. At our  request the director discussed one of the institute's most  recent research studies--of the present state of the Ukrainian  Army.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Sir, why was your institute established?    [Gazdag] The purpose of a research institute within a  ministry's staff organization is to offer ideas and analyses to  the ministry's political leadership, to demonstrate processes,  and perhaps to prepare forecasts. It follows from the Defense  Ministry's functions that we have to concern ourselves primarily  with questions of national defense and security policy. In other  words, the ministry's purview determines our work. Consequently,  we are interested in all questions related to our country's  defense and security and its system of relations with countries  both near and far. We are studying particularly the questions of  Hungary's security and also Central European, European, and  global security.    [PESTI HIRLAP] How systematic are your relations with the  Ministry of Defense? How frequently does the ministry request  analyses from your institute?    [Gazdag] Regrettably, a system of bilateral relations has  not  yet fully evolved. We prepare annual research plans, which are  approved, respectively, by all the main departments within the  ministry and by the state secretaries. Thus we have an approved  research plan that is based in part on the types of research the  ministry needs; we also suggest certain research topics. To tell  the whole truth, however, our institute was established in 1990;  we first have to develop and deploy our capacities, and only  then will this bilateral process be able to function. At  present, the ministry itself often does not know what it needs.  Despite the substantial investment, one can never be certain  about the return on it. After all, our research results appear  in long-term studies, analyses, and books.    [PESTI HIRLAP] What is your budget?    [Gazdag] We receive 20 million forints annually from the  ministry, and our entire staff consists of 12 people at present.  If we take into consideration that, since 1990, the ministry's  budget has been declining gradually in real terms, it is  conceivable that there will be changes at our institute within  the foreseeable future.    [PESTI HIRLAP] What are the institute's current research  programs?    [Gazdag] I think it will suffice to list our principal  directions of research. The first principal direction is the  evergreen topic of the defense of the Republic of Hungary. The  second principal direction is the security of Central Europe and  of Europe proper. Incidentally, we are now preparing a  conference, and a large volume of conference reports, both to be  called The Security of Central Europe 1994  [Kozep-Europa biztonsaga 1994]. New challenges, new dangers, and  risks is what we call our third principal direction of research.  We have to take into account that the world, or at least the  immediate world around us, has not become any more secure, even  though the bipolar system has disintegrated, the period of great  military threats is over, and NATO and the Warsaw Pact are no  longer confronting each other. Instead of the great nuclear  threat, there now are many small but real threats. These threats  involve many things that are not military factors, yet  researchers must take note of them. The problem of refugees, for  instance, also has security implications. Our fourth principal  direction of research is the process of modernizing combat  materiel and the structure of armed forces. Such research is  definitely for the Hungarian Armed Forces. There is also a  fifth, interesting and new area of research in which we are  investigating the connection, the system of relations, between  the armed forces and society. Research in this area became known  in Hungary only a few years ago.    Over and above the principal directions of research, each of  my colleagues has a favorite research topic he likes to pursue.  Andras Balogh, for instance, is investigating the relationship  between minorities and security; a lengthy article of his on  this subject appeared in VALOSAG not so long ago. Another  colleague is investigating the psychological aspects of  security-policy conflicts; he, too, published his results  recently in what has become the well-known Braun report.    Of course, we are also allowed to investigate topics that  are  not so prominently in the forefront of everyday thinking. Let me  give you an example. Much as it is desirable for us to take part  in European integration, it also raises many factors of  uncertainty. Therefore it is our duty to investigate already  now, for instance, what burdens would devolve on us from the  realization of Hungary's strategic objective of attaining NATO  membership. The average NATO country is spending 3 percent of  its national income on defense, whereas Hungary is spending  merely 1.6 or 1.7 percent. Which means that we would have to at  least double our military budget if we wanted to upgrade the  Hungarian Armed Forces ideally to NATO standards.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Is the distribution of your institute's  studies and reports restricted to the Ministry of Defense, or do  members of the opposition also have access to them?    [Gazdag] Members of the National Assembly's Defense and  Foreign Affairs Committees, and central agencies receive our  reports by virtue of their office. Upon request, we gladly make  our research results available to the expert of any party,  regardless of his party affiliation. At the moment we are  distributing our publications free of charge to officials on our  distribution list, but we are also planning to make our  publications available for sale to the interested public. As an  example, let me mention that, with the help of NATO's  Information Department, we recently published the NATO manual  that explains how NATO functions. The manual was so successful  that we have decided to print a second edition, but we will be  charging a small fee for its copies, instead of distributing  them free of charge.    [PESTI HIRLAP] What are your relations like with other  institutions of the Hungarian Armed Forces and with civilian  research institutes at home and abroad?    [Gazdag] Research work is interactive. When someone  discovers  something, he is in contact with very many people and is working  in a system of constant feedback. Most of my colleagues are  teaching at universities, both civilian and military ones. We  regard the Hungarian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense as  our customers whose requests we try to satisfy as  comprehensively as possible. We like to rely on the work of our  partner institutes, primarily on the Foreign Affairs Institute  and the World Economy Research Institute. Our relations are  outstanding with similar institutes in the neighboring  countries. We often receive guest researchers; most recently,  for example, we had colleagues visiting us from Poland.    [PESTI HIRLAP] To our knowledge, members of your institute  visited Ukraine recently. What experience have they gained there?    [Gazdag] There are very many forms of cooperation, including  the mutual exchange of research materials, analyses, and  studies. Last fall, for instance, a delegation of the Ukrainian  General Staff's Scientific Directorate came to our country for  consultations lasting several days. In return, Hungarian  security policy experts were invited to Kiev for discussions, on  26 through 28 April. Representing our institute, Colonel Dr.  Laszlo Nagy was a member of the Hungarian delegation. Besides  meetings with the official Ukrainian delegation, he held talks  also with the heads of the International Research Institute of  Regional and Global Security and with the military-policy  adviser to the Ukrainian minister of defense.    During the consultations, our experts gained much valuable  information on Ukraine's security policy and the state of the  Ukrainian Armed Forces. They established that Ukraine is in an  extremely difficult situation. The recession, inflation,  insolvency, and dependence on Russia are very serious. Yet our  partners in the consultations were a bit more optimistic than a  year ago. They told us that the recession had bottomed out in  some areas and that the country had not collapsed under the  successive crises. The rate of inflation has slowed slightly.  The parliamentary elections took place without any serious  disruptions, and four-fifths of the 450 seats have been filled.  The institutions of public administration have become  stabilized, and the legislative backlog has been reduced to some  extent. Although disputes with Russia are continuing with  undiminished intensity, matters have not come to a head, and  there remains the possibility of a negotiated settlement for  every controversial issue.    Ukraine's international political assessment is improving,  and its bilateral relations with the neighboring smaller  countries are good. During the past two years and also at  present, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been undergoing  substantive reform, but the process is by no means a smooth one.  The trouble started with Ukraine's inheriting a randomly grouped  part of the Soviet Armed Forces that happened to be on Ukrainian  territory when Ukraine became independent, rather than an  integrated army that gradually evolved in the course of  Ukrainian history, in organic unity with society. According to  our Ukrainian partners, their concept of having to reform their  inherited armed forces was a mistake. It would have been better  to aim immediately for complete reorganization and  reconstruction.    This realization was two years late in coming; the euphoria  of the initial period after declaring independence was not  always accompanied by well-founded decisions, and a  comprehensive conceptual plan was lacking. Work was hampered,  for instance, by the decision that in 1992 the personnel of the  Ministry of Defense could be brought up to only 50 percent of  its original size. The strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces  gradually declined, from more than 650,000 at the time of  independence to about 450,000 at present. In addition to the  Army, there is also a National Guard about 50,000 strong. On the  American model, the National Guard is able to reinforce the  police primarily in emergency situations, without actually  having to deploy the Army itself.    [PESTI HIRLAP] In the case of Ukraine, nuclear weapons pose  a  separate problem.    [Gazdag] That is true. The trilateral agreement signed by  Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in January, on Kiev's  accession to the START I Treaty, has calmed tempers. Two  shipments of nuclear warheads have already arrived in Russian  since then, and Ukraine has received the promised fuel for its  nuclear power plants. Kiev has undertaken to fully disarm itself  of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the schedule specified in  the START treaties. (In other words, Ukraine--unlike  Russia--will not be retaining any nuclear weapons.)    On the other hand, Ukraine is not yet willing to accede to  the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, although Ukrainian aversion  to it seems to be diminishing. It is conceivable that Ukraine  might revise its standpoint in the near future. Ukrainian policy  on nuclear weapons, which is not always clear, has another  aspect. In conjunction with the trilateral agreement signed in  Moscow, there is a Ukrainian notion that appears to be spreading  among military policy experts. It holds that only mediation by a  third party could offer hope of any progress in resolving the  controversial questions between Ukraine and Russia.    The advocates of this theory would like to involve at all  cost a third party in the dispute over Crimea and the Black Sea  fleet. The ideal third party would be the United States; should  it decline to participate, however, the United Nations or some  other international organization could also come into  consideration. This theory is dangerous in the sense that  Ukraine might try to delay its nuclear disarmament in an attempt  to persuade Washington to enter the Ukrainian-Russian dispute.  Although the United States has categorically stated on several  occasions that it would not let itself be blackmailed, the  possibility cannot be excluded that Kiev might resort to the  questionable method of a tie-in sale.    Such a step would considerably destabilize relations  primarily between Russia and Ukraine, which would not be  indifferent from our country's point of view. Otherwise, Kiev  regards as reassuring the development and existence of parallel  European structures (the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe, North Atlantic Cooperation Council, Partnership for  Peace, etc.), but finds all this inadequate to offset Moscow's  growing efforts at reintegrating the Soviet republics.  Incidentally, Ukraine is the only associate member of the CIS  beside the Commonwealth's 11 regular members.    [PESTI HIRLAP] The information you have just outlined is  merely of general interest at present. But how useful is all  this to the SVKI?    [Gazdag] It is very useful in our work, primarily in  developing optimal conceptual plans for our country's security  policy. I have already mentioned that the SVKI is organizing an  international conference on Central European security, to be  held in Budapest on 16 and 17 May. Perhaps the most important  item on the conference's agenda will be a comparative analysis  of the conceptual security policy plans of the countries within  the region. I will cite merely one fact to illustrate how  serious this conference will be: NATO Headquarters in Brussels,  and also the Marshall Center--an American research base  established in Germany last year--have already informed us that  they would attend.</p>

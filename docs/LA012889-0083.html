			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENDING THOMPSON FOR TAKING A WALK  </P> <P> Regarding the Murray article of Jan. 26: Murray was not at his best in his  tirade against Georgetown's John Thompson, a coach who has been relentless in  maintaining discipline and insisting that his kids apply themselves to their  studies on or off the road. But before that he had to be confident that his  recruits were endowed with the gray matter and determination to meet the high  moral and academic standards of Georgetown. Perhaps Murray can get Jimmy the  Greek and that Dodger VIP (whose name I have already forgotten) to help him  extricate his foot from his mouth. Then I suggest that he ask his BUSHel of  supporters in Washington to get the Pentagon to build him a bullet proof shoe  (for 20 grand or so) to protect him in case he keeps trying to shoot himself in  the foot.  </P> <P> JACK B. RYAN  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

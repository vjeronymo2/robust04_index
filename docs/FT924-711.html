			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / German power challenge dropped OVER 160 local authorities in east Germany yesterday agreed to drop a constitutional challenge to the virtual monopoly of the main west German utilities on generation and supply of electricity in the former communist state. An out-of-court settlement between the two sides means that the utilities, headed by RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, will be guaranteed 70 per cent of the electricity market in east Germany for the next 20 years. The local authorities have agreed to generate from their own power stations no more than 30 per cent of the total requirement. In return, the suppliers have agreed to protect jobs in the east German brown-coal industry, which still employs some 80,000, and embark on new investments valued at up to DM30bn (Pounds 12.3bn). The local authorities will be allowed to choose whether to take over full ownership and control of electricity and district heating supply and distribution facilities on their territory, or cede the right in exchange for up to 49 per cent of the shares in their regional electricity supply organisation. The deal could fall foul of EC competition rules. It is likely to mean foreign electricity suppliers will be effectively excluded from access to the east German market for the next 20 years, industry analysts say. Foreign suppliers have shown an interest in the east German market, including Electricite de France, Britain's PowerGen, National Power, and Scottish Power. The German utilities have been attacked by German industry as among Europe's most costly power suppliers.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORHOOD WINS ON ZONING ISSUE  </P> <P> At the urging of local residents who sought to preserve their neighborhood's  character, the Torrance City Council has voted to rezone a two-block  neighborhood from multifamily to single-family zoning.  </P> <P> In a petition to the Planning Department, 21 residents near Border Avenue and  San Ardo Street asked for the zone change to ban apartment buildings and  condominiums. There are 26 single-family houses on the two blocks.  </P> <P> The change will take effect June 29. There was no opposition to Tuesday's  council action.  </P> <P> Residents have told city officials that they oppose the density that apartment  buildings have brought to surrounding neighborhoods.  </P> <P> In a similar situation last month, 16 residents of the 1000 block of Amapola  Avenue asked the city to declare the block a historic overlay district.  Residents said they feared that without the historic zoning, developers would  replace older homes with condominiums and apartments. The council instead  approved a zone change that requires a public hearing before any construction  takes place on that block.  </P></p>

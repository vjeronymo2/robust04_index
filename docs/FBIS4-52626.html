			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of the  No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party, appealed to Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday [12 May] to agree to a meeting  with him next Tuesday.    However, Kono said he has not yet finalized possible topics  for discussion with the premier. "I will consider what the  contents of the meeting should be," he said.    Hata, in his first policy speech to the House of  Representatives on Tuesday, appealed to opposition parties to  cooperate to help his fragile minority government steer Japan  through difficult times on both domestic and international  fronts.    But Kono, in his parliamentary interpellation on Thursday,  questioned the authority of the minority government and  expressed readiness to take over power from the Hata  administration.    Kono has also arranged a meeting with Tomiichi Murayama,  chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], on  Monday, a day before his planned talks with Prime Minister Hata,  according to other LDP sources.    The Kono-Murayama meeting marks the first between an LDP  president and an SDP chairman since the LDP was ousted from  power last summer, party officials said.    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told  reporters both Kono and Murayama have agreed to hold separate  meetings next Tuesday with Hata, who is also leader of Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party).    Kumagai said Hata may also seek similar dialogue with  leaders  of other parties, including new party Sakigake [Harbinger].</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (19): Small oilfields made viable - Amerada Hess EVER SINCE it was discovered in 1975, the Ivanhoe oilfield, in the North Sea 110 miles north-east of Aberdeen, had been deemed uneconomical to exploit. Given the immense cost of constructing and installing equipment to produce oil, the field was simply too small. Only when the neighbouring Rob Roy field was located in 1984 did it begin to look feasible to exploit the two together. But in 1986 another blow struck. The oil price tumbled, and Amerada Hess (AHL), the company with the rights to exploit the fields, was forced to think again. Undaunted, its designers managed to cut the cost of the project from Pounds 480m to Pounds 340m, with an innovative plan to refurbish an existing floating platform to exploit the fields. Six years later, with both fields now producing, AHL has won a Queen's Award for technology for its floating oil and gas production facility - perhaps the largest single project to win an award this year. This is the first time in the world that gas had been exported from a floating platform, and that two geographically separate fields have been exploited simultaneously from such a facility. Amerada Hess was one of the first oil companies to become involved in the North Sea in 1964, when licensing of offshore fields began. It is now, according to a recent survey by County NatWest, the UK's eighth largest oil and gas producer in the UK, employing nearly 600 people in London, Aberdeen and offshore. In addition to the Ivanhoe, Rob Roy and Hamish fields, it operates the Angus field, which came onstream at the end of last year, and the Scott field, one of the largest in the North Sea, which comes onstream in 1993. It has interests in a further nine oilfields and four gas fields. AHL acquired an interest in Ivanhoe and Rob Roy when it purchased the oil and gas interests of Monsanto Petroleum in December 1985. The company took over operation of the consortium which owned the two fields - which also includes Deminex UK Oil and Gas, Kerr McGee Oil and Pict Petroleum - and undertook to develop the fields on behalf of the group. The first step was to find a suitable semi-submersible platform for re-fitting. The chosen vessel was the Sedco Phillips SS, formerly a flotel used to carry out maintenance work on platforms in the North Sea, which was renamed AH001. If the name was slightly short of imagination, the project was not. AH001 was taken to Nigg Bay in Scotland, where redundant equipment including a 350-tonne revolving crane, and the existing generators and accommodation modules were ripped from the deck. Two new 1,000-tonne cross-hull pontoons were fitted to the structure to improve stability. Then it was taken to Tyneside, where, at 12,500 tonnes, it was then the largest structure ever to enter the Tyne. Eighteen months later, after a further 2,500 tonnes of equipment had been removed and replaced with nearly 6,000 tonnes of structural reinforcements and oil and gas processing equipment, it was certainly the largest to leave. While the platform was being transformed from a floating hotel and repair shop into a fully-operational oil and gas platform, drilling work was under way 70 nautical miles out to sea, and 140m under water. By the time the AH001 was towed out to sea in April 1989, it was ready to be linked by flexible pipelines to three underwater manifolds connected by more pipelines to the various oil and gas wells. An export pipeline to carry oil the 25km to Occidental's Claymore A platform, where it connects with a trunk pipeline to the Flotta Terminal in the Orkneys, was already in place, as was a 14km gas line to Texaco's Tartan platform, from where gas travels along a pipeline to the St Fergus terminal on the east coast of Scotland. Safety measures also have a high priority on the platform. Blast walls have been fitted between the accommodation and the gas compressor train - potentially the most dangerous area - which have been situated as far apart on the deck as possible. Emergency shutdown valves, used to turn off the oil and gas supplies in the event of an accident, are protected by special steel platforms, and an enclosed lifeboat area fitted with an emergency incident control room gives additional protection should the platform need to be evacuated. The project came onstream in July 1989, within budget and ahead of schedule. Gas was first exported a month later, and in 1990 the small satellite field Hamish was also hooked up to the AH001's facilities. Remarkably, only a year passed between the discovery of this field and its coming on-stream - proof of the versatility of AH001. Mr Sam Laidlaw, AHL's managing director, says such floating platforms will increasingly become a feature of North Sea oilfields. 'The average size of fields is clearly going to get smaller, and this type of floating technology that can be re-used and shifted from field to field is going to be essential to get the most out of the reserves left beneath the North Sea.'</p>

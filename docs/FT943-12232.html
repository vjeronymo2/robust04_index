			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Poor results for three big US energy groups Three big US energy groups produced disappointing second-quarter results yesterday, reflecting lower profit margins from refined products due to the rebound in oil prices in recent weeks. The higher oil price repaired some of the damage done late in 1993 and early this year to exploration and production profits at Exxon, Mobil and Texaco. However, this was more than countered by the higher costs faced by downstream, or refining and marketing, operations, which were unable to raise prices sufficiently to offset the rebound in the price of the commodity. Two of the three, Mobil and Texaco, were also held back by restructuring costs announced this month. Exxon, which reported its lowest quarterly after-tax profits since the last quarter of 1989, saw exploration and production earnings fall by a 11 per cent, to Dollars 603m. The company blamed the drop on the fact that oil prices were on average Dollars 2 a barrel lower than the second quarter of 1993, despite the recent run-up. Before one-off charges, Mobil's upstream earnings slipped 15 per cent and Texaco's fell 37 per cent, to Dollars 335m and Dollars 155m respectively. Downstream earnings, meanwhile, showed a reverse of the first three months of the year. At that time, profit margins had swollen as the companies benefited from lower input costs. In the second quarter, Exxon's refining and marketing profits slid 50 per cent, to Dollars 201m; Texaco's fell 41 per cent, to Dollars 106m; and Mobil's slipped 8 per cent, to Dollars 224m (all figures before one-off items). Echoing comments from the other companies, Mr Alfred DeCrane, Texaco chairman and chief executive, blamed the poor downstream results on rising costs. 'Market conditions precluded recovery of these added costs to the refining and marketing units,' he said. One bright spot for the US oil majors has been the rebound in profitability at their chemicals businesses in recent quarters. In the latest period, Exxon said profits had jumped to Dollars 110m, from Dollars 50m a year before. Both sales and profit margins in the chemicals business improved during the latest quarter, and profits have now risen in four consecutive periods, said Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman. Mobil recorded earnings of Dollars 39m from chemicals, almost as much as the Dollars 44m it made in the whole of last year. Texaco reached agreement recently to sell its chemicals operations, and accounted for these operations as a discontinued business.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       US ENERGY COMPANIES - SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Earnings  HALF-YEAR                    Total           E&amp;P*              Downstream                '94     '93     '94     '93        '94          '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Amoco          410     487     244     283         55          262 Arco            24     271      81     233         16           79 Exxon          885   1,235     603     761        201          446 Mobil          198     579     150     465        189          105 Texaco          28     309     115     245         44          179 Unocal          50      88      79     113         38           46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Earnings                  HALF-YEAR                       per share                   TOTAL                    '94        '93            '94         '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Amoco             0.83       0.98            808         716 Arco              0.14       1.67            173         531 Exxon             0.70       0.98          2,045       2,420 Mobil             0.46       1.41            733       1,069 Texaco            0.35       1.11            317         593 Unocal            0.16       0.33            104          99  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Quarterly figures include the following after-tax charges, net of one-off gains: Mobil, Dollars 315m (Dollars 60m in 1993); Texaco, Dollars 127m (none in 1993); Exxon, none (Dollars 210m gain in 1993).

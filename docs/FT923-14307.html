			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / BCCI report by Bank set to back tighter regulation THE BANK of England is expected to respond today to the criticisms of a Commons select committee and back stronger banking supervision laws after the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Extra powers to act against banks whose opaque or internationally spread structure makes regulation difficult are expected to be proposed by the Bank in its formal response to the cross-party Treasury select committee investigation into the affair. However, the Bank is expected to wait until the publication of Lord Justice Bingham's official inquiry into BCCI before it gives its detailed response to specific criticisms of the closure of the bank more than a year ago. The Bank has already rebuffed the MPs' general assertion that action could have been taken against BCCI earlier than last summer's closure. To the anger of Labour MPs, the Treasury is expected today to say it will not publish its response to the Treasury select committee until after the Bingham report - probably not until after MPs rise for the summer recess next week. Mr Giles Radice, Labour member of the treasury committee in the last parliament, said: 'If a select committee acts quickly, like we did, and tries to come up with something sensible about regulation of a dodgy bank you would have thought that the government would at least have the courtesy of responding quickly. The delay is becoming a major scandal.' The Bank is understood to have compiled a 30-page response to the Treasury committee's investigation into international and national banking supervision laws and to have accepted a number of the MPs' recommendations. Bank officials came in for most criticism in the report, with ministers escaping blame. The committee said troubles in BCCI's structure were recognised but its 'complicated international network' was tolerated. An attempt by BCCI creditors to postpone a planned challenge to the High Court's approval of a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 883m) compensation package failed in the Court of Appeal yesterday, Raymond Hughes writes. After the decision of the BCCI UK creditors' committee not to appeal against last month's High Court ruling sanctioning the deal negotiated between liquidators Touche Ross and the bank's Abu Dhabi majority shareholders, a number of individuals want to take over the appeal. Their application to be substituted as appellants is due to be heard next Monday but yesterday their counsel, Mr David Hunt QC, asked for an adjournment until July 20.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MILLENDER TAKES OVER FOR CANYONS  </P> <P> Seldom does a basketball coach have to tell his leading scorer that she is  being too unselfish, but that's what College of the Canyons Coach Jeff Dunlap  told Tressie Millender.  </P> <P> As the Canyons women prepared Monday for their first state tournament  appearance, Dunlap told Millender that it was time she took control.  </P> <P> Millender responded with 32 points, 22 in the second half, to lead fifth-seeded  Canyons over visiting Fullerton, 71-66, Wednesday night in the first round of  the Southern California regional of the women's state junior college  tournament.  </P> <P> "Thank God for Tressie Millender," Dunlap said. "She decided she wanted to take  us into the second round."  </P> <P> Canyons struggled in building a 33-31 first-half lead against 12th-seeded  Fullerton, a perennial qualifier and a team Dunlap called the North Carolina of  women's basketball.  </P> <P> Canyons trailed, 40-39, early in the second half when Millender took control.  Millender, a 5-foot-10 sophomore forward, scored seven consecutive points on a  rebound basket, a three-point shot and a layup.  </P> <P> "We were shaky," said Millender, who grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds. "I just  told everybody to calm down, relax, and we'd get the job done."  </P> <P> Fullerton (16-14) refused to quit, though, and trailed, 60-56, with less than  10 minutes left. However, Millender wasn't finished, either.  </P> <P> She scored seven points in a 9-0 Canyons run that put the game out of reach,  69-56.  </P> <P> "This was a real learning experience for us," Dunlap said. "I feel more  comfortable about the second-round game than I did about this game."  </P> <P> Canyons (24-7) had defeated Fullerton by 30 points earlier in the season, but  the Lady Hornets played the first game without point guard Candi Burnett and  forward Kris Kelley.  </P></p>

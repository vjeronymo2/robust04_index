			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Spending cuts urged on Finns FINLAND needs to make further spending cuts and create a more flexible labour market if it is to build on the export-led recovery which is starting to emerge, says the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development in its latest report. The OECD predicts flat economic growth this year, after a 10 per cent decline in real output in 1991 and 1992. In 1994 it forecasts a 2.1 per cent increase in gross domestic product following the strong revival in exports which has accompanied the depreciation of the markka. The OECD says Finland's ability to reduce interest rates further is being constrained by a need to prevent a weakening of the markka to keep inflation under control. It says further spending cuts are 'clearly needed' to curb a rising budget deficit.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / US Money and Credit: Optimism at Clinton appointments PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton, whose economic and fiscal policy utterances will dominate US credit market sentiment for months to come, saw his own credit rise several notches on a suspicious Wall Street last week as he announced his team of economic advisers. The appointments gave Wall Street the most tangible indications yets of the likely economic priorities of a Clinton administration. And the credit markets, which generally associate Democratic administrations with the twin sins of increased government spending and inflation, were partially reassured by the politically centrist team they saw. The market's over-riding fear is that the Clinton administration, committed during the election campaign to jump-starting the (then) ailing US economy, will go for an excessive fiscal stimulus early next year, just when US growth seems to be gathering momentum. The result could be renewed inflationary fears and a slump in bond prices. The market's hope is that Mr Clinton, whose campaign pledges also included action to cut the federal budget deficit, will energetically apply himself to this goal, which would be positive for bond prices. The membership of the Clinton economic team gives grounds for optimism not just that the emphasis will be on deficit reduction, but that the administration may be able to get genuine change through the Democrat-dominated Congress, which its Republican predecessor failed to do. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new treasury secretary, knows Congressional fiscal policy-making inside out thanks to his many years as chairman of the Senate finance committee. Representative Leon Panetta, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, has long been a strong advocate of deficit reduction. Wall Street sceptics suggest the appointment of Congressional insiders could make Mr Clinton a prisoner of a free-spending Capitol Hill, but the president-elect's finely tuned political instincts seem more likely to produce the very opposite effect. As Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist at securities firm CJ Lawrence, points out, Mr Clinton wants to get re-elected in 1996, and the strong showing of Mr Ross Perot during last autumn's campaign shows the electorate is deeply concerned about the deficit. He adds: 'The big surprise over the next few months could be that Clinton's multi-year economic proposals will have much less short-term fiscal stimulus and much more deficit reduction than widely expected.' Certainly, the latest statistics suggest that the economy is now recovering sufficiently robustly not to need a sharp stimulus. Last Friday brought word of a better-than-expected jump in November retail sales and a big rise in consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book on economic conditions points to a modest but uneven improvement and the central bank seems certain to keep monetary policy on hold when its Open Markets Committee meets on December 22. At the same time, inflationary pressures remain very subdued. The consumer price index for November, released on Friday, saw a modest two-tenths of a per cent rise, just what Wall Street had been expecting. The net effect of these various forces last week was to leave long bond prices modestly higher on the week, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue dropping from 7.48 per cent to 7.43 per cent. A rally early in the week on news of the political appointments was partly offset in the latter half by the good economic figures. The great unknown remains the economic package Mr Clinton will unveil in the early weeks of his presidency. The market was unsettled by his recent remarks - albeit made well before last week's cabinet appointments - suggesting that the recovery may not be all that robust. But each fresh batch of statistics suggests otherwise, and could open up for Mr Clinton a golden opportunity for deficit reduction. Long bond prices might then rally, producing a substantially flatter yield curve as short term rates trended upwards in response to recovery.</p>

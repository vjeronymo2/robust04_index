			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: From Russia with confidence - Forget those rouble problems. John Thornhill finds that some investors believe in a glowing future Like murders, investments need a means, motive and opportunity. While the anti-market Communist party ruled the Soviet Union for 74 years, none of these factors applied to Russia. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the helter-skelter growth of capitalism, many investors believe they can make a killing in the land of Lenin. Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton emerging markets fund - one of the most successful in the sector - certainly shattered some pre-conceptions by forecasting that Russia's fledgling capital markets could become as big as those in the US within 20 years. He told the FT he believed his Dollars 8bn fund would have a 20 per cent weighting in Russia within 10 years, and added: 'It is an explosive investment market.' There was no shortage of rivals ready to attack such seemingly outlandish views. It is easy enough to find the ammunition. Russia's economy is still in the middle of a colossal upheaval, with industrial production falling 28 per cent in the past year. The rouble has resembled a yo-yo this week, losing 21.5 per cent of its value on 'Black Tuesday' but rising by 25 per cent on 'White Thursday'. And although the political situation has grown more stable over the past few months, it remains precarious. Yet, some investors now believe that the potential rewards of buying Russian assets more than outweigh these macro-risks. Russia is a country of vast natural resources, with 150m well-educated people and a high technological base. Following its mass privatisation programme, 120,000 capital-hungry companies have been transferred into private ownership. Some could emerge as extraordinarily profitable businesses and highly attractive investments. 'The seeds of growth have been sown by the privatisation programme and the capitalist genie has been let out of the bottle,' says one western fund manager. The big problem with many of these potential investments, however, is that no one yet knows their true financial condition. Russian accounting is rudimentary and financial information about companies and their markets scanty or non-existent. Thus, trying to value companies on any traditional methods, such as earnings or cash-flow multiples or dividend yields, is all but impossible. Instead, investors pay more attention to the valuations ascribed to the privatised companies' assets and, on that basis, many of them look extraordinarily cheap by global standards. To take just two examples, Baring Securities calculated that, in August: The value of Gazprom, which owns more than 30 per cent of the world's known gas reserves, was about 0.3 cents a barrel of oil equivalent while that of British Gas was about Dollars 10.30. The value of Rostelekom, which has 80 per cent of all telephone lines in Russia, was about Dollars 49.35 per access line while that of NTT of Japan was about Dollars 2,429. The market value of the 30 largest Russian companies which form the Moscow Times index have a total value of Dollars 22bn - less than that of some big companies in the FT-SE 100. Such seemingly seductive calculations have led to a rapid influx of foreign capital into Russia in the past few months, mainly from private investors and hedge funds. CS First Boston, which is the most active western stockbroker in Russia, says it is buying on behalf of 95 western funds and forecasts that the total inflow of foreign capital this year could reach Dollars 3bn. That sum, however, is still likely to prove less than Russia's capital flight. As in all emerging markets, Russia is a case of hot money chasing a fast story, and the investor has to discount much wild talk. In illiquid markets, sentiment is often critical and there is no shortage of speculators trying to talk up the price of shares. The speculative bubble might well have been pricked already, with leading shares showing some sharp falls in the past few days. But the longer-term hope would be that once Russia sorts out its securities legislation, more serious long-term capital will flood into the country, creating a more stable and sustainable investment boom. At present, however, mainstream investors are deterred by a host of micro-problems. As yet, there are no effective clearing or settlement systems and it can be extremely difficult simply to buy and sell shares  - the spreads between bid and offer prices can be as much 50 per cent. Share registration is also a nightmarish process. Buyers have to list their purchases on the company's register, which means having to visit some remote Siberian towns. There is no guarantee that the names will not be erased after being entered, and there are bound to be huge problems and scandals as the market develops. No fund manager who takes his fiduciary responsibilities seriously should yet be prepared to invest. Change is happening fast, though. A group of leading Russian companies, wishing to attract foreign capital, has produced its own investors' charter to introduce higher financial standards and greater corporate governance. The government promises a new securities law. A national settlement system is being developed and foreign banks are setting up custodial services. If these issues are resolved rapidly, there is perhaps a real possibility that Mobius's prediction might not prove so fantastic. The emerging markets team at Morgan Grenfell last month published a report forecasting a possible 500 per cent rise in the stock market in dollar terms by 1996. 'Russia has the potential to be the outstanding stock market for the rest of the '90s, just as Japan was in the second half of the 1980s,' it concluded. Maarten Pronk, Moscow representative of ING - a Dutch bank which spans both commercial and investment banking activities - says: 'In truth, nobody knows how big this market can get. It might grow as big as the US, Japan or Germany. Who knows? But Russia needs the capital - and it has a huge capacity to grow.'</p>

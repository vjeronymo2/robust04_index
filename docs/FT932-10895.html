			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium depression forecast to continue ALUMINIUM PRICES are expected to remain depressed this year, with higher demand offset by increased production capacity, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Unctad, which last week hosted a meeting of bauxite consumer and producing countries, reckons that at current prices more than half the world's aluminium capacity (excluding eastern Europe and the socialist countries of Asia) is operating at a loss. Unctad foresees a rise in primary aluminium production capacity of about 570,000 tonnes in 1993, broadly in line with 3 to 4 per cent growth in demand. This, it says, implies little or no reduction in record stocks of about 1.7m tonnes accumulated in London Metal Exchange registered warehouses, equivalent to more than a month's global consumption of primary aluminium. Further cuts in capacity utilisation and closures of high-cost smelters may be needed to avoid a complete collapse of the price this year, Unctad warns. Aluminium prices fell from a high of about Dollars 2,100 a tonne in September 1990 to below Dollars 1,100 a tonne late last month. That reflected recent increases in production capacity, the steep climb in exports from the former Soviet Union and the maintenance of output despite low prices. The prices of upstream products, alumina (aluminium oxide) and bauxite (aluminium ore), have also been affected, Unctad notes. Prevailing prices for alumina are insufficient to justify investment in new capacity, which could restrict supply in future years, it says. Guinea is by far the biggest bauxite exporter, followed by Brazil and Australia. Australia is the leading exporter of alumina, while Canada, the US and Norway head the export rankings for unwrought aluminium. The former Soviet republics have boosted annual exports from between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes a year to between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes in 1991 and 1992, according to Unctad. The increase is equivalent to about a quarter of previously estimated Soviet consumption. Though the flood of ex-Soviet aluminium exports may abate, Unctad believes they will still top 500,000 tonnes this year and next.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa advances to SKr520m TRYGG-HANSA SPP Holding, the Swedish insurance group, yesterday reported that its operating profit rose to SKr520m (Dollars 85.6m) for 1991 from SKr97m in 1990, writes John Burton. However, despite the powerful increase in net earnings the company is pegging its dividend. This is to stay at SKr4 a share. The steep upturn in profits reflected a 14 per cent increase in premium income to SKr7.5bn and a 48 per cent rise in earnings in insurance operations to SKr920m. At the same time financial income provided the accounts with SKr345m against a loss of SKr456m in 1990. On a less positive note the company explained that it faced a new source of concern in the shape of its 43 per cent shareholding in Gota, the Swedish financial group. This caused a loss of SKr850m for Trygg-Hansa. The group's consolidated capital increased by 24 per cent to SKr12.9bn last year.</p>

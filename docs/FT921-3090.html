			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (14): Sharpening fiscal incentives THE new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed by the Nigerian government and its foreign joint venture partners last July, guarantees minimum profit margins to the foreign joint venture partners of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) over the coming years depending on their levels of capital investment and cost efficiency. The original MoU was signed in 1986 at a time of falling oil prices and production, dwindling reserves and low capital investment by the foreign oil companies. It guaranteed a minimum after-tax profit margin of Dollars 2 per barrel in exchange for stipulated exploration commitments. This guaranteed profit margin was subject to NNPC's operating partners keeping to minimum standards of cost efficiency. When costs rose above a notional technical cost of Dollars 2 per barrel, the guaranteed profit margin was reduced. The original MoU also obliged the foreign companies to purchase the government's crude oil share at 45 days' notice if it was unable or unwilling to sell it on the open market because of adverse market conditions. Negotiations to update the original MoU began in early 1990, the year in which the original five-year exploration programme ended. The real value of the guaranteed profit margins had been eroded by inflation. Moreover, the government was keen to sharpen the fiscal incentives for the foreign companies to increase their oil reserves to meet its declared aim to increase total reserves to 20m barrels by 1995. After some delay, the new MoU was signed last year, detailing a new five-year plan for exploration and production and containing a number of new features designed to increase capital investment in the oil sector. It guarantees a profit margin of Dollars 2.3 a barrel so long as technical operating costs do not exceed Dollars 2.5 a barrel. But the minimum guaranteed margin increases to Dollars 2.5 a barrel if capital investment exceeds Dollars 1.5 a barrel with total operating costs less than Dollars 3.5 a barrel. In addition, the new MoU provides bonuses for companies that increase their reserves by more than they produce in any given year, thereby adding to net reserves. It also reduces the required notice period for purchasing unsold government crude to 15 days. The terms of the MoU do not apply to the new oil fields that have been allocated by the government over the past year. For these fields, the government intends to shift to production-sharing agreements, the terms of which are still being negotiated. The foreign oil companies appear satisfied with the new agreement and have stepped up their capital spending plans accordingly. Mr Philip Watts, managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, says that having the new MoU has made a big difference by providing a 'proper financial underpinning' for Shell's Nigerian operations. 'Its not that the deal is marvellous. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating; and all the major players are gearing themselves up for major capital expenditure.'</p>

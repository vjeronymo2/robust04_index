MTI's Warsaw correspondent yesterday reported that Polish  Minister of Defence Piotr Kolodziejczyk, returning from a visit  to Prague, said on Tuesday evening [25 January] that a military  exercise of this kind, the largest held within the Peace  Partnership framework, would be held shortly.    Erdelyi said military exercises would definitely be held  within the Peace Partnership, but no concrete preparations have  been made so far. NATO member states would also participate, as  one of the goals is to coordinate with the western military  forces.</p>

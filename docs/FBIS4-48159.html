			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There are reports of top secret discussions being  held in Algeria between the Malian Government and the Tuareg  rebels. It seems that there have been problems over an earlier  agreement between the two sides signed in the Malian capital,  Bamako, two years ago. Not all Tuaregs, it seems, agree to that  earlier peace deal which was between the Malian Government and  the Azaouad rebel movement. The current discussions in Algeria  are aimed at resolving problems of integrating former Tuareg  rebels into a unified Malian Army. From Algiers, Mohammed  Areski Hima faxed this report.    The exact location of the meeting between the Azaouad rebel  movement and the Government of Mali has been kept secret.  Discussions between the two sides began yesterday under a total  news blackout. The breakdown of earlier discussions held at  Tamanrasset in mid-April has prompted both sides to maintain  secrecy this time. The Tamanrasset meeting was designed to try  to salvage a peace agreement signed in 1992 in Bamako. This  peace deal ran into problems over the integration of Azaouad  fighters into the Malian Army. The Azaouad movement originally  wanted some 2,300 Tuaregs reintegrated, but the Malian  Government was expecting to accommodate only 1,000. Since the  peace deal was signed, only 600 Tuareg fighters have been  accepted into the Army and the Malian Government says that it  does not have sufficient funds for any more.    The Tuareg groups are also said to be unhappy about  government funding for social projects in the regions of  Timbuktu, Kidal, and Gao. Azaouad faces the problem of what  happens to its fighters if they are left outside the national  army. Such groups could create insecurity by devoting  themselves to acts of banditry in the Azaouad Region in northern  Mali. Even now, disaffected groups of rebels who disapprove of  the 1992 peace deal are said to be in rebellion against Azaouad.</p>

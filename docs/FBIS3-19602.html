			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The 33d congress of the Spanish Socialist Workers  Party [PSOE] has ended. Party Secretary General Felipe  Gonzalez closed the congress. Antonio Criado reports from  Madrid's Palace of Congresses.    [Criado] This congress will go down in history because it  marks the difference between one period and another. This is  what Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez said in his closing  address to the 33d congress. According to Felipe Gonzalez this  has been the best congress in the past 20 years. In short, he  was extremely satisfied both with the renewal and the  integration that the party has undergone. According to Felipe  Gonzalez, wounds have to be healed with generosity -- a  generosity that has to be extended to integration of all wings  in the party during the provincial congresses.</p>

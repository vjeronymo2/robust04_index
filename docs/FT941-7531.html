			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Defensive strategy The surprise in British Aerospace's results yesterday was that there were no surprises. That was not because the company has been flouting the puritanical rules on disclosure post-LIG, but more that BAe seems to have broken with its long habit of producing dead rabbits from hats. Indeed, there were even some pleasant developments. The Pounds 128m turnround in Rover's underlying profits, while flagged at the time of the BMW deal, was rather lost in the hullabaloo. The figure is a credit to the transformation of the company, though BAe will no longer benefit from the work. And as it owes much to Land Rover, where sales rose by 30 per cent, it hints at some of the goodies BMW has in store. Shorn of most of Professor Sir Roland Smith's distractions, BAe is left with two main challenges. Operating losses of Pounds 120m in turboprop aircraft this year, and perhaps Pounds 80m thereafter, need to be curbed. Finding a joint venture partner is a priority, though the worry must be that, with the market so poor, two badly bleeding operations may be merged into one badly bleeding operation. Grinding out defence profits from the order book is the other task, and while costs have been cut, the suspicion remains that there is more to go for. From the market's perspective, the limited visibility of defence earnings and the uncertainty over margins are a concern. Since the company must also persuade doubters that it is not in the hands of a defence mafia, more detail on the business would serve both purposes. The greater the confidence in the exposed core of the company, the lower the discount the market will apply to those profits. Yet even given that healthy degree of scepticism, BAe's earnings prospects for the next two years imply plenty of upside for the shares.</p>

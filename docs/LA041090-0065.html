			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT FEE PLAN DRAWS SHARP PROTEST IN OTAY MESA  </P> <P> A new fee to be levied on real estate development as a means of funding  low-cost housing in San Diego has drawn sharp protests from Otay Mesa  manufacturers and developers, who say the tax could end up inhibiting business  expansion in the area.  </P> <P> Alan Foster, vice president of Sanyo North America, which operates a huge  refrigerator factory in Otay Mesa, said the tax would add about $400,000 to the  cost of a $10-million-plus, 400,000-square-foot addition planned at the  facility.  </P> <P> Although Sanyo has made no definite decision on whether or when to build the  addition, Foster said, the tax would be an inhibiting factor. He said Sanyo,  which employs 400 workers at its 330,000-square-foot plant in Otay Mesa, moved  there from the Kearny Mesa area so it would have room for expansion.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council passed the tax measure by a 5-4 margin March 26. If  the measure passes a second time at the council's second reading April 16, it  will take effect within 60 days. The rule would impose a fee of from 50 cents  to $2 per square foot on all new industrial warehouse, office and retail  construction.  </P> <P> The 200-member Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce is campaigning against the tax,  whose monies would go into a city-administered housing trust fund. By adding  30% to the fees already being paid by developers of industrial buildings on  Otay Mesa, a cost that eventually will be passed along to tenants, the tax will  make Otay Mesa a less desirable place for businesses, the chamber says.  </P> <P> "The development industry is holding the load instead of these costs being  spread out," said Andrea Korogi, the chamber's executive vice president. Bob  Filner, the city councilman whose district includes Otay Mesa, voted with the  majority to approve the tax, she said.  </P> <P> City officials say the $12-million tax is a key element in helping balance a  $60-million shortfall projected for the fiscal year that begins July 1.  </P></p>

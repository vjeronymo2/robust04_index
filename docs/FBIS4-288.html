			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--Jean-Marie Ngendahayo,  Burundian minister of state for foreign relations and  cooperation, who is currently visiting Cairo, has expressed  shock over the tragic incident that claimed the lives of Rwandan  President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien  Ntaryamira in Kigali last night.    In an exclusive statement to MENA, the Burundian minister  said that the incident was not provoked by any turmoil or unrest  and that the target was the Rwandan president. He pointed out  that the incident took place at Kigali airport in Rwanda at  about 2030 last night and President Ntaryamira was expected to  arrive in Burundi at about 2105.    Minister Ngendahayo said that on board the small Falcon  plane  that crashed in Kigali last night were Bernard Ciza, Burundian  minister of state for planning development and finance; Cyriaque  Simbizi, Burundian minister of communications and government  spokesman; and Captain Cizahayo, an escorting officer.    Concerning the incident's possible repercussions for  Burundi,  Minister Ngendahayo said that there are two unconfirmed  possibilities about the plane's crash or downing.    If the plane has crashed, he said, it is a tragic accident  for two presidents with good reputations in the continent and  will have grave consequences for Rwanda, which is going through  a phase of democratic transformation and whose government is  conducting talks with the opposition.    As for Burundi, Ngendahayo added, it is an extremely painful  and sensitive situation, as President Ntaryamira has only been  in power for two month and the country had already lost  President Melchior Ndadaye last October.    In the event the plane was downed, this may foment latent  problems in Rwanda. As for Burundi, I believe that the incident  is unfortunate but will have only a temporary effect. According  to the information I received, the average Burundian took the  news as a piece of "bad luck."</p>

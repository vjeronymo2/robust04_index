			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Spectre of strife stalks Ukraine:  Moves to prevent a schism between west and 'Russified' east THE massive granite government buildings circling Kharkiv's out-sized central square are a legacy of the 1920s when this gritty eastern Ukrainian industrial city was the capital of Soviet Ukraine. When Stalin's grip over the second-most powerful Soviet republic grew firmer, he shifted its government west to Kiev, the nation's traditional centre, but the factory bosses of the largely Russian-speaking eastern regions remained the most powerful force in the country. That changed when Ukraine became independent nearly two years ago. Since then, the influence of eastern Ukraine has waned and many of its traditional links with Russia have been severed. Instead, western Ukrainian politicians, propounding a nationalist ideology foreign to the eastern regions, have come to the fore with promises to pull Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and bring it into Europe. While western and central Ukrainian politicians see independence, in the words of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, as 'the fulfilment of the centuries-old dream of our fore-fathers', eastern Ukrainians are more inclined to dwell on the costs of separation from Russia. At a meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers in Kharkiv on Monday one eastern Ukrainian regional government official described the repercussions of breaking away from Russia, which ruled his area for more than three centuries. 'This separation has cut our very hearts in two,' he said. 'Not only have links between factories been severed, but families find themselves cut in two by what used to be a symbolic border.' Some Ukrainian leaders and western observers fear the growing disquiet in the east could give rise to a separatist drive to re-unite eastern Ukraine with Russia. That, in turn, could plunge Ukraine into a messy civil war. Concerns about a civil war are not confined to marginal Cassandras. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk himself hinted at this worst-case scenario in a recent television address. Warning eastern Ukrainians against provoking a regional schism, Mr Kravchuk said darkly: 'We cannot allow our nation to step across the chasm into chaos, anarchy and then dictatorship.' Mr Kravchuk's warning is particularly ominous because a civil war between the nationalist west and the Russo-philic east could easily drag in Russia. Mindful of the potentially explosive repercussions of a split between eastern and western Ukraine, Kiev is bending over backwards to appease the east. Earlier this month, the government broke the national budget and agreed to hold a referendum in September to end a strike by eastern Ukrainian coal miners. These economic concessions, which are likely to push the Ukrainian economy into hyper-inflation, point to the double- barrelled problem Kiev faces in eastern Ukraine. Not only is the east the region most disenchanted with Ukrainian independence, but it is also Ukraine's rust-belt, home to loss-making coal mines and heavy industry, which must be closed if the government is to pursue market reforms. Another effort to mollify eastern Ukraine can be spotted in Kiev's new, more conciliatory approach to its political, military and economic disputes with Russia. Ukraine has bent to Russian claims over the Black Sea Fleet and at their meeting in Kharkiv on Monday the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers agreed to liberalise customs controls along the 850-mile border between the two Slav states. But Ukrainian leaders at the Kharkiv meeting also made clear that there is a limit as to how far they will go to appease eastern Ukraine. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, clearly buoyed by the pro-Russian sentiments of Ukrainian regional government officials, suggested light-heartedly that the border between Ukraine and Russia be moved to Romania in the west and Vladivostok in the east. That solicited a sharp rebuff from Mr Ivan Pliushch, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliament and one of the most powerful figures in Kiev. After speaking of the need for better economic ties with Russia, Mr Pliushch warned: 'If anyone thinks that this is a path to the recreation of a new union of republics, then he is sorely mistaken.' The challenge for Mr Pliushch and his colleagues in Kiev is to appease eastern Ukraine without jeopardising their country's independence.</p>

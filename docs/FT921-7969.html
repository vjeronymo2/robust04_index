			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Polish pay policy is challenged MR Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski, the finance minister, as a two-hour token rail stoppage challenged the government's tough new pay policies. The strike for higher wages was called by the Solidarity trade union only days after the government announced its intention to reduce real wages by 5 per cent this year. Mr Lutkowski offered his resignation on Monday because of fears that the government's new economic policies, designed to boost investment and growth, would prove too inflationary. Two previous post-communist governments were frequently forced to concede demands for higher railway pay. They also proved powerless to discipline rail management which regularly overshot pay guidelines. Under the wage system state enterprises are obliged to keep wage rises well below inflation or pay punitive taxes. By the end of last year the railways had a large unpaid penalty tax bill. Delayed tax payments from the railways and other state enterprises are a principle cause of the budget deficit.</p>

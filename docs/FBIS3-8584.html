			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 9 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  strongly denounced the speech delivered by President Michal  Kovac this morning in the Slovak Parliament.    "The Slovak Government is greatly concerned and offended by  the speech of Mr President as it considers it a crude assault on  the basic institutions of the new state," the governmental  statement reads. According to the cabinet, Kovac's speech  "harms Slovakia's reputation and position abroad and  destabilizes the complicated domestic situation."    In the speech Kovac attacked Meciar's cabinet.    The government fundamentally rejects his address as  confrontational and unprecedented, opposing European political  standards, human ethics and overreaching the constitutional  powers of the head of state.    The declaration notes that it was Meciar's government which  had credentials for the creation of the independent states and  bears most responsibility for its developments. In this  connection the document poses the question "on behalf of whom  and in whose interest Kovac's speech was said," noting that  "certainly not in the interests of Slovak nationals."    The government is ready to acquaint citizens with a  "thorough  analysis" of Kovac's speech.</p>

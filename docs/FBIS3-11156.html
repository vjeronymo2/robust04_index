			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Anti-Aristide opposition is mobilizing and calling  on the Army to support a solution to the crisis. The  coordination committee of the parties hostile to President  Aristide has decided to go on the offensive to try to fill the  institutional vacuum. Mobilization is the political fuel the  committee intends to use to achieve this goal. During its first  contact with the press on 16 March, this assembly of parties,  including MDN [Mobilization for National Development] and FRAPH  [Revolutionary Front for Haitain Advancement and Progress],  terms the absence of a leader in the executive anarchy. The  committee's president says this political vacuum can provoke the  explosion of a social bomb in the country. Attorney Gregoire  Eugene states that the problem of institutional vacuum must be  solved in any case:    [Begin Eugene recording] We are going to get involved  immediately because there is danger in the house. It is urgent.  The situation can no longer hold. We are going to launch the  great offensive and impose on whomever it may concern the  obligation of filling Haiti's institutional vacuum, allowing the  country to emerge from its crisis. I am not saying that in  filling this vacuum, we are going to solve all the problems, but  at least something will be done; there will at least be an  organization to help the country emerge from its deadlock. [end  recording]    The coordination committee intends to interact with other  political forces in an effort to devise a unified strategy for  facing the power vacuum that has existed since Malval's  resignation. Questioned on the attitude of the international  community toward such an initiative, Eugene asserts that in case  of rejection of their solution by the foreigners, Haitians will  have to learn to manage the embargo:    [Begin Eugene recording] If the international community  agrees with our decision not to remain in this state of anarchy  and decides to consider the ambient misery, that is fine. If it  is deaf and uneasy, then the only answer is for us to find ways  to manage the embargo. That is, unfortunately, what we have not  learned to do. It would be necessary that after this embargo,  after the experience that we will have faced, we could say  blessed be my accounts. [as heard] [end recording]    It should be noted that during this news conference, the  coordination committee, following the forum at the Visa Lodge,  considered the legislators' plan doomed to failure.</p>

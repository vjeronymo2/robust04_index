			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CROWDS FILLING STATE PARKS  </P> <P> The three national parks in Central California are already filling for the  Labor Day holiday, the last long weekend of the summer. Officials in Yosemite,  Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said they expect all three to be filled  by midday today. "Anyone without reservations for a camping spot, tent, cabin  or hotel room will have to leave the park at night," said Lisa Dapprich, a  National Park Service spokeswoman in Yosemite. "We still have a few campsites  on a first-come, first-served basis, but they'll be gone by Friday morning."  Officials in Sequoia and Kings Canyon reported similar conditions and said they  expect the parks to be heavily used by holiday crowds during the three-day  weekend.  </P></p>

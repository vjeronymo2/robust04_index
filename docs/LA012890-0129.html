			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: EVERGLADES BY CONNIE TOOPS;  </P> <P> THE SKY ISLANDS OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA BY KATE CROWLEY &amp; MIKE LINK (VOYAGEUR:  $14.95 EACH, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Two new installments in Voyageur's "Wilderness" series devoted to America's  indigenous flora and fauna.  </P> <P> Mike Link's descriptions of the animals and people who inhabit the Arizona  deserts and riparian environments have a crisp clarity lacking in the other  writers' work. Connie Toops' personal accounts of trekking through the forests  and swamps of the Everglades really don't tell the reader much about that  fragile, threatened environment. But most people will buy these large-format  books for the gorgeous color photographs of egrets, cacti, sunsets, etc. that  make both volumes resemble outsize Sierra Club calendars.  </P></p>

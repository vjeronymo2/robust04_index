			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: FAMILY IS THE KEY TO CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> "Material things don't matter. It's happiness and tranquility in the family  that count."  </P> <P> A surprising holiday sentiment from someone who holes up on Linda Isle, deep in  the heart of nouveau riche country?  </P> <P> Not if you're Dee Wambaugh, wife of author Joseph Wambaugh, best-selling author  of such books as "The Onion Field" and the soon-to-be-published "The Golden  Orange," a cop thriller played out in Orange County.  </P> <P> Sure, Dee kicks up her social heels with the best of them, happily tipping  bubbly here, diving into caviar there, dressed to kill everywhere.  </P> <P> But, like many of the stars who regularly shine on the local scene, Dee knows  that the bottom line for happiness is family.  </P> <P> Case in point: She and her pen-wielding hubby are hitting the road for the  holidays, leaving glittery Newport Bay for the desert, where she'll cook up a  turkey on Christmas Eve with son David, 25, daughter Jeannette, 21, and  grandparents Emma and Frank Hendricks ("Can you believe someone my age is lucky  enough to have grandparents?").  </P> <P> She says it again: "It's happiness and tranquility in the family that count.  I'm hoping for some the rest of the year."  </P> <P> So is Gep Durenberger. The effervescent director of the Center for the Study of  Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano, site of many a sophisticated splash, is  heading for his old homestead in Le Sueur, Minn.  </P> <P> The house where Durenberger was born was built in 1859, the same year the house  belonging to the famous Mayo family of Minnesota was built. "It sits on a  hill," he says. "And, of course, an old-fashioned Christmas tree sits in a huge  bay window, covered with old-fashioned ornaments."  </P> <P> Durenberger, a pal of such social front-runners as television producer Norman  Lear and internationally acclaimed interior designer John Saladino, will open  his favorite front door on New Year's Day for a familial love-in. "My cousins  will come, and we'll dine on old-fashioned cooking -- baked apples, bread  pudding, that kind of thing. It's wonderful. I get renewed and come home with  both feet on the ground, ready to do battle."  </P> <P> Even the bustling Amen Wardy, owner of the thriving boutique in Newport Beach  that is patronized by such glitz-loving luminaries as Jackie Collins, is  leaving it all behind for the holidays. "I'm on my way to my house in  Montecito," says Wardy, who turned a car garage into a mirrored a la Versailles  boutique and made millions. And he'll do the cooking for Christmas Eve, which  he will enjoy with his beautiful daughter, Soffia. On the menu? "I don't know  yet. I don't decide until I go to the store!"  </P> <P> Social heavyweights Al Baldwin and his wife, Deeann, are heading to their ranch  in Wyoming, returning to their Emerald Bay home for Christmas and then zipping  to Wyoming again.  </P> <P> The reason for the zig-zag, Deeann says, is "parental pressure."  </P> <P> "Mine and Al's parents want to see us and our four children on Christmas, and  we want to see them."  </P> <P> But, Deeann admits, she prefers Wyoming for family holiday celebrations. "My  Emerald Bay tree is beautiful, but it's really a designer tree.  </P> <P> "In Wyoming, I take a tree and throw all the ornaments on it I can find. And I  pop popcorn, make apple pie and settle down with Al and the kids to play board  games. There's no television, so the kids have to talk to us. And there's no  phone, so the kids don't get any calls! It's heaven."  </P> <P> Heiress Joan Irvine Smith, who stages Orange County's most lavish brunch when  she tosses her Oaks Classic horse-jumping event each spring, will spend  Christmas Day in her San Juan Capistrano ranch house with her mum, Athalie  Clarke, and a slew of relatives. Everybody helps with the cooking, says Clarke,  who is proud as punch of the guest list since it will include her  grandchildren, Lt. Commander Russell Penniman, a graduate of Annapolis ("one of  the best pilots the Navy has," she says); James Swinden, and Morton Irvine  Smith. "And a new great grandson, Russell Penniman V," she adds.  </P> <P> Since the 6-month-old will be on the scene, Joan and Athalie have decided to  make it a "children's Christmas" celebration, Athalie says. "Little Russell  will get a rocking horse, and Joan is putting miniature horses all over the  tree."  </P> <P> There will be eggnog, turkey and plum pudding, Clarke says. "What's more fun  than dining with family?"  </P> <P> As for yours truly, someone who hits an average of 120 bashes sans family per  year, well, it's time to toss a party. A family party, of course. On Christmas  Eve, I'll set out the champagne (something you learn to love when you're a  society writer) and my husband, Bob, and I will toast our blessings with our  five children: Robert, Michelle, Christa, Rick and Michael.  </P> <P> Then we'll head into the dining room for a sit-down dinner where I'll serve  lobster that Bob has prepared (dining on something someone else has prepared is  another thing you learn to love when you're a society writer) and drive  everyone nuts when I ask the same old question: "What are you most thankful for  this Christmas?"  </P> <P> High on my list will be the fact that I've gotten to know so many  family-oriented social types in Orange County.  </P> <P> They know the bottom line. And I do too.  </P></p>

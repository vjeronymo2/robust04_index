			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Samo Kobenter editorial: "Better Late Than Never"] </F>   [Text] The West has finally -- let us hope that it was not  too late -- decided to adopt a tougher stance vis-a-vis the  Bosnian Serbs. It became clear on Wednesday [9 February] how  sensitively the besiegers react to this language. When signs  increased that the West was serious this time, they wanted to  withdraw their heavy artillery quickly from the hills  surrounding the capital and without demanding anything in  return. This is more than the peace mediators have achieved in  the past two years.    Still, one should not delude oneself now that peace will  break out in the foreseeable future. Irrespective of the  situation in Sarajevo, a strong Serbian offensive is under way  in central Bosnia. Unimpressed by the threats of NATO, the  Serbian aggressors tighten the noose in the Tuzla basin, thus  threatening about 1 million people. The Serbs are clearly  impressed by the position of NATO, which, however, cannot stop  the immense war machinery of the Serbs.    Determination and good political judgment are now more  urgently needed than ever before -- not least out of  consideration for Russia's policy that decided to strictly  reject a military intervention in Bosnia across all ideological  camps. One can hardly assume that the West, after its long  hesitation in the Balkans crisis, wants to risk a serious  conflict with the pan-Slavic bloc at this particular point. The  next 10 days might become a test that will go far beyond the  Bosnian issue. Basically, what was to be prevented by all means  has now become a political reality: The Balkans has become the  biggest burden for the newly defined relationship between Russia  and the West.</p>

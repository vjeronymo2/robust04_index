			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / PSBR study may blunt Kinnock claims on tax THE TREASURY might have unwittingly handed the government a way of escaping Labour party charges that it will be 'borrowing to bribe' the electorate in next week's Budget. By citing a German 'golden rule' for public finance Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, could justify more than doubling the government deficit in 1992-93 if he so wished. An analysis of UK public-sector capital spending in the latest issue of the Treasury Bulletin suggests that even a public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of close to Pounds 30bn in the coming financial year  - against an expected Pounds 12bn for this year - could be justified as covering government investment. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, last week contrasted Tory plans for 'borrowing to bribe' the electorate through tax cuts and a higher PSBR in the forthcoming Budget with Labour's commitment to 'borrowing to build' through higher government investment in public services. But the Treasury study shows that on one definition the government should be able to claim that sharply higher borrowing expected for 1992-93 will do no more than cover public-sector capital spending. In that way, Britain would be conforming to what economists call the 'golden rule'. This rule, a cornerstone of German fiscal policy, stipulates that the amount the government borrows should not exceed the amount it invests in any given period. Next year's official target for the PSBR is one of the most closely guarded Budget secrets. But there is no doubt that it will be sharply higher than the total for the 1991-92 financial year. The final figure is generally expected to be between Pounds 24bn and Pounds 30bn. Problems arise, however, when an attempt is made to relate British PSBR figures to measures of investment because, according to the Treasury, there are at least four sets of statistics that can be used to define public-sector capital spending. Three sets of statistics show that public-sector investment in recent years has been well below the likely PSBR for 1992-93. However, the Treasury has compiled a fourth set of statistics - known as 'public-sector asset creation' - in which it calculates that public-sector investment totalled Pounds 29bn in 1990-91 and estimates its outturn in the current financial year at Pounds 28.6bn. These levels are roughly in line with next year's expected PSBR.</p>

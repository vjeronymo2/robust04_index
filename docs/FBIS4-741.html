			<p>BFN     [Text] Maseru April 15 SAPA -- The uprising in Lesotho  appeared to be over on Friday [15 April] and South Africans were  advised that it was again safe to visit Maseru, SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported. South  Africa's Ambassador to Lesotho Gerhard Visser said it was no  longer dangerous to visit the Lesotho capital, where a minister  was shot dead and four others were kidnapped on Thursday.    Troops occupied a hill overlooking Maseru on Friday morning  and sporadic rifle fire was heard, but the city was otherwise  calm.    The reason for Thursday's revolt could not yet be  determined,  but it was reported the soldiers who took part in the  insurrection bore a grudge against Deputy Prime Minister  Selometsi Baholo, who was killed on Thursday, and Justice  Minister Kelebone Maope.    The two ministers earlier this year took part in talks at  which rationalisation of the Lesotho Defence Force was  recommended.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: SNEEZING CAT MAY SPREAD INFECTION  </P> <P> Q: In the past week, my two cats have started to sneeze and have runny eyes.  They both are eating OK but look like they feel bad. My husband and I have both  had colds recently and I wonder if my cats were able to catch our colds. Is  this possible? They are both indoor/outdoor cats and have always been very  healthy. What should I do to treat them?  </P> <P> Mrs. John Sharpe, Garden Grove  </P> <P> A: It is extremely unlikely that your cats got their colds from you because  most cold viruses tend to be species specific. However, cats do occasionally  have an organism called chlamydia psittaci, which causes runny eyes and  sneezing and could be spread to humans. In man, if the organism comes into  contact with your eyes, it can cause a burning, watery eye irritation. I would  recommend that you wash your hands thoroughly after handling your sneezing cats  and try not to let them sneeze into your face. Fortunately, the eye infection  is treatable with antibiotics.  </P> <P> You should have your cats examined by your veterinarian to help determine what  type of infection they may have. It would also be wise to update your cat's  vaccinations, especially for chlamydia. Your vet will most likely start your  cats on antibiotics and eye medication to help ease their symptoms and  discomfort.  </P> <P> Cats also can get a herpes virus that can cause upper respiratory problems,  including sneezing. This virus can be spread to people by contact with the  discharge, and can cause some irritation. If you follow proper cleanliness  after handling your sneezing cats, your risk for exposure is minimal. In either  case, there are vaccines available to help protect your cats.  </P> <P> Q: This may be a silly question but can cats or dogs see colors? Our dog  occasionally watches TV, and I wonder if he can see the colors or is it just  the motion?  </P> <P> NNS, Santa Ana  </P> <P> A: Cats and dogs do not have the ability to see colors other than black and  white and the various shades in between. The retina or back part of the eye  that receives light does not have the proper neuro receivers for sensing color.  Your dog may be responding to the motion or sounds coming from the television  when he "watches" TV.  </P></p>

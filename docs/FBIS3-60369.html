			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EUREKA Project To Measure CO2 Levels </F> Receives Euro-Tag"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS  Database]    [Text] The CARIOCA project, an undertaking which aims to  develop and commercialise a special buoy designed to measure CO2  levels at the surface of the oceans, has been awarded the  European R&amp;D designation EUREKA [European Research  Coordination  Agency], the Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP), one of the  leading organisations involved in the scheme, announced on  October 26. The buoy is expected to automatically carry out  precise measurements in the middle of the ocean for a period of  up to a year at a time, using the spectrophotometry technique.  Buoys of this type could eventually form a worldwide  ocean-monitoring network, under the aegis of the Global Ocean  Observing System (GOOS) programme.    Studying levels of carbon dioxide absorption by the oceans  is  a sine qua non for a serious investigation of the Earth's  climate. Atmospheric studies, which show a 25&percnt; increase  in CO2  concentrations, and the theoretical models which describe  absorption of the gas by the oceans do not together fully  account for the total estimated volumes of carbon dioxide  released into the environment since the start of the Industrial  Revolution. The discrepancy in the two sets of figures could  well be due to the speed of CO2 absorption into the oceans.</p>

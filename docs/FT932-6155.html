			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Power Corporation takes holding in Time Warner CANADA'S Power Corporation has bought a small stake in Time Warner, the US entertainment group, reinforcing signals that the company is seeking a role in international communications. Power's purchase of a 1 per cent stake in Time Warner, for USDollars 99m, was disclosed in documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission by Seagram, the drinks group which revealed this week it had built up a 5.7 per cent interest in Time Warner. The Seagram and Power investments are bound to heighten the speculation which has swirled around Time Warner since the death of its chairman, Mr Steven Ross, in December. Seagram insisted yesterday the purchases by the two Montreal-based companies took place independently, and were 'not part of any co-ordinated strategy'. A Power official declined to comment. Seagram has indicated it plans to lift its investment in Time Warner to 15 per cent to fulfil a long search for a 'third leg' to complement its drinks business and its 24 per cent stake in EI Du Pont, the US chemicals group. Seagram and Power have a number of links with each other. Mr Paul Desmarais, Power's chairman and controlling shareholder, sits on the Seagram board, while Mr Charles Bronfman, whose family controls Seagram, is a Power director. Mr Desmarais, together with unidentified European investors, last year sought to interest Seagram in a joint investment in Time Warner's entertainment division. Power, which has access to cash resources of about CDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 1.96m) is also thought to have considered a much bigger investment in the Time Warner parent last autumn. A Seagram official, however, said these discussions were 'very brief and fleeting'. He said Mr Desmarais absented himself from deliberations by Seagram's board on the Time Warner investment. Power already owns a number of Canadian newspapers and radio and TV stations. Through its affiliate, Pargesa, the Geneva-based merchant bank, it also jointly controls Radio-Television Luxembourg. Two months ago, Power paid CDollars 180m for an 18.7 per cent stake in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper publisher. Power also has substantial interests in financial services in north America and Europe.</p>

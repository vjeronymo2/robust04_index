Rehn's  success mainly redounded to the disadvantage of Raimo Ilaskivi  (Conservative Party), and Rehn was moreover the candidate who  garnered most votes across party lines.    The results were analyzed by a Statistics Center report that  was published immediately after the first stage of the  presidential election on Monday [17 January]. The Statistics  Center compared the votes received by the candidates' political  parties in the last municipal elections and constructed special  profiles for each candidate.    The support for first-round winner Martti Ahtisaari (Social  Democratic Party [SDP]) derived mainly from areas where the SDP  is strong, completely different from the pattern in Rehn's  support.    Looking at where the SDP ran strong in the municipal  elections, Ahtisaari won in Helsinki and Oulu, and in the Kuopio  and Lapland electoral districts, and did worst in Northern  Karelia and Kymi electoral districts. In his hometown Oulu and  in the Kuopio electoral district Ahtisaari won the leftist vote.    Ahtisaari also seems to have run strongly among high income  earners. He was the victor in 67 of Finland's richest 113  municipalities, and Rehn in 27.    Ahtisaari was the winner in most large cities. Some  exceptions included Espoo, Kokkola, and Vantaa, where Rehn was  victor.  <H5>  The Unemployed Favored Paavo Vayrynen </H5>   Center Party candidate Paavo Vayrynen appears to have been  the favorite in areas of heavy unemployment. He won in 7O of the  12O municipalities in which unemployment has grown most rapidly.    Second most favored in areas of heavy unemployment was  Ahtisaari and third was Keijo Korhonen (Center Party).    Having campaigned as a strong leader, Vayrynen received  strong support also from those municipalities in which incomes  fall below the national average. Vayrynen came out somewhat  poorly in regions where his Center Party is strong, but did well  in areas where Center Party strength is weak.    Vayrynen's support was greatest in sparsely populated  agricultural districts.  <H5>  Ilaskivi Lost in Cities </H5>   According to the Statistics Center, Ilaskivi did poorly in  areas in which the personal income level is high and that have  been the basis of Conservative Party electoral strength.  Ilaskivi's losses were larger in cities than in less densely  populated municipalities.    Comparing figures for Rehn and Ilaskivi, it appears that  part  of the Conservative vote went to Rehn.    Korhonen was especially favored in cities, from which he got  over half his votes. His support was as expected strongest in  Kainuu, where he took votes from Vayrynen.    The Left Alliance lost most votes as a party, compared with  the 1992 municipal elections. Support for Claes Andersson  dropped from the figure for the latter elections especially in  the Lapland, Oulu, and Kuopio electoral districts. The Left  Alliance voters also deserted Andersson in the northern  electoral districts of Turku and Pori counties.    Support for Pertti Virtanen was slightly larger in cities  than in rural areas.    Eeva Kuuskoski garnered two-thirds of her votes from cities.    Finns residing abroad most strongly supported Rehn, who got  3O.9 percent. Following her were Ahtisaari (29.5), Ilaskivi  (14), and Vayrynen (12.4).    Kuuskoski, Andersson, Korhonen, and Virtanen got small  percentages of the foreign Finns' vote, and the bottom  candidates some tenths of a percent.    Those casting their ballots in Sweden favored most Ahtisaari  (33.2 percent), followed by Rehn (32.8). Then came Vayrynen  (14.4) and Ilaskivi (7.3).</p>

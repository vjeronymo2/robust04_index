			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- Slovak Deputy Premier  Brigita Schmognerova today rejected opposition claims that the  government was capitulating before the restrictive policy  demands of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).    "It is easy to accuse somebody but hard to argue," she said  at a press conference. She refuted the opposition claims by  citing from documents showing the former government led by  Vladimir Meciar was planning -- shortly before being ousted by a  no-confidence vote in March -- to introduce a 20 per cent rise  in the price of energy and increase the pension age to 65 for  both men and women. The measures would meet the conditions  required to qualify for an IMF loan.    Meciar said at Jedlove Kostolany, west Slovakia, on Friday  [17 June] that it was inhuman to send 65-year-olds into  retirement when the average life expectancy for Slovak men was  67.    At the same meeting Sergej Kozlik, deputy premier in the  Meciar government, compared the commitments given to the IMF by  the present government of Jozef Moravcik to a cowpat in a field:  one person stops before it, the other treads in it. "Whose  boots are going to stink now? The Moravcik government's!"  Kozlik said.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: The end of an independent life - The Pounds 16m sale of Dale Electric to the TT Group Mr Iain Dale did not try to hide his sadness. On Friday he and his fellow directors at Dale Electric recommended that shareholders accept an offer that would end the independent life of the company his father founded in 1935. 'Of course I am sad, but there is no place for sentiment in these things.' There will be no place for Mr Dale in TT Group, the acquisitive conglomerate which is offering Pounds 16m for the North Yorkshire-based generator manufacturer. But he believes the best way forward for the company is as part of a larger group, partly because of increasing competition in international markets. 'The world we face after the recession will be even more competitive than in the past, and I think we will see other smaller companies facing the realities of the future and deciding they do not have the critical mass.' For a company with only 600 employees and sales of Pounds 48m Dale is very widely spread. Based in Filey it sells into more than 100 countries. Exports account for more than half its turnover and go to operations as far afield as Thailand, Mexico and Nigeria. 'We are right in the forefront of world competition and everything we do has to be the best,' says Mr Dale. 'We have to have the lowest production costs and highest quality and though we have done very, very well as a group there is a limit to our financial flexibility. That limits the speed with which we can introduce new products and develop new markets.' Dale has been an export-led company almost from the start. Mr Dale's late father, Leonard, a milkman turned electrician who set up in business with 11/8d in 1935, started making generators after the war. When an early advertisement in Farmers' Weekly brought an inquiry from an ex-pat in Kenya the export business was born. After steady growth in the 1960s Dale went public in 1972 and was soon enjoying a boom in exports to the oil-rich Middle East. Back home, sales of its stand-by generators were boosted by power strikes and its share price surged as profits topped Pounds 3m in 1978. But in the early 1980s the combination of the UK recession, the strong pound and problems in some of its key export markets dealt it a heavy blow from which it has never fully recovered. Swiss Bank Corporation's Mr Peter Corley, who brought Dale and TT together, argues that Dale spread itself too thinly. 'It has a good range of products but has not had the financial muscle to get the best from them. It did not have the resources to develop markets quickly enough.' In view of its patchy record over the last ten years Mr Dale admits: 'Maybe with hindsight it would have been better to sell out ten years ago.' There was an opportunity in 1987 when Dale fought off a bid worth 136p a share from the much smaller Sunleigh. The shares reached a high of 147p in 1989 compared with yesterday's close of 72p. Longer term shareholders have done even worse. Allowing for a one-for-one scrip issue in 1977 the shares were floated at 56p which after 22 years of inflation would be worth more than Pounds 4. But Dale is held in great affection by many in the financial community. Mr Rodney Lambert, a long-time follower at Roy James, the Birmingham stockbrokers, agrees that it might have been better if it had sold before. But, like many, he finds it hard to criticise. 'The TT deal is a good one given current conditions but I am sorry to see it go.'</p>

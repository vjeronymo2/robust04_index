			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER  </P> <P> The nomination of John Tower has gone too far. With wild accusations, Tower's  detractors have tried to portray him as a man unfit for the job of secretary of  defense. In fact, there is nobody better qualified than Tower for this  position.  </P> <P> Tower's history of alcoholism has been brought up numerous times as a reason  for denying his nomination, despite the fact that there is no evidence to  support the accusation that he is an alcoholic now. In case you haven't heard,  alcoholism is curable. I wonder how an alcoholic can be chairman of the Senate  Armed Services Committee, can chair the U.S. delegation at the strategic arms  reduction talks, can effectively lobby for major defense contractors, and can  provide "senior management" for several major defense contractors. This  experience makes Tower the best qualified person for nomination by President  Bush.  </P> <P> Tower has also been accused of seldom meeting a weapons system he didn't like.  He is being condemned by the very same people who have voted to fund those very  same weapons systems. During the Reagan years, Tower was afforded the luxury of  being able to fund any weapons system he liked, but this doesn't mean that he  cannot function with a restrictive budget. It is not enough reason to deny the  nomination because Tower may fail somehow to budget.  </P> <P> John Tower has nothing against him and everything for him; his confirmation  should not be delayed any longer.  </P> <P> SCOTT HARRISON  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

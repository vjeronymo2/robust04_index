			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Eight die as Tajik police fire on Dushanbe protesters RIOT police in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan opened fire on a crowd in the capital Dushanbe yesterday, killing at least eight people and wounding many more, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. Interfax news agency quoted General Anatoly Martovitsky, head of Tajikistan's national border guards, as saying a crowd of armed people had tried to break into the KGB building, where some government officials have been hiding since the conservative leadership, under President Rakhmon Nabiyev, collapsed last week. Police initially fired warning shots in the air, but their fire was returned from the crowd, Gen Martovitsky said. The police then fired directly into the crowd, which scattered. There were dead and wounded on both sides, he added. The shooting shattered a brief period of calm which followed Thursday's victory by Moslem and democratic forces protesting against the government of the central Asian state.</p>

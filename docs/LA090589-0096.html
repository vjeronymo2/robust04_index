			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ORIOLES NEED GREAT SEPTEMBER FROM RIPKEN TO WIN DIVISION  </P> <P> It is September. Children's hour is over. In this season of the Kid-O's, it's  time for a veteran to step forward.  </P> <P> It so happens the Orioles have the ideal candidate.  </P> <P> You know him. You love him. He has the most famous shoulders in Baltimore. The  question is: Are they broad enough to carry the Orioles to a division title?  </P> <P> Maybe this is a better question: Are they broad enough to carry the Orioles to  an extra-base hit?  </P> <P> Obviously, the burden of leadership falls to shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. He is, by  most measures, a superstar. He has the rep. He has the history. And now,  perhaps more than at any single moment in his career, the Orioles need him to  live up to that standard.  </P> <P> Maybe that's too much to ask, but what options are left to the Orioles? Mickey  Tettleton isn't ready yet to carry anyone. In his first day back from a knee  injury, he pinch hit Sunday and struck out on four pitches. Keith Moreland, who  in four at-bats Saturday did not hit a ball past the pitcher's mound, has been  a bust. Just put him in a museum. Larry Sheets is in the last throes of  consecutive disastrous seasons. Phil Bradley, slumping anyway, is a run-scorer,  not a run-producer.  </P> <P> That pretty much leaves Ripken, the team's cornerstone.  </P> <P> "This is the guy you want up at the plate with the game on the line, or in any  tough situation," Manager Frank Robinson said of his perennial All-Star. "Right  now, he's just not producing the way you'd expect or hope.  </P> <P> "We need him. We need someone. One guy can do it. One guy can step forward and  lead us."  </P> <P> Who, if not Ripken?  </P> <P> "You can't expect the young players to do that now," Robinson was saying. "What  you get from (Mike) Devereaux or (Randy) Milligan or (Tim) Hulett or even  (Craig) Worthington, that's just a bonus. You look for your veterans at this  time of the year."  </P> <P> The Orioles must find someone. In their last 44 innings, they've scored six  runs, with no extra-base hits. Not a bloop double. Not a pop fly that someone  loses in the lights. And they haven't hit a homer in a week, since Ripken's  shot last Sunday.  </P> <P> In Sunday's game, another big game in what will be a month of big games, the  Orioles had a shot to catch Toronto Blue Jays, who were, in an upset, losing to  the Minnesota Twins. But Oriole starter Jeff Ballard wasn't as sharp as usual,  and the Orioles' bats missed another wake-up call. And yet, there were a few  chances in what would be a 4-2 defeat.  </P> <P> In the first, Ripken came to the plate with a runner on second and struck out.  In the sixth, he had runners on first and third and nobody out and grounded  into a double play, his team-leading 19th of the season. In the eighth, with a  runner on, he represented the tying run and flied to left.  </P> <P> "It's not the pressure," said Ripken, talking about the team's batting  problems. "It's just a slump."  </P> <P> Asked about his production, he said, "I don't want to have to analyze it now."  </P> <P> He has said often that he likes to lead by example. In the field, he may be  having his best season. No one ever disputes his work ethic. But at the plate,  he is struggling. Every other week, he changes his stance and you can almost  sense the frustration he must be feeling.  </P> <P> A look at his recent numbers is not heartening for Oriole fans. He is hitting  .266 this season and .260 over the last three seasons. He has 41 extra-base  hits this season, which, if he doesn't pass last year's total of 49, would mark  his sixth consecutive year of decline. After walking 102 times last year, he  has drawn only 44 this season, indicating a lack of patience and an attendant  widening of the strike zone. And although he leads the team with 79 runs batted  in, he has fewer RBI per at bat than either Worthington or Tettleton.  </P> <P> In the glory years of the not-that-long-ago past, the Orioles had a man who  could take his teammates by the hand and lead them. This player, who had been  their greatest run-producer since Robinson himself, was, of course, traded in  the off-season. Eddie Murray, for better or worse, was one who could carry a  team. Ripken would often marvel at that particular quality and suggest that he,  for some reason, couldn't provide that same spark. Murray led, Ripken followed.  </P> <P> While it's true that the Orioles would never have been in contention without  having traded the contentious Murray, it's true now that they need someone like  the old Murray.  </P> <P> The only one on the team anything like him is Ripken. He's going to the Hall of  Fame someday. You can make book on that. When he chose to stay with the Orioles  last winter instead of looking to a team that might not be in a long rebuilding  process, it was the first and perhaps most important step on the way back for  the Orioles. He is their anchor, but can he be their leader?  </P> <P> Surely, he has many great moments ahead of him. But, if the Orioles are to pull  off this miracle of a season, they're going to need one great month from him.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 16 (AFP) -- Russian special envoy on  ex- Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin, said Saturday [16 April]  Bosnian Serb forces had assured him that they did not plan to  take the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    Speaking here after meeting UN special envoy on  ex-Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi, Churkin said: "The two very firm assurances I  think I got from them (the Bosnian Serbs) is that it is not  their intention to take the town. It is not their intention to  shell the town."    Serb forces were Saturday consolidating their position  around  the eastern town, which now shelters around 70,000 people, after  capturing the last strategic positions in the area Friday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, April 14 (AFP) -- Somali warlord Mohamed  Farah Aidid's faction has seized control of the town of Merca,  south of Mogadishu, a United Nations official in Nairobi said  Thursday [14 April].    Fighters of General Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA)  took over the town, 75 kilometres (45 miles) from Mogadishu, on  Tuesday, said Huntley Anderson, a UN spokesman in Nairobi.    Merca had been rocked by weeks of clashes between SNA  militiamen and fighters of a rival faction, the Southern Somali  National Movement (SSNM) which formerly controlled Merca.    The two groups had been allies until they fell out during  UN-sponsored peace talks in the Kenyan capital Nairobi last  month.    The SSNM then joined the Group of 12 factions led by Aidid's  chief enemy, self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed.    Anderson said the UN had evacuated its four international  staffers from Merca to Mogadishu this week.    Details of the fighting in Merca and the number of  casualties  were unknown.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Telekom plan approved GERMANY'S main parliamentary groups have given the go-ahead to the plan which will pave the way for the eventual privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunication monopoly. However, the plan was criticised by the German chamber of commerce and industry, which yesterday said that creating a state-controlled holding company would hinder the international competitiveness of Deutsche Telekom. The German industry federation was critical, too. Mr Tyll Necker, its president, said 'the ability of Deutsche Telekom to go to the stock market will not be secured under the present privatisation plan'. In an internal vote, the parliamentary groups of both the governing parties and the opposition Social Democrats voted for a government plan which will allow Deutsche Telekom to start selling shares on the stock exchange as early as the middle of 1996. The plan foresees the creation of three separate joint-stock companies for Deutsche Telekom, the postal service and the postal bank. These would operate under a state holding company. The holding company would retain a 50 per cent stake in Deutsche Telekom as long as the latter has a monopoly in basic telephone services and lines. The majority stake would be relinquished once the European telecoms market is opened up in 1998, as recently agreed by the EC. The plan also provides for the holding company to oversee the maintainance of the telecom infrastructure.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Talk is cheaper with voice-activated WP - Worth Watching A voice-activated word processor is now available for less than Pounds 5,000. Developed in the UK by Shakespeare Speechwriter, the Compaq hardware uses the latest Intel 486 to give dictation speeds of 30 words a minute. The Speechwriter has a 80,000-word dictionary and users can add their own catalogue of words. To train the speaker-dependent system, the user says 200 words three times each, from which the software extrapolates pronunciations for all the other words in the dictionary.

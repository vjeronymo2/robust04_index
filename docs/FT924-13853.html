			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Record sales boost Intel quarterly income by 19% INTEL, the leading US semiconductor chip manufacturer, yesterday unveiled record third-quarter revenues and higher-than-anticipated earnings. Net income rose 19 per cent to Dollars 241m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, from Dollars 202,m or 96 cents, a year earlier. Revenue was Dollars 1.43bn, up 20 per cent from Dollars 1.19bn. 'This was the best quarter in our history,' said Mr Andrew Grove, chief executive. 'Our products are enjoying broad acceptance in the marketplace; our factories are performing at record levels, and our bookings are excellent.' Third-quarter results were driven by strong personal computer sales as buyers took advantage of falling systems prices. Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips that form the 'brains' of personal computers. Sales of Intel 486 microprocessors exceeded those of the older Intel 386 products for the first time. 'The Intel 486 microprocessor is clearly the new personal computer standard,' noted Mr Grove. The company said business conditions were strongest in the US and Europe, although improvement was beginning to be seen in the Asia-Pacific area. The shift to the Intel 486, combined with a weak dollar, was fuelling business overseas, even in economically troubled Japan. During the quarter Intel declared the first cash dividend it its history of 10 cents per share. For the first nine months, net income wasDollars 638m, or Dollars 2.98 per share, against Dollars 630m or Dollars 3.01 1991. Revenues were Dollars 4bn, up from Dollars 3.6bn. Advanced Micro Devices , which competes with Intel in the microprocessor market, said its was proceeding with plans for a 'timely introduction of its versions of the 486 microprocessor' following rulings on Friday in a long-running copyright dispute between Intel and AMD. In June a jury found that AMD had used Intel 'microcode', the internal programs that control a microprocessor, without licence. The case addressed an earlier math co-processor chip, but forced AMD to postpone plans to launch its own versions of the 486 microprocessor. Now AMD believes that the jury decision 'does not resolve questions related to AMD's rights to microcode in microprocessors', which will await a ruling by the judge.</p>

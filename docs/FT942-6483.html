			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: The moment of truth for Crispian Hotson - Michael Smith begins a series of profiles on potential bidders for British Coal Crispian Hotson was in a hurry when he arrived in the UK 10 years ago after a spell in the US. He thought the British coal industry was about to be privatised and saw it as a 'wonderful opportunity'. His timing was way out. He will find out soon whether he was right about the opportunities. Mr Hotson's Ryan Group last week notified the government that it was interested in bidding for three of the five British Coal regions which are being sold off in the return of the industry to the private sector after 47 years of state control. Ryan faces considerable competition but Mr Hotson does not intend to be thwarted. 'I have been waiting for this moment for 10 years,' he says. 'It was my whole raison d'etre for investing in coal.' A 42-year-old South African, Mr Hotson is a life-long opponent of apartheid but says that was not his motivation for leaving the country. 'My father told me the best business opportunities were outside South Africa.' he says. After taking a degree in natural sciences at Cambridge, stints in the US copper and coal industries gave him the wherewithall and money to return to the UK in 1983 to take over at Ryan, a coal recovery company capitalised at Pounds 4m. 'My merchant bankers said I was crazy to get involved in coal and in Wales. They told me to keep on taking the pills and take lots of sleep. 'But I saw the chance of taking the rigid structures out of a nationalised industry and was convinced the UK government would privatise coal before electricity.' In spite of his miscalculation, Mr Hotson can look back on some significant successes. Helped by the acquisition of the Derek Crouch contracting company in the north-east of England in 1987, Ryan is a significant force in opencast coal. In Dalquhandy, Lanarkshire, and Stobswood, Northumberland, it has two of the largest and longest lasting opencast mining contracts in the country. The UK opencast operations produce more than 3.5m tonnes of the company's 5m tonnes a year of coal, most of the rest being mined in the US (1m tonnes) and Poland (150,000 tonnes). Operating profits have been generally healthy and Mr Hotson estimates that Ryan, in which he and other managers have a 25 per cent stake, will make about Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 110m this year. Mr Hotson is respected among his mining peers. 'He is bright and sharp,' says one British potential rival bidder for British Coal. 'He knows the industry inside out.' But Mr Hotson's 10-year period at Ryan has had some fraught moments, most of them emanating from an abortive attempt to merge with Carless, the UK oil independent in 1988, and a subsequent decision to mount a highly leveraged Pounds 70m management buy-out at Ryan. With coal companies poorly rated at the time, the buy-out must have seemed a good idea for a company which had long term plans and thought the stock market concentrated too much on the short term. But the high debts incurred in staging the MBO was the main reason why Ryan made losses of Pounds 4m two years ago. In spite of a financial restructuring, which involved Electra, the venture capital group, taking a 25 per cent stake in the company, debts remain high at Pounds 60m. The debts will also reduce pre-tax profits to about Pounds 4m this year from Pounds 9m at the operating level. Rivals say the indebtedness puts Ryan at a disadvantage, especially as the company cannot tap the stock market for funds. Mr Hotson sees no disadvantage, saying that a private company has as much access to equity capital, and is confident of being able to bid for all three regions, the north-east of England, Scotland and south Wales, where he has pre-qualified. Ryan's negotiating power should be strengthened by its decision to mount two of the potential bids with partners - Alcan, the Canadian aluminium company, in Scotland, and Miller, the construction group, in the north-east of England. And if they are successful, Mr Hotson has no doubts about Ryan's ability to make a success of assets which British Coal has struggled to make profitable for years. 'When the UK coal industry was producing 100m tonnes a year it was never going to be competitive. But it can certainly make money at half that level,' he says. Ryan would consider employing different mining techniques from British Coal and would try to involve employees more, not least through share ownership schemes. None of this is particularly unusual. What marks Mr Hotson and Ryan out from the pack are their staying power. 'He has hung on in there through thick and thin for a decade,' says one coal executive. 'No-one could call him an opportunist. He deserves at least something from the British Coal spoils.'</p>

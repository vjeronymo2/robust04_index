			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov has arrived on  an official visit in Ankara as the guest of President Suleyman  Demirel. At Esenboga Airport Niyazov was received by Demirel.  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and other officials were also  present at the ceremony.    In reply to a question by a correspondent from the Turkmen  television, Demirel expressed his satisfaction in welcoming  Niyazov in Ankara. He said: Turkmenistan is our ancestral  homeland. Turkey is your and my precious brother Niyazov's  second motherland. Pointing out that Turkey's relations with  Turkmenistan have developed excellently in the last two and a  half years, Demirel said that positive developments can be  observed in bilateral relations.    [Begin Demirel recording] We will review everything. We  will give them another push. I remember Niyazov's last visit to  Turkey three years ago. Our relations since then have developed  as though these three years were actually 30. We extend our  love and greetings to our brethren in Turkmenistan. We will  work together for the happiness of these two brotherly peoples.  I am very happy that I am extending my love and my greetings to  the Turkmen people through this television that is being  inaugurated today. Our good relations will continue for  eternity. Long live Turkish-Turkmen cooperation and  brotherhood. [end recording]    An official welcoming ceremony for Niyazov was held at the  Cankaya Mansion. After the national anthems of the two  countries were played, the two presidents inspected the honor  guard. Acting Assembly Speaker Kamer Genc, Deputy Chief of  Staff General Ahmet Corekci, Cetin, Agricultural and Village  Affairs Minister Refaiddin Sahin, Energy and Natural Resource  Minister Veysel Atasoy, and other ministers were present at the  ceremony.    Addressing the ceremony, Demirel said: I welcome you from  our ancestral land Central Asia, Turkmenistan, to your second  homeland, Turkey. Pointing out that there exist special, strong  and deep-rooted ties based on a joint history between the two  countries, Demirel added that the adjective Turk in the names of  both peoples descending from the great Oghuz tribes is the best  symbol of these special ties. He noted that the bilateral  relations and cooperation, which were based on a strong  foundation in the aftermath of Turkmenistan's independence, are  developing speedily in line with the will and wishes of the two  peoples. He added that the relations and cooperation in  question will gain a new impetus and strength as a result of  Niyazov's visit.    [Begin Demirel recording] We are observing with appreciation  the reforms and developments Turkmenistan has accomplished under  the efficient leadership of Niyazov in all walks of state and  community life as well as the contributions it has made to peace  and stability in Central Asia. We believe that brotherly  Turkmenistan, which is an important country in the region, will  best use all its resources to overcome the obstacles and  difficulties of this transition period and that it will become a  developed and prosperous country. Turkey will continue its  policy of aid to and support for Turkmenistan. [end recording]    Demirel stated that Turkish firms have undertaken  significant  projects worth $1.28 billion in Turkmenistan. Noting that there  are some 2,600 Turkmen students studying with scholarships in  Turkey, Demirel stressed that communications and travel between  the two countries are increasing. Demirel said:    Turkish-Turkmen relations are based on equality,  noninterference in domestic affairs, mutual interests, love, and  respect. Our relations and cooperation also serve regional  development, prosperity, stability, and peace. Our relations  should, naturally, be further advanced. The two sides have the  political will to achieve that goal. These points will be taken  up in my talks with my brother Niyazov. Furthermore, we will  exchange views on regional problems concerning our countries and  international issues.    Niyazov said that such visits, which have become a  tradition,  constitute an opportunity to review the developments that have  been achieved so far. He stated that the two countries have  great potential, adding that the administrators of these two  countries should make the most of these great opportunities.  Niyazov, who will begin his official contacts tomorrow, will  leave Turkey on 29 June.</p>

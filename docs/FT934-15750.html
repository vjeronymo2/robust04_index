			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Rates cut at Lloyd's LLOYD'S of London is cutting its premium rates for life insurance by up to 14 per cent, to help it compete with other life insurers. The largest reductions are in Keyman cover, where companies insure top employees or directors to protect against financial loss if they die. The average reduction for standard life premiums is 5 per cent. The nine syndicates which make up Lloyd's life insurance market offer only term insurance, rather than the whole of life policies also offered by other insurance companies. The maximum term is 10 years, but individuals can be insured for as short a period as one day. Lloyd's has specialised traditionally in arranging flexible cover for unusual risks which most insurers would not consider. Anyone planning to join a relief convoy to Bosnia next week would not be welcomed by most of the big-name life insurance companies, but Lloyd's is used to accepting that kind of risk - although standard premiums would, of course, be raised. The short-term cover can also be useful if the increased risk is for a limited period: say, a three-week trip to a war zone or a day's parachuting for charity. Cover can be arranged through traditional Lloyd's brokers or through other insurance brokers or financial intermediaries. As an example of the reduced rates, a non-smoking man aged 45 next birthday, and wanting a sum assured of Pounds 250,000 over five years, would pay an annual premium of Pounds 562.50 rather than the previous Pounds 642.50. Women are now rated as if they were five years younger than men, rather than four as previously.</p>

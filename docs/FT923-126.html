			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Management: Sit where you like - Executives are being deprived of their desks to save space but there are compensations An Englishman's home may still be his castle, but the fortifications around his workspace are collapsing as property prices and the quest for greater efficiency batter traditional ideas of office organisation. Open plan offices, it is clear, were the thin edge of the wedge. Executives 'owned ' their desks but shared a communal working space. Now, a number of companies are beginning to implement the concept of 'hotdesking' or the 'virtual office', where executives own neither desk nor workspace but make use of any desk that is free during visits to the office. The pioneers of hotdesking in the UK are the large multinational computer companies, International Business Machines (IBM) and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), as well as Andersen Consulting, the management consultancy. Clearly, it is a concept suited only to organisations where staff spend appreciable amounts of time away from their desks and where office space is at a premium. Andersen's consultants, for example, are as often at clients' premises as in the company's Arundel Street, London, offices. Hotdesking, Andersen claims, is making possible an occupancy ratio in Arundel Street of three square metres a person, or one third the conventional rate. The two computer companies say that technology is both the reason for, and the key to, hotdesking. All traditional computer manufacturers have been hard hit by a combination of the recession, price collapse caused by technological advances and static demand. As a consequence, they are 'rightsizing', laying off staff and closing facilities while looking for ways to make more economical use of space. Hotdesking for such companies is possible only because of the 'intelligence' it is possible to build into a desk through computers and clever telephone systems. While IBM has experimented with hotdesking at a number of its older sites in the UK, its recently completed Pounds 60m national marketing centre in New Square, Bedfont Lakes, a few minutes from London's Heathrow Airport, is the company's first offices purpose-built for the new approach. Open plan offices are spread round the periphery of the building at three levels, with open spaces in the centre providing communal dining and recreational facilities. The overall impression is of black girders, bolts and glass. IBM's idea in developing Bedfont Lakes was to consolidate staff scattered around four leased buildings in west London on to one long-term site. Eventually there will be 1,000 people in the building. At present, it is only about half full as staff move from the older offices, but IBM's planners reckon they are achieving between 20 and 30 per cent space savings compared with traditional office organisation. IBM's ideas of shared space go back to 1988 when its planners noticed that unoccupied space was growing as the nature of work changed. Surveys showed that desks were typically used for little more than two-thirds of the working week and usually much less. Research also revealed that while most of the company's larger customers already had an IBM terminal on their premises, IBM's own employees were in favour of portable technology and flexibility in their place of work. Customers, software developers and systems builders had all taken precedence over IBM's own marketing and sales specialists when it had come to the allocation of the latest computing technology. This unfulfilled desire for flexibility formed the basis for a unique deal. Employees were persuaded to give up their personal space - individual desks and offices - but in exchange were given the latest IBM personal computer technology, including portable systems. In other words, Bedfont Lakes staff have traded off a loss of identity in the workplace against freedom. IBM's own surveys suggest they are at least as happy in the new environment as they were in the old. Work areas at Bedfont Lakes are of two sorts; one for staff who come into the office every day and which are little different from traditional offices. Then there are the hotdesks which offer standard facilities throughout the building. Each member of staff has his or her own secure locker for personal effects. There are larger, lockable filing cabinets for documents and records used by work groups. Each hotdesk is equipped with a personal computer connected to the corporate network, a point to plug in a portable computer and a telephone handset. When staff visit the building, they find an empty desk and key into the computer system which automatically sends their own electronic mail and telephone messages to that workspace. In practice, staff tend to use the same desk or one close to it; members of work groups cluster together as if they owned the same desks and office space. Robert Young, a customer service specialist, says: 'I thought I was not going to like it, but it is working quite well.' He now uses a laptop computer in the office and at home. It is an innovation which has opened new possibilities for staff. 'Some people in this department are quite determined never to go into the office again,' one manager admitted.</p>

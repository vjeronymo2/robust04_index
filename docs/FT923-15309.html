			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: South Africa to change control of airports SOUTH AFRICA is to take its airports and air traffic services out of direct government control and into two new companies. Mr Piet Welgemoed, South African transport minister, will today announce the approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals. The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the companies but both will be run on a commercial basis and the government should be able to phase out subsidies. The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles 12m passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport. Eight others will be affected, including Cape Town and Durban airports. South Africa is increasingly popular for air traffic: over the past year, 25 more airlines have applied for access rights. Legislation will have to be passed before the plan can proceed and this is expected by next spring. The government will set up a regulation committee for the two companies, but it will not be able to intervene in everyday affairs.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANUEL CALDERA PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD;  </P> <P> PENTAGON: THE L.A. FOUNDER OF AMEX SYSTEMS ADMITS TO BRIBING TWO NAVY ENGINEERS  TO HELP HIM LAND CONTRACTS.  </P> <P> Manuel R. Caldera, a former Los Angeles defense contractor active in community  affairs, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy to commit bribery and defraud the  United States in connection with a defense contracting scandal.  </P> <P> The 59-year-old investment banker and founder of Amex Systems Inc. faces seven  years imprisonment and $500,000 in fines.  </P> <P> Caldera, named Hispanic Businessman of the Year by President Reagan in 1983,  became the 39th person to be convicted in connection with the two-year-old  Pentagon procurement investigation known as Operation Ill Wind.  </P> <P> Caldera entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in  suburban Alexandria, Va.  </P> <P> He admitted giving thousands of dollars to two Navy engineers, Stuart E. Berlin  and James D. Sampson, "in return for their assistance in obtaining and  maintaining contracts with the United States Navy," according to a government  statement filed with his plea.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica said Caldera bribed the engineers to obtain  six contracts for his small company from 1978 to 1984. The contracts were  awarded to Amex Systems under the minority enterprise program managed by the  Small Business Administration, which does not require competitive bidding,  Aronica said.  </P> <P> "The contracts had a value of approximately $40 million, with potential  follow-on value of an additional $100 million between 1984 and 1988," the  prosecutor said. He added that Caldera sold Amex Systems in November, 1984, for  $45 million, receiving $28 million as his share. In addition to founding the  company, he was its chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> After the 1984 Amex Systems sale, Caldera began operating an investment banking  firm under his name in West Los Angeles. He has been a prominent contributor to  Latino candidates on all political levels and received minor appointments from  Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> "I'm one of the lucky ones," he said in a 1983 interview with The Times. "I'm  an American and a Mexican. I'm rich and honorable. Who could ask for anything  more?"  </P></p>

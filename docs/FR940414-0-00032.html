			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PBGC believes that similar relief should be available for plans terminating in distress terminations pursuant to section 4041(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the PBGC's distress termination regulation (29 CFR part 2616). Sections 2616.3(b), 2616.24, and 2616.25(c)(2) establish deadlines for filing a distress termination notice and related information with the PBGC. Section 2616.27(a)(1) establishes the deadline for issuing notices of benefit distribution in those few terminations where the plan is sufficient for at least guaranteed benefits and, accordingly, plan assets may be distributed to participants and beneficiaries in a manner similar to a standard termination distribution. (The notices of distribution are similar to the notices of plan benefits required in standard terminations under 29 CFR 2617.23.) Finally, &sect;2616.29(a)(1) contains distribution procedures and deadlines that are generally the same as those in standard terminations; that section cross-references 29 CFR 2617.28 (c), (e), and (f) and provides the same 180-day (unless extended) deadline for distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments in this final rule permit the PBGC's Executive Director (or his or her designee) to extend the above deadlines in the same circumstances as were provided for standard terminations in the interim rule. (The PBGC did not include distress terminations in the interim rule because the small number of distress terminations filed annually lessened the need for prompt action; however, these provisions are essentially procedural in that they establish alternative mechanisms for obtaining extensions of filing or other deadlines (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)), and the notice and public procedure and delayed effective date requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 therefore do not apply.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E.O. 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 29 CFR Part 2606 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Organization and functions (Government agencies), Pension insurance, Pensions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 29 CFR Parts 2616 and 2617 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employee benefit plans, Pension insurance, Pensions, Reporting requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, the interim final rule amending 29 CFR parts 2606 and 2617, as published on August 24, 1993, at 58 FR 44738 and corrected on September 17, 1993, at 58 FR 48600, is adopted as a final rule without change, and 29 CFR part 2616 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 2616_DISTRESS TERMINATIONS OF SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLANS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

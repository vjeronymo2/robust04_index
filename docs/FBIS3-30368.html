			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by radio </F> editor David Stahlavsky; place and date not given--live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Stahlavsky] Let me conclude  by asking you about a totally different subject. Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian nationalists, again spoke  unfavorably about the Czech Republic last week. What is your  reaction to his statement that the Czechs will soon lose Moravia  and keep only Prague and breweries producing bitter beer?    [Klaus] I admire his general knowledge as he says such  things  without the slightest doubt--once about Japan, then again about  Russia's southern Asian neighbors or about Europe. I do not  think there is any need to comment on this.    As far as this is concerned, I am troubled by a very  different thing, which was also very clearly demonstrated at the  Davos Forum. The issue is not Zhirinovskiy himself because a  considerable number of Zhirinovskiys can emerge provided certain  conditions exist inside a country, if that country is not coping  with its internal events, as Russia is not currently coping with  its task of transformation, transformation of the country with  its past into something totally different. And this creates  fertile soil for such remarks.    Thus, there is no need to make witty comments on  Zhirinovskiy's statement. The issue is what small contribution  can be made in order to deprive such Zhirinovskiys of their  fertile soil.    [Stahlavsky] What would be the Czech Government's reaction  if  Mr. Zhirinovskiy expressed an interest in visiting the Czech  Republic?    [Klaus] I would not like to formulate any official stand  right now. First, I hope he will not get any such idea. I hope  no one will invite him here, although I can imagine some small  extremist groups that might be interested in doing so. [passage  omitted]    Of course, the Czech Republic is generally in favor of the  free movement of people in the world. We would not like to  create a precedent by preventing someone by default from  entering our territory. This is what the communist regime did  so many times.    We need to be careful in this field. However, I must say  that we are not inclined to invite this guest.</p>

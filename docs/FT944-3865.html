			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: They're the Topps] If this year produces other Yuletide entertainment on the level of the Topp Twins's Topp Secret, it will be a vintage Christmas. This confirms my reaction to the Topp Twins in Edinburgh this summer: love. Most of their current show is new - and if we have seen before such things as Lynda Topp getting carried away doing the spoons, what of it? And yet it is hard to explain their spell. The snobs among you may not thrill to hear that Les Topps (a) come from New Zealand (b) are squirrel-faced identical twins (c) are lesbians (d) sing a lot of country-and-western music. But who could resist them? The characters they play most of the time are over-energetic spinsters, jolly and Down Under, so ludicrously over-committed to country-and-western that the audience cannot help but howl with laughter at music-making that actually they make extremely well. And who could resist the way they wear their country-and-western outfits? The fringed sleeves, the hats, the checked mini-skirts with waistlines hoisted halfway up their diaphragms. 'I'd like to introduce you to the Yodelling Sweetheart of the Tennessee Weightwatchers Club', says Jools. And while the yodelling song starts, Lynda  -the plumper of the two - starts to get those spoons going. She has a few problems at first, but soon she has got the utensils rattling like metal maracas, bouncing off her elbows, her knees, her pelvis; and off the audience too. All of which distracts the audience from noticing how well the Topps (Jools especially) sing and play their songs. In fact, they let country-and-western music, in its best blend of rhythm and melody, seduce you insidiously. But there are innumerable moments that reveal the quality of their musicality. 'Martina', for example, starts with an agitato strum on the guitars, a unison staccato turn of the heads - and then a soft glissando strum that takes us completely by surprise . . . You may forget this, of course, and remember only the words ('Oh oh Martina . . . Now the ball's in your court . . . I don't miss the sex, I'm going out with your ex, She'll write a book about me.') Their purity in music-making and their absurdity in words or action is what makes the Topps unique. By the end, they can afford to be serious, but the main sensation they generate is not laughter or sympathy - but sheer joy. Drill Hall, WC1 until Jan 7</p>

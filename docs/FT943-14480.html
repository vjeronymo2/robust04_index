			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Observer: To the hilt Bristol &amp; West Building Society is so concerned to take the public's views into account that it commissioned research to find out what people wanted from a mortgage. It found that the public was not seduced by the various cashback schemes which have cluttered the market recently but looked at a mortgage in terms of monthly payments. How wise of the society then to launch a new range of mortgages on the basis of those findings; how sad, however, for existing B&amp;W borrowers who find that the standard variable rate they pay is - at 7.89 per cent - the highest charged by any of the ten largest societies.</p>

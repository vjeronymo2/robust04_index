			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles of </F> the Change '94 Alliance during the final presidential "debate"  sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies  and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow Citizens: Throughout my speeches during this  electoral campaign, I have reiterated that the 8 May elections  will be the most important in our country's history. Our future  and that of the coming generations depend on these elections.  Our campaign is based in reality, not false illusions. Our  promises are based on experience, on our team's ability, and on  what we know we can do. False promises with the selfish  objective of winning votes are not part of my personality, nor  those of vice presidential candidates Guillermo Quijano or Tomas  Herrera. It is simply dishonest to make false promises.    We live in a world of realities with real problems that  demand solutions which our young associates can provide. Our  reality is clear. Panama must overcome the present to guarantee  the future. Panama cannot be prosperous so long as we have  children going to school hungry. We cannot tolerate that. Our  young people must have opportunities and effective educations so  our country can develop. Our country needs young people who are  strong both physically and spiritually. Those characteristics  require an education that instills a guiding light in the souls  of our youths.    Panama is a country with potential, and we will turn that  potential into realities to be enjoyed by all Panamanians. To  achieve this, we need a capable government that will make the  necessary decisions; a government that will make decisions  honestly; a government that knows what it is doing; a government  that will energetically make decisions and implement them  efficiently.    That is why the government that we will establish following  the 8 May elections will be made up of men and women who have  the know-how ability, honesty, and experience to make and  implement those decisions. You are familiar with these people  because they are not unknowns, nor have we kept them hidden.  You see them around me all the time because they have attended  all kinds of political events. It is a disgrace that in Panama,  a country with the potential to be wealthy, a majority of the  population is still poor, and too great a percentage of the  population currently lives with so many scarcities.    More than 90 years ago, Panama optimistically entered the  community of free, sovereign nations. When it achieved that  freedom and sovereignty, it hopefully announced that it had  finally reached victory through unity. That is why we are now  astonished to hear some people doubt that we are going to find  the path that will lead us to the fatherland about which  [Panamanian poet and writer] Ricardo Miro wrote.    President Lincoln, the same person who spoke about  government  of the people, by the people, and for the people, also said that  when the people are kept well informed, the nation is safe.  That is why when the people exercise their right to elect  government leaders, they also have every right to have access to  all the information they need, without exception, to make an  intelligent vote, in full knowledge of what they are doing and  obeying only the dictates of their conscience and an analysis of  the records of those whom they choose to support.    Today, in the last phase of the activities promoted by ILDEA  [Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies] in the electoral  process, I must point out that these activities were unable to  promote an analysis of the problems and the solutions proposed  by the candidates. The analysis was made on the basis of  questions that led to ambiguous answers which did not permit a  differentiation between the truth and falsehoods. Panamanians  have not had a real opportunity to evaluate the proposals,  plans, and programs of the candidates through an in-depth  analysis. The vice presidents on my ticket asked for debates  with the other vice presidential candidates. Debates were not  held at that level.    Nevertheless, the people are wise despite all the  limitations, and on 8 May they will elect their future leaders.  It is their opportunity to find the lost path. The decision is  up to the people and only the people. I know my fellow citizens  will not make a mistake, because their hopes for a better future  now depend on their decision, no one else's. We of the Change  '94 alliance offer a real, innovative, and valuable change to  once and for all achieve real victory for all Panamanians. For  this purpose, fellow citizens, give us your vote. We are the  best ticket, individually and collectively. Back us with your  vote, which is what the country needs.</p>

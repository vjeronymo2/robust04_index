			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Russia's gamble RUSSIA HAS a long history of impatient rulers who imposed untold suffering to speed the pace of change or shift the country in a new direction. The freeing of most prices at the start of the year looks like another of these desperate gambles. But the motivation is no longer ambition; rather it is desperation, a sense that, after seven decades of communism and seven years of discussing economic reform, such change had to start somewhere. Only now is the full extent of the economic disaster becoming understood. Even before the New Year price rises, most families spent more than 80 per cent of their declining real incomes on food. But with oil and energy output falling in line with the overall drop in production, there is a growing risk that more and more people will face both cold and hunger in the months ahead. For the advocates of price reform, such a situation is partly a consequence of decades of central price fixing. Artificially low prices for oil, coal and food made the producers of real wealth dependent on ad hoc subsidies. Perhaps that mattered little in a command economy where resources were allocated from the centre, mainly in the direction of the military. But it is impossible to operate a market economy without a link between prices and the cost of production. In the short run, higher prices may not call forth much of a supply-side response from an economy still in the hands of state-owned monopoly producers. In an ideal world, price reform would have been introduced only after large scale privatisation of state property was well under way and where plans to cut government spending, and ensure more effective tax collection, were in place. Without this there is a risk that higher prices will lead to an explosive wage-price spiral, fed by the printing presses. Immediate benefits Nevertheless, price liberalisation will bring some immediate benefits: reduction in the wasteful use of food, for example, and, perhaps still more important, closure of the gap between official and unofficial prices and elimination of the basis of much of the current black-marketeering and associated corruption. Provided the printing presses can also be stopped, the monetary overhang accumulated during the previous years of artificially low prices and scarce goods will also be eliminated. These gains are, on balance, worth the risks now being taken. Thanks to the experience accumulated by Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia over the last two years, Mr Yegor Gaidar and the other young economists currently in charge of Russia's economic reforms are well aware that things must be taken still further. Price liberalisation is only part of a broader package which includes privatisation, tight budgetary controls, curbs on real wages and a realistic exchange rate, backed up by a substantial hard currency stabilisation fund. Without support They, and Mr Boris Yeltsin, their political master, have decided to push ahead without the supporting mechanisms in place because they fear that otherwise there may be no chance of movement at all. Windfall profits will now be made. But this is no more iniquitous than the previous method of enrichment, when those with access to state-controlled goods were able to make large fortunes by simplying selling them at market prices to the new co-operatives. These were often indirectly owned by the managers of state controlled plants who, in practice, sold subsidised goods to themselves. The next few months will be exceedingly hard. The west must continue to channel food and other aid as accurately as possible into Russia and the most vulnerable of the republics, while forging closer ties with the new governments and with the military. But having embarked on price liberalisation, Russia and the other republics also have no alternative but to flesh out their reform programme. The circumstances are as difficult as they could be. But this may be the only chance of democratic, market-oriented reform for more than a generation. Mr Yeltsin's gamble is justified by the prize; it also justifies whole-hearted western support.</p>

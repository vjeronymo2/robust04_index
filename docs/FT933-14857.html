			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Argentina sells energy group in three units ARGENTINA has completed the privatisation of its principal energy companies with the sale of Hidronor, the country's principal hydroelectricity generator for Dollars 1.11bn. The sale follows last month's successful flotation of YPF, the national oil company, and last year's privatisation of the federally-held gas and electricity companies. In just 15 months, Argentina's energy privatisations have raised more than Dollars 6.65bn. The government split Hidronor into three parts, selling each as a separate unit. Three international consortia paid Dollars 474.6m in cash and took on a further Dollars 631.1m in financial liabilities from the government. Hidronor's dams have been transferred as 30-year concessions. The sale last week of El Chocon, the largest of the dams, for Dollars 519.3m to a consortium led by Endesa of Chile, was particularly significant. Argentina and Chile have long been fierce rivals. El Chocon is located close to the Chilean border in the southern Andes and is a large source of electricity for Argentina. Last year, Endesa acquired generating and distribution companies in greater Buenos Aires. A consortium headed by Southern Electric of the US paid Dollars 393.5m for the Alicura dam. Another consortium comprising Dominion Energy, also of the US, and Louis Dreyfus, the international commodity trader, paid Dollars 192.9m for the smaller Cerros Colorados dam.</p>

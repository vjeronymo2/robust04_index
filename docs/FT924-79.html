			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Bottomley stresses need for change THE GOVERNMENT'S deter-mination to continue with controversial changes to healthcare provision in London was reiterated yesterday by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, Alan Pike writes. Mrs Bottomley says in a newsletter distributed to all National Health Service staff in the capital that change can no longer be postponed. She says in the publication that London's problems have been discussed for years and too little has happened. Mrs Bottomley is due to make decisions next month on Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report into healthcare provision in London. This recommends reducing the number of hospital beds, closing or amalgamating famous hospitals and shifting resources to family doctors and community services. Mrs Bottomley is facing intense opposition to some of the proposed closures. The report's recommendations include closing St Bartholomew's in the City; amalgamating Guy's and St Thomas' on a single site; merging the Middlesex and University College on the latter's site and moving the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden specialist hospitals to the Charing Cross site in west London.</p>

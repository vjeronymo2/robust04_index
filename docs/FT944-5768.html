			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / PDS goes on hunger strike in tax row Leaders of east Germany's reformed communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, have gone on hunger strike in protest against plans by the Berlin tax authorities to seize their property in part payment for alleged outstanding taxes. PDS leaders claim the action by the tax authorities is a politically orchestrated attempt to force the party into bankruptcy. In city elections next year the PDS is expected to win several seats in the east of the city. 'We will keep up the strike until this claim is dropped,' said Mr Gregor Gysi, parliamentary leader of the PDS and one of seven PDS members who are on hunger strike in Berlin's state parliament. The party won 30 parliamentary seats in last month's federal election, and 4.4 per cent of the federal vote. The tax authorities are claiming that the PDS owes DM67m (Pounds 27.3m) in property tax due for the first six months of 1990. But Mr Gysi said the authorities had a poor legal case for claiming that tax since two separate Germanies existed at that time. He added: 'The authorities have never asked the other east German political parties to pay tax for this period. This is an attempt to politically kill us by making us bankrupt.' The other parties, which had been sanctioned by east Germany's communist party were merged with west Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition. Their property, like that of the PDS, is held in trust by the Treuhand privatisation agency, while separately an independent commission is assessing who has the legal right to inherit any of these properties. The tax office, which is headed by Mr Elmar Pieroth, the CDU senator responsible for Berlin's finances, said it would seize the PDS's property if the party did not pay. Most of the PDS's property had belonged to east Germany's former communist party. However, the legality of such an action was last month challenged by a Berlin court, which, by way of a compromise, proposed that the PDS hand over as a guarantee to the tax authorities the DM6.6m due to the party from the federal state for expenses incurred during the recent election campaign. But Mr Lothar Bisky, chairman of the PDS who is also on hunger strike, yesterday said if the party was forced to part with the DM6.6m, it would face bankruptcy, 'which is exactly what some of the political parties want,' he said. The PDS has outstanding debts of over DM5.5m, of which DM2m is owed to east German enterprise managers and supporters who helped finance the PDS's election campaign.</p>

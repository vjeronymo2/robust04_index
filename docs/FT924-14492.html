			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas in novel health deal MCDONNELL Douglas, the financially stretched US aerospace group, yesterday came up with an innovative means of protecting its balance sheet from the impact of new accounting rules for retirees' health benefits. The plan, which covers retirees who do not belong to a union, involves the replacement of company-funded health care coverage with a scheme funded by the retirees themselves - though much of the cost will be met by a special trust fund set up by the company. The financial key to the scheme, which will last until at least 1996, is the establishment of a special trust which will draw on a surplus in the company's pension fund, estimated at Dollars 2.2bn in December 1991. McDonnell said that the surplus would be reduced by about Dollars 300m. All US companies face large non-cash write-offs over the next year as they adopt Standard Financial Accounting Statement 106, which requires them to show their future healthcare obligations to retirees, rather than what they are actually paying out in any given year. McDonnell said yesterday that its scheme would reduce its estimated FASB 106 write off from Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.8bn - almost half shareholders' equity - to about Dollars 600m to Dollars 700m. It explained that retirees enrolling in its new plan would receive a one-time supplement - drawn from the special pension benefit trust - which could be used to pay for coverage identical to that offered under the company scheme. The company said the amount of the supplement, after taxes, equalled almost all of the cost of the premium, so 'most retirees will have little, if any, new costs that are not covered by the supplemental pension benefit'. The complexities of the scheme may cause anxiety among McDonnell employees, although the company argued yesterday that its commitment to the plan until 1996 meant greater security for retirees, since up till now it has had the power to modify its benefits programme. Termination of the company-funded healthcare plan will allow McDonnell to cut its cash spending on retiree health care, which it said had more than quadrupled in the last decade. The programme affects some 20,000 retirees and will involve a further 50,000 employees when they retire. McDonnell Douglas's balance sheet has been strained ever since it spent some Dollars 4bn to develop its new MD-11 wide-bodied civilian aircraft. It lacks the funds to develop a larger aircraft, the MD-12 and has been seeking Asian equity finance, so far without success.</p>

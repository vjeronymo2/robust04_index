			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received the text of a statement issued  by the State Duma stressing the groundless nature of criticism  of the country's budget adopted in the second reading on 8 June.  The statement notes that even in accordance with the initial  draft, 20 percent of all budget expenditure was allocated for  military needs. Moreover, when the budget was passing through  the second reading it became possible to allocate an additional  3.5 billion rubles. Sources outside the budget to finance  defense needs were determined, and Duma experts estimate that  these will amount to another several trillion rubles.    The statement acknowledges that the budget, which reflects  the actual state of the Russian econony, is extremely tight.  But, the statement says, the deputies are convinced that  parliament, and society, through parliament, have to place the  use of taxpayers' money under strict supervision.</p>

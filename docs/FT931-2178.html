			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Secret pollsters keep tabs THE possibility of surprise last-minute upsets in French elections exists because the country's electoral law forbids the publication of opinion polls within a week of polling day. But no French government has an excuse for being taken aback by any 11th-hour turnaround in public sentiment, because it has a secretive political department within the Interior Ministry which continues to feed it reports on the public mood right up to the moment when the polling booths open. This department is known as the Renseignements Generaux, a shadowy force whose job is to keep tabs on political developments of all sorts within the country. The RG used to function more like a secret police in opening politicians' letters and bugging their offices, but since 1964 it has created a polling organisation within the Interior Ministry which is the envy of many regular pollsters. It is able to call on the services of several hundred inspectors, who often interview a much wider sample of the public (up to 2,000 people) than the regular pollsters do. But, as one RG inspector told Liberation newspaper, they are not straightforward about their identity. 'When someone asks who we work for, we say that we are doing subcontract work for some institute whose name is known. To say that we are policemen would falsify the replies.' Yet the RG believes it forms a valuable role. 'Weakened by decentralisation, the state has more and more need of an institution to supply it the information which will help it take its decisions,' the inspector said.</p>

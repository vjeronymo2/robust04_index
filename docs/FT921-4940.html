			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Whitehall row foils freezing of Libyan assets DISAGREEMENT within the British administration was responsible for the failure to freeze Libyan assets which have been moved outside the reach of UK jurisdiction, officials in Whitehall have confirmed. Stiff, and ultimately successful, opposition to Foreign Office support for such a move was mounted by the UK Treasury which feared that freezing Libya's assets could damage London's position as an international financial centre. Official figures due for release next Tuesday are expected to show that Libyan funds in London, which stood at more than Dollars 1.5bn at the end of March 1991, fell to about Dollars 400m by the end of last year. The inter-departmental tussle took place soon after November 14, when two Libyans were indicted in the US and Scotland for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner. The Foreign Office became aware that Libya was moving its funds out of London, and asked the Treasury to take steps to freeze them. But, in a series of tense meetings and telephone calls, held over a weekend, Treasury officials argued strongly against the freeze. The Treasury's case was based in the first instance on legal grounds. The Emergency Laws (Re-enactment and Appeals) Act 1964 stipulates that foreign assets in Britain can only be frozen by Treasury order if their outflow is to the economic detriment of the UK. The Treasury solicitor argued that an assets freeze under this law would be open to challenge. Ministers were ultimately convinced that the assets could not be seized without special legislation, and that by the time such legislation had passed there would be no assets left to seize. The Treasury judged that an outflow of Libyan assets from London could not be considered detrimental to the UK economy, largely because they were comparatively small. Moreover, the Treasury traditionally has taken the view that freezing foreign assets in the UK is action that should only be taken as a last resort, such as in times of war or when there is international agreement on such action through the United Nations. Iraqi assets were seized after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, but that was done in implementation of decisions taken initially at EC level and subsequently in the form of UN Security Council resolutions. In the Libyan case, officials concluded that there would be no hope of mobilising an international consensus for such action quickly enough to be effective. Underlying the Treasury's resistance to the proposed assets freeze was the fear that it would undermine London's position as a financial centre. A unilateral freezing of another country's assets, without any backing in international law, could prompt other nations to shift their funds abroad. Switzerland would be an obvious beneficiary of such action. But the UK financial authorities also feared that rival financial centres in the European Community, such as Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam, would be quick to profit from a British freeze of Libyan assets. Because of the tough competitive environment in which London operates and the importance of the City for the UK economy, it was argued that Britain could not emulate the US, which has frozen Libyan assets. A British official yesterday firmly rebutted any suggestion that the plan for a freeze had come from the US. It was, he said, a purely British idea, and had not been discussed with the US government because it never became British policy.</p>

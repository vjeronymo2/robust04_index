			<p>BFN     [Text] Orlando Lugo Fonte, national president of ANAP  [National Association of Small Farmers], has explained that  small farmers and members of cooperatives should clearly  understand that one must be profitable as a result of increased  agricultural-livestock production only, not higher crop prices.  Speaking before more than 200 delegates, among them the  presidents of 48 CPA's [agricultural-livestock cooperatives],  whose production cost per peso does not exceed 50 centavos,  Lugo, who is a member of the Council of State, reiterated that,  for the economy, that is the useful path to take.    At this cooperative and small-farmer event, which is being  held in the capital on the occasion of 17 May, Agriculture  Minister Alfredo Jordan spoke of incorporating (Fregatte)  irrigating machines as part of the strategy aimed at increasing  production. Jordan pointed out, as a serious current difficulty,  the acquisition of seeds, as well as the need for each producer  to produce and preserve the seeds he uses to grow his crops.</p>

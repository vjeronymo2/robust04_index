			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / IMF slow to act on Brazil loan The International Monetary Fund yesterday welcomed Brazil's economic reform efforts, but fell short of promising a stand-by loan to back the government's anti-inflation programme. This left unclear the status of the country's commercial bank debt restructuring, which needs an IMF seal of approval and is close to a deadline. Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, said there was already a 'significant record of progress' in tackling Brazil's annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent under Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister. He said Mr Cardoso's plans to introduce a new currency later this year should lead to a 'sharp reduction' in inflation. The IMF has proposed a monitored economic programme to be followed, when the new currency is introduced, by either a stand-by loan agreement or a 'form of enhanced co-operation'. He said work was continuing on the Brazilian programme for 'early consideration' by the IMF executive board. Mr Camdessus made no committment on the signing or timing of a letter of intent for the stand-by loan accord. According to some analysts, such a letter is thought to be needed before the US Treasury agrees to issue zero coupon bonds. These will form part of the guarantee for the Brady-style rescheduling of Brazil's Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35.60bn) of private commerical bank debt. Under the existing timetable, the bank deal has to be finalised by April 15. Bankers and Brazilian officials had hoped the IMF would indicate support for the deal this week. Delaying the April deadline is possible but difficult. Mr Cardoso said he thought the IMF's statement, which listed eight positive aspects of the country's economic policy for this year, was enough to win support from the US Treasury. Mr Cardoso is today due to meet Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, the closing agent for the bank deal, to discuss the next moves. Notification that the deal is to go ahead has to be given by Friday for the April 15 deadline to be met. Brazil may now try to use Mr Camdessus' statement as an intention of support and go ahead with the debt rescheduling without the formal stand-by loan agreement. This would require the banks granting a waiver this week, and would also suggest Brazil has already bought at least some of the required zero coupon bonds in the market.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In cases where installations of conversion configurations are performed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties other than the certifier, EPA envisions that the certifier will enter into legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding agreements with said installers. To facilitate EPA enforcement actions each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installer must be listed on the certificate filed with EPA at the time of certification for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each conversion configuration, and the certifier must submit a revised list to EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when new installers are added. The certifier is responsible for compliance with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable production line testing requirements (e.g., Selective Enforcement Auditing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal certification) regarding the availability of vehicles and emissions testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities at the certifier's facilities and at those of the certifier's installers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Identification of a converted CFV as a LEV, ULEV, or ZEV will be based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information provided to EPA at the time of the certification of the conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> configuration. To aid in their identification, a converted CFV must be labeled as such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the engine labels. Consistent with other EPA certification programs, records are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be maintained of the tests performed to support the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, and these records must be made available to EPA enforcement personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon request. Certifiers must maintain records of each vehicle converted including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make of the vehicle, vehicle identification number, serial number of the conversion kit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date and location of the conversion, and the results of the post-installation emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test discussed in the following section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conversion installation quality test <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CFV emission standards are considerably more stringent than conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, and converted vehicles certified as CFV's will be eligible to earn marketable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase and emission credits and to receive TCM exemptions as CFVs in the Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuel Fleet program (LEVs, ULEVs, ZEVs or ILEVs). In the NPRM EPA requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on whether additional requirements are necessary to ensure compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CFV standards given that the conversion industry historically has consisted of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large number of relatively small businesses that have not previously faced specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions performance requirements. Specifically, EPA requested comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it would be useful to require a post-installation test for converted vehicles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess the quality of the conversion installation from an emissions perspective. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a test is required by the California Air Resources Board in its regulation of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel retrofit systems. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Title 13, California Code of Regulations, Sections 2030 and 2031. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of those commenting on this subject, all expressed concern regarding reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of poor emissions performance of some converted vehicles presently in use and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that EPA should promulgate strict standards to instill consumer confidence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions performance of CFVs. There was support for the EPA concept of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-installation test requirement to help identify poor installations or defective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion kit hardware that would otherwise result in high emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The dielectric gas  breakdown[.sup]1[/] creates a plasma and subsequent chemical  reaction even where a resonant condition does not exist. The  CO[.sub]2[/] laser beam (wavelength: 9.6 m, pulsewidth: 2  sec, pulse energy: 0.4-1.5 J) was focused by a  BaF[.sub]2[/] lens through a KBr window into a glass reaction  cell filled with raw material gas. B, TiB[.sub]2[/], and  B[.sub]4[/]C powders were prepared from  BCl[.sub]3[/]+H[.sub]2[/],  BCl[.sub]3[/]+TiCl[.sub]4[/]+H[.sub]2[/], and  BBr[.sub]3[/]+CH[.sub]4[/]+H[.sub]2[/] gas mixture  respectively. The particulate materials were characterized by  scanning electron microscopy, ICP atomic emission spectroscopy,  and X-ray and electron diffraction. It was found that the  short-range order structure of boron powders deposited on a cold  reaction wall was similar to that of  _b_-rhombohedral.[.sup]2[/] Produced TiB[.sub]2[/] and  B[.sub]4[/]C were crystalline. The particles were  monodispersed and the particle sizes of the powders were 0.1-0.3  m. The yields of powder were increased linearly with  increasing laser pulse energy, whereas average particle size was  independent of energy. The threshold of breakdown in the gas  mixture of total pressure of 250 Torr was about 600  J/cm[.sup]2[/] and was inversely proportional to the total  pressure of the gas in a logarithmic scale, and the proportional  constant was -0.52 for BCl[.sub]3[/]+H[.sub]2[/]. About  90% of incident pulse energy was absorbed by plasma in the  reactant gas.  References    1. C. DeMichelis, IEEE J. QUANTUM ELECTRON. Vol 5, 1969, p  188.    2. M. Kobayashi, T. Oyama, H.

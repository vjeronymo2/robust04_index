			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ALL THAT'S SOVIET ISN'T RUSSIAN;  </P> <P> OPERA: FOUR MUSICIANS FROM THE TBILISI OPERA THEATRE WILL OPEN THE SOVIET ARTS  FESTIVAL WITH A RUSSIAN OPERA THAT IS NOT PART OF THEIR GEORGIAN NATIONAL  TRADITION.  </P> <P> As the Soviet Arts Festival is about to prove, not all Soviet art is Russian.  The Faberge Imperial eggs, for instance, are luxurious Russian artifacts  commissioned by the czars, but the festival's icon exhibit organized by the  Timken Gallery is from the treasury of Georgian religious art on loan from the  State Art Museum of Georgia. Modest Mussorgsky's opera "Boris Godunov," which  opens the festival Saturday night, recounts the turbulent political upheavals  of 16th-Century Russian history, but, for the four visiting musicians from  Georgia's Tbilisi Opera Theatre, "Boris Godunov" is not part of their Georgian  national tradition. Although Georgia is now one of the 15 Soviet republics, the  roots of Georgian culture pre-date its inclusion in the Soviet Union in 1921.  </P> <P> If bass Omar Khoperia, who will sing Varlaam in San Diego Opera's "Boris  Godunov" production, had his druthers, he would be singing in Zakhary  Paliashvili's "Absolom and Eteri," a classic of the Georgian opera tradition.  </P> <P> "It would be much more pleasant for me to sing Georgian national music in San  Diego," said Khoperia through an interpreter provided by San Diego Opera. "  'Boris Godunov' is one thing -- Georgian opera is another."  </P> <P> It is not that conductor Jansoug Kakhidze and his three Tbilisi Opera singers  don't like "Boris Godunov." Kakhidze, whose English is fluent enough to  interrupt and clarify his interpreter, proudly talked about a "Boris"  performance by his Tbilisi Opera company in Moscow's prestigious Bolshoi  Theatre on tour four years ago. Georgians take pride in their own musical  heritage, however, which is distinct from the Russian tradition.  </P> <P> Kakhidze, who will conduct San Diego's "Boris," is Tbilisi Opera's director and  head conductor, as well as a conductor of Georgia's State Symphony. (San Diego  Opera's "Boris Godunov" production brings together two principal singers from  Leningrad's Kirov Opera, the four Georgians, and American stage director  Nathaniel Merrill, as well as the San Diego Opera chorus and other American  singers in comprimario roles.) That Kakhidze could participate in the San Diego  festival with several members of his company is an unmistakable result of  perestroika, according to Khoperia. Before the Gorbachev era, he noted, only a  single singer would be allowed to perform in the West. In addition to Khoperia,  the visiting Tbilisi contingent includes tenor Teimuraz Gugushvili and bass Gia  Asatiani.  </P> <P> Last year at Boston's Soviet arts festival, "Making Music Together," Kakhidze  made a highly favorable North American debut conducting a contemporary Soviet  opera, Rodion Shchedrin's "Dead Souls." Boston selected Kakhidze to conduct the  Shchedrin opera, even though he had not conducted it prior to the Boston Opera  production.  </P> <P> "Shchedrin and I are great friends," said Kakhidze, "even though he lives in  Moscow, which is far from Tbilisi. I have toured all around Europe conducting  his compositions, and I consider him one of the prominent contemporary Russian  composers." Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto, which will receive its West  Coast premiere with the San Diego Symphony Nov. 2, was presented in Boston  under Kakhidze's baton.  </P> <P> Both Khoperia and Kakhidze stressed that Georgians find singing as natural as  most cultures find speaking. In spite of a long tradition of folk singing,  Kakhidze explained that Georgian opera did not come into its own until the  early decades of the 20th Century. Although the operas of Paliashvili and  contemporary Georgian composers such as Gia Kancheli rarely are performed  outside of the Georgian Republic, in purely musical terms, they compare with  the national, patriotic operas of, say, Smetana and Dvorak.  </P> <P> "Georgian people like very much to sing. If three Georgians get together, they  will start singing in parts," said Khoperia, alluding to the polyphonic nature  of Georgian folk song.  </P> <P> "Georgian people have beautiful voices," Kakhidze said. "Most do not work as  professional singers, but they sing when working, at weddings, when sitting at  table -- every connection between people is celebrated in singing."  </P> <P> Unlike most European vocal folk music, which consists of a single melodic line,  Georgian folk song developed a complex polyphonic tradition early in its  history. It is basically choral singing, rather than solo singing. San Diegans  who attend the Georgian State National Singing and Dancing Ensemble at the  Spreckels Theatre (Nov. 1-5) will hear some of this traditional Georgian choral  folk music.  </P> <P> "In Europe, instrumental music was more developed," Kakhidze said. "But in  Georgia, singing was everything."  </P></p>

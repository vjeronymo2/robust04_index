			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Venezuela gets a dual forex market A dual market in foreign exchange has emerged in Venezuela for the first time in five years following new rules introduced this month that have rationed central bank sales of dollars. The gap between the value of the bolivar on Venezuela's official market, where the central bank sells dollars to banks and exchange houses and that on the parallel foreign exchange markets has widened to 15 per cent over the last week. This widening spread is worrying the government. Mr Julio Sosa, minister of finance, said the government was 'concerned' over the exchange differential and the central bank should 'take some type of action.' When he made his remarks on Tuesday banks were selling dollars obtained from the central bank auction at 131.5 bolivars, while rates on the still legal parallel market ranged to 148 bolivars or more. On May 4, the central bank replaced open sales of dollars under a crawling peg-type system, in effect since 1989, with daily auctions, which have met only part of Venezuela's dollar demand. A parallel market in dollar trading developed almost immediately, especially for corporate buyers.</p>

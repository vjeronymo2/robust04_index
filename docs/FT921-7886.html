			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Czech ATM network launched CASH-short bank customers in Czechoslovakia will no longer have to wait hours to withdraw money following the introduction of the first network of on-line automatic teller machines (ATMs) by Komercni Banka, a leading commercial bank in the republic, writes Ariane Genillard in Prague. The bank intends to install several dozen ATMs this year. Cardholders eventually will be able to use them for payments on goods and services as well as making cash withdrawals. The bank has formed an Interbank Credit Card Association which will allow for a linked banking structure in the country. It will also issue international cards linked to the Eurocard/Mastercard and Cirrus networks, giving Czechoslovak citizens access to currency while they are travelling abroad.</p>

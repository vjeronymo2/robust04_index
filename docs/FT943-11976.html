			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers firm Food retail stocks were a generally bright picture as a combination of broker upgrades and continuing takeover talk underpinned the sector. But William Low was one weak spot as investors swayed over whether there would be a counter bid to the Pounds 154m agreed offer from Tesco. Low shares slid 10 to 268p, with turnover reaching 3.5m. Tesco was 1 1/2 lighter at 236 1/2 p. J Sainsbury, which is currently considering whether to enter the fray for Low's, added 5 to 411p. At the same time, the market's attention turned towards another northern-based supermarket chain, Morrison Supermarkets, as a potential alternative. The shares ended 3 ahead at 131p. Elsewhere in the sector, both Hoare Govett and SG Warburg were making positive noises on selected food stocks. The latter shifted to a buy on Argyll Group, the shares responding with a rise of 3 1/2 to 272 1/2 p. Profits forecast for the current year were raised by Pounds 16m to Pounds 400m, while the 1995-6 estimate was lifted the same amount to Pounds 440m. The 13-year battle for control of the Savoy Group appeared to heat up as the luxury hotel group announced that it had 'become aware of talks between hotels group Forte and certain trusts, which have a significant shareholding in The Savoy.' The statement added that the discussions could affect the eventual management of the group. The news boosted Forte shares which closed 4 1/2 ahead at 231p on a hefty 7.7m traded. Savoy 'A' shares slipped 3 to 970p. Analysts interpreted the terse statement as the management's response to Forte's quiet but gathering campaign to wrest control of the Savoy, a situation which has simmered since Forte's failed bid in 1981. The two camps have a stand-off arrangement whereby Forte will give 12 months notice of a hostile bid. Forte holds just over 42 per cent of voting rights in Savoy, while Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chief executive, sits on the Savoy board. However, Forte's grand plan of creating a luxury hotel chain centred on the Savoy group has been an open secret in leisure circles and lobbying of Savoy shareholders has been taking place - a move confirmed by yesterday's statement. ICI, the UK's leading chemicals company edged a penny higher to 840p, notching up a gain of 8.5 per cent over the past fortnight ahead of second quarter figures tomorrow . The shares have outperformed a rising FT-A All Share Index by five percentage points over the same period and many dealers were beginning to suggest that the company would have to pull something extra out of the hat if it was to hold on to recent gains. 'The range is Pounds 110m to Pounds 140m with most of the City around Pounds 130m but the company historically disappoints and there could well be some profit taking with the figures,' commented one seasoned chemicals analyst. Support for BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance conglomerate, moved ahead in front of interims today. The shares improved 11 to 443p. Elsewhere among internationally traded stocks, Reuters Holdings, which is also expected to announce interim figures today, bounced 15 to 480p as a heavy selling order carried out by one leading US house was said to have been completed. Also, NatWest Securities reiterated its buy recommendation. Forecasts for the half year profits range from Pounds 235m to Pounds 254m. Barclays recovered from previous weakness as the shares took some heart from a piece of research published by Smith New Court ahead of the sector's results season which begins with Lloyds on Friday. Smiths argue that: 'In a mature market with commoditised products banks are showing signs of going ex-growth'. However, it believes Barclays will head the cost cutting required and provide a seed bed for growing operating profits. Barclays bounced 9 to 551p while Lloyds came off the top to close 7 better at 567p after 5762p earlier. Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries shrugged off Monday's weakness to close 3 1/2 ahead at 196 1/2 p, with Williams de Broe recommending the shares. A slide early in the week was halted after the company dismissed a press report that it was under investigation in the US for falsifying inspection of parts for commercial aircraft. Williams de Broe urged investors to buy the stock and cited the 'recovery potential in the automotive business' for the recommendation. Rolls-Royce fell 6 to 183p, in trade of 2.3m with SG Warburg said to have had the day's main seller of the stock. Engineering group Whessoe tumbled 26 to 108p, after the company warned it would make a loss for the year and would pass the final dividend. A squeeze was reported in both Hall Engineering and McKechnie. The former jumped 20 to 195p, while the latter put on 12 to 482p. News that services group Inchcape has teamed up with Coca-Cola to invest in six bottling franchises in Russia cheered the market. The shares appreciated 4 to 461p. Firm platinum prices boosted Lonrho and the shares gained 3 to 132 1/2 p. Strong demand for airports group BAA ahead of Friday's first quarter figures saw the shares advance 10 to 994p. A stock overhang was said to have undermined Taunton Cider, off 7 at 173p. The strong Confederation of British Industry export figures helped selected spirits companies. Matthew Clark advanced 9 to 558p and Highland Distilleries was ahead 8 at 432p. Other statistics, Page 30</p>

But Wolfgang Ehrfeld is holding real treasures in his  hands: Ultrasmall microturbines, which do not reveal their true  shape until placed under a high-resolution microscope. Such  microsystems, assures the managing director of the Institute for  Microtechnology Mainz (IMM), are once again radically changing  the industrial world: "Even today we still have no concept of  most applications."    What until recently still smacked of science fiction--tiny  robots which independently repair machines, carry off  calcification in blood vessels or self-navigating vehicles  equipped with microsensors--are slowly but surely becoming  reality in the laboratories from Mainz to Madison, Wisconsin,  from Tuebingen to Tokyo. Microcomponents are already being used  in fiberoptics networks and medical equipment, as well as in  everyday articles such as ink jet printers and air bags.    German companies and researchers are involved at the  forefront of this promising future technology and are even  leading in some subareas. Professor Anton Heuberger at the  Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin and Daimler researcher Walter  Kroy in Munich are two of the most famous pioneers in silicon  microtechnology. The newer and more flexible Liga [lithography,  electroforming, casting] process, with which tiny parts can also  be made from metal, ceramics or synthetics, was developed by IMM  head Wolfgang Ehrfeld in the 1980s at the Karlsruhe Nuclear  Research Center (KfK). And Dortmund Microparts GmbH--a joint  venture of the Steag, Krupp/Hoesch, Huels, Rheinmetall and VEW  groups--is considered worldwide to be the only company which has  mastered large-series manufacture of micromechanical systems.  The team around managing director Reiner Wechsung can produce  120,000 microscopic little gearwheels in one operation. "In  basic research and first products we are probably ahead of the  United States and Japan." Rainer Guenzler of the Institute for  Micro-and Information Technology (Imit) of the Hahn-Schickard  Society in Villingen confirms the European lead but with the  reservation: "In patents the Japanese are unequivocally ahead."  Guenzler should know: His institute, supported by the land of  Baden-Wuerttemberg, helps medium-sized mechanical engineering  manufacturers introduce microtechnology and therefore  painstakingly keeps track of pertinent activities at home and  abroad.    But Imit cannot supply a reliable analysis of the future  world market in microtechnology. Even professional market  watchers are stumbling about in the fog. The Market Intelligence  Research Corp. (Mirc) in Mountain View in Silicon Valley  predicted last fall that worldwide turnover in microsystems and  microstructures would surpass the three-billion-dollar mark as  early as 1995; last spring Mirc corrected the sum to 2.9  billion--and the year to 1998.    Battelle Memorial Institute also reports contradictory data:  While its Frankfurt branch, now closed, at the end of last year  predicted a market volume of 20 billion German marks [DM] for  the year 2000, Battelle Europe now anticipates only sales of  eight billion dollars in this market by the turn of the century.    On the other hand, should the daring assumptions be correct  on which the Federal Ministry [for Research and Technology,  BMFT] supports the draft of its second subsidy program for  microsystem technology (period: 1994-1999), the anticipated  world market could be much greater: Microcomponents are to  represent a full four percent of the sales price for cars in the  construction year of 2000. Even in the worst economy that would  be more than DM 20 billion. In Europe alone microsystems worth  DM 3.6 billion would then be built into telecommunications  facilities. In this context the BMFT does not even mention the  application field of medical and pharmacological technology,  regarded as particularly promising.    The prophets only agree on one point: that an additional  technological race between Europe, Japan and the United States  is coming--its outcome still open.    All three sides are ready to invest. In the United States  the  research authority ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) has  taken up the subject. ARPA manager Kaigham J. Gabriel, himself a  former microengineer, is allowed to spend 24 million dollars in  seed capital over three years.    In Japan, micromachine development is focused on the  Micromachine Center (MCC) in Tokyo, in which such illustrious  companies as Fanuc, Hitachi, Kawasaki, Matsushita, Mitsubishi,  Seiko or Toshiba are participating. In 1991 the Ministry for  Industry and Trade, MITI, granted 25 billion yen (DM 387  million) to a 10-year program aimed at the concrete task of  joint construction of a millimeter-large, automatic blood vessel  scrubber.    Such a joint leitmotif is missing in the German program for  microsystems technology, whose first part runs out at the end of  the year. Over the past three years the bureaucrats in Bonn  dissipated their energies on no fewer than 31 (Japan: five)  joint projects with 224 partial projects, whose DM 148 million  budget was split equally between industrial companies and  research establishments. Even the whole dozen of the Fraunhofer  institutes involved conduct largely uncoordinated research. For  example, only four belong to the pan-European microtechnology  elite group Nexus, which is run by Heuberger's Fraunhofer  Institute for Silicon Technology (Isit) in Berlin.    While the BMFT is now preparing to kick off the second round  of subsidies with the prospective sum of DM 400 million, Liga  inventor Wolfgang Ehrfeld prefers to fight his own fight. As  founder of the IMM subsidized by the Rhineland-Palatinate, the  ex-KfK employee wants to show how efficient German research can  be.    "I wish for more competition in research and development,"  Ehrfeld taunts the solicitous ministerial technocrats, "because  that is the only way to mobilize the reserves which lead to  innovation."    The ambitious professor, helped by the economics minister of  Rhineland-Palatinate, Rainer Bruederle, has thus within two  years built a fully equipped think tank from the ground  up--mainly filled with second-hand, like-new equipment. Since  then the IMM has grown to 100 employees, already finances 25  percent of itself through industrial contracts and, in addition  to MicroParts, is regarded as the most important address in Liga  technology. The Mainz team is not satisfied with applications in  the branches of telecommunications, medicine, pharmacology and  automobiles, but in addition devotes itself to improving  production technology and the associated equipment development.    Together with the Lothar Spaeth company Jenoptik in Jena,  the  IMM developed a precision scanner for deep lithographic  production of tiny molds needed for mass production of Liga  microparts. Since there is no comparable equipment on the world  market, inquiries and orders have already come in from Europe,  the United States and the Far East.    Old and established entrepreneurs often shy away from that  much high-tech, even if the innovations would soon have  immediate impact on their business. In mechanical engineering,  the BMFT estimates, 60 percent of the companies will be forced  to use microsystems components. But only five percent of the  companies would develop such products themselves.    So the employees at Imit in Villingen, which as a supplier  of  R&amp;D is to pave the way to the future for the traditional  Black  Forest precision mechanics companies, will also have to do a  great deal of persuading. Sighs Rainer Guenzler: "It is not easy  to convince the head of a small company that he should invest in  new things precisely during the recession."  <H5>  Flexible Alternatives </H5>   Various methods are available in order to produce  microscopically small components. The conventional methods, for  instance etching of fine structures, are derived from silicon  processing. The advantage: benefiting from years of experience  in semiconductor manufacture.    But that does not compensate for the serious disadvantage,  namely fixation on the material silicon. The Liga  technique--Liga stands for the three principal process steps of  lithography, galvanizing, casting--developed by Wolfgang Ehrfeld  at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK) in the 1980s is  now revealing itself as a highly promising and flexible  alternative. Ehrfeld: "We can produce components from gold,  copper, synthetics or ceramics."    The principle is simple. Through a mask a  radiation-sensitive  synthetic is irradiated with X-rays. A solvent etches out the  affected surfaces, and the hollows are filled in a galvanic  process with nickel. After removing the residual synthetic, the  metal structure serves as a mold for the production of the  actual parts.    In this manner Ehrfeld produces new kinds of fiberglass  plugs  from the synthetic PMMA, a mass product which costs only  pfennigs although it has a dimensional tolerance of less than  one-thousands of a millimeter.    These are not the only such applications to make the Liga  process famous beyond the science. While the method has so far  been kept under lock and key up by the KfK, Ehrfeld with his  institute is deliberately taking a different tack: "If we want  to have any chance at all versus the established silicon  methods, we must open up the Liga process to all who are  interested."    That is precisely what the busy research entrepreneur is  doing. He organized an international network of Liga users,  which he is busily continuing to expand. By now, more than 30  groups are likely to be working with this method worldwide. To  be sure, this leads to the German share of the Liga cake  becoming smaller. That is the intention for Ehrfeld: "That is  the only way the method can become established and plant  builders and other suppliers can become interested in it."    The market resulting form it, according to Ehrfeld, "more  than compensates for the lost monopoly."</p>

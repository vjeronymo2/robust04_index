			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLACKHAWKS SNAP OILER WIN STREAK  </P> <P> Chicago Blackhawk defenseman Doug Wilson had quite a day Friday. And perhaps an  even better night.  </P> <P> First, he was named one of three finalists for the Norris Trophy, awarded to  the NHL's best defenseman. Then, on Friday night, he scored the winning goal  for the Blackhawks in their 4-3 playoff victory over the Edmonton Oilers.  </P> <P> "It has been a great day," Wilson said after his goal with 1:59 left tied the  best-of-seven Campbell Conference finals at 1-1. "We did a little bit of  soul-searching, and I think we played the way we wanted to play tonight. It's  nice to be going back home with a split."  </P> <P> The series resumes with Games 3 and 4 on Sunday and Tuesday nights in Chicago.  It was the first time the Blackhawks had won a playoff game in Northlands  Coliseum, where they were 0-6 going into Friday night's game.  </P> <P> Wilson scored on a wrist shot from the left point. His goal followed a turnover  by Esa Tikkanen to Denis Savard, who finished with a goal and two assists after  complaining about being benched for a good portion of Game 1.  </P> <P> "Denis Savard is one of the best team players I've ever played with," Wilson  said. "He's got as much character as anybody and he's got an awful lot of  pride."  </P> <P> Tikkanen was the beneficiary of a turnover by Savard earlier in the third  period, converting Jari Kurri's rebound to tie the score, 3-3.  </P> <P> Troy Murray and Steve Thomas also scored for Chicago, and Glenn Anderson, Kurri  and Tikkanen had goals for the Oilers, whose eight-game playoff winning streak  was snapped two short of the NHL record.  </P> <P> Edmonton Coach John Muckler said he thought the Oilers would win the game after  they came back to tie the score in the third period.  </P> <P> "After he (Tikkanen) got the goal in the third, we came on strong and had  several good chances," he said. "Standing behind the bench, I thought we would  win.  </P> <P> "But we wound up making the mistake that lost the game."  </P> <P> The Blackhawks started slowly but came on midway through the first period to  get their forechecking game going. Murray shed Mark Messier's check to convert  Jeremy Roenick's centering pass at 17:50.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks haven't lost in all six playoff games in which they have scored  first.  </P> <P> Savard made it 2-0 at 2:02 of the second period when he took Dirk Graham's pass  in the slot and beat Bill Ranford between the pads.  </P> <P> The Oilers, outshot 11-0 by the Blackhawks in a stretch of about seven minutes  early in the period, scored with Anderson's goal after a nice passing sequence  with Messier.  </P> <P> It was Messier's 113th career playoff assist, leaving him second only to former  teammate Wayne Gretzky on the all-time NHL list.  </P> <P> Kurri's goal was his 88th in playoff competition, leaving him one behind  Gretzky on the all-time list.  </P></p>

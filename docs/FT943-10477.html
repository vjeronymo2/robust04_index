			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures see-saw - Market report COFFEE traders at the London Commodity Exchange said supply worries and a Brazilian meteorology institute forecast of frost today in Parana state helped keep sellers mostly away, on a day when futures see-sawed in a Dollars 99 range. The November delivery position ended the day Dollars 18 lower at Dollars 3,555 a tonne after reaching a high of Dollars 3,625 and touching a low of Dollars 3,533. COCOA futures slid in late trade on a wave of speculative selling encouraged by technical factors. The December position ended Pounds 24 down at Pounds 1,072 a tonne. London Metal Exchange contracts were generally lower at the close, as a wide-ranging and volatile COPPER market continued to pull the strings. The three months copper price almost hit both ends of the current Dollars 50 trading range, before closing at Dollars 2,415 a tonne, Dollars 6 below Tuesday's kerb close. ALUMINIUM was a partial exception to the general trend, as late speculative buying lifted the three months price to a close of Dollars 1,472 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day. However, the market mostly reacted to copper's movements, and was still some way off hitting a Dollars 1,485 upside target, traders said. LEAD rallied slightly from mid-afternoon lows, but remained easier after falling conclusively below Dollars 600 a tonne when stop-loss selling orders were triggered. Compiled from Reuter</p>

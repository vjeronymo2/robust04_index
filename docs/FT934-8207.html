			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Moi under fire over tribal violence AFRICA WATCH, the human rights group, yesterday warned that ethnic conflict in Kenya could degenerate into civil war unless President Daniel arap Moi's government took immediate steps to end the violence, Leslie Crawford writes from Nairobi. In a report on Kenya*, Africa Watch accuses the government of instigating tribal clashes in which 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes since the advent of the multi-party system in 1991. 'There is clear evidence that the government was involved in provoking this ethnic violence for political purposes and has taken no adequate steps to prevent it from spiralling out of control,' the report says. 'The conflict has been deliberately manipulated and instigated by President Moi and his inner circle and has undermined attempts to create an atmosphere conducive to political pluralism in Kenya.' The majority of the victims of the ethnic clashes are peasant farmers of the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are distrusted by President Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority tribes. The report comes at an embarrassing time for Kenya, which is due to meet donors next week to discuss the restoration of financial aid. *Divide and Rule: state-sponsored ethnic violence in Kenya, published by Africa Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10017-6104, tel: 1 212 972 8400.</p>

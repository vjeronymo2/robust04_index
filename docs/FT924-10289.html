			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / War and pieces: UN proposals to resolve Bosnia's ethnic conflict through decentralisation The first tentative steps towards reaching a political settlement in Bosnia were taken earlier this week when Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the joint chairmen of the Geneva conference, unveiled a draft constitutional plan for the former Yugoslav republic. It is an ambitious document which hinges on the principle that Bosnia's territorial integrity must remain intact, that the republic must not be carved up between Serbia and Croatia, and that ethnic cleansing should be reversed. 'The cantonisation of Bosnia into three regions, largely dominated by Croats and Serbs, will never be accepted,' said Lord Owen in a recent interview. 'Instead, we will work towards a decentralised republic consisting of about 10 provinces, each with a wide degree of autonomy covering the spheres of education, police, judiciary and local government.' Lord Owen insisted that the 10 regions would be anchored on the democratic principles of the rule of law. What remains unclear is how such principles would be implemented, or indeed how the fighting between the Moslems, Croats and Serbs could be stopped. More important, the criteria for drawing the proposed regional borders have yet to be agreed. He stressed that 'any family, mainly Moslems, who have been forced out, can return. Ethnic cleansing will be reversed. It will probably take about 20 years to achieve this. But we are not prepared to make the Moslems the new Jews of Europe.' Despite these well-meaning intentions, it is difficult to see how ethnic cleansing - the forcible expulsion of local populations along ethnic lines - will or can be reversed. The homes of many Bosnian Moslems have been destroyed by the Serbs precisely in order to prevent them from returning. Further, the peace plan does not guarantee the security of those who want to return. Above all, the hatred between the ethnic groups of the former Yugoslavia is now so intense that it is hard to imagine that Croats, Moslems and Serbs will want to live together again in Bosnia - or in any of the former Yugoslav republics. A senior UN diplomat commented: 'I fear it is already too late to save Bosnia. I do not know how it can be put back together again. I do not know know how the war can be contained.' But since the Geneva negotiators seem determined to prevent Bosnia becoming what Lord Owen called 'another Lebanon', many Balkan specialists believe the newly created provinces should be given protectorate status. 'A UN protectorate, backed by outside police and judges, would mean that it would be impossible for Serbs and Croats to organise their own states within Bosnia,' said Mr Zarko Puhovski, a political scientist at Zagreb University. Ms Jane Sharpe, a defence specialist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a London-based think-tank, concurs: 'The provinces created for Moslems and Bosnians will be surrounded by authoritarian Croat and Serb-dominated provinces. The Moslems will feel vulnerable; they will need protection.' While the Geneva negotiators consider the issue of setting up protectorates in Bosnia, the international community is already being pushed into accepting ethnically pure regions throughout the former Yugoslavia as one of the prices of peace. 'Whether we like to accept it or not, we have already turned a blind eye to the forcible transfer of populations, particularly the Moslems,' the same UN diplomat said. 'For the price of peace, it would not surprise me if the international community will tactily condone more movements of people, whether through force, or through negotiations,' he added. The prospect of Bosnia being divided along ethnically homogeneous lines could set dangerous precedents, not only for the rest of the former Yugoslavia, but for the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 'If the Serbs, or any other group in the region, can get away with it, potential dictators (elsewhere) can adopt the same methods with the aim of setting up their own ethnic states,' said Mr Charles Dick, a defence expert at the Soviet Studies Research Centre at Sandhurst. 'The point is that ethnic cleansing, and the transfer of populations in the former Yugoslavia, have been achieved through violence.' Mr James Gow, a Balkan specialist with the Centre for Defence Studies at Kings' College, London, agrees: 'If such mono-ethnic communities, originally established through force, are accepted at the Geneva peace conference, what will dissuade the ethnic Albanians from the Serb-controlled province of Kosovo, or any other minority from setting up their own ethnically pure states through the diktat of either precedent or force?' These views are echoed by Mr George Schopflin, a lecturer at the London School of Economics. He believes a process of restricted citizenship based on ethnic background - which is now being implemented both in Croatia and in Serb and Croat-held regions of Bosnia - could be emulated by the governments of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Moldova, Croatia, Slovakia and Romania, all of which are involved in ethnic disputes. 'The west is not helping to create the climate in which democratic habits can take root,' he said. 'The fledgling democratic institutions of these countries will be undermined because these new states will have been built on ethnic criteria, and not on democratic principles. That is why any precedent in establishing ethnically pure regions in the former Yugoslavia is not only dangerous, but it will lead to instability in the entire region.' The primary goal of the Geneva negotiators is to reach a settlement in Bosnia. How they define peace, however, is likely to have wider and more long-term implications.</p>

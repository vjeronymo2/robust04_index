After the resumption today  of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Taba to work out the  final details of the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho and the transfer of civilian power, and on the eve of  the bilateral negotiations in Washington, U.S. Ambassador to  Lebanon Mark Hambley delivered to Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz  a written message from U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    The ambassador would not reveal the contents of the message,  saying only that it deals with the bilateral peace talks that  will resume in Washington tomorrow. Hambley expressed optimism  about the results of the talks. He said the deliberate tension  and violence in southern Lebanon is aimed at undermining the  talks. He stressed that his country is eager to maintain the  peacekeeping forces in the south as a factor of stability in  Lebanon. [passage omitted]</p>

When Washington officials confirmed the U.S. plan to deploy  Patriot missile batteries in Korea on a request from the  commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, there were immediate  speculation of a possible link with moves to promote the sale of  the now-famous anti-missile system to Korea. Recent U.S. media  reports included quotations from senior U.S. defense officials  encouraging South Korea to consider the purchase of the Patriot  missile which they vouched as the best system at the present  time.    It is known that Seoul's defense authorities have had  considerable interest in the Patriot system since its employment  in the Gulf War and that preliminary negotiations started in  mid-1993 between military procurement officials here and the  Raytheon Co., the U.S. manufacturer of the missile. Yet, it is  not quite gratifying to witness U.S. officials showing great  salesmanship as if representing their defense contractors.    On top of this, an embarrassing document has been disclosed  here involving U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry in  which Perry, who has been nominated for Pentagon chief, strongly  suggested that South Korea purchase a specific airborne  self-protection jammer for the Korean Fighter Program on a  commercial basis. U.S. reports have it that this particular  ASPJ system had been found defective in tests, adding to our  dismay.    Under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which  has been the primary channel of Korea's procurement of U.S.  military hardware, the U.S. Government, which often arranges  long-term, low-interest credits for the transactions, retains  the right to approve the supply of specific items.    In the course of implementing the FMS program, the  possibility of U.S. defense officials' opinions affecting the  choice of weapons may not be excluded. But suggesting Korea  purchase a specific item on a commercial basis outside the FMS  avenue is certainly extraordinary. We hope that responsible U.S.  officials restrain themselves from being involved in military  procurement schemes directly or indirectly so as not to cause  unnecessary misgivings on this side of the military alliance.</p>

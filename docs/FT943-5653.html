			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: BASF moves drugs divisions toward generics BASF, the German chemicals group, is attempting to revive the fortunes of its Knoll pharmaceuticals division by diversifying into non-patented generic drugs in the German market. A new distribution and marketing company, BASF Generics, will start operating next year with the aim of generating DM100m (Dollars 63.3m) in sales before the end of the decade, the company said yesterday. Talks are also under way with potential partners, indicating further moves, possibly into other markets, are likely. Knoll recently bought the rights to around 80 out-of-patent drugs from Hexal Pharma, one of Germany's leading generics makers. It also took an option on a further 80 which are expected to be licensed for use in Germany in the near future. The creations of BASF Generics is the biggest step yet in a strategy developed at the end of last year, when Knoll reported its first loss, of DM6m on sales of DM2bn, and ordered a 15 per cent cut in its workforce. Germany is the fastest-growing and largest market for non-patented generic medicines in Europe, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the Dollars 4.85bn market, according to a recent report*. In 1992, about 29 per cent of all prescriptions dispensed in Germany were generic drugs. The German generic market then was worth about DM2.67bn, accounting for about 22 per cent of all prescription drugs sales. BASF is the last of Germany's big three chemical groups to gain a foothold in generics. In March, Bayer spent Dollars 130m on a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein, a privately-owned US group. That followed last year's Dollars 546m purchase by Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another US company. Earlier this year US group Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired a 25 per cent stake in Azupharma, a German generics subsidiary of Gehe. In June, Merck announced its intention to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Amerpharm, an international generics company based in the Netherlands. *Generic Pharmaceuticals: implications for the global pharmaceuticals industry, Financial Times Business Information; 071 814 9770; Pounds 298.</p>

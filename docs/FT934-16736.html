			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Messiaen remembered - Music in London The London Symphony Orchestra starts the current concert season in commemorative mood, recalling two colossi of 20th-century music. A week ago it was Leonard Bernstein (who died three years ago); last Sunday it was Olivier Messiaen (who died last year). On both occasions the mixture of memorial and celebration has been expertly judged. Sunday's LSO Messiaen concert launched a series of four at the Barbican Hall  -two by the LSO, two by the London Sinfonietta, the last timed to fall on what would have been the composer's 85 birthday (Dec 10). During its course the orchestra will give the eagerly-awaited London first performance (a year after the New York premiere) of Eclairs sur l'au-dela, the last big Messiaen composition. But in the first of the series the approach was both introductory and panoramic: in four works covering more than 50 years of creation - L'Ascension (1933), Poemes pour Mi (1937), Chronochromie (1960) and La Ville d'en haut (1987) - the evolutions in language and style of a composer who came to dominate French music in the second half of the century were fully and rewardingly adumbrated. The idiom may have altered, sharpened, enriched its amalgam over time - birdsong, Messiaen's most remarkable and most personal appropriation for music, entered his artistic universe only in the 1950s. Yet the vision behind the idiom remained utterly consistent. For Messiaen music was always a means of glorifying God: this is the chain that securely joins up the complete span of his compositions. Sunday's LSO conductor was Pierre Boulez, in most respects a Messiaen conductor non-pareil. The accuracy, brilliance, clean cut and balanced outlook of his readings hardly need describing at this date. Not for the first time, however, it struck me that the determinedly 'non-mystical' side of Boulez's character sometimes prevents him from penetrating that very region in Messiaen. In L'Ascension, for instance, the numinous atmosphere that should accrue from the ritualistic passage of four richly-textured movements was undercut by the conductor's matter-of-fact-ness; and in Chronochromie, the most ruggedly complex of Messiaen compositions, though Boulez always sorts out the barrage of detail with enviable lucidity, the spiritual purpose behind the detail remained unclear. Yet when so much of Messiaen's thinking is characterised with so much mastery, by conductor and orchestra alike, it is hard to remain long in this critical mode. And to the performance of the rapturously romantic Poemes by the French soprano Francoise Pollet, ample, beautiful and serenely dignified in every bar, surrender was the only possible response. Earlier on Sunday the Barbican had offered the first of its 'Celebrity Recitals': Stephen Kovacevich played Beethoven and Schubert (two more later this month). In spite of an early technical hiccup with the Steinway, the pianist produced the sort of playing that now places him among the world's small number of reigning Classical masters. Kovacevich seems boldly unconcerned with tonal allure; his Beethoven Op 31 sonatas were often gruff, but never lacking in spirit. His Schubert - the late A major - combined simple lyricism and long-term dramatic intensity in a way to bring to mind the late Rudolf Serkin. No praise could be higher.</p>

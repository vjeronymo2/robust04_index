			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup": "Fruitful Sino-Portuguese Cooperation"] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 10 (XINHUA) -- The China visit by  Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva will give a new  impetus to existing fruitful cooperation between the two  countries, official sources said here today.    Silva, who signed the historic China-Portugal Joint  Declaration on the question of Macao during his first visit to  China seven years ago, arrived here by air this morning on a  week-long official visit to China at the invitation of Chinese  Premier Li Peng.    The sources described Silva's visit as "a major event in the  history of Sino-Portuguese relations."    China and Portugal are far apart geographically, but  friendship brings them closer. Since the two countries  established diplomatic ties 15 years ago, contacts between the  countries' high-ranking officials have been increasing  noticeably.    Foreign ministers of the two countries exchanged visits  while  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Vice  President Rong Yiren paid visits to Portugal on separate  occasions.    This has not only promoted mutual understanding, but also  pushed forward bilateral ties in every field.    With concerted efforts and friendly consultations, the  question of Macao left behind by history is being properly  settled.    The two governments formally signed a joint declaration on  the question of Macao on April 13, 1987 after four rounds of  talks over nine months.    The two sides confirmed that China will resume its exercise  of sovereignty over Macao from December 20, 1999.    Since the Joint Declaration was signed, the two governments  have conducted good cooperation with fruitful results.    The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has convened  nineteen  meetings at which the three major questions in the transitional  period of Macao, namely the localization of public servants, law  and official institution of the Chinese language, have been  discussed in depth.    The two foreign ministers reached a consensus in February  1991 that the Chinese and Portuguese languages share the same  status in Macao and that Portuguese will also be an official  language after 1999.    In December of 1991, the Portuguese side finished  legislative  procedure on the above-mentioned issue. Progress has also been  made in localization of public servants and laws.    Both China and Portugal have taken a sincere and friendly  cooperative attitude toward the question of Macao, which has  given rise to a good environment for Macao's social stability,  economic development and residents living and working in peace  and contentment.    Last year, the two countries successfully settled the issue  of financing the Macao International Airport and the model for  aviation agreement.    Now the Macao International Airport, with a total investment  of 7.3 billion patacas, is under construction. The principal  part of the airport lounge and runway have been built. It is  expected that the project will be completed in July next year.    In addition, the second largest bridge in Macao has been  erected and three advanced refuse burners with a total  investment of 600 million patacas newly built in the region.    The prime minister will take part in a ribbon-cutting  ceremony for the bridge in Macao after his visit to China.    Over the past few years, trade between the two countries has  risen by a big margin. Statistics show that the volume of trade  between the two countries last year amounted to 110 million U.S.  dollars, a 64.4 percent increase over 1992, hitting an all-time  high.    In March this year, the two sides signed a contract on the  joint investment of a winery with an annual output of 4,500 tons  in north China's Hebei Province. Seventy percent of the wine  will be exported.    In addition, the two countries also signed agreements on  economic, industrial and technical cooperation and on the  protection of investment.    In March last year, the Portuguese Minister of Trade and  Tourism Fernando Faria de Oliveira headed a delegation composed  of industrialists and businessmen to visit China. In September  of that year, the mixed Committee for Economic Cooperation and  Trade between the two countries held a meeting in Lisbon.    Today the Portuguese prime minister has brought nearly 60  industrialists and businessmen, including leaders of nearly 40  major Portuguese enterprises, to China.    During the visit, they will hold business talks with about  200 Chinese entrepreneurs, exploring new ways for further  expansion of bilateral cooperation.    All these demonstrate that Sino-Portuguese cooperation is  advancing healthily. The Chinese people hope that Silva will  make fresh contributions to the growth of bilateral ties  established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.    They also feel that with the approaching of 1999, it is  imperative to accelerate the pace for the early settlement of  the three major issues concerning the transitional period of  Macao so as to create good conditions for the stable transition  and smooth transfer of power.</p>

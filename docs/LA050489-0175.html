Pomona is 13-11 in the CCAA and  20-26 overall.  </P> <P> Pomona has been led by catcher Chris Goldbach, who leads the conference with a  .398 batting average and is tied with outfielder Chris Butterfield for a  team-high six home runs.

Pomona-Pitzer has drawn a first-round bye and  will face Skidmore of New York in its opening match Tuesday.  </P> <P> "In terms of talent, we would be an even match for anyone in the draw," Coach  Lisa Beckett said. "We lost to Gustavus Adolphus but it was a close match.  We're definitely in the running (for the title). We just have to be mentally  prepared."  </P> <P> Pomona-Pitzer enters the 10-team national tournament after posting a record of  10-0 in the SCIAC and 23-2 overall.

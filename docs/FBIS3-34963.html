In an  informal talk with newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime  minister said what she had told BBC was that Kashmir was a  disputed territory and if Pakistan had not interfered in India's  internal affairs when it was facing problems in east Punjab,  then how could it do so now. India, the prime minister said, is  trying to mislead its own people and the international community  by putting the blame on Pakistan for the situation in held  Kashmir. Pakistan's policy of noninterference in the internal  affairs of its neighbors, she added, proves Pakistan's respect  for international law. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said  India has launched a propaganda campaign that Pakistan is  fanning trouble in occupied Kashmir. She said the indigenous  movement in occupied Kashmir is being nurtured by the Kashmiris  themselves and it is their spirit to render every sacrifice for  their right of self-determination. She said Indian allegations  were false and baseless and Pakistan has exposed Indian human  rights violations in held Kashmir.    The prime minister regretted that the opposition tried to  distort her every statement, but it would not deter her from  serving the country. She urged the leader of the opposition to  give up the negative attitude and work for promotion of  consensus on national issues. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the  government and opposition may have political differences, but  there should be consensus on issues of national importance. The  prime minister said it was during Nawaz Sharif's tenure that  Pakistan was blamed for terrorism despite the fact that India  itself was indulging in human rights violations in held Kashmir.</p>

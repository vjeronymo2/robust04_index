			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BAN ON IMPORTING SEMIAUTOMATIC GUNS EXPANDING, WHITE HOUSE SAYS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said today that it is expanding a recently imposed ban  on the importation of semiautomatic assault weapons.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush accepted a  Treasury Department recommendation that the ban be widened, effective  immediately.  </P> <P> The action expands the ban to cover all imports of the high-powered, rapid-fire  weapons, Fitzwater said. The previous ban, announced in early March, covered  only about 80% of imports, he said.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the initial ban on such weapons, including the AK-47 assault  rifle, was aimed at fostering "a climate in which reasonable and well-intended  people . . . could work out a thoughtful solution" to the proliferation of such  weapons. He said the department is imposing a ban on an additional 24 types of  guns "to review their suitability for sporting purposes."  </P></p>

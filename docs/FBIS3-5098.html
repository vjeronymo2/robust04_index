He also told a news conference after a regular cabinet  meeting that he is "concerned" about President Bill Clinton's  decision to revive the retaliatory "Super 301" provision of U.S.  Trade Law, but said Japan must react "coolly."    Asked about recent climbs in long-term government bond  yields, Fujii said, "I do not think they are trending upward"  and said they would not likely harm the economy.    Fujii said market rates "fell quite far" after last  September's cut in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate to  a record low 1.75 percent a year.    The benchmark 10-year government bond yield climbed to 3.94  percent Wednesday, the highest since just before the rate cut,  with market players citing a central bank survey that showed a  halt in declining business confidence and supply-demand concerns  over stepped-up government bond issuance.    Fujii cited markets analyses that overseas rate increases  were pushing Japanese rates higher and that there are some  expectations of Japanese economic recovery, but he repeated that  the economic picture remains mixed.    He also repeated that the effects of last month's record  15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package have yet to be  felt, adding that "the effects should steadily emerge."    Fujii denied a suggestion that rates are rising naturally as  the market thinks the economy has already bottomed and brushed  off concern that premature rate increases could dash a recovery.    On the Super 301 trade provision, Fujii said, "It is  possible  that unilateral moves could occur, and we are concerned about  that."    But he stressed that the overnight White House announcement  merely sets in motion "procedures" that could ultimately result  in sanctions or other moves.    He expressed hope that Washington will make a "sensible  response," and said Japan must act in a cool-headed way to avoid  a breakdown into a trade war.    Fujii said Japan plans to make a "voluntary, positive  response," citing a pledge to complete a package of  market-opening measures this month including deregulation,  import promotion, improved government procurement practices and  beefed-up antitrust enforcement.    But he said Japan's policy is to continue to oppose  numerical  targets to gauge progress, saying that macroeconomic targets  have not been mentioned in discussions on the package by  government ministers.    In the insurance sector, for which his ministry is  responsible, Fujii said "substantial agreement had been reached"  with the U.S. and that Japan will proceed "positively" on the  issue.    Super 301 allows the U.S. Administration to retaliate  against  trade practices judged to be unfair, but U.S. officials have  said they hope both sides can avoid retaliation.</p>

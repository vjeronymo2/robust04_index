			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Libyan offer to surrender THE Libyan lawyer for the two men accused of involvement in the bombing of the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 yesterday reiterated Tripoli's position that they could be conditionally surrendered abroad, but not to Britain or the US, AP reports from Tripoli. The remarks by Mr Ibrahim Legwell were similar to numerous Libyan offers to surrender the suspects to neutral countries, but not to London or Washington, which have requested their extradition. Mandatory UN sanctions, including a ban on air travel to or from Libya, came into force on Wednesday after the regime headed by Col Muammer Gadaffi had refused to hand over the two men. Earlier, Mr Lagwell said the men would go to Scotland or the US if a fair trial was guaranteed. Libya has told various foreign diplomats to leave the country, in retaliation for a reduction in Libyan representation abroad demanded by other countries in accordance with the UN sanctions. Italy, Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Hungary were among the first countries affected. The cut in air links has forced passengers to travel overland to airports in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>

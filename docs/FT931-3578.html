			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Ways of promoting growth sought by EC THE European Commission is considering fresh measures to stimulate growth because the response from EC member states remains inadequate, Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. Mr Christophersen said after a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels that the Commission may put forward new ideas on promoting investment and job creation at the EC summit in Copenhagen in June. 'More needs to be done,' he said. The Danish presidency of the EC has called for a 'jumbo' meeting of finance ministers from the Twelve and the six members of the European Free Trade Area on April 19 in Luxembourg.</p>

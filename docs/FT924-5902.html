			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM forms client-server unit but denies policy shift INTERNATIONAL Business Machines announced a worldwide initiative to promote client-server computing, the use of multiple computer systems distributed around a corporate network. It has formed a business unit, reporting directly to Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president, to focus on client-server products and strategies. The move is seen by IBM competitors as an acknowledgment of market trends away from IBM's traditional view of corporate computing based upon a central mainframe computer. However, IBM takes a different view. 'Already, IBM is probably the leading supplier of client-server computing systems', although it is hard to quantify the loosely defined market, said Mr Kuehler. He stressed that the formation of the new business unit was prompted by customer demand rather than a strategy shift by IBM. 'This is not a new direction away from mainframes,' Mr Kuehler said. He acknowledged that mainframe computers may or may not fit into the client-server computing model, depending upon the needs of individual customers. In the past, IBM executives have defended the role of mainframe computers, the company's most profitable products. Client-server computing, often called the next wave of computing, is rapidly gaining acceptance, making it one of the fastest growing segments of the computer industry. The concept of client-server computing is to distribute computer power and computing tasks throughout the systems linked to a network, whether they be personal computers, workstations, mid-range computers or mainframes. This contrasts with the traditional data processing model with a centralised mainframe or minicomputer hub, surrounded by terminals, or more often today by desktop PCs that are linked on local area networks. 'Many of IBM's customers are looking for help to convert to client-server computing,' Mr Kuehler said. 'IBM sees this as a growth opportunity for services and software as well as all types of hardware.' More than 900 employees, most of them programmers, have been reassigned to the new client-server unit. Its role will be to help IBM's product units to co-ordinate the delivery of integrated client-server systems. The unit will develop products. The new business unit will be headed by Mr Thomas Furey, former manager of IBM's software development laboratory in Santa Teresa, California. The unit's first task, Mr Furey said, would be to establish customer centres which will showcase client-server systems based on IBM and non-IBM products, and help customers assess and pilot test client-server solutions tailored to their needs. IBM has several of these customer centres in Asia and Europe. Sixty more will be added in the US and centres will be established in large markets throughout the world.</p>

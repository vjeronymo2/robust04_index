			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Set a target Sir, In the government's search for a new monetary policy one obvious idea is to adopt explicit inflation targets, as used in Canada and New Zealand. For example, the UK could announce targets of, say, 3 per cent for December 1993 and 2 per cent for December 1994, excluding mortgage rates. This approach would conform to the prime minister's insistence that low inflation remains the top priority while leaving the way open for interest rate cuts ahead of Germany if the economy remains weak.

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RIVERS' STEAL, FREE THROWS DEFEAT HEAT  </P> <P> Doc Rivers stole the ball from Grant Long and hit two free throws with  seven-tenths of a second left as the Atlanta Hawks defeated the Miami Heat,  117-115, Thursday night at Miami.  </P> <P> After Dominique Wilkins' free throw put Atlanta ahead, 115-113, with eight  seconds left, Long took an inbounds pass and drove to the basket. Rivers  slapped the ball away and dribbled into the front court, where he was fouled by  Sherman Douglas.  </P> <P> "Long broke through and I thought he might get a three-point play," Rivers  said. "He was going full steam one way. I was going full steam the other, and I  got it."  </P> <P> Rivers hit both free throws, giving the Hawks enough to survive Glenn Rice's  basket at the buzzer.  </P> <P> Moses Malone led the Hawks with 28 points. Rivers had 24 and Wilkins 22.  </P> <P> Rice had a season-high 27 points. Rony Seikaly added 22.  </P> <P> Seattle 123, Portland 102 -- Derrick McKey scored 22 points as the SuperSonics  won at Seattle.  </P> <P> Dale Ellis got 11 of his 23 points as the Sonics outscored Portland, 35-21, and  opened a 93-72 lead in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Xavier McDaniel scored 22, and Sedale Threatt added 18 points. Clyde Drexler  led Portland with 25 points.  </P></p>

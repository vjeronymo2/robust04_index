In December they  had time to resign themselves to the latest surprise, and not  the most painful: under the new television broadcasting  schedules, television channels have been working only from 1800  until midnight on working days.    Broadcasting resumed in full in the New Year, but it turns  out that viewers' rejoicing was premature. This was just a  small Christmas present, and the restrictions come back into  force on 10 January. Naturally the official reason remains the  same: the shortage of electric power. However, local  authorities in certain regions do not conceal their own view on  the matter, using figures to prove how small the savings have  been as a result of these restrictions and describing them as  primarily a political move.</p>

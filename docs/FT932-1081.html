			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Nicotine patch plea rejected A COMPANY selling nicotine patches designed to help smokers give up cigarettes failed in the High Court yesterday to challenge an official ruling that its product was 'medicinal'. The ruling by the Medicines Control Agency means it would be a criminal offence to sell Nicostop patches without a licence. Tobyward, a mail order company of Stratford, east London, asked Mr Justice Tucker for permission to seek a judicial review and a declaration that Nicostop was not a medicinal product, as defined under the 1968 Medicines Act, and a licence was not therefore required. The judge said the application was 'premature and misconceived'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Even if the African National Congress [ANC] wins in  the 27 April general election in South Africa, it cannot simply  dictate Pretoria's foreign policy. The ANC, which is expected  to win the first multiracial election in South Africa, has close  ties with Mainland China. There have been indications that once  the ANC heads the government, South Africa will switch its  diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Peking.    According to visiting South African Justice Deputy Minister  Shelia Camerer, the National Party would like to maintain close  trade links with Taiwan. Since the government will be a  government of national unity -- a coalition government --  Camerer said, the National Party, headed by the president after  De Klerk, will still be a part of the government. She said the  National Party will work hard to maintain South Africa's ties  with the ROC [Republic of China], a position which the party  will not give up easily.    South Africa is the only major country that has maintained  diplomatic ties with the ROC.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton prices languish INDIAN COTTON prices are much lower than last year's, in spite of the federal government raising support prices and sanctioning an export quota of 500,000 bales (170 kg each) of cotton, plus 85,100 bales of yellow pickings and soft and hard cotton waste, ahead of the arrival of the new season crop. The delayed monsoon has ensured that this year's cotton crop will be late and crop arrivals are just begining to pick up momentum. Last year, however, cotton prices were too high, which restricted mill offtake to 10.3m bales. So the 1992-93 season opened in September with very comfortable stocks of nearly 3.3m bales. The behaviour of cotton prices has once again proved that India cannot depend entirely upon value-added exports of yarn and fabrics. The interest of farmers in cotton cultivation is unlikely to be sustained unless India remains a regular exporter of cotton. In fact, the government may allow further exports of cotton in the current season to maintain domestic prices. Mill offtake is also likely to rise to 11m bales. Estimates of this year's cotton crop vary between the ministry of agriculture's 11.51m bales and the East India Cotton Association's 12.8m-13.6m bales. The Cotton Corporation of India puts the figure at 13m bales. Based on these projections, the Cotton Advisory Board has settled on a range of 12m to 12.5m bales, up from 11.9m bales last year. As the season progresses, however, the crop estimate may be revised, as had always been the case in the past.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANUFACTURING UNIONS' RANKS FALL 3.2% IN '89  </P> <P> Membership in manufacturing-industry labor unions registered its biggest drop  in three years in 1989, the Grant Thornton management consulting firm said.  </P> <P> The reason for the 3.2% drop: greater demand for high-tech workers.  </P> <P> "There are fewer unions in the high-tech area, and those that are, are not  organizing as effectively," said Selwin Price, a partner at Grant Thornton.  High-tech workers "are better educated, higher skilled, and management might  keep them happier."  </P> <P> The study shows that union membership in manufacturing fell by 153,000 last  year. That represents a 3.2% drop from 4.8 million members in 1988. It is the  largest yearly decline since 1986. That year there was a decrease of 199,500  workers, or 3.8%.  </P></p>

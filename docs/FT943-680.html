			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Labour's new economics 'It is time,' Mr Tony Blair said yesterday at the UK Labour party's conference on new policies for a global economy, 'for a rebirth of the intellectual basis of left-of-centre economic thinking.' It is by this standard that his thoughts and those of Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, should be judged. What the party needs is not a long list of policies, but an intellectual framework on which to hang them. That it has. To beat 'the crude and wasteful individualism' of the Conservatives, the Labour party is embracing aspects of the social market economy. Since the Conservatives have hardly found the key to an economic nirvana, they are vulnerable to a party that offers seemingly relevant ideas. In elucidating the vision, Mr Brown states that 'new Labour sees modern economic intervention not as a controlling or directing force, . . . but as working in partnership with people to make the market economy truly dynamic'. The shadow chancellor has embraced theories that 'atomised agents cannot - acting alone, without active government as a partner - deliver the kinds of investments that are the true source of dynamism in the modern market economy'. His aim is to promote 'long-term relations and commitments', referring specifically to 'the importance of respecting the implicit contracts between stakeholders if companies and people are to invest long-term'. The Labour party's vision means that there is now a clear choice between two competing approaches to the market economy. It has also jettisoned much cumbersome baggage. Gone is the commitment to demand expansion as a remedy for unemployment. Gone is the simplistic commitment to taxing and spending. In their place come recognition of the constraints imposed by the global economy and a willingness to build on the improvements in the macro-economic policy framework of the past two years. Yet the new model Labour party is not home free. It is far from clear, for example, whether it is feasible to introduce features of the stakeholder capitalism of Germany and Japan into the very different circumstances of the UK. It is also not obvious how helpful success would be, since the continental European version is showing marked symptoms of the sicknesses that Labour identifies in the UK: mass unemployment, sluggish economic growth and excessive public spending on 'rescue', rather than 'renewal'. To turn the new vision into a credible set of policies for a modern, market-oriented economy, Labour has still to travel a long way. But the distance it has gone is remarkable. Listen to the shadow chancellor announcing that 'the old Labour language - tax, spend-and-borrow, nationalisation, state-planning, isolationism, full-time jobs for life for men while women stay at home - are as inappropriate to the demands of the future as they were to the needs of the past'. This is a new Labour. How will the party react?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kawi Chongkitthawon: "KR: Thailand Facing </F> an Image Problem"]    [Text] Thailand itself is to be blamed for sitting on the  fence too long amidst continued allegations of its links with  the Khmer Rouge. Indeed, it is fighting a losing battle for two  reasons.    Firstly, Thailand is no longer a frontline state. It is now  virtually standing alone vis-a-vis the international community  on the Khmer Rouge issue. When the Cambodian leaders decided to  take the bull by the horns, alleging Thailand of supporting the  Marxist group, they knew they had the world's support. To the  world, the Khmer Rouge is the only visible threat to the  Cambodian government's current endeavour to rebuild the  war-shattered country, therefore any remaining ties with this  notorious group, imaginary or real, is unwarranted.    Secondly, the threat to use force against Cambodia in  retaliation against the Cambodian government's allegations, even  though verbal, has already earned Thailand a reputation of being  a new "regional bully". In any circumstance, if the tit-for-tat  is actually carried out, there will be no sympathy for Thailand.    In the absence of national reconciliation in the past eight  months in Cambodia, Thailand's decision makers were at a loss.  Without any clear policy direction, they resorted to ambiguity  -- the traditional way of handling sensitive issues with  neighbouring countries.    Since the formation of new Cambodian government last  September, Thailand has been hoping that the Khmer Rouge would  be integrated within the new government. Supposedly, it would  be the only acceptable way out for Thailand's diplomatic  quagmire. For one thing, Bangkok would be able to maintain the  status quo in its relations with the group including trade  links, while being accorded legitimacy as the Marxist faction  would be part of the government.    Unfortunately, the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge  have failed to reach an agreement. Eventually, the nature of  Thailand's link with the Khmer Rouge will depend on how fast the  latter integrates with Phnom Penh. As long as they are excluded  and resort to the tactics they have chosen to, it is extremely  difficult to see a practical termination of Thai-Khmer Rouge  ties.    Even though the Chuan government and armed forces chiefs  have  repeatedly assured the leaders in Phnom Penh and the world  community that Thailand no longer helps the Khmer Rouge, in  compliance with UN resolutions and in recognition of the new  Cambodian government, nobody seemed to take Thailand seriously.  In private discussions, senior Thai officials always linked the  alleged Thai assistance to unruly individuals, some of them in  uniform, along the Thai- Cambodian border, who have always taken  the law in their own hands.    If these individuals remain at large and are able to go  against the Thai government's policy, they must be reprimanded  immediately. Failure to do so would only strengthen the  perception of continued Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge.  Worse, it would also give credit to the claim that Thailand is  still playing the Khmer Rouge card as long as the new Cambodian  government remains hostile to Bangkok.    When the Foreign Ministry issued a six-point protest  statement, trying to attract international sympathy and  appealing for public understanding, it was an act of  desperation. The ministry should have known that, as far as  Thai-Cambodian relations are concerned, it is a different  ball-game now. It is useless to cry over spilt milk.    Certain things can be done to ameliorate the tense  situation.  The most important would be discussions among top military  leaders of the two countries to ensure that there are no rooms  for misunderstandings. The planned visit of Thai Supreme  Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari would be a good  start.    Thailand should also consider the possibility of helping  Cambodia in certain difficult circumstances in handling the  Khmer Rouge. If need be in the future, they can join in a  pincer move against the Khmer Rouge. Unfortunately, it would  require such a drastic action to convince Cambodia and the world  of Thailand's sincerity.    Finally, Thailand has to decide whether the survival of a  democratically elected Cambodian government or the Marxist group  is more important. Thailand cannot have both. If Thailand  chooses the first choice, then the country must go all out to  support Cambodia without conditions. In case Thailand still  wants the Khmer Rouge, then Thai leaders should not complain at  all when allegations are levied against them.    There is one caveat. Thailand cannot expect Cambodia to be  modest. The Cambodian leaders have an enormous task to rebuild  the country.</p>

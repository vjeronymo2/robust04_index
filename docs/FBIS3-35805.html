			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the </F> Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by KURIER in Slovenia on  29-30 January: "If NATO Is Enlarged, This Will Not Contribute to  Peace"]    [Text] [KURIER] Vladimir Volfovich, you are frightening  millions of people in Russia and in the whole world with your  statements. What is your feeling?    [Zhirinovskiy] The people of the world simply do not know  how to deal with this new party, the strongest in Russia. The  people do not have any experience.    [KURIER] You want to become Russian president. What would  you do differently?    [Zhirinovskiy] I would stop the help for foreign countries  and turn to internal problems, for example, the high crime rate  and the reestablishment of the military and military industry.    [KURIER] You are constantly quoted as making contradictory  statements. First you do not want borders to be changed in  Europe, then you want to reestablish the Soviet Union. What is  valid?    [Zhirinovskiy] I meant that the republics of the former  Soviet Union will voluntarily become Russian territory.    [KURIER] You want to return South Tirol to Austria -- this  would probably not be possible "voluntarily."    [Zhirinovskiy] I talked about what would happen in Europe if  Russia were divided. There are many problematic regions in the  world, among them are South Tirol, Trieste...    [KURIER] The public prosecutor's office in Moscow is  conducting investigations regarding you because of warmongering.    [Zhirinovskiy] This is a mistake of the political forces  that are my opponents. They use every opportunity to harm me.    [KURIER] According to your party program, Europe belongs to  the Russian sphere of influence.    [Zhirinovskiy] It would be best if all former East Bloc  states remained neutral. NATO is a military bloc. If a country  accedes to this bloc, this will not contribute to the  establishment of peace. NATO will use these countries as small  partners that are to serve the big members.    [KURIER] You are often compared with Hitler. Are there  parallels?    [Zhirinovskiy] There is no reason for these comparisons.  Then Pinochet and Mao Zedong would also have to be called  Hitler. There is a Hitler in every country.    [KURIER] IZVESTIYA wrote that it is easier for you to seduce  a nation than a woman.    [Zhirinovskiy] I never had the problem of being obliged to  seduce a woman. As far as the nation is concerned -- I am  working on it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 26 (AFP) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto said Thursday [26 May] her country had put  forward counter-proposals to a US plan for non-intrusive  inspections of Pakistan's nuclear installations. The  counter-proposal was passed on to Washington by President Farooq  Ahmed Leghari, who is in the United States on a private visit,  she said at a press conference following her return from a  three-day visit to Nepal.    "We are using this occasion to have informal talks" with US  leaders and explain Pakistan's position following US Under  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's trip to Islamabad in April,  she added. Bhutto did not elaborate on the contents of the  counter-proposals.    Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said last week that  Washington had proposed a "non-intrusive" inspection of  Pakistan's nuclear plants to verify that Islamabad was not  producing nuclear weapons. He added that Pakistan was prepared  to consider non-physical verification of its programme. The US  proposals followed Talbott's talks on the nuclear issue with  Pakistani leaders, when the two sides agreed to pursue a policy  of "quiet diplomacy" to improve bilateral relations.    President Leghari, who in United States to attend his son's  graduation, held talks with US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and met Vice President Al Gore, while officials of  the two countries Thursday began two days of talks in Washington.    Pakistan's controversial nuclear programme has caused strain  between Washington and Islamabad, with the United States in 1990  cut off more than 500 million dollars worth of military and  economic assistance to Pakistan. Washington also stopped  delivery of 38 F-16 jets, following reports that Pakistan was  pursuing a weapons-oriented nuclear programme, a charge which  Islamabad has denied.    In April Washington asked Islamabad to agree to a  "verifiable  cap" on production of missile materials in exchange for a  one-time waiver of the embargo imposed against it under the 1990  Pressler Amendment. Although the proposal was discussed during  Talbott's visit, no immediate agreement was reported.    Bhutto said she wanted to see an improvement in relations  between the two nations, adding that she wanted to visit the  United States later this year. Pakistan shared with the US its  concern over nuclear non-proliferation, she said, but added that  she saw the Pressler Amendment as a "veto" in the hands of  Pakistan's traditional rival, India. She said India applied  this veto "on every single proposal made by Pakistan for  regional non-proliferation."    Islamabad wants a "non-discriminatory" application of the  legislation, forced India, which exploded a nuclear device 20  years ago, to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. "If  Pakistan and the US are to proceed on a common goal of non-  proliferation in the region, then it is important that the  Indian veto through Pressler be removed or waived," she stressed.</p>

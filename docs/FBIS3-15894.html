			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Friday in Chisinau, Moldovan President Mircea  Snegur and Deputy General Director Vilor Venkov of the Russian  joint stock society Gazprom agreed Moldova would pay what it  owed Russia for natural gas deliveries.    Shipments of high quality farm produce would take care of 30  billion rubles and Moldova would have to draw on loans from  international organizations to pay off the remaining part of the  126 billion ruble debt.    To avert the repetition of what had happened, action must be  taken to enforce, at last, the Commonwealth's economic accord.  President Snegur suggested that the next Commonwealth summit  remove all the barriers between the former Soviet republics.</p>

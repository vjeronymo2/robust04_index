			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa in cost-cutting plan as privatisation looms LUFTHANSA, the struggling state-controlled German airline, has prepared a new cost-cutting package designed to eliminate losses and prepare it for privatisation. Confirming a pre-tax deficit of DM542m (Dollars 370m) for the first six months of this year, the airline said that its supervisory board would be asked to approve the new measures at a meeting on August 31. Despite selling 19 per cent more tickets in the first half, which boosted turnover 9 per cent to DM7.2bn, and raising DM105m from the sale of 23 surplus aircraft, the national flag carrier's losses increased from DM331m last time. Although no details have been released officially, the workforce has been prepared for a fresh round of job cuts, in addition to this year's planned 1,800 reduction in the 50,000-strong payroll. The latest issue of the company magazine pointed out that the number of administrative staff had increased 47 per cent since 1986. Personnel costs are more than a third higher than those of British Airways, wrote board member Mr Adrian von Dornberg. Plans to scrap first-class services on European flights are expected to save DM600m a year, and Lufthansa is also likely further to reduce its fleet. Other economy measures could include stepping up last-minute ticket sales in an attempt to improve load factors. At present, only 60 per cent of seats are filled on the average flight. The company blamed its continuing decline on worldwide market weakness and over-capacity, 'exorbitant' tolls at German airports, high insurance costs and the transatlantic price war. Earlier this month Lufthansa announced price cuts on some US routes of up to 36 per cent. Heavy loss-making flights out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Philadelphia will be cancelled from October 25. The weakness of the US dollar was also costing the airline more than DM100m a year, the company said. Apart from the urgent need to stem losses, the Lufthansa management is under pressure to prepare the business for full privatisation. The government recently announced that it aimed to press ahead with the sale of a wide range of state assets. Lufthansa, together with Telekom, the national telecommunications network, was named among the prime candidates. Bonn, which still controls more than 50 per cent of the equity, wants to raise funds to reduce mounting federal debt and help ease the costs of financing economic redevelopment in the former GDR. Its initial aim is to reduce its Lufthansa holding to 25.1 per cent. The government will retain this as a blocking stake until full completion of the European single market, the finance ministry said.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NEW TEST MAY TRACE SOURCE OF HARBOR'S PCB CONTAMINATION  </P> <P> Scientists studying PCB pollution of the sediment underlying Los Angeles Harbor  are attempting to use a new type of chemical analysis to track down the sources  of the contamination.  </P> <P> Chemists with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project are  centering their efforts on harbor sediment near a giant Terminal Island  metal-shredding facility, site of the worst PCB pollution found so far.  </P> <P> The study employs a method of analysis that can identify different types of  PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. PCBs are toxic chemicals that were used in  products ranging from lubricants to electric transformers until their  manufacture was banned in 1979. They are suspected of causing cancer in humans.  </P> <P> Now nearing completion, the study was commissioned in 1988 by the state  Regional Water Quality Control Board. Board staffers say that although PCB  pollution in the harbor has been known since the early 1970s, the new technique  may for the first time allow them to pinpoint those who should be made  responsible for cleaning it up.  </P> <P> "There are a number of formulations of (PCBs)," said Robert Ghirelli, the  board's staff director. "Without this fingerprinting technique, it is very  difficult and in some cases impossible to show that the chemical in the water  originated from a particular onshore location."  </P> <P> Environmentalists applaud the effort. They admit that PCB pollution should be  expected in water bodies like Los Angeles Harbor, for decades the site of  intense waterfront industrial activity. But they point out that PCBs threaten  to contaminate marine life there, some of which serves as a local food source.  </P> <P> "Like it or not, there are subsistence fishermen who fish the harbor," said  biologist Mark Gold of Save the Bay, a Santa Monica environmental group. "And  fish don't stay in one place. They move around."  </P> <P> The new technique of PCB analysis was developed by Robert Eganhouse, a chemist  with the Coastal Water Research Project, a public marine research agency. It  allows scientists to distinguish among PCBs, complex mixtures of 40 to 70  distinct compounds, by identifying and measuring their chemical components.  </P> <P> The research project is using the technique to analyze samples from more than a  dozen harbor locations in hopes of determining whether pollution of the  underlying sediment can be linked to contamination from facilities on the  shore.  </P> <P> But chemists are focusing most of their attention on the Hugo Neu-Proler Co.,  on the north side of Terminal Island, which shreds discarded metal products  ranging from cars to refrigerators and loads the scrap onto ships for export.  </P> <P> Although most of the harbor's PCB contamination is believed to stem from  pollution that occurred more than a decade ago, officials fear that PCBs could  be entering the harbor today as discarded goods containing them are processed  at Neu-Proler.  </P> <P> In operation since 1962, the company says it grinds up more than 700  automobiles and 3,000 household appliances daily to help fuel scrap exports  amounting to more than 1 million tons a year.  </P> <P> Harbor sediment near the scrap yard registered by far the highest PCB levels  found in the study, in which samples were gathered at more than a dozen harbor  locations.  </P> <P> A sample of sediment taken near a conveyor that loads the scrap onto ships  registered concentrations of 11.5 parts per million, well above the next  highest level, 1.87 parts per million, detected near the former Todd Shipyards.  </P> <P> "We knew there were high concentrations in the harbor, but we didn't know about  Neu-Proler," said Richard Gossett, the chemist in charge of the study. "These  levels (near) the conveyor area are about five times higher than what I've seen  elsewhere in the harbor."  </P> <P> The levels also outstrip those in an area of known PCB contamination outside  the harbor: the ocean bottom near the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts'  sewage outfalls off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. According to Gossett, the  highest concentrations measured there recently were 1.5 million parts per  million.  </P> <P> Gossett says his analysis shows that the PCBs found off Neu-Proler are "very  dissimilar" to samples his agency took from the other harbor sampling sites.  But they exhibit strong similarities to the PCBs in debris collected on land  directly under the loading conveyor, he said.  </P> <P> "I would say (the connection) looks very strong," Gossett said last week. "They  were very similar." In an interview, Eganhouse said he agrees with Gossett's  appraisal.  </P> <P> Shirley Birosik, a water board staff member monitoring the harbor study, takes  a more conservative view, saying that a final test Gossett is conducting must  be completed before her agency can begin to reach conclusions.  </P> <P> The test will determine whether tiny particles on the water's surface near  Neu-Proler carry the same type of PCBs found on the shore and in the underlying  sediment. After that test, Gossett will submit a final report to the regional  water board's staff, officials say.  </P> <P> "Our staff will evaluate their report," Ghirelli said. "If in fact the evidence  does point to a linkage between what was found in the sediment and the material  on shore, then the board would have evidence to go ahead and order a cleanup."  </P> <P> Hugo Neu-Proler General Manager John Prudent said his company will not comment  in detail on the PCB investigation until the study is finished. But he  indicated that the company would be willing to take cleanup action if it is  found to be causing the pollution.  </P> <P> "We would be ready to cooperate," he said.  </P> <P> Officials say it is unclear whether funding will be available for tracing other  possible sources of PCB contamination in the harbor once the Hugo Neu-Proler  survey is complete. Even if such projects are funded, they would face serious  challenges.  </P> <P> For instance, PCBs at many locations in the harbor are intermingled in a  confusing jumble or are too degraded chemically to identify with precision.  Still, officials are hopeful that further PCB sleuthing could establish links  between underwater pollution and onshore sources.  </P> <P> One possibility, for instance, would be to trace the origin of contamination  that has apparently emanated from the Dominguez Channel. That would involve  analyzing PCBs found in channel sediment and at polluted sites along the banks  to see whether there is a connection.  </P> <P> Ghirelli said that even if a suspected polluter is no longer in business, solid  evidence of a link between sediment contamination and an onshore facility would  give the water board grounds to take regulatory action against the former  operator.  </P> <P> Said Ghirelli: "We'd have the smoking gun."  </P> <P> PCB LEVELS IN LOS ANGELES HARBOR  </P> <P> A study of PCB pollution levels in the sediment underlying Los Angeles Harbor  turned up extremely high concentrations of the chemical off the Hugo Neu-Proler  metal shredding facility on Terminal Island. High PCB levels were also detected  in sediment near the former Todd Shipyards and in the Consolidated Slip/East  Basin area.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The government decided  Friday to consider asking the United National Security Council  to take additional action should North Korea reject the IAEA's  [International Atomic Energy Agency] proposal to suspend the  changing of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and  permit complete inspections.    The government held a unification and security policy  coordination meeting attended by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime  minister and National Unification Board [NUB] minister, and  other related ministers to discuss North Korea's replacement of  fuel rods.    At the meeting held at the South-North dialogue office, the  ministers also decided to strengthen cooperation with related  countries, including the United States, in trying to solve the  nuclear problem.    The government determined that North Korea's removal of  spent  fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor is a serious violation of  IAEA nuclear safeguards.    The United Nations' nuclear watchdog Thursday warned  Pyongyang that if it continued to replace spent fuel rods at the  5-megawatt reactor, the case would be reported to the United  Nations Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors.    The International Atomic Energy Agency also proposed to send  a team to Pyongyang soon to negotiate inspection of the  refueling process at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. But the  ministers agreed to draw up detailed countermeasures after  determining North Korea's attitude, considering that settlement  of the nuclear problem through negotiation is still possible.  Deputy Prime Minister Yi was quoted as saying, "we still cannot  say that the prospect for settlement of the North Korean nuclear  problem is totally pessimistic. The IAEA expressed its position  to Pyongyang, and now what is important is North Korea's choice."    NUB spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said, "we expect that North Korea  will respond to the IAEA proposal soon. And we will decide ways  to cope with the problem as soon as North Korea announces its  answer."    A senior government official expected that if North Korea  reacts negatively to the IAEA proposal, the government will have  to consult the United States on asking the UN Security Council  to take additional action against North Korea.</p>

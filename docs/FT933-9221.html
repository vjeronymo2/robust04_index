			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UN closes Somali airstrips UNITED NATIONS forces in Somalia yesterday closed two airfields to stop supplies to fighters loyal to the fugitive warlord, General Mohammed Farah Aideed, agencies report from Mogadishu. Pakistani UN troops barricaded runways at an airfield 50km west of Mogadishu and at second airstrip nearby. UN aircraft dropped thousands of leaflets saying the airfields would be closed indefinitely. A UN military spokesman, Major Dave Stockwell, said Gen Aideed's supporters used the airfields to smuggle arms and shipments of khat, a narcotic plant chewed by many Somalis. 'We know the Aideed faction obtains a good proportion of its financing through importing and selling khat,' Maj Stockwell said. The UN action came two days after Somali gunmen killed four American UN peacekeepers in an ambush. The closure appeared to be a first step towards a new crackdown on Gen Aideed, blamed by the UN for Sunday's ambush.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (14): Stormy year for non-life companies - Insurance / Like their UK counterparts the French companies were also hit by the 1990 weather, but that is hardly apparent from theirfigures Europe's leading insurance companies, especially those with heavy exposure to general business, had a bleak year in 1990. The storms of January and February produced heavy claims for direct insurers  -such as Allianz, Generali and Union des Assurances de Paris, Europe's top three non-life companies - and reinsurers such as Munich Re, denting profits. Allianz saw a fall in profits to Dollars 1,146.1m compared with Dollars 1,256.5m in 1989, while profits were flat at Munich Re, which has a cross shareholding agreement with Allianz, rising marginally to Dollars 107.1m in the 12 months ending June 30 compared with Dollars 106.4m in the previous year. Generali, Italy's number one and Europe's number two, suffered a 15 per cent fall in profits to Dollars 431.1m. The impact was heavier on the UK companies, which labour under a harsher tax and reserving regime, and were also hit by the impact of subsidence and recession-related claims. BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, saw profits cut by half to Dollars 1,661.8m, with the pre-tax losses in 1990 of Eagle Star, its general insurance subsidiary, largely responsible. Sun Alliance, Royal Insurance, Guardian Royal Exchange and General Accident all made pre-tax losses. The losses seem to be one of the main reasons for the decline in the ranking of top insurers. Allianz Holding fell two places to sixth, BAT Industries two places to 15th, and Generali 12 places to 24th. Other UK companies, which invest more heavily in equities than their European competitors, also suffered: Sun Alliance, the strongest non-life company, fell 14 places to 103rd, with a capitalisation of Dollars 4,645.9m, while Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange, the weakest two of the UK's five composite insurers, fell 49 places to 159th with a capitalisation of Dollars 3,042.8m and 43 places to 179 with a capitalisation of Dollars 2,713m, respectively. Scandinavian insurers also had a bad year. Baltica and Hafnia of Denmark made losses of Dollars 311m and Dollars 77.8m, respectively, with Baltica falling 78 places to 328 and Hafnia 122 places to 498 in terms of capitalisation. Skandia of Sweden saw profits fall by Dollars 200m and sank 11 places to 205. Two Finnish insurers, Pohjola and Sampo, ranked 351 and 475 last year in Europe, both fell out of the top 500. In terms of capitalisation Allianz, which during 1990 acquired Fireman's Fund, the US industrial risks insurer, and the east German, formerly state-owned insurer, Deutsche Versicherungs, is still by far the biggest of Europe's insurers, a dominance which is accentuated further if its links with Munich Re, and its quoted life insurance subsidiary, Allianz Leben, are taken into account. Indeed, bringing those connections into the picture, the Munich group is more than twice as big as its nearest rival, even when the size of Generali's life insurance subsidiary, Alleanza, is included in the Generali figure. The Prudential Corporation (with capitalisation of Dollars 8.2bn) and BAT Industries (which owns the highly profitable Farmers Group of the US and Allied Dunbar, the UK life insurer) also figure in the top 10. The most striking feature this year, however, is the inclusion of France's leading insurers, which join the FT500 for the first time after the rules were changed to cover companies with 25 per cent of their shares in the hands of the public. The government privatised 25 per cent stakes in each company in 1989. Like their UK counterparts the French companies were also hit by the 1990 storms, but that is hardly apparent from their figures, which reflect the strength of their reserves and the importance of government backing. Union des Assurances de Paris, the 52nd biggest company in Europe, with a capitalisation of Dollars 7,720.1m, is the third biggest direct insurer (behind Allianz and Generali), but rises to second place  - above Generali - if the broader constellation of interests around it are taken into account. Together with Liberty Life of South Africa, UAP controls the UK life insurer, Sun Life (capitalisation Dollars 1,317m). It has a 37 per cent direct interest in Belgium's biggest insurer, Royal Belge (capitalisation Dollars 1,752.3m) and a 34 per cent stake in Groupe Victoire, which is part of the Compagnie Financiere de Suez financial conglomerate. Groupe des Assurances National is 63rd in Europe (with a capitalisation of Dollars 6,707.2m) - the figure takes into account the acquisition of the UK life insurer, General Portfolio, at the end of 1989. Assurances Generales de France is 95th (with capitalisation of Dollars 4,921m). Axa, the private group whose listed subsidiaries are controlled by a mutually-owned holding company, is 88th in Europe (with capitalisation of Dollars 5,108m). All four companies have been increasing their market share in the competitive industrial risks market, especially in the UK, where Axa is said to have been an especially active player.</p>

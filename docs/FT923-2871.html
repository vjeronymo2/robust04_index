			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Waigel denies interference over rate cut THE Bundesbank's decision to cut interest rates was not the result of German government interference nor an EC 'finance ministers' coup,' Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, insisted yesterday. However, Mr Waigel refused to deny that Chancellor Helmut Kohl made a secret visit to the Bundesbank last Friday to discuss the move. 'Clearly a number of meetings have occurred and a number of telephone calls have been made,' Mr Waigel said, but the details would be 'better left for my memoirs.' He ruled out - for the time being - any further realignment of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System following Monday's devaluation of the Italian lira, and specifically ruled out a sterling depreciation. 'I certainly do not envisage such a development at this point in time,' he said. 'The government of the UK has made it clear that it would not accept a realignment.' Mr Waigel is understood to have accompanied Mr Kohl to the Bundesbank last Friday, in what has been seen widely as the exercise of political pressure on the independent central bank ahead of France's cliff-hanger referendum on the Maastricht treaty this Sunday. The finance minister, on a visit to the European Parliament his Christian Social Union party say was arranged in April, hotly reiterated that the rate cut in no way compromised the Bundesbank's independence. He also flatly contradicted French president Francois Mitterrand's recent assertion that the future European Central Bank envisaged by Maastricht to administer monetary union would be subject to policies decided by EC heads of government and finance ministers. The rate cut was 'an entirely logical decision in line with prior Bundesbank thinking,' he insisted. 'This was not a U-turn by the Bundesbank.' He agreed the cut was 'not a disadvantage' for the French Yes campaign, but primarily a 'positive signal. . . for the economic situation in Germany, Europe and the world' and a 'very sovereign decision.' Maastricht made absolutely clear, he pointed out, that the European Central Bank which would subsume the D-Mark into a single EC currency 'will be independent, and its independence will be enshrined in national legal conventions.' Mr Waigel brushed aside suggestions that fear of losing the D-Mark and hostility to Maastricht were growing in Germany. But he acknowledged the domestic pressure by calling on pro- and anti-treaty campaigners elsewhere in Europe to stop brandishing fear of German power as a weapon. 'Fear of Germany is not justified. You must look at what we have achieved in our country. We have been a reliable partner and everyone is aware of this. I would appeal to all our partners. . . to have consideration for the other peoples in Europe,' the minister said. He also called for 'a European solution' to the flood of asylum-seekers across Germany's eastern borders, echoing remarks on Monday by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. Speaking after the German rate cut, Mr Delors said solidarity in Europe was 'a two-way street' and that Germany's partners should reciprocate by collaborating to ease its immigration burden.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Tax rises will not hit recovery, Clarke reaffirms Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has reaffirmed that the UK's economic recovery will not be threatened by the tax increases announced in his last Budget, which are due to be introduced over the next two weeks. In an article in House magazine, a weekly journal distributed in the Palace of Westminster, Mr Clarke says he was right to introduce increases in taxation and cuts in public spending in last November's unified Budget. He says that he accepted at the time that there would be 'recriminations and upset as April approached' and that people are still 'a bit shell-shocked' after the experience of the past few years. But he remains convinced that he was right to make the reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement the cornerstone of his Budget proposals. He says: 'If I had not taken decisive action, confidence would have taken a serious knock. 'The main topic of economic debate now would not be the outlook for economic recovery but how much more I would need to raise taxes in the next Budget. That would create unwelcome uncertainty for people planning their family finances. And the markets would have judged that this government had lost the ability to take tough decisions.' Mr Clarke acknowledged that some areas of the economy faced an uncertain future. He says: 'Even now, nearly two years into the recovery, I still cannot promise that every indicator is going to be good. Far from it - that is just not the way with any economy.' But he says that low inflation has been the most promising of all economic indicators in recent months - and that the government has reasserted its determination to make this a permanent feature of the British economic landscape. 'If we take due care to keep inflation low, the prospects are brighter than they have been for a generation,' he says.</p>

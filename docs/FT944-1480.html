			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No time for doubt about India's reforms Sir, The sense of friendly concern about the future pace of India's economic reforms evident in your editorial, 'India on trial' (December 15), is understandable; but not, I submit, the note of pessimism about the possible implications of recent state election results when you say: 'Reform will stand still, while fiscal stabilisation starts to go backwards.' By most yardsticks (foreign exchange availability, balance of payments, inflow of direct as well as portfolio investment, liberalisation of the trade and payments regime, convertibility on current account, exports, industrial production) India's record since June 1991 should leave no room for doubt that steady progress in the liberalisation programme will continue. Of course, important challenges remain (labour laws, opening up of the insurance sector, reform of banking, disinvestment), but, as Dr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, suggested in an interview with the FT some months ago ('We will surprise ourselves and the world,' March 30), there is a need to avoid shock therapy if the delicate plant of liberalisation is to be protected. The Indian prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, and the finance minister have repeatedly stressed that benefits of reform must reach the poor. As the prime minister put it in his Guildhall speech in March, if the poorest sections of the population are left behind, it would lead to disaster. The recent state election results might be seen by some as reinforcing the logic of that concern, across the political spectrum. But this will only strengthen the consensus about the need for rapid economic growth across a broad front, not weaken it. The international community, which demonstrated such robust confidence in India's economic reforms at extremely difficult times in 1991, perhaps owes itself not to indulge in doubt and concern now, when neither is warranted.

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: SocGen climbs despite market uncertainties Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks, yesterday reported consolidated group net profits up 3.8 per cent to FFr2.24bn (Dollars 420m) for the six months to June 30. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said the group's diversified structure helped offset declines caused by the uncertainty in global markets. The bank reported a substantial decline in provisions, down 22 per cent to FFr2.74bn. Exceptional charges amounted to FFr80bn against FFr6bn. Mr Vienot said the provisions reflected charges against loans to small and medium-sized business, specialist subsidiaries and international credits. There was a 41 per cent drop in income from financial instruments and currency transactions during the first half, reflecting declines in interest rates and a reduction in equity activity. However, the bank stressed the decline was lower than those of many of its competitors during the period, and was offset by specialist investment and management activities. Total revenue fell 1.7 per cent to FFr19.9bn from FFr20.2bn, while administrative costs rose 2.2 per cent to FFr13.8bn, leaving a 9.6 per cent reduction in operating profits to FFr6.05bn. The number of employees fell 3.8 per cent to 44,665. However, staff costs were up 1.7 per cent to FFr7.77bn. Other administrative costs rose 2.1 per cent to FFr5.38bn and depreciation charges increased 9 per cent to FFr677m. Balance sheet assets rose 5.2 per cent to FFr1.53bn in the half. There was a 6.4 per cent increase in revenues, excluding certificates of deposit, to FFr394m, and an 8.4 per cent jump in share capital to FFr45.4m. However, client deposits fell 1.9 per cent to FFr651m from FFr663m.</p>

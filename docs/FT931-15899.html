			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: A Scottish flourish - Poetry in performance ALTHOUGH it called itself the Festival of New Poetry, lastmonth's gathering of 12 poets at the Poetry Society in London was hardly an affair of youth at all - only one of the poets reading was under 30. Of that dozen readers, four were from Scotland, and these poets made the most distinctive and original contribution to the festival - especially Bill Herbert, who writes by turns in English and Dundonian Scots and, in certain respects, is a natural heir to Hugh MacDiarmid. Herbert is a reader with flair and gusto, perfectly at ease in front of an audience and like MacDiarmid, too, a natural proselytiser for his own point of view. To such an extent, in fact, that it was his single prose piece, exploring the dilemma of the Scottish dialect poet in a society that largely thinks and feels in English, which was his most memorable and amusing contribution to the second evening. Herbert was, of course, mocking society's refusal to take lowland Scots seriously as a language for poetry; but when he went on to read an original poem in Scots entitled 'The Flock in the Firth' telling us proudly that it was full of 'dictionary vocabulary' because it 'sounded good', one began to wonder about the validity of the exercise as a genuine repository of feeling. We sat back and enjoyed the music. Fellow Scot Angela McSeveney, the festival's youngest reader, could not have been more different. The subject matter could not have been plainer: the imagined terrors of the smear test; a delightful description of a dirty weekend, 'one of those poems you can't publish while your parents are alive'; the back injury which results in a visit to the physiotherapist who 'walks round me like one of those art gazers'. These were poems about the normalities of life, written with a forceful simplicity. The sole Welsh representative at the festival was Gwyneth Lewis, a poet whose work has been too little published. Many of the poets reading seemed to have an instinctive dislike of using language in ways that poets have traditionally used it: to praise; to express sublime feelings; to regard the writing act itself as something ceremonious. All that sort of thing is old fashioned; it sorts ill with the cynicisms of the present - and, indeed, with its tragedies. That is the way the humbug runs. Gwyneth Lewis set aside these fashionable preoccupations in such poems as 'The Hedge', 'Illinois Idylls' and, most remarkably of all, a poem entitled 'Pentecost', the account of an Estonian woman who has been commanded by God to go to Florida in order to reveal his miracles to the benighted residents. The language of this poem - as of others that she read - had a visionary reach that few poets now writing manage to attain. (The woman, it seems, really existed - and she went). But the last word of all must go to Maurice Riordan, a poet from Cork whose work will be represented in a forthcoming volume of Faber introductions to new poets. Riordan's poems were unusual in several respects: for their remarkable rhythmical control and judicious choice of vocabulary, for example, evidence in such poems as 'Chair', a long and loving description of the splendid engineering of the chair used by the master of the Inquisition for the purposes of torture, Riordan read softly, mellifluously, unhurriedly, allowing each nasty detail to register its impact upon us, culminating in the statement that 'the sitter must learn the virtues of minimal fuss'. But best of all the long narrative poem of his entitled 'Time out', which told the terrible story of a serial nightmare. A father leaves his house at night to buy a packet of cigarettes. A taxi knocks him over. He dies overnight in the hospital. Unfortunately, back at home, alone and helpless, two small sons lie sleeping in their beds. This was one of the most gripping and horrifying narrative poems I have heard read aloud in many years, and it surely heralds the arrival of a major new talent. It was as refreshing festival, and one which said a great deal about the state of poetry now: how various an art it is, for example, no longer divided into schools or camps; the fact that there is no subject matter that poetry will not encompass, and no words that it feels afraid to use; what a fresh, confident and distinctive contribution young women poets are now making; and, perhaps most interesting of all, how shamelessly poets plunder their own autobiographies when writing their poems, which are sometimes little more than versified anecdotes - something entirely out of bounds to the prose writer, of course, for whom the writing of autobiography, fragmented or otherwise, is an admission of failure (unless, of course, you happen to be famous for other reasons. In which case someone else would probably write it for you.) W N Herbert's 'Anither Music' is published by the Vennel Press at Pounds 4.99; Angela McSeveney's first collection, 'Coming Out with It', will be published shortly by Polygon.</p>

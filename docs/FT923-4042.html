			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic Markets In Turmoil: EMS tensions take toll of Nordic markets - Sara Webb explains the factors behind yesterday's financial drama NORDIC bankers used to joke that when Finland sneezed, Sweden caught a cold  -and vice versa. The joke is beginning to grow stale. Over the last year, whenever there has been a crisis of confidence in Finnish economic policy, Sweden has suffered a knock-on effect and the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, has been forced to push up domestic interest rates to protect the krona. Late on Monday night, Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen, the governor of the Bank of Finland, informed her Nordic counterparts that Finland was considering scrapping the link between the Finnish markka and the Ecu, preparing them for the official announcement made early yesterday. The Finnish markka fell in the foreign exchange markets yesterday morning with the Ecu appreciating by 15-16 per cent against the markka. Finnish government bond yields were at first forced up in hectic trading, although yields ended lower on the day. In Sweden, the Riksbank increased its marginal rate (the key lending rate to the banking system) by 8 percentage points, from 16 per cent to 24 per cent to prevent a dramatic outflow of currency. Q. Why has Finland decided to abandon linking the Finnish markka to the Ecu when it only recently introduced the peg? Finland decided to apply for EC membership earlier this year and the link of its currency to the Ecu in June 1991 was intended to signal its desire for a closer monetary relationship. However, the recent tension within the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System has taken its toll on the Nordic markets. Many international investors are worried about the possibility of a realignment in the ERM and the impact this would have on the Nordic markets, and as a result, capital has flooded out of the region. Over the last week, the Bank of Finland has taken several steps to defend the markka. It has been forced to intervene to defend the markka every day and in increasing measures. It has operated in the forward market - and will therefore have to meet these commitments soon, and it has drawn on swap agreements with other European central banks. There were rumours in the financial markets that the Bank of Finland's reserves had been almost depleted by these measures. Mr Jorn Donner, a Bank of Finland parliamentary supervisor, said yesterday that the bank's reserves yesterday 'were probably eaten up'. The central bank itself denied this and said it still had 'substantial reserves'. However, in the end, it decided that these measures were not enough to prop up the currency and decided to let the markka float. The decision frees the central bank from supporting the markka with high interest rates at a time when the Finnish economy is in recession. The Bank of Finland has stressed that this is not a formal devaluation - however, the effect of allowing the markka to float is tantamount to allowing a depreciation of the currency. Once the currency has stabilised, it is likely the Bank of Finland will link it to the Ecu again. Q. Why has Sweden been forced to raise interest rates on such a dramatic scale? Nervousness about the state of the Swedish economy and tensions within the ERM sparked a sharp outflow of capital from Sweden last month, forcing the Riksbank to raise its marginal rate on two occasions. Yesterday's large rise in the marginal rate - from 16 per cent to 24 per cent - was intended to give the financial markets a clear signal that Sweden wants to defend the krona. Mr Claes Norgren, deputy governor of the Riksbank, said: 'After Finland's decision to float, we needed to be on the early track to prevent a currency outflow.' He added that the measure was intended 'to demonstrate the firmness of monetary policy'. He denied that there were any plans to float the krona. Q. Who is responsible for withdrawing capital from Finland and Sweden? The Bank of Finland claims that the Finnish corporate sector in general is moving currency out of the country with foreign investors playing an almost insignificant role in the capital flows. Many foreign investors pulled out of Finland last year after the devaluation. However, in Sweden, the Riksbank said that both domestic and foreign investors were responsible for the capital movements.</p>

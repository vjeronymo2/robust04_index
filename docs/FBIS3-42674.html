			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Ludin: "The Tajik Mosaic"] </F>   [Text] "We came with blood and we shall leave with  blood,"--the popular saying, ascribed sometimes to Emomali  Rakhmonov, sometimes to his first deputy Abdumadzhid Dostiyev,  and sometimes to Minister of Internal Affairs Yakub Salimov, is  going around Tajikistan.  <H5>  The Will of the Imam </H5>   "Success on the roads!" the nice-looking Lena Shmeleva  regularly repeats in "Avtomig." The deeper meaning of this wish  becomes clear in the cab of the ZIL on the Osh-Khorog route  which links Kyrgyzstan to Gornyy Badakhshan. No formalities are  needed with the Pamir drivers. The currency of independent  Kyrgyzstan, the som, is less popular than Russian rubles and 10  or 20 thousand of them are "taken" from the drivers. Yet life in  the disgraced Gornyy Badakhshan is hanging by the thread of this  high mountain route: This is the only remaining relatively  stable channel for bringing to the autonomous republic flour and  oil from the "Fund of Agakhan" and fuel and cement for  construction of the Pamir-1 hydroelectric power plant.    The humanitarian aid of the "Fund of Agakhan" and the  construction of the hydroelectric power plant today have become  effective channels through which Dushanbe authorities can apply  pressure on the Gornyy-Badakhshan autonomous region. "Unless  Pamir-1 is started up in the winter there will be a catastrophe  in Khorog," says the journalist G. Mamadloikov. Yet it is  deliveries of cement and the supply of fuel that are regularly  slowed up and cut off.    Relations between the Dushanbe authorities and Badakhshan  remain deadlocked. Official Khorog has formally distanced itself  from the armed opposition and from the orientation of Badakhshan  self-defense commanders, restricting itself to defense of only  their own territory, without intervening in the civil war  outside Pamir. But the sympathies of many residents of  Badakhshan are with the opposition leaders: Kazikolon  Turadzhonzod, Davlat, Khudonazarov, the mujahidin field  commanders Rizvon and Dzhuma-Boy and the head of the "transition  government in emigration" Mullah Abdullo Nuri--this is obvious.    Nonetheless at a recent conference between Rizvon and the  Badakhshan commanders it was decided that the Badakhshan troops  would concentrate only on defending their own territory. A  significant factor affected this decision.    In October the deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of  Tajikistan, Kazidavlat Koimdodov, met in Geneva with Karim Shakh  al-Khuseyn and Imam Agakhan IV--the spiritual head of the Muslim  Ismailites who constitute almost all of the population of Pamir.  For several days Koimdodov travelled through the Badakhshan  villages speaking about the meeting with the Imam and he  repeated many times the Agakhan's demand to refrain from  participation in the Tajik civil war. If this demand is not  complied with, the Imam will stop the humanitarian aid.    Agakhan is the unassailable authority for every Ismailite.  Moreover, the humanitarian aid from the Fund of Agakhan is the  only thing making it possible today for the population of  200,000 in Pamir to exist. The Imam's demand is the law, even if  it is conveyed by the deputy of Emomali Rakhmonov.  <H5>  Who Is Defending Whom? </H5>   Respect for the Imam is perhaps the only thing that unites  Badakhshan society today.    The civilian activists of Khorog, self-defense troops, and  politicized refugees are consolidated around the executive  committee of the oblast council headed by its chairman,  Balkhiyer Zamirov. They are oriented toward expansion of the  independence of Badakhshan, strengthening of its civic  structures, and economic and administrative reforms.    In a large region--Verkhniy Khorog--the influence of the  Communist Party is traditionally strong. Here they are aspiring  to reconciliation with Dushanbe and blame all of Pamir's  problems on the opposition and local commandos. The mouthpiece  of this tendency is the presidium of the oblast council headed  by Gambsho Shakhbozov.    The main political objective of the reformists is for  Badakhshan to achieve the status of an autonomous republic. It  has already been conferred without preliminary permission and  has been recognized by the Tajik opposition. The Dushanbe  government, avoiding a categorical refusal, is insisting on  "postponing a decision on the problem until the situation  stabilizes."    Naturally, the political antagonism only aggravates the  social problems. The fellow traveler of the blockade--the total  deficit--is turning into impoverishment, black market  speculation, and unrestrained mafia activity. Not every family  has a garden and a ram, and the average wage of 10,000-15,000  rubles [R], paid as if by force, does not enable everyone to  take advantage of the services of merchants who produce food,  clothing, and consumer goods from Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan.  Strikes are developing among workers of budget-financed  organizations. "With this kind of poverty it is impossible to  put an end to contraband drugs," states the former minister of  foreign affairs of Tajikistan, General M. Navzhuvanov.    Recently the fight against drug trafficking has been the  main  task of the Khorog border detachment. Officers of Russian border  troops candidly admit that without help from Badakhshan  self-defense forces, not only is it impossible to hope to close  off the border, but one cannot even speak about elementary  safety of the border guards. There have been no victims in the  four seizures of hostages in recent months only because of  intervention from the Badakhshan commanders, who each time went  to the negotiations with their Afghan "colleagues" and achieved  the release of the Russian military men.    "It is not they who are protecting us but we are protecting  them," said a Badakhshan commando. "But Kozyrev and Grachev keep  this in mind in Moscow when they are helping Rakhmonov." The  border guards did not respond.  <H5>  Tug of War </H5>   The Kulyab nomenklatura-mafia clan, which won in the civil  war in 1992, has extracted everything it could from the victory.  Its representatives control all key posts in the organs of  power. The Tajik army and other power structures are under its  jurisdiction. It still has reliable military support--the  Russian 201st Division. But still the path back has been cut off  for it as has any possibility of compromise--the military crimes  of the army of Sangak Safarov, in whose ranks practically all  the "Kulyab leaders" fought, were too great.    The Leninabad nomenklatura, whose 55-year rule was shaken by  the May victory of the Democratic Islam opposition in 1992,  recognized its mistake. The bureaucratic business of  Leninabad-Khudzhand financed the organization and arming of the  Sangak People's Front but the administrators and bosses of the  Communist Party of Tajikistan (KPT) were crowded out of power by  the Kulyab commando leaders. In order to protect themselves from  armed attacks, residents of Leninabad even had to blow up the  bridge that joins the oblast to the rest of Tajikistan and think  seriously about becoming autonomous themselves--this is the soil  on which the accelerated rapprochement between the Khudzhan and  Khorog leaders appeared.    In this arrangement it is instructive to look at the  position  of the Leninabad boss Sasafaral Kendzhayev, former chairman of  the republic's Supreme Council, around whom the "Tajik knot" was  tied in the spring of '92. An active participant in the war who  in October '92 made a bloody attempt to seize Dushanbe, and an  experienced political intriguer, after the "victory" Kendzhayev  was pushed into the background by competitors from Kulyab. Left  as merely the rayon procurator, he quickly went over to the  opposition, retaining and reinforcing his own armed guard made  up of ethnic Uzbeks from Gissar and began to cautiously explore  the possibilities of joint actions...with the Democratic Islam  opposition! He formulated a package of demands on the government  clearly intended to support the opposition, especially those  from Pamir: the resignation of all Kulyab leaders (true,  Rakhmonov was a possible exception), redistribution among the  regions of posts in the power structures, return to the refugees  of real estate and other property seized from them, etc.    A solid foundation for the "Leninabad revenge" is being  prepared by the slowly but confidently unfolding processes of  nomenklatura privatization: The monopolistic monolith of state  industry remains unshakable and the distributors of state  property, pumping funds into commercial structures, are opening  light productions and trade enterprises. The interests of the  nomenklatura bourgeoisie of a "Deng Xiaoping" bent are  objectively coming into conflict with the "kimirsenov" solidity  of the Kulyab commandos.    On the other hand, the position of the ruling regime is made  burdensome by the ideology of the KPT, which actually  contradicts the interests of the Dushanbe elite. The KPT is a  part of the SKP [United Communist Party]-CPSU, and the  restoration of the USSR is the cornerstone of its program. This  is not very inspiring to the heads of the regime who think that  they are assured patronage from Tashkent and Moscow. On the soil  of this contradiction arose the People's Party (NPT) headed by  the first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, A. Dostiyev,  who is assigned the role of supporting the regime (like the  Democratic Party of Turkmenistan under President S. Niyazov) and  at the same time--acting as a weapon for Dostiyev in his  struggle for power.    As long as the tug of war is going on, the threat of the  collapse of Tajikistan becomes more and more real. Expansion of  the independence of Badakhshan can no longer be stopped even  with force. Leninabad-Khudzhand, which is rich and closely  linked to Tashkent, is quite capable of autonomy. Gissarskiy  Rayon with its significant Uzbek population has long been drawn  to Uzbekistan. Khatlon (a combination of Kulyab and Kurgan-Tyube  Oblast) and the Garm group of rayons, where the influence of  Islamic political forces is strong, are tied up in a war with  one another which could ultimately compare to the land of  Dushanbe... But, "we came with blood...."  <H5>  Party Committees and Mosques </H5>   They understand all this in Badakhshan. They were clearly  sympathetic to the appointment of Rizvon as minister of defense  in the "transition government" of Abdullo Nuri. The line of the  Kazikolon Turadzhonzod, which presupposes a political resolution  to the conflict, is losing influence. Proponents of maximum  consolidation of armed opposition and overthrow of the current  Dushanbe regime by force are coming to the fore.    "I personally think negotiations and a peaceful regulation  are impossible," says Khadzhi Badakhshi, one of the military  leaders of the opposition and coordinator of the Badakhshan  mujahidin. "The current power must be unconditionally  overthrown, and this will be done by the armed forces of the  mujahidin who are supported by the Tajik people. Russian troops  must be expelled from Tajikistan. This pertains both to the  201st Division and to the border guards. Our armed forces are  quite capable of controlling their border themselves."    "Among the mujahidin they are speaking more and more  frequently about a jihad. Does this mean dissemination of the  ideology of Islamic fundamentalism?"    "No," Khadzhi answers resolutely. "A jihad today is not a  war  for Islam but an anticommunist liberation war. The war is also  revenge against the murderers."    Khadzhi Badakhshi emphasized that what he said is his own  personal viewpoint. The "transition government" is still just  developing its final position. But it very much seems that it  will finally be formed in precisely these configurations.    How is Russia to figure out its role and its interests in  view of this quite real prospect? Russia ends up in the role of  a helpless observer in the face of Afghan internal conflicts  which affect its vital interests. Forcing General Dustum, a  creature of the Uzbek neocommunist regime, from the scene, the  fundamentalist Golboddin Hekmatyar and the moderate Islamist  Ahmad Shah Masood, a more "Europeanized" figure and one who is  oriented toward Islamic modernism, came together. The weakening  of Dustum's position is objectively advantageous to  Russia--which cannot be said, however, about the strengthening  of Hekmatyar. The "contact" with Masood, the official minister  of defense of the IGA [Islamic State of Afghanistan], who is  popular in both Afghanistan and Tajikistan, "through the head"  of the Hekmatyar leadership would help to stabilize Russian  interests not only in Afghanistan itself but also with respect  to the Tajik war.    In the second place, the matter is actually proceeding to a  point where Tajikistan, Russia's potential stronghold in Central  Asia, is gradually entering the zone of Islamization. Pro-Islam  sentiments are growing in Uzbekistan, especially in its southern  regions (Fergana, Namangan). It cannot be ruled out that the  sinking dictatorship will try to play the card of Islamization  in Tajikistan next.    "Everything is ready in Leninabad," said B. Zamirov in  Khorog. "The union of party committees and mosques is becoming  stronger there. They are just waiting for a signal. After all,  portraits of Marx, Lenin, and Najibollah hung in Afghanistan  too--and nobody even noticed when they were replaced with green  flags."    It is difficult to argue with this.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- The NATO air force and  Muslim formations in the area of Gorazde carried out  synchronized attacks against Serb positions between 1415 and  1445 today, the information service of the Srpska republic army  general staff has said in a statement.    The statement says that the Srpska republic army  "successfully responded to the strong attack and is holding its  positions."    A NATO C-130 transport carrying a NATO rapid intervention  unit with a large quantity of ammunition, weapons, and military  equipment, landed at Tuzla airport at 1650, the statement says.    The general staff of the army of the Srpska republic has  learned from reliable sources that rapid intervention forces  with their weaponry and equipment have been sent from  Frankfurt's NATO base to operate together with members of the  Muslim force against Serb units, the statement says.    The synchronised attack in the Gorazde area and the abuse of  Tuzla airport as a military means (the airport is yet to be  opened to humanitarian operations) indicates that UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] units have overstepped their mandate and that  they bear all responsibility for further escalation of conflict  in the area of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says.    It adds that the UNPROFOR's present activities fully confirm  the assumption that they have openly sided with the Muslim  forces and become directly involved in the civil war in the area  of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons down on warning Bad news continued to surface at Fisons as the pharmaceuticals group announced that it expected no profits this year and was sacking its chief executive, Mr Cedric Scroggs. The one-time Footsie company saw its share price slide 24 to 113p, its lowest level for more than nine years. Turnover was unusually high at 30m shares as investors rushed to sell. Part of the trading volume was said to have been prompted by a block of 1m shares dealt at 138p as part of a programme trade - unfortunately on the buy side. The company said it was writing off Pounds 28m to cover a change in trading policy and would take a Pounds 16m charge on its scientific instruments division. It would also have to pay out for management con-sultancy and job cuts. The net effect would be to reduce 1993 prospects from Pounds 100m to zero. Forecasts for 1994 were cut back by around Pounds 20m, to Pounds 100m. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, placed its A-1 Fisons rating on Credit Watch. Mr Nigel Barnes of Hoare Govett said: 'It is a real mess. I would steer clear of Fisons, although it has some yield advantages now and could be back in the bid target range once the rubbish is cleared.' The group has been hit on previous occasions by profits warnings and management changes over the past two years.</p>

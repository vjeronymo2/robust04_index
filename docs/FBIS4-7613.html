			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- The all-out Moslem  offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic continues on all fronts  on Sunday, the Bosnian Serb command says and adds that along the  Sava river in the north the Moslems are being backed by regular  troops of neighbouring Croatia.    According to the same source, Croatian multiple rocket  launchers and long-range artillery on the left bank of the Sava  river have been pounding the territory of the Bosnian Serb  republic.    The shelling has been especially heavy in the Serb villages  of Krepsic and Obudovac and the town of Doboj.    The Bosnian Serb command says that although the Moslems are  attacking practically all borders of the Bosnian Serb republic,  the brunt of their attacks is directed against the corridor  linking the eastern and the western part of the republic.    The same source emphasizes that the Bosnian Serb army is  responding to all attacks and inflicting heavy losses to the  enemy, and that everything indicates to a complete breakdown of  the Moslem offensive very soon.    Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo reports continuation of  inter-Moslem fighting in the northwest between forces loyal to  Fikret Abdic and Moslem hardline leader Alija Izetbegovic.    Abdic, a fierce opponent of Izetbegovic's war-mongering  policy, last October proclaimed independence for the province of  western Bosnia.</p>

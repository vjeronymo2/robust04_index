			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Economics: Further signs of German slowdown expected NEW indications about the extent of economic decline in Germany may arrive later this week with the latest unemployment figures for the western part of the country. The market expectation is that unemployment will jump by around 45,000, in a further sign of the slowdown in activity which has alarmed much of Europe, though awakened hopes that the Bundesbank may be moved soon to make further cuts in interest rates. Elsewhere, in a thin week for economic data ahead of the Easter holidays, attention will focus on the figures due to be announced today in the UK for new credit business by consumers in February. With the markets looking for further signs that economic activity in Britain may be turning up slightly, the central prediction is for credit to have increased by a reasonably robust Pounds 100m. However an important caveat is that much of this extra borrowing may conceivably be due to consumers taking on more credit in order to pay off old debts, in a reminder that Britain may still have some way to go before it shrugs off the torpor of recession. In the US, a smattering of data about home completions, car sales and consumer credit may provide something of a guide as to the degree to which the North American economy is on the rebound. For aficionados of economic data, some interest may be provoked by the unveiling today of the latest cyclical indicators from the Central Statistical Office which attempt to shed light on whether the economy may be picking up. With the CSO investigating the indicators to see whether they could be improved to show a better correlation with measured economic activity, fans of the current generation of indicators will be eager to see how well they are performing in monitoring a possible upturn.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary </F> Unity, URNG, General Command on 19 April; place not given]    [Text] The serious damage from Guatemala's political and  social situation in the past few weeks calls for prompt and  specific measures. We cannot continue on this level of  uncertainty and confusion.    Deeply concerned by the current situation, which endangers  the legitimate hopes of the Guatemalan people, hopes that will  be dashed by a situation imposed by groups opposed to a  political solution and just and democratic peace, and in light  of the government's delay in directing and defining its  policies, the URNG General Command states to the people of  Guatemala and the international community:    Today marks the third week since the solemn signing of the  Global Agreement on Human Rights, a historic document intended  to have an immediate impact on the country's social and  political life if it is seriously implemented.    It is disquieting that, to date, there has been no specific  proof of the government's political willingness to implement the  agreement. Twenty-one days have passed and the government has  not complied with the simplest point in the agreement; that is,  to advise the people, through massive multilingual campaigns and  the media, of the contents of such an important document.    Quite the contrary has occurred. Instead of carrying out  this indispensable, instructional task, the government has  undertaken a strong campaign to confuse and misinform the people  of the contents of the agreements. The government is spreading  misleading facts to try to promote the image that the URNG is  disintegrating as a fighting force, something that we have  described on several occasions as a dirty trick by the Armed  Forces.    Most serious of all is the fact that since the signing of  the  Global Agreement on Human Rights, there has been a wave of  attacks on prominent people that is being condemned by everyone.  In addition, intimidation based on threats and charges against  people and religious organizations called to play an important  role of the Civilian Society Assembly [Asamblea de la Sociedad  Civil] in the negotiation process has continued.    All this represents not only a violation of human rights but  also a clear disregard for the agreements and an intention to  hinder their implementation. It would be very bad to keep  silent and not warn of the serious implications this has for the  present and future of the country.    Everyone is aware of the destabilization plan to block the  negotiation process. It is indispensable to point out that the  government's policy to confront this situation is incoherent.    The government's security forces are obligated to clarify  these criminal actions. They can do it because they know the  origin of the plan and how it operates. The government of the  Republic must act firmly, openly, and efficiently toward that  end.    It is unacceptable and censurable for the answer to be a  display of military force, the presence of which is directed at  intimidating the people. Establishing an illegal state of siege  will not solve the problems of crime or public insecurity; on  the contrary, it will inhibit and hamper the people's ability to  express themselves, to protest, and to denounce what is wrong.    For all of the above, the URNG General Command hereby  demands:    That the government strictly abide by the General Agreement  on Human Rights, without delay in all of its points;    That there be strong action taken against the destabilizing  forces to denounce and identify them and to bring them to  justice;    That work begin immediately to divulge the complete text of  the General Agreement on Human Rights and the commitment  agreement to discuss and reach a consensus on the composition,  operation, and authority of the Investigation Commission to  clarify all human rights violations committed during the  country's armed conflict;    That the deployed military forces be withdrawn;    That urgent action be taken to end the intimidation and  terror certain sectors of public security organizations are  inflicting upon civilian organizations and their leaders, under  the cover of anonymity;    That Army organizations cease their campaigns of  misinformation and manipulation and that other government  officials who are part of the peace process be prohibited from  repeating such information.    The URNG calls upon all sectors of society not to be  intimidated or inhibited, to speak out loudly against any form  of threat or cohesion, and to strongly demand complete  fulfillment of the General Agreement on Human Rights.    The URNG calls on the international community to be  vigilant,  now more than ever, on the fulfillment of the General Agreement  on Human Rights at this particularly critical and dangerous  moment and to offer the Guatemalan people and their  organizations its full support, as they fight their decisive  battles at this time.    [Signed] URNG General Command    [Dated] 19 April 1994</p>

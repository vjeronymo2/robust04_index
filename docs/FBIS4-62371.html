			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Boltovskiy article under the "After a Sensation" </F> rubric: "Bomb Under the Constitution"]    [Text] It is now obvious that the protracted spin in which  the country's economy finds itself has been caused not by the  "democrats'" desire to improve it but by a rapacious struggle  for the redistribution of property. In this the authorities  have gone so far that they have set against themselves even some  of their former patrons.    Almost six months after the referendum and the elections  pro-U.S.-oriented foreign news sources suddenly reported that  their results had been falsified: There was a voter turnout of  less than 50 percent, which means the Constitution was not  adopted.    The international observers who concealed the truth assume  the expression of naive simpletons, pleading concern for Russia.  Several months ago this concern made them lie, but now it makes  them tell the truth. Love really is unpredictable.    So, the powers that be and the Constitution carved out by  them have received from the West a crushing blow instead of  credits, about which no one has breathed a word recently. And  for the president -- a bomb under the czar's throne? Russia's  rulers might end up on a par with their colleagues in Haiti.    The blow was not unexpected. Let us recall the scandal over  the Russian spies, the Ames, which was blown up out of all  proportion. Having kept them in cotton wool for about two years,  for some reason they exposed them at just the time when B.  Yeltsin was in the greatest need of foreign support.    There is more. When the Russian Government tried to pick up  brownie points with its diplomatic activity in Yugoslavia, the  United States ignored those peacemaking efforts and shot down  Serb aircraft. There then followed the militarily pointless  bombing of Serb territory. In response to Russia's attempts to  show itself a great power, the United States roughly put it in  its place, making it clear that Russia was no more than a  provincial actress in a U.S. show. The presidential team, above  all, was slighted.    Why has "friend Bill" swapped favor for anger? Or has he  forgotten about the trillions of dollars spent on the struggle  against communism, and is he now indifferent to what will happen  to Russia? The stubborn show of U.S. hostility toward Russia  can only be explained by a firm resolve to change its ruling  clique. By what motives might the United States be guided?    The situation in the country is steadily deteriorating and  will evidently be critical by the fall. The stoppage of  enterprises and mass unemployment on the one hand. Harvest  failure for well known reasons, a sharp fall in the livestock  population, and the threat of famine on the other hand. Thus, a  tight knot of very acute problems will have been tied in a  number of regions by the fall: unemployment, a food shortage,  and high prices. A social explosion is really in the cards.    Those who look at Russia with sober eyes understand that  indignation will turn against capitalizers. Last year's  elections convinced them of this. The people will sweep  capitalism away, and some strong individual might accede to  power on a broad wave of protest. The West does not doubt that  such people still exist on Russian soil.    It is frequently possible to hear the surprised comment:  "The people are being robbed, but they stay silent. They have  simply been zombified!" This is nonsense, of course. Over the  years of Soviet power a distinct type of social consciousness  took shape in our country: The cells of society -- labor  collectives -- were geared to the leaders and lived according to  the rules of large families. Workers are not making a resolute  protest not because they have been stupefied by somebody but  because they cannot yet overcome a psychological barrier -- the  president's authority.    The masses do not see a sufficiently strong figure in the  opposition. When one appears, the people will wake up at once.  They have already voiced their protest by casting their votes  for Zhirinovskiy, although the majority take a highly ambiguous  attitude toward him, to put it mildly. Therefore the  peacemakers have good reason to make haste with the presidential  election, without waiting for the masses themselves to nominate  their leader.    The chief consequence of the election will not be a new  president but a coalition government, whose creation is insisted  on by practically the entire opposition. Being the Duma in  miniature and being politically ill-assorted, it will not change  the policy of capitalization. On the other hand, it will  dissipate the working people's future discontent and carry it  away.    Under these conditions the left-wing opposition must  formulate more exactly its demand for a government of public  confidence. In our view, the question should be raised of  creating a socialist government which advocates the power of  labor collectives based on the supremacy of ownership by the  whole people and Soviet self-management.    It is highly doubtful that the trip to Germany will  strengthen the president's position. It seems that there is  still no getting away from an early election.    But a coalition government...is already being created, as  evidenced by the appointment of N. Travkin, leader of the  Democratic Party of Russia, as a minister. The fact that he  will be without a portfolio is also symbolic.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas thinks that  the jointly coordinated draft Lithuanian-Polish state treaty  addresses the integrity of both states and the inviolability of  state borders. The president said at a news conference today  that the current mutual relations between both countries and  prospects for future cooperation were adequately described in  the draft treaty.    Answering a question of whether the property would be  returned to the Polish public organizations which were active in  the occupied Vilnius region in 1920-39, President Algirdas  Brazauskas pointed out that this was not envisaged by the  Lithuanian constitution.    According to the president, similar questions were raised by  Jewish organizations in Israel. However, the two conditions  envisaged for the reimbursement of private or state property say  that persons claiming back their property must be citizens of  Lithuania and reside permanently in Lithuania. If it is proved  that these conditions are fulfilled then their property will be  returned, regardless of their nationality, the president said.</p>

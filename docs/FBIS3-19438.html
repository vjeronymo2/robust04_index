The Turkish side has  expressed its satisfaction with this.    But you cannot say the same thing about the protection the  Turkish side is offering our staff who serve in Turkey, because  recently, unidentified people have not only harassed and  threatened these staff, in word and deed, but they have even  targeted their family members. The Turkish side's attention is  drawn to the repercussions that similar actions might have, for  which Ankara would be responsible.    It is demanded that every measure be adopted to end the  harassment and protect our official staff and their families in  Turkey.    All of the above was stressed in relevant representations  made to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and to the Turkish Embassy  here, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement concludes.</p>

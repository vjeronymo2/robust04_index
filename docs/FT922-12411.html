			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Gardening: Under Granada's enduring spell - The earthy legacy of Islam rivals the voyage of Columbus as a monument in the history of Spain IN SPAIN, it is a Fifth Centenary year, but there is more to 1492 than Christopher Columbus. Five hundred years ago, he did indeed set sail from Spain to America, believing that he was heading to Asia by a back route. He was not, however, the only important event of the year. A few months before, Islamic rule had lost its last seat in Europe: the city of Granada was surrendered to the Christian Catholic monopoly of the new rising stars, Ferdinand and Isabella. 'We must adopt the Moslems' works of charity,' advised the first Christian archbishop of Granada, 'and they must adopt our faith.' No sooner had the last Moslem marginal been recaptured than the victors rounded on the third party: in 1492, triumphing Christians savaged the Jews. It all makes for a fitting Fifth Centenary, the more you look at it. First, victory - then, intolerance. The economy, meanwhile, was about to be rescued from the New World by a man who had no idea what he was doing and had actually lost his way. There is also a horticultural story to it all. On the hills of that same Granada stand not one, but two, of the world's great gardens, with a third nursery garden of flowers and shrubs across the hills between them. Their history is one of changing masters, from Moslems through Christians to modern Spaniards. Their origins go back to the last of the Islamic dynasties in southern Spain, the Nasirid sultans of the 13th century. Of the two, the Alhambra is older and more famous, although many of its smaller patio gardens and intricate formal hedging are much later additions to the original. None the less, we can still derive an idea of the Moslems' taste from the Alhambra's famous Court of the Lions and Court of Myrtles. In the former, excavations have shown that the central paths originally were raised above four lower flower beds to show off a carpet of blossom which the sultans viewed from above. Twelve stone lions, as we can still see, spouted water into an intersecting canal among a pattern of flowery formality. In the Court of Myrtles, a broad canal of water ran up to a neat, circular conclusion, just as we still see it. Probably, it was flanked even then by the evergreen hedging and curtains of climbing jasmine which we still enjoy. The fascination of the Alhambra is its particular use of light, inscriptions and architectural decoration. The gardens are fine, but I never think that they compete with those in the Generalise garden, which was begun in the 1320s as a small summer residence for the Moslem governors. There are two derivations of its Arabic name - 'garden of the architect' or 'noblest of gardens' - and I like to think that it referred to both. Here, too, the garden has a link with its first historic plan which goes back way before 1492 to its Islamic phase. In 1958, archaeologists found the bones of the original Islamic garden beneath the Generalise's present Courtyard of the Fountains. Its plan was not so different from the one which we now see but, like so many Islamic gardens, it was divided into four symbolic sections. This pattern is now known all over the Islamic world, from Spain to Afghanistan. In the centre stood a garden pavilion, spanning the point where the water canals met. A Moorish poet of Granada describes a similar design in the 14th century, 'secret for private conversation but open to the approach of inquisitive visitors.' Perhaps it was covered already with jasmine and other climbing plants. These early Islamic gardens were planned for sitting and conversing among the light and shade of evergreen trees, the scents of roses and climbing plants, and the constant play of water. I find it fascinating that so little has changed in the aims of Mediterranean gardening across the centuries. Subsequent masters added Italian and French style, more box hedging and latterly, in Spanish hands, some bright bedding flowers and truly awful garden lights (a final patio flourish, much of which could usefully be reversed in honour of the Fifth Centenary). Once, Moorish summer-houses stretched right up the Generalise's hill and led to the romantic House of the Bride. We have lost them all, along with the pavilion which stood at the meeting point of the garden's four canals. But other features continue, and you can see behind modernity to a charm which makes you happy to imagine a life of retirement as the sultan's man on the hill. In the Generalise, the great leisure pavilions remain and their Islamic decoration and inscriptions are unimpaired. They look down the one surviving canal of water from the likely original design and stand beneath one of the loveliest features on the site. A stone staircase runs down from the highest terrace in the garden, but its handrail is made as a channel for a falling and constantly-moving stream of water. This device could be true in spirit to the garden's origins, one of those 'water-courses beneath the shade of trees' which a contemporary poem on Moslem gardens mentions. It is not inappropriate that so many fountain-jets have been added to make arches of spray in the various pools and canals of the courts below. Their Moslem governors would have loved the effect and sound of this water and its refrain. They would also have appreciated the planting. We know something about the flowers of Spanish gardens in the 14th century from Arabic books and poems and a calendar of the seasons, as described in the nearby city of Cordova. Spanish gardeners since 1900 have done most of the planting which we now see in the Generalise, but much of it would not have seemed odd to its old inhabitants. Cypress, myrtle, blue iris, jasmine, red roses, thyme and narcissus are but a few of the flowers known to have been loved in the gardens of this region under Moslem rule in the 14th century. Since then, some awful zinnias have intruded, but there have also been gains from discoveries in the Far East which Moslems never imagined. This very week, the Generalise is the site of a marvellous curtain of white Banksian roses and cascades of pale purple, scented wisteria. It would take only the smallest discipline and artistic exercise to banish some of the accompanying modern Spanish rubbish and transform the place into a Sittinghurst of southern Europe. Nightingales still sing in the myrtles of the garden's upper terraces, while plaster busts of classical figures look across from the highest terrace to the soft pink stone of the Alhambra's outer walls. In this anniversary year, it is the continuity which continues to impress me. When Arabs first came out of their peninsula into Syria in the 7th century, they had not a clue about proper gardens - let alone the natural, springtime olives and blood-red anemones of Syria; the dovecotes and quinces of Iran; or the wild tulips and irises which stretched through southern Asia and north Africa. In the Koran, their prophet had pictured gardens in heaven only, thick with grapes and fruits: his heirs now found natural gardens all around them in landscapes which Mohammed had never imagined. They were not slow to take to the Mediterranean's natural lessons. There are early reports of huge acts of terracing and transporting as Arab patrons shipped garden plants from one end of the Mediterranean to the other. They fell naturally into a style of greenery, intimacy and water: nowhere seemed more perfect for it than the plains around Granada. During six centuries since, four other cultures have imposed themselves on the two Granada gardens, the Islamic rulers' one surviving monument in this field. In spirit, almost all of them have been striving for a similar effect, although empires and national labels have changed around them with the centuries. The two great gardens of Granada need no single centenary to make the point. 'Granada,' wrote the finest of the Arabic poets in the city's golden age, 'is a bride whose crown is the Alhambra, whose jewels are flowers, whose throne is the Generalise, whose mirror is the surface of its pools, and whose earrings are the drops of frost.' After five centuries and more, that picture is still recognisable.</p>

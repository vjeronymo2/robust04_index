President Kim made the remark while delivering a speech at the  commencement ceremony of the Korea Naval Academy's 48th class in  Chinhae, South Kyongsang Province.    "The people who exploited the sea have prospered and, in the  economic war era of `survival of the fittest,' it is even more  important to exploit the sea," Kim said. The central stage of  world history is moving to the Pacific Ocean, Kim added, and  exchanges and cooperation in the Pacific region are increasing  rapidly.    "Your mission of protecting the sea is becoming more and  more  important," Kim said. Kim noted that the military has been able  to fulfill its mission as a military of the people and as their  final fortress.    "I hope that you will lead change and reform in the military  as the new generation, and I ask you to make personal sacrifices  to build a credible Navy."    "I myself will make strong efforts for better treatment and  promotion of your prosperity, so that you can concentrate on  your mission. I will see to it that professional soldiers feel  they are performing an honorable job for the state and the  nation."</p>

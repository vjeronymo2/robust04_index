			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / People: Another title for Derek Bonham Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, acquired another title yesterday, when he was made deputy chairman, a rank that has not existed at the Anglo-American conglomerate since Gordon White, now Lord White, who is chairman of the US arm, left for America in the early 1970s. At the same time, David Clarke, deputy chairman and ceo of the North American arm Hanson Industries, has been made a vice chairman of the group, alongside Martin Taylor. Derek Rosling, the other vice chairman, is stepping down from that position and will retire in May 1994. Since the position of deputy chairman is senior to vice chairman in the Hanson hierarchy, yesterday's announcement simply underscores Bonham's seniority. Lord Hanson plans to retire in 1997, but a large part of the succession question had already been answered when Bonham, now 50, was made chief executive of the group in April 1992.</p>

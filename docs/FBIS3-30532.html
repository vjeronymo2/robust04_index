			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by D.W.: "GM: The Contract Is Final"] </F>   [Text] Foreign Economic Cooperation Minister Leslaw  Podkanski, who was quoted by TYGODNIK ZAMOJSKI and then by PAP,  issued a negative evaluation of the joint-venture agreement  between the FSO automobile plant and General Motors.    The head of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation  said  that the agreement does not resolve the global issues related to  the restructurization of the Polish automobile industry. He  stated that the sum of 16 million German marks, which the  concern promised to invest in FSO, was "no sum." He also added  that he is against granting the company the guaranteed  preferential system for sales of Opel Astras. He most probably  meant the customs licenses for those cars and the possibility of  selling those cars, just like Fiats, to those who made  prepayments to receive Fiat 126's or FSO's [system of selling  rationed cars under the communist system].    "Our contract has all the necessary signatures,"  RZECZPOSPOLITA was told by John Passadis, the GM representative  in Poland; he added that "the contract is permanent and final.  GM representatives have already arrived at FSO and we are  getting ready to begin manufacturing." Far more painful for GM  Poland was the decision by the Finance Ministry which, as of 1  February, lowered the limit for the 15-percent excise tax on  imported cars from 7,000 ECU's to 8,000 ECU's.    FSO General Director Andrzej Tyszkiewicz said that the  implementation of the contract is in line with the schedule: The  day of "closing" is scheduled for March; the installation of  equipment and machines in the factory will begin in April.</p>

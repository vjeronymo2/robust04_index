			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Five faces of frugality: Emma Tucker on converts to thrift, 1990s-style JOHN WILLIAMS, a 38-year-old businessman, believes there has never been a better time to free himself of debts accumulated in the 1980s. A new refrigerator, a better stereo and even new clothes have been foregone as Mr Williams, who has cut up three of his five credit cards, has made repayment a priority. Although he and his wife are in secure jobs and have no children, they rent a house and do not intend to take out a mortgage to buy property until all their debts - mainly hire purchase agreements, bank loans and outstanding credit card bills - have been paid. Nor will they act until they are sure that house prices have bottomed out. 'I am a great deal less profligate than I used to be. Before I would have spent money on anything that took my fancy and used my credit cards to pay for it. Now I don't want to incur any more debt,' says Mr Williams. ANDREA DIPPLE (right), financial planning manager at a large food and drinks company, had always wanted to buy her own home. She liked the idea of decorating it exactly as she pleased, an option that would not have been open to her had she rented. Unfortunately, her decision to buy a house in Kent at the end of 1989 has already cost her Pounds 20,000, not as a result of extensive home improvements but because the value of the property has fallen from Pounds 64,000 to Pounds 45,000. 'If the privilege of decorating a house as you like it is going to cost Pounds 20,000, then I think I would rather rent,' she says. Keeping up mortgage payments is not a problem for Ms Dipple - her salary has doubled since she bought the house. The real headache is that she has taken a new job 75 miles away and, at the age of 26, finds herself with a deficit of Pounds 20,000 and a house she cannot sell. JOY EVANS and her husband, both retired, sold their Manchester home three years ago, bought a smaller house and put the difference into a building society. The fact that their new house has gone down by some Pounds 10,000 in value does not worry them since they do not envisage having to sell it. Although they have never felt so rich, Mrs Evans says their desire to spend has been curtailed by worries over the difficulties facing their children, one of whom has had to let her house in order to meet her mortgage payments. CHRIS POULTER (right), a foreign exchange dealer at Citibank, has put off buying a house for more than three years and will probably leave it for at least another. In the meantime, most of the money he has earned over the past four years has gone into a building society. 'I haven't bought a car, and I've not had to buy a tv or washing machine, because the flats I have rented already had them,' he says. Although he can afford to go out and spend money, Mr Poulter, 23, says he does not feel particularly rich. With the recession causing job losses throughout the City, fear of unemployment lurks at the back of his mind. 'My current spending plans are certainly nothing more than my living costs and a nice holiday every so often.' DAVID ROBERTS lost his job in a sheet metal manufacturer about two years ago, since when he has done temporary work. He is now Pounds 12,000 in arrears on his mortgage and an order to repossess his Stevenage home has been served. He has reached an arrangement with the building society to continue paying Pounds 235 a month, rising to Pounds 400 at an unspecified future date. In addition to their mortgage problems, Mr Roberts and his wife owe another Pounds 25,000 on bank and hire purchase debts. 'I used to be able to do what I wanted. If the kids needed a pair of trainers I could just go and buy them. Now I have to tell them to wait,' says Mr Roberts. 'We can only afford the basics. I would rather save to buy something than run up debts again.'</p>

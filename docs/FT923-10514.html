			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Ford of Europe turns in Dollars 24m profit FORD of Europe achieved a net profit of Dollars 24m in the second quarter of the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 75m in the corresponding period a year ago. The pace of the company's financial recovery in Europe remains slow, however, following a net profit of Dollars 84m in the first quarter which compared with a loss of Dollars 129m in the same period of 1991. Ford said Jaguar, its troubled UK luxury car subsidiary, suffered a loss of around Dollars 70m in the second quarter, virtually unchanged from a year ago. Jaguar made a loss of Dollars 90m in the first quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 130m in the same period a year ago. Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a net loss in the whole of last year of Dollars 1.08bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989. The company said that Ford of Britain - now excluding Jaguar, whose ownership was transferred last year to the US parent company - had achieved a small profit in the second quarter as in the first quarter, after running up record losses in the whole of last year. Ford of Britain's financial performance improved thanks to higher production volumes, cost reductions and in particular lower marketing costs. Ford said its marketing costs across Europe were virtually unchanged from a year ago, however. Costs in the UK have been reduced 'substantially' by a cut in sales to the daily rental fleets and through reduced dealer stocks, but this has been offset by higher marketing expenditure in Germany, where competition is becoming more fierce as the market declines. Ford has lost market share in the west European car market this year largely through the weakness of its ageing Sierra large family car range. It hopes to boost its fortunes early next year, however, with the launch of the new generation Sierra as well as a redesigned Escort/Orion later this year. In 1993-94 it is planning to export two new product ranges from the US to Europe, the Probe sports coupe and the Explorer four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle, while sales are also due to start next year of another four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle to be produced for Ford in Spain by Nissan.</p>

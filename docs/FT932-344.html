			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop buys Plumrose operations PACIFIC DUNLOP, the diversified Australian industrial group, has acquired the Australian and New Zealand operations of Plumrose, the foods company, from Denmark's East Asiatic Company (EAC) for ADollars 225m (USDollars 151m). EAC also announced that the planned sale of its Plumrose companies in the UK and the US to the Danish slaughterhouse group, Vestjyske Slagterier (VJS), would proceed. VJS and EAC are also co-operating in the development of the Plumrose operationsin Germany with a view to a future sale to VJS. EAC publishes no separate sales and profits figures for the Australian and New Zealand groups, but the performance in 1992 was said in the group's annual report to be 'very satisfactory'. The sale of the Plumrose operations, as well as the disposal earlier this year of the EAC container shipping line to the Danish AP Moller group, will help strengthen the group's finances. In 1992, the group made a loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 180m). Equity capital fell to DKr2.55bn from Dkr3.82bn on assets which were down to DKr14.66bn from DKr15.70bn.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Books: A mercenary business ONE MILLION MERCENARIES: SWISS SOLDIERS IN THE ARMIES OF THE WORLD by John McCormack Leo Cooper Pounds 18.50, 224 pages Despite its somewhat fatuous title - the actual number of Swiss who served in foreign armies cannot be so easily calculated - this is an excellent and absorbing study, albeit a brief one. Every precaution however should be taken to prevent any copies falling into the hands of our present cabinet. It contains too many hints on how to profitably privatise the military. Given that Switzerland is now synonymous with watches, fine chocolate, the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention, it comes as a mild shock to learn just how warlike the Swiss of yore could be. Yet warlike they were. In the closing decades of the 15th century and opening decades of the 16th, Swiss infantry was invincible. Not only did it secure the independence of the original cantons, but it wrecked Charles the Bold's attempt to transform Burgundy into a European power; and it also played a not infrequently decisive role in the Italian Wars of Charles VIII and Francis I. Swiss prowess was based on the pike. A hardy mountain people unused to horses, they had somehow to cope with cavalry attacks across the Alpine lowlands. The pike square, sometimes caricatured as a hedgehog, provided the solution. Used defensively it could withstand the charge of any cavalry; used offensively, it could mow down opposing infantry. In time the development of firearms and cannon undermined the pike. But by then the Swiss had earned themselves an unassailable reputation, and for more than three centuries most major European armies - but especially the French - had their Helvetian contingents. And they made good soldiers. As John McCormack records, so long as they were paid they could be relied upon to perform well, sometimes brilliantly, in battle. In many major European engagements, their contribution won the day. In short, as mercenaries, the Swiss were the exception that proved the rule. This had largely to do with an esprit de corps that, once established, refused to die; and with a lack of opportunity to follow the noble profession of arms within Switzerland's own borders. But as the mercenary tradition evolved, so did the business. An estimated 0.2 per cent of the Swiss population were employed as mercenaries at any given time in the 17th and 18th centuries, their repatriated earnings and pensions accounting for 6 per cent or more of the gross national product. The mercenary companies however were literally owned by their commanders, who hired them out according to the terms of 'Capitulations' negotiated between the Swiss Diet and foreign states. Over the years, 'Military Enterpriser' families gained a stranglehold over Swiss politics and the national economy. Where McCormack fails in his otherwise impeccable inquiry is with regard to the latterday exploitation of capital accumulated by these Enterprisers. Hoffman-Laroche is anecdotally cited as a beneficiary, but it would be interesting to discover exactly how many other Swiss corporations owe their existence to hard currencies earned the hard way. The demise of Swiss mercenary forces coincided with the growth of nationally conscripted armies, following the French Revolution. The interesting question, however, is whether the Swiss regiments would have petered out in any case. The evidence McCormack assembles strongly suggests that during the course of the 18th century the double burden of military leadership and business management was too much for the captains. As profit margins diminished, so they had to make savings where they could. Pay, provisions, morale and discipline - in a word, effectiveness - suffered accordingly.</p>

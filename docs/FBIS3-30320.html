Jeszenszky arrived in  Belgrade for an official visit, at the invitation of Yugoslav  Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic.    Speaking to the press after the talks, Jeszenszky said that  Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of  Vojvodina Hungarians (DCVH), was a welcome presence at the  talks. He said topics discussed included bilateral relations,  economic problems and ways to develop economic cooperation.    The two sides agreed that both Hungary and Yugoslavia should  form bridges with Europe and the Middle East -- their geographic  location should be utilized. Jeszenszky added that a priority  consideration for Hungary is that the Hungarians in Vojvodina  should have a secure future.    "Along with the presence of Andras Agoston, another  encouragement was the fact that President Milosevic said the  Vojvodina Hungarians will enjoy full equality. He also said  they can and will have institutions which they deem necessary  for themselves. This is significant not only for our two  countries, but can serve as a model settlement for the  ethnically mixed region," Jeszenszky said.    Milosevic also said the Serbian Government does not tolerate  any actions that could lead to citizens fleeing their  birthplaces. The main problem today is of an economic nature,  and this is largely the consequence of the sanctions.    Jeszenszky said he is not competent to judge whether the  conditions offered will be sufficient for peace in Bosnia, but  he voiced the hope that the proposal tabled by the European  Union, based on the Kinkel-Juppe proposal, could bring an end to  the conflict. Jeszenszky said the Serbian side is committed to  meet the expectations and the motions.    The Hungarian foreign minister discussed the so-called  Krajina issue with the Serbian president, and the matter of  territories near Hungary, such as Baranya.    "Large numbers of refugees have arrived in Hungary from  there, fleeing the war and threats by people who forced them to  leave. I expressed the hope that these people will be able to  return to their homes as soon as possible," Jeszenszky said.    He also voiced the hope that major facilities like the Adria  oil pipeline will again become operational. "It is important  for hostilities to finally come to an end here, not only for the  two countries, but for all Europe as well," the foreign minister  said.    Jeszenszky again stated that Hungary would gladly support  the  lifting of sanctions, but this can only take place if Serbia  wins approval from the international community, which can be  achieved only through their actions.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said his talks  with Foreign Minister Jeszenszky touched upon all walks of  bilateral relations and international life.    "During our talks on Friday, we should deal more with  bilateral relations. With the approach of an end to the  south-Slav crisis, it will be possible to expand relations with  the neighbouring countries. Foreign Minister Jeszenszky is the  first arrival, and his visit indicates we have arrived at the  start of normalizing relations with the neighbouring countries,"  the Yugoslav foreign minister said.</p>

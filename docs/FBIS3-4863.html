			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Tuesday [1 March] that he will make a final  decision Wednesday whether to immediately reshuffle his nearly  seven-month-old cabinet.    Hosokawa expressed his intention to reporters following a  series of separate meetings with coalition party leaders to seek  agreement on his plan to shake up the cabinet.    However, an increasing number of the coalition parties  believe that Hosokawa may have to give up the plan because of a  tight Diet business schedule and strong opposition from the  Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sakigake (Harbinger) and the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), coalition members said.    During a series of separate talks, the prime minister said  he  wants to tackle economic reform issues, including trade friction  between the U.S. and Japan and deregulation, with a second  Hosokawa Cabinet, political sources said.    But the SDP, the DSP and Sakigake, which is headed by Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, are opposed to an early  cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito and Komeito are endorsing the  premier's plan.    The primary purpose of the cabinet reorganization is widely  believed to be the replacement of Takemura, top government  spokesman and chief of staff, who has been at odds with Hosokawa  over several of the government's important policy themes.    Takemura told Hosokawa in a meeting that a cabinet reshuffle  could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, the  sources said.    Takemura maintains he will not take another cabinet post if  Hosokawa changes his cabinet, they said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked Hosokawa to drop his  intention for an early shake-up, stressing the need for the  cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues, they said.    Murayama and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi told Hosokawa that  they  oppose the replacement of Takemura, warning such action will  damage the coalition foundation, the sources said.    Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that  the party will support the scheme to reshape the cabinet.    Hata, who serves as foreign minister and deputy prime  minister, said he notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting  at the premier's official residence, they said.    A top government official, who did not want to be  identified,  said Hosokawa still plans to reshuffle the cabinet Wednesday.  He said Hosokawa is ready to accept some negative impact  following the planned cabinet reshuffle.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Thoughts of devaluation gain currency: Economists are starting to think the unthinkable THE grim cocktail of economic fragility, a sliding pound and tension over the Maastricht treaty is forcing financial markets to think the unthinkable. They are dusting off theories about a possible sterling devaluation. Even though Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected in a speech in London tonight to repeat his strong opposition to such a move, some private-sector economists are pondering the circumstances that might force him into it. Mr John Shepperd, of SG Warburg Securities, the London investment group, says: 'The longer the recession drags on and the Bundesbank keeps German interest rates high, the stronger the possibility of a devaluation.' Mr David Brown of the London office of Swiss Bank Corporation says: 'This week the markets have caught the devaluation jitters. It's going to be a difficult few months.' For all such talk, the government is a long way from thinking seriously about devaluation. Any action to reduce the pound's DM2.95 central rate in the European exchange rate mechanism - or to leave the ERM - would be seen as a huge backward step. It would end the UK's policy of trying to control inflation by linking the pound to the D-Mark, and severely damage Britain's European credentials. Others view devaluation as a sensible measure to enable UK interest rates to be reduced and end the longest recession for 50 years. Because German rates are so high, Mr Lamont is unable to reduce UK borrowing costs without risking a fall in sterling that would breach its ERM limit. Several factors explain why devaluation - for all its negative connotations  -is starting to figure in economists' talks. Economic woes: The end to the recession still appears some time away. Many economists expect a further economic contraction this year, after a 2.4 per cent decline in 1991. In those circumstances, base rates at 10 per cent are extremely high, especially with inflation at about 4 per cent to 5 per cent. Any move that could help in a reduction in loan rates might appear attractive. According to Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, the best way to do that would be to leave the ERM and let sterling find its level beneath its central ERM rate. Sterling's slip: Partly because of the economic gloom - and helped by the recent rise of the D-Mark against the dollar - the pound has lost ground heavily in recent weeks. From about DM2.94 at the end of May, it touched DM2.8585 yesterday before closing against a weaker German currency at DM2.88. The weak pound makes it all the harder for Mr Lamont to cut rates. Maastricht muddle: With progress towards European economic and monetary union far less certain than it appeared earlier this year, worries are surfacing that an unravelling of the Maastricht treaty might shake investors' faith in the ERM. That could lead to heavy selling of weaker currencies - including the pound and the lira - with the resultant strain either necessitating a currency realignment or leading to the collapse of the system. A senior British official says: 'Emu is very important to the ERM. If Maastricht comes unstuck, perhaps after the French referendum result (in September), managing the ERM might become difficult.' Bundesbank obduracy: Top officials at the Bank of England are not expecting any cut in German rates until the late autumn. That is because inflation and monetary growth - both given a strong push by reunification - are still too high for the liking of the German central bank. That seems likely to give Britain little leeway to cut rates over the next few months. Much depends on economic data to be published over the next month or so. Although ministers do not have to worry about facing voters for another four or five years, many other groups - backbenchers, industrialists and investors - are in a position to apply pressure to stoke a recovery. Against that is the theory that reducing sterling's value might not lead to a long-term lowering of interest rates. Confidence in sterling might be shattered by the huge step of either leaving the ERM or arranging a realignment. As a result, the UK would be back to its position in the 1980s of having to cope with periodic sterling crises and rapid changes in interest rates - the very events ERM membership was meant to avoid.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARS TO TRANSFER, LAY OFF WORKERS  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said Saturday it has begun notifying some of its  office workers that they will either be transferred or let go after New Year's  Day.  </P> <P> The affected employees are an undetermined number among the estimated 20,000  people who work in areas including customer service, accounting and payroll in  the 850 Sears stores across the nation, spokesman Gerald Buldak said.  </P> <P> "It's really too soon to tell" how many employees will be affected, but most  work part time, Buldak said. He added that some staff functions will be merged  at a hub office in some stores.  </P> <P> "Employees displaced would have an opportunity to work elsewhere in a store, if  a job existed, or would not have a job," he said.  </P> <P> Last fall, the company began seeking ways to improve customer service and to  cut costs, Buldak said. Using employee ideas, Sears tested pared-down  procedures at 10 stores, he said.  </P> <P> The company began notifying workers late last week that they could be either  transferred or lose their jobs through a nationwide cost-cutting effort, Buldak  said.  </P> <P> Last month, Sears reported sharply lower net income for the third straight  quarter, with overall earnings down 30%, but said that its retail unit had  improved. The retail group accounts for more than half of all company revenues.  </P></p>

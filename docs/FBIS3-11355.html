Group is on the verge of  purchasing a refinery located in Cuba's Cienfuegos Province,  sources close to the negotiations told the FINANCIAL SATELLITE  NEWS SERVICE (FINSAT).    Mexpetrol authorities have declined to comment on the report  and have referred questions on the matter to Mexican Petroleum  (Pemex), which owns 25 percent of Mexpetrol's stock. In turn,  the Pemex public relations office would only say: "This is a  sensitive issue, and we have been instructed to deal with it  cautiously."    Meanwhile, National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomex) officials  said: "Cuba and business Mexico conducts with the Caribbean  island are sensitive issues in light of our country's current  relations with the United States." Bancomex is another  government partner of Mexpetrol, holding 5 percent of Mexpetrol  stock.    According to information supplied by officials familiar with  the negotiations who requested anonymity, "one of the stumbling  blocks to concluding the talks is that the Cuban authorities are  asking a very high price for some installations that have  obsolete technology"; these officials refused to give specific  amounts.    The refinery in question has a 60,000 barrel per day [bpd]  heavy crude processing capacity, which is similar to the  capacity of Pemex's Maya refinery. Industry sources place its  value between $15 and $200 million [figures as published].    The U.S. publication "The Latin American Energy Alert" which  circulates in North America has disclosed that Mexpetrol  authorities met with Cuban authorities in Havana in February to  discuss the possible purchase. It appears the refinery  currently operates at half of its installed capacity by  producing 60,000 bpd [as published]. According to the  publication, the Cuban Government will sell the Cienfuegos  refinery in exchange for Mexpetrol's promise to release part of  the refined production to the island for internal use. Once  refined, the remaining crude would be exported and marketed in  Mexico.    The Cienfuegos refinery was designed with Soviet technology.  It previously processed Venezuelan crude when Venezuela sold  its products to the then-Soviet Union, and from this fact it is  assumed heavy crude will continue to be processed at the  refinery.    Currently, Pemex hold 25 percent of Mexpetrol's stock while  Bancomex and the Mexican Petroleum Institue hold 5 percent  apiece. The rest of the stock is held by the Mexican  construction companies Protexa, Bufete Industrial, Ingenieros  Civiles Asociados, and Equipo Petroleros Nacionales. Up until  last year the Lanzagorta group held 13 percent of Mexpetrol  stock, but at the beginning of 1993 it sold its holdings and  withdrew from the company. Before now, this has never been  officially reported.</p>

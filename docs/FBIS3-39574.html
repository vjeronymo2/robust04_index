Kozyrev, who has often  made contradictory statements and rejected NATO influence in the  East as well as a tough military stance against the Serbs in  recent weeks, had the joint appeal with Kinkel published in the  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE (Friday [18 February] edition).    In the article, the foreign ministers, who are meeting in  Athens on Thursday and Friday, conjure up a "long-term strategic  vision." The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO is not  mentioned, but what is mentioned is a strategy for partnership  that must entail support for political and economic reforms in  Russia and neighboring countries. According to the paper, the  Foreign Ministry stressed that in view of the outcome of the  Russian elections, Kozyrev accorded particular importance to  continuing free market economic development in drawing up the  appeal.</p>

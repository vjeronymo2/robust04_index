			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: Volumes in learning - take it as read What happens to all those management books that get published in greater number each year? There must be a market for them, or publishers would not print so many. But who has the time (or the inclination) to sit down and read them? The answer seems to be, practically nobody. Managers buy the books, only to leave them on their shelves for show-off value, or at best to dip into them briefly. The Management Training Partnership, a training consultancy, has done some research into the reading habits of the UK's personnel directors, and found that three-quarters of them buy at least four heavyweight management books a year, but only one in five of these volumes stands any chance of being read. The problem is partly the books themselves - which are too long and too tedious - and partly that managers have no opportunity to read volumes during the day and no desire to do so at night. While they may buy Charles Handy's latest or Michael Hammer's book on re-engineering, the only book that they have actually read right through over the years is The Goal, written by the Israeli eccentric Eli Goldratt. And the reason they have read that is that it is written as a pacy novel. The message to writers and publishers is that if they want their books to be read, as well as sold, the style cannot be too downmarket, and the arguments cannot be summarised too briefly nor in big enough letters. So far the lesson has not been learnt: few books contain such summaries. The problem may be that if you condense the arguments in many management books too ruthlessly, you would be left with simple statements of the glaringly obvious. What does the inside of your bathroom cabinet look like? Is the toothbrush near the toothpaste, and are both located for ease of access? Are your ties hung up with the colours ranging from dark to light for speed of selection? Is your breakfast routine organised in such a way that you do not move from the cupboard to the table more than once? If not, you could be wasting valuable minutes every day. These are some of the handy tips contained in a new edition of How to Gain an Extra Hour Every Day. This is one volume that does not suffer from the general malaise of management books: it has sold 2.5m copies since it was published in 1955, and almost every page is a quick-to-read summary, containing few words of more than two syllables. People may read this sort of thing - but do they take any notice? It is all very well to be told to get up at 5am, do several hours' work before breakfast, to move your toothbrush from its accustomed space, and to make lists of priorities every day on a wallchart in your office, which will be so tidy it will have almost nothing else in it. But try living that way. It's easier to show willing by buying the book. Ray Josephs, the author of this fine work, is 82 years old and still charging round Europe armed with aide memoires and maps, and sending off letters with all the important bits highlighted in yellow pen. He is part of a tradition of elderly management writers who seem to keep going longer than people in almost any other line of business. W. Edwards Deming, the father of them all and inventor of total quality management, was 93 when he died last year. Peter Drucker is in his mid-80s and still going strong. At first sight it is surprising that in an area so full of fads, gurus can survive for half a century and more. Perhaps it proves that it's a cushy life being a guru. Alternatively, it shows that fashions change only on the surface; people will always want more time, to be better at motivating employees, and to achieve greater efficiency. Anyone on to a good idea does well to stick to it. I was taken aback the other day to get a letter inviting me to reconsider a donation I had made to the Rwanda Emergency Appeal. Apparently the government has decided that anyone who gives more than Pounds 50 with a credit card in response to a charity's plea on TV should be allowed to think better of it. There are many expenditures that it would be good to be given a chance to reconsider, but this happens not to be one of them. What about that awful sofa, that expensive holiday, that ludicrous pair of shoes, that second-hand car with the alarming clanking sound? And what about all those sluggish investments? Some shops give you your money back if you change your mind, but for most expenditures there is no way out. As there is nothing to insure us from a burst of greed or vanity, why should we be given protection from a shortlived burst of generosity? Perhaps the government feels that the sight of starving children beamed into our living rooms makes us spend more than we otherwise would. But surely that is the whole point.</p>

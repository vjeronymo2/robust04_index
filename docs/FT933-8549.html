			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: No logic in tax laws THE INLAND Revenue has advised that, for the moment, it considers me as normally resident in the UK for tax purposes. I had an overseas investment in the Guinness Flight International Balanced Growth fund, which is in US dollars. To try to maximise currency gains, I recently switched to a different fund under the same 'umbrella' in pounds sterling. It seems to me that the element of gain accruing from movement in exchange rates should logically be treated as a capital gain as distinct from movement in the quoted price which, I understand the Inland Revenue treats as investment income. Both types of gain would then be reported separately to the Revenue. Is this the case and, if so, at which exchange rate is the gain in the price in pounds to be calculated: the start, finish or average? It is rarely possible to deduce one's UK tax liabilities by the use of logic. Over the years, we have tried to get across the message that UK taxation is levied according to complex and arbitrary rules laid down by parliament with scant regard for logic or equity. Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 28 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, your income tax gain will be calculated by deducting the cost (translated to sterling at the rate of exchange for the day of the purchase contract) from the market value on the day of the switch (translated to sterling at the rate of exchange for that day). You will have a capital gains tax loss equal to indexation on the cost figure. If, however, you are regarded by the French tax authorities as resident in France, then it is possible that article 13(3) of the France-UK double taxation convention (in conjunction with article 3(2)) will protect you from assessment to UK income tax on the notional gain. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOWELL'S HOMER WINS IT;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FETTERS GETS HIS FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE VICTORY AS ANGELS BEAT BREWERS,  4-3, IN 11.  </P> <P> Hitting the home run that gave the Angels their second consecutive extra-inning  victory Saturday brought extra satisfaction to Jack Howell.  </P> <P> Howell's opposite-field home run with two out in the 11th inning lifted the  Angels to a 4-3 victory in Milwaukee's County Stadium and boosted his  confidence beyond what a .223 batting average would suggest. His diligence and  willingness to take advantage of teammate Dave Winfield as a resource paid in a  two-for-four performance that included Howell's first home run since June 21  and gave reliever Mike Fetters his first major league victory.  </P> <P> "When you're hitting below .200 and things aren't successful, you abandon a lot  of things," said Howell, who hit a pitch from Randy Veres (0-1) into the  left-field bullpen. "Not only DJ (hitting instructor Deron Johnson), but  (equally) as important is Dave Winfield. Since Cleveland, when I sat out three  games, I've been hitting with DJ and going over a bunch of different  philosophies. One thing we talked about was hitting the outside pitch and going  with it.  </P> <P> "In my previous at-bat (a fly to the left-field warning track in the ninth  inning), I thought I hit the ball fairly well. He was throwing me everything  away, so I was looking for a pitch away and that's what he threw. As far as  Winfield, the thing that's been the big key isn't mechanics but what pitchers  are going to do. He told me I can hit the ball the other way, but it's been  other things, too. Winfield hasn't stepped on any toes."  </P> <P> Winfield, who entered the game as a defensive replacement in the 11th inning,  downplayed his role in Howell's success. "We just talk some baseball," he said.  "DJ's worked with him and I just talk to him like I talk to all my teammates."  </P> <P> The Angels, who are 4-5 on this trip with one game left, were able to talk  about a sweep in Milwaukee because Fetters pitched two solid innings after  starter Chuck Finley's nine-inning effort. Finley struck out a season-high 10  batters but was unable to hold a 3-0 lead the Angels had provided him after  four innings.  </P> <P> "I did what I can do. I'm not disappointed with anything," said Finley, a  27-year-old left-hander whose record remained at 11-4 with a 2.54 earned-run  average and 84 strikeouts in 117 innings.  </P> <P> "It was just one of those nights were they weren't hitting it real hard. There  were lots of rollers. . . . I felt like I did what I needed to do, and it was  great to see Mike get his first big league win. I remember my first one, in  1986."  </P> <P> Finley seemed likely to collect his 12th victory after the Angels provided him  a run in the first inning and two more in the fourth.  </P> <P> Luis Polonia led off the game with a triple into the right-field corner, and he  scored on Max Venable's sacrifice fly to center. The lead grew to 3-0 in the  fourth inning when second baseman Johnny Ray, who entered the game with 11 hits  in his previous 22 at-bats, got his first of two hits Saturday with a single to  right field with one out. Lance Parrish followed that by smashing a 2-and-1  pitch into the left-field seats for his 16th home run of the season.  </P> <P> Milwaukee cut that lead to 3-2 in the fifth inning, stirring first when Rob  Deer led off with a 425-foot blast into the left-field seats. "He just crunched  it," Finley said. "He got it up and out. I challenged him and he hit it. But it  don't matter how far it went, it's still only one run."  </P> <P> But the Brewers scored another in that inning when Jim Gantner singled to  center, stole second and scored when Gary Sheffield hit a liner to left that  hopped over the glove of Polonia for a triple. Finley ended the inning by  inducing Robin Yount to pop to second.  </P> <P> Pete O'Brien, the eighth hitter in the Brewers' lineup, started the  seventh-inning rally that tied the game, 3-3. He singled to left, moved to  second on a well-executed sacrifice by Bill Spiers and, after Gantner struck  out, scored on Sheffield's double to left.  </P> <P> The Brewers put a runner in scoring position in the 10th inning when Deer  reached on an infield single and moved up on O'Brien's sacrifice, but Fetters  was able to bear down and retire Spiers on a fly to left and Gantner on a  grounder to the right side.  </P> <P> A 10th-inning Brewer threat was thwarted when Dave Parker was stranded on  second base after a double.  </P> <P> "After being swept in Toronto, coming here and winning the first two is really  big," said Fetters, who was promoted from triple-A Edmonton on May 18 after  Finley had sprained his left ankle and had to miss a start in Toronto.  </P> <P> "I was looking forward to getting in tonight -- well, I was looking forward to  Chuck getting a nine-inning victory, but I'm glad I could get my first one."  </P> <P> Howell has taken heart from the Angels' 16-inning victory Friday and the  comparatively brief win Saturday, which leaves them 5-4 in extra-inning games.  </P> <P> "It would definitely be nice to sweep this series right before the (All-Star)  break," he said. "It would give us a really good feeling going into those two  days off."  </P></p>

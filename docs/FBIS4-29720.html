			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Brian Hansford] </F>   [Text] Sitting down together rather than shooting one  another is the main achievement of Cambodia's coalition  politicians, according to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.    "Parties have turned from confrontation to cooperation,  politically and militarily, in the months of the coalition  government. This is the biggest favourable point in the last 20  years," Hun Sen told Inside Indochina.    The interview took place before Interior Minister Yu Hokkri  ordered the closure of the Khmer Rouge [KR] office in Phnom  Penh, citing the failure of peace talks.    Hun Sen denies that dialogue is superficial. He acknowledges  there are disputes at lower levels of Phnom Penh's  administration, but says they are not necessarily political  disagreements between the main coalition partners of FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and  Cooperative Cambodia] and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP].    "Cooperation between Prince Ranariddh and me is good. We  seem to be coming from one party," said the CPP's top man in  government.    "I do not mean all our officials have such good cooperation  but differences between officials do not require many parties.  I used to lead a government with one party and used to  experience differences between provincial governors and deputy  governors or ministers and deputy ministers who come from only  one party."    Hun Sen made clear that he believes the country's main  problem is the Khmer Rouge rather than coalition politics.    "I am fed up with this matter (of outlawing the guerrillas)  because in such a state of hesitancy it's difficult for me to  work," said Hun Sen repeating his wish to outlaw the Khmer Rouge  during the next session of Cambodia's parliament.    Cambodia's "second problem" is economic development although  the stable Cambodian currency, the riel, in recent months shows  people's increased confidence in the government's economic  measures, according to Hun Sen. However, Phnom Penh officials  say the Cambodian premier has much less confidence in the  country's finance minister, Sam Rangsi.    Officials say Hun Sen has spoken of Rangsi's trying to set  up  Western economic systems too quickly for Cambodia, despite the  fact the finance ministry has support from world financial  bodies including loans from the International Monetary Fund  (IMF).    "The third problem relates to restructuring our  administration. Cambodia's civil and military administration are  combined from three factions. That's why the number of civilian  and military (personnel) today is more than our finance can  support.    "Before the same source of income was used to feed the  people  of the State of Cambodia (the pre-election government) but now  the same source has to feed other people from other factions,"  Hun Sen said, explaining the chronic overstaffing of government  offices.    But last year's election results and the resulting coalition  government with three main parties and their extra personnel is  only a partial explanation for the government's overstaffing,  according to independent experts.    "This holds true to a large extent on the military and  police  sides with the merging of the FUNCINPEC and BLDP [Buddhist  Liberal Democratic Party] forces with those of the pre-election  government, but the civil administration was already way  overmanned," a Phnom Penh-based diplomat said.    More than two years ago a World Bank study noted: "The size  of the administration is larger than public management norms  recommend and creates problems of duplication and its root cause  of overstaffing."    Regular Cambodian government troops are estimated at 160,000  with a similar number of civil servants. These are figures  which some experts say are around 10 times and twice as much,  respectively, as appropriate for cash-strapped Cambodia.    Independent explanations for such chronic overmanning focus  on reasons of political patronage and corruption but, whatever  the cause, Hun Sen admits such overmanning breeds inefficiency  and corruption which in turn deters potential investors.    "We have to do our best so investors can be confident, to  secure stability for investment and put in practice the new code  of investment, decrease tax and to cut short the paperwork. We  have to get ride of corruption," Hun Sen said.    His ideal is that foreign investment will create jobs and  attract people from the state sector. This will allow better  pay for the remaining government employees, reducing corruption.    Numerous Cambodian businessmen and officials, as well as  expatriates, have stressed the importance of dialogue among  Cambodia's coalition leaders. Despite encouraging words from  some officials the reality is bleak.    A more worrying aspect is the image of apparent government  impotence or at worst a lack of interest in the face of the  overstaffed, inefficient state apparatus.    "The danger of not tackling these issues is that you give  the  impression there is no political will or that people don't  recognise the problems. That sends a very bad signal not only  to the international community -- private sector and donor --  but also to the population," said an experienced international  aid official working in Cambodia.    As Hun Sen said: "Right or wrong is one thing but the  important thing is to correct our mistakes."</p>

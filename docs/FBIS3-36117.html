The premier was pleased to  note that Estonia made a breakthrough at the forum. "Estonia was  all the time spoken about as a real partner," he said.    Laar said at a press conference today that economies in  transition became the focus of attention at the Davos forum.  "The participants arrived at the conclusion that the transition  of many states from a planned economy to a market economy makes  also developed countries undergo major changes," he claimed.    The premier said the forum attached great importance to free  trade and opening of borders as the best ways to develop world  economy. "The protectionist attitude is considered the greatest  danger to world economy," he noted.    Laar said a high-level Russian delegation arrived in Davos  to  convince Western businessmen and politicians that economic  reforms continue in Russia. "I gathered they didn't succeed very  well in this," he said.    The Estonian premier had several bilateral and three-way  meetings in Davos. He was pleasantly surprised by the Palestine  Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat's high regard for  Estonia.    Laar met in Davos with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.  The two agreed in principle to conclude as soon as possible a  free-trade agreement between the two countries.    The Estonian premier met also with his Swedish and Finnish  counterparts, Carl Bildt and Esko Aho. Laar said he and Bildt  had a thorough discussion of the situation in Paldiski. "Sweden  is prepared to assist Estonia in cleaning up the environment in  that town," he said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miomir Strbac: "Transformation Conflict in 120 </F> Pictures"]    [Text] The Privatization Fund's right to increase the  value of its principal and the buyer's ownership package by  approving additional capitalization of enterprises is viewed by  small shareholders as robbery, and by the presidents of  commercial courts as "a flagrant violation of rights," but the  fund retorts that "they are interpreting the law in a hostile  manner and undermining the state." The dispute over additional  capitalization, which was sparked by the case of Split's Dairy,  is currently before the Constitutional Court, and 120 buyers are  in doubt as to whether what they have bought will be granted  them.    The case is called U-171/94, and it is just now in the  process of being resolved by the Constitutional Court. The  problem that is being dealt with within the covers of the  documents with that designation, in dry lawyers' language, is  designated as "additional capitalization--entry in the  registry." In practice, however, during discussions of that same  subject completely different expressions are being used, and  thus some people are talking about theft and robbery, others  about a flagrant violation of the rights of small shareholders,  and yet others think that the statements of the former (and to  some extent the latter) are "a hostile interpretation of the law  equivalent to destruction of the state."    Just the harsh words used in those verbal clashes indicate  that this is a hot dispute, and when it also turns out that the  "former" are small shareholders (and a large number of ordinary  citizens), the "latter" are the presidents of Croatia's  commercial courts, and the "yet others" are the Croatian  Privatization Fund, it is clear why the entire problem has been  transferred to the Constitutional Court, before too much of a  public hue and cry could be raised and before teams of  supporters could be formed.  <H5>  From Disputes to Arrests </H5>   Nevertheless, while the constitutional judges, in the peace  of the country's highest judicial institution, are leafing  through and analyzing the materials they have received, the  polemics, nervousness, and conflicts outside of that court  building have not stopped. Furthermore, one of the incidents  that have emerged in the dispute over the case of "additional  capitalization--entry in the registry," namely Split's Dairy,  resulted a few days ago in the arrest of the protagonists of  that additional capitalization, Sinisa Caktas, Ivo Cecuk, and  Ferri Toth, with an uncertain outcome. At the same time, as many  as approximately 120 transformations in Croatia have been  completed following the model over which the "constitutional  war" has been started, and so now a big question mark is written  over each of them. Let us go in order, then.    Everything started back in February 1993, when amendments to  the Law on Transformation restricted the right of employees and  other privileged groups to purchase shares to 50 percent of the  assessed value of an enterprise. The Privatization Fund, to  which the rest of the shares were required to be transferred,  however, was given the right to sell them to the highest bidder  after publishing a public advertisement for that purpose. Sales  of shares following that model started in mid-1993, and as a  rule the bidders, along with buying an offered package of shares  in a given enterprise, also offered additional capitalization in  varying amounts. At that time such an arrangement seemed  indisputably good and desirable, both from the standpoint of the  buyer of the shares, the Privatization Fund (and thus the  state), and probably also the small shareholders.    In fact, it turned out, logically, that investors are not  willing to invest hundreds of thousands or millions of German  marks [DM] in shares in any enterprise without obtaining a  majority ownership and management package. That was ensured  precisely through additional capitalization, which increased the  firm's capital and expanded the shareholder stock, which was 50  percent larger in the buyer's hands. As far as the state is  concerned, its calculation was that additional capitalization  meant fresh capital that would help restructuring, modernizing,  and developing the firms sold, and would accelerate desirable  privatization. For the same reason, employees were supposed to  believe that additional capitalization and privatization would  bring them new economic vitality, a more certain future, and  higher wages.  <H5>  The Shareholders Do Not Believe It </H5>   We say "were supposed to believe" because it soon turned out  that at some enterprises the small shareholders, above all,  believe that through the decision on additional capitalization  of their firm without their consent, the fund was unfairly  seizing control over the enterprise and their own fate out of  their hands, and leaving them at the mercy of a private  businessman who, as he saw fit, could declare them surplus,  dismiss them, pay them badly, or disband and sell off "their"  enterprise. Those are the cries with which the first protests  began--i.e., at the level of raising an uproar over justice and  robbery--and since they began very soon to embrace ideas about  the Privatization Fund's illegal action and arbitrary action in  all this, the fund decided to protect itself. At the end of last  year, without any opposition whatsoever from the Assembly  deputies, it proposed and obtained an amendment to the Law on  Transformation that authorized it to increase, by its own  decision, the principal of an enterprise being transformed into  a stock company by the amount of additional capitalization that  was accepted. It seemed that everything was now all right, as  least as far as the legal aspect was concerned.    As ill luck would have it, the Zagreb enterprise Pismorad  appealed to the Croatian Constitutional Court to investigate the  legality of that legal authorization for the fund, and then the  presidents of all the commercial courts in Croatia met in Zagreb  on 9 February. This was, therefore, a group that from the legal  standpoint can discuss very authoritatively a subject like  "additional capitalization--entry in the registry." On 11  February Vladimir Gusin, president of the High Commercial Court,  sent the conclusions from that meeting to all subordinate  courts, with instructions to inform all judges and employees at  court registries with them, but also the Croatian Constitutional  Court, the government, the Ministry of Justice, the Assembly,  the Public Legal Defender, the Privatization Fund....    In those conclusions, analyzing the legal provision that  allows the Privatization Fund, by its own decision, to increase  the principal of an enterprise in the process of transformation  by the amount of the additional capitalization accepted, the  presidents of the commercial courts also say the following:  "This provision of the Law on the Transformation of Socialized  Enterprises is in direct violation of the provision in article  49, paragraph 4 of the Croatian Constitution, which says,  `Rights acquired through the investment of capital cannot be  reduced by law or any other legal act,' as well as the provision  of article 48, paragraph 1, which guarantees ownership rights.  By applying the disputed provision of the Law on Transformation,  the Croatian Privatization Fund is flagrantly violating the  shareholders' rights, since by converting the additional  capitalization proposed into additional shares, it is depriving  the other shareholders of the right to participate in additional  capitalization, and proportionately reducing the other  shareholders' already acquired rights and the amount of their  investments."    The consequences are also explained using the example of a  firm where small shareholders have acquired 50 percent of the  shares and management rights, but when the fund sells the rest  of the shares and the buyer accepts additional capitalization,  "not following the procedure in the Law on Commercial Companies  and the means of additional capitalization regulated by the  company's charter, he acquires majority rights, and what happens  in practice is that he replaces management bodies, decides on  dismissing workers, and so forth."  <H5>  Illusion of Fresh Money </H5>   The presidents of the commercial courts also took the  position that the claim that additional capitalization brings  "fresh blood," i.e., fresh money, into the economy is  unacceptable, and "an illusion for the uninformed," because in  the vast majority of cases the funds for additional  capitalization come from loans from domestic banks, and thus  that represents merely a transfer of existing capital, and not  an infusion of new capital. "For the above-mentioned reasons, we  are pointing out to the registry courts that any entry of  additional capitalization carried out in that manner is  unconstitutional and illegal, and we recommend delaying entries  in the manner described until these issues are discussed at the  proper level."    It was not necessary to wait long for the fund's reaction.  It  was sent in the form of an extensive letter signed by the fund's  president, Ivan Penic, as soon as 25 February, to the same  addressees as the positions of the commercial court presidents.  The fund, naturally, rejects all the judges' ideas, and there  are two key postulates in its arguments. The first is that the  purchase of preferred shares (up to DM 20,000), limited to 50  percent of the enterprise's value, is not a collective right of  the small shareholders, but rather the personal right of each of  them, which remains equally even after additional  capitalization. The second one is the postulate that the fund,  by accepting additional capitalization, is increasing the  enterprise's principal before the completion of the  transformation, "when a stock company has not been founded, and  thus one cannot consider the criticism about a flagrant  violation of the shareholders' rights, since while there is no  stock company, while it has not been entered in the court  register, there is also no shareholder status; instead, this is  a process of transition in accordance with the provisions of the  Law on Transformation."  <H5>  The Fund Strikes Back </H5>   In the conclusion of the letter, the fund also recommended  to  the commercial judges that before uttering bold assertions about  unconstitutionality and illegality, they could discuss disputed  issues at the level of the competent state authorities, and that  they were obligated to apply the law with which they disagreed  until the Constitutional Court, possibly, thought differently.    In the end, on 28 February the whole problem reached a  meeting of the government, after which the president of the High  Commercial Court instructed all the lower courts to resume the  blocked entries of enterprises with additional capitalization in  the registry, since "in the event of abuse there is the  possibility of intervening by deleting those entries."    Thus, this is how things currently stand (entangled and  confusing, to say the least) with the case of "additional  capitalization--entry in the registry" at the level of the state  authorities. And in real life? Even worse, because it has been  possible for months now to buy shares from the Privatization  Fund and obtain additional capitalization, spending around DM1  million, without any problem. Legally, however, sometimes it is  possible to regularize such a transaction by entering its  results in the court registry, and sometimes it is not. There  have also been situations in which it is possible in some  places, but not in others (at the time when the Split Commercial  Court was refusing to register the "additionally capitalized"  Dairy, the Zagreb courts consistently registered identical  cases). The worst thing of all, however, is that the buyer,  whether he has registered the additionally capitalized  enterprise or not, still has hanging over his head the sword of  Damocles of the possibility that his arrangement with the fund  (as we have said, so far about 120 of them have been concluded)  might be declared unconstitutional. Then, once again, even  though he claims complete innocence, he will suffer, because  overnight he will lose what he bought.  <H5>  Small Shareholders Keeping Quiet </H5>   It is not difficult to judge how much that kind of "legal  security" of privatization here is a "good advertisement" for  potential investors to loosen their purse-strings. The  Privatization Fund nevertheless seems to be sure of itself:  Without any doubt whatsoever in the outcome of constitutional  case U-171, it is continuing official announcements of the sale  of shares and additional capitalization under the terms in the  controversial articles of the Law on Transformation,  guaranteeing the buyers ownership rights and court registration.  The problem, however, is that the fund, no matter how  self-confident it is, cannot give anyone a guarantee of what the  Constitutional Court's decision will be, and so its guarantee  that the enterprises will be registered is shaky. And the small  shareholders? For the time being they are mostly keeping quiet,  awaiting the Constitutional Court's verdict. It does not matter  whether they are doing so because of a headache from  confrontation with the legal labyrinth in which nothing is clear  to them anymore, or because everything is clear to them, and so  their heads ache from helplessness.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Immediately after the signing of the agreement in  Cairo on Wednesday, the release of the first half of the 5,000  Palestinian prisoners slated to be released will commence. The  release process will continue until the beginning of the week  following the signing of the agreement. Twelve hours after the  agreement is signed, the Palestinian police force will start  moving from Egyptian Rafah into the Gaza Strip via the Rafah  border terminal. Palestinian sources told our correspondent  Moti Amir that the convoy will include jeeps, light armored  cars, and approximately 1,500 policemen under Raji Jabali,  commander of the Gaza Strip police. They will be accompanied by  Muhammad Dahlan, head of the Gaza Strip security services, who  is considered to be the strong man in the Gaza Strip.    Approximately 500 policemen will arrive in Jericho, but it  is  still unclear whether they will enter from Gaza, via the open  passage agreed upon by the two sides, or from Jordan, via the  Allenby Bridge. The policemen will be accompanied by  administrative workers from the PLO headquarters in Tunis, and  Jibril al-Rajub, head of the Palestinian security services in  the West Bank.    Yasir 'Arafat will apparently arrive in the territories on  15  June, after preparations in the field and the organization of  the Palestinian institutions in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He  will be received in a large ceremony attended by ambassadors and  possibly heads of state.</p>

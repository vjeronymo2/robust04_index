			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price falls for fifth day in succession Gold prices yesterday fell for the fifth successive day and analysts suggested they might have further to fall before staging a recovery in the final quarter of 1994. The precious metal tested a critical technical support level - Dollars 378 a troy ounce - but remained just above it at the close in London at Dollars 378.70, down Dollars 1.75 from Tuesday's close. Gold has slipped by Dollars 9.70 an ounce or 2.5 per cent in the past week. Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, suggested the usual northern hemisphere summer 'lull' was causing gold's downward drift. He said gold was likely to remain under pressure for the rest of August and might fall another Dollars 4 or Dollars 5 an ounce. Nevertheless, for the fourth quarter he forecast gold would trade between Dollars 370 and Dollars 405 an ounce, compared with an average price of Dollars 383 for the first nine months of this year. He said some pressure on gold was coming from disillusioned US hedge funds, which had expected the metal to go to Dollars 400 an ounce. Now they were selling and putting their money elsewhere. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that gold's Dollars 5 fall so far this week contrasted with the 'tramline trading' of recent weeks when the price was often seemed trapped in a Dollars 2 range. He said that there had been a good deal of selling by producers recently, which had been soaked up by some physical demand. And, while speculative funds had helped to drive down the gold price this week, there was another element at work in the market that was hard to identify. 'Something subtle is going on. It is hard to say what,' he added.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Go-ahead given for air ticket claims A US federal court in Atlanta has given final approval to the settlement of a class-action lawsuit against the main US airlines which centred on allegations of illegal ticket price-setting through use of a computerised reservation system. Most of the carriers settled the suit last summer, without admitting liability, and will pay out an aggregate Dollars 458m (Pounds 322m) - most of it through discount coupons for future air travel. Under the settlement, virtually anyone who took a domestic flight between January 1 1988, and June 30 1992 can apply to share in the settlement pool. The deadline for claims is June 1.</p>

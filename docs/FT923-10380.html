			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Armenians 'advance in Karabakh' ARMENIAN fighters in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh have recaptured several villages and killed about 100 Azerbaijani troops, Armenian reports said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow. The Armenian side suffered six dead and 16 wounded over the last two days while recapturing five villages in the Mardakert district of Nagorno-Karabakh, the reports said. In addition, three people were killed and two wounded in Azerbaijani shelling of two Armenian villages before dawn yesterday, the reports said. The Azerbaijani losses in the fighting are said to have consisted of no less than 100 troops. There was no comment from the Azerbaijani side. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan unilaterally freed 19 Armenian hostages who were flown yesterday from the capital of Baku to Tbilisi in Georgia. Russian television said Azerbaijan was hoping for a reciprocal Armenian gesture. Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been fighting for four years for control over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Christian Armenian region within the predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan. Reuter adds from Rome: A new round of peace talks to seek an end to fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh will start in Rome tomorrow, the Italian foreign ministry said. The statement by Italy, which is chairing the 11-nation talks, said the latest round would run from July 31 to August 4. A third round of Rome talks, which was meant to pave the way for a fully-fledged peace conference under the auspices of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Minsk, ended in stalemate early this month. 'The Italian presidency expects that the round. . . will lay the concrete bases for a real end to hostilities in the region and to remove the obstacles which have until now prevented the calling of the Minsk peace conference,' the statement said. Russian peace-keeping forces yesterday began deploying in Trans Dnestr. The secessionist region of eastern Moldova, with a Slavic majority, has been seeking independence from Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, AP reports. The peace-keepers flew in under an accord signed by presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Mircea Snegur of Moldova last week in an effort to end the fighting which has killed more than 600 people since March. Last week's peace accord grants Trans Dnestr a special status within Moldova.</p>

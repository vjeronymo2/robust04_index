			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 21 Jun (INA)--Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad  has returned to Baghdad after taking part in the OPEC  Ministerial Council's conference held recently in the Austrian  capital.    In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said  that participants in the conference have decided to retain until  the end of this year the OPEC's current output ceiling of 24.5  million barrels per day.    He added that Iraq's participation in the conference has  proved its positive role in serving the organization's goals of  protecting the interests of the OPEC member states.    The minister also said he had held meetings with oil  ministers on the sidelines of the conference to explain the  impact of the economic blockade imposed on Iraq--a blockade  which has prevented Iraq from investing its oil wealth. He  added that during these meetings, he asserted that Iraq would  return to the oil market as soon as the blockade is lifted,  would remain a positive factor, and would exert every effort to  maintain OPEC's interests.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Airbreak Leisure beats forecast The ending of the Gulf war and the demise of the International Leisure Group brought a surge of bookings to Airbreak Leisure Group, a tour operator. As a result pre-tax profit for 1991 came to Pounds 1.63m, compared with Pounds 1.5m forecast in the prospectus last August and with Pounds 711,000 achieved in 1990. Sales for the current year were holding up strongly, said Mr David Lewis, chairman. The acquisition of Sunsail International in February is expected to make a notable contribution, along with a full year's benefit from Goldcrest Aviation, the joint venture with Champion Holdings. Turnover expanded to Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 18.8m) and the operating profit increased to Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds 709,000 struck after Pounds 360,000 exceptional costs. Earnings per share came to 5.92p (1.74p) and the dividend is 1.3125p as forecast. Following introduction to the USM, a further Pounds 2m cash subscription was entered into by Champion, combined with the joint venture.</p>

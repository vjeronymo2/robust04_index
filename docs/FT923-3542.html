			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Milk shaken milk - is about to undergo a shake-up with proposals to reform the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales. But the milk industry is having difficulty agreeing a new structure to satisfy itself, let alone consumers. The MMB has its origins in the early 1930s, when it rescued dairy farmers from the depression by giving them monopoly power over milk supplies. Since then the board and the Dairy Trade Federation, representing the dairies and processors, have enjoyed a cartel, which has survived several shocks, including the UK's entry into the European Community. In 1984 the introduction of EC milk quotas halted the MMB's production expansion. In 1986 a government-commissioned report criticised aspects of Dairy Crest, the MMB's wholly owned subsidiary which has 25 per cent of the UK market for manufactured dairy products. The report was prompted by concern among other dairy companies that the MMB had become not only a monopoly supplier, but also the biggest processor of milk. It was clear that reform was needed. But when the MMB was invited by the government to come up with reform plans in 1990, its only proposal was for the MMB to transform itself into a voluntary co-operative. This was unacceptable both to the EC Commission and the DTF, which criticised it for replacing a statutory monopoly with a voluntary one. Some urgency was added by a challenge to the monopoly from the EC Commission over sales of low-fat milk, which now account for 40 per cent of liquid milk sales. The EC gave a 'reasoned opinion' that the MMB did not hold the statutory right to buy and sell low-fat milk. Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, rejected the opinion, but used his decision to put further pressure on the DTF and MMB to agree on reforms. Last month the MMB published another proposal to turn itself into a single voluntary co-operative, this time promising to hive off Dairy Crest. The DTF is still not happy with the plan. Last week it highlighted some of the more obvious concerns, not least that the co-operative would be incompatible with the free-market policies of the present government, since it expects to attract 80 per cent of the country's 30,000 dairy farmers. Aside from these worrisome aspects, the MMB has given no details of the type of contracts it expects the co-operative to have with dairy farmers. Its attempts to reform Britain's arcane milk pricing system also collapsed last month, leaving no obvious alternative. Behind these pricing problems is the fact that the milk market is not free because supplies are restricted by the EC's quota system. But this distorting system of production control also reduces the importance of eliminating the MMB monopoly, since greater competition in the market for milk cannot affect the quantities supplied. The only part of the MMB proposal welcomed by the DTF is the spinning off of Dairy Crest. But again, crucial details are lacking, such as the basis on which shares in the company will be allocated to farmers who supplied the MMB in the past. The agriculture ministry has said it will make no comment until after September 18, the deadline for responses to the MMB's proposals. At the moment a bill is supposed to come before Parliament this autumn. In theory it could be given the Royal Assent next June, leading to the end of the MMB monopoly in mid-1994. But with the present deadlock, this looks a wildly unrealistic timetable. It is time for the ministry to take a firmer lead. If it has insufficient ideas of its own, perhaps the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should be asked to lend a hand.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Concerns over US rates depress share prices - Market report The UK stock market staged a successful rally towards the close of a depressed session yesterday which was dominated by weakness in British government bonds and also in sterling as political tensions increased. Markets kept a close eye on the US dollar, worried that any renewed setback might prompt the US Federal Reserve to tighten credit policy more harshly than previously in the present cycle. Yesterday's money market action by the Federal Reserve came after the London close. The disclosure that domestic consumer credit had jumped by Pounds 516m in March, far above market expectations, gave a further blow to any lingering hopes for a cut in base rates but brought little relief to either bonds or sterling. The FT-SE 100 Index was 25.3 down at the day's low when Wall Street had opened sharply off and global bond markets were drifting easier. But London rallied as the loss on the Dow Average was cut to 9.5 in early trading. At its final reading, the FT-SE 100 showed a net decline of 8.2 at 3,097.8. The late recovery in the blue chip leaders was fuelled by the expiry of two over-the-counter option contracts believed to have been operated by leading houses. These houses were thought to have been operating heavily in the Footsie future towards the close of the trading session as the share option contracts expired. Trading volume in UK equities was not heavy yesterday but the concern over US interest rates overshadowed all other considerations. Markets across Europe were concerned that the Federal Reserve might take action ahead of this week's refunding of US government securities. UK equities crumbled in early trading behind a fall in stock index futures and also in gilt-edged securities. There were suggestions from political sources that Mr John Major's Conservative government, hard hit in the opinion polls following last week's UK local elections, was under pressure to hold a national referendum on policies towards the Economic Union. Unimpressive trading volume indicated that share losses reflected cautious marking down operations by marketmakers rather than any undue selling pressure. The loss of the Footsie 3,100 mark yet again was unhelpful and the consumer credit data underlined the market's resignation to the fading of base rate hopes - as well as raising fears that the next move in domestic interest rates might be upwards. However, the day's Seaq trading volume total of 480.6m shares was nearly 27 per cent down from Friday's figure, which was worth Pounds 1.24bn in retail worth, at the lower end of recent daily averages. The picture among the second-line stocks was much the same as in the Footsie-listed issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index failed to share in the late rally and closed with a fall of 28.9 points at 3,742.1. The setback in the UK equity market was less than those recorded by other leading European markets, although UK gilts were significantly weaker than other bond markets because of the political factors in London. Weakness in gilts has continued to undermine UK equities for the past two months, and there was little sign yesterday that share prices were yet ready to disengage from the gilts market and to respond more confidently to the growing indications of recovery in the UK economy.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce head quits on BMW link Mr Peter Ward is to quit as chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which has just signed a collaboration agreement with BMW of Germany. The move, at the end of next week, is believed to reflect a divergence of views with the parent Vickers board on how best to take the luxury cars business into the 21st century. Mr Ward, who is 48 and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, will also cease to be Vickers' managing director, operations. However, he will remain an executive director of Vickers and will stay on as Rolls-Royce chairman for at least six months. After that, 'Mr Ward has decided that his career objectives can best be satisfied outside Vickers', said Vickers. Mr Ward was said to be 'unavailable' last night. Yesterday's announcement came just 48 hours after a deal between Rolls-Royce and BMW, under which the German carmaker will supply engines and other technology to Rolls-Royce, based in the Crewe, Cheshire. BMW, which owns Rover Group - the supplier of Rolls-Royce car bodies - won the partnership deal after months of negotiations in which its German rival, Mercedes-Benz, began as the favourite to become the UK company's partner. Mr Ward is understood to have preferred the Mercedes option. His departure is likely to be greeted with concern by Rolls-Royce's 2,500 workforce, as he has been a popular figure despite driving through changes in working practices and other reforms. Mr Chris Woodwark, chief executive of Vickers' Cosworth Engineering subsidiary, is to succeed Mr Ward as Rolls-Royce chief executive.</p>

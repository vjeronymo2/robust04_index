			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Price war rages over soft commissions - A practice which is no longer restricted to a few specialist houses THE UK's large integra-ted securities houses last year received 13 per cent of their commission income through 'soft commission' arrangements, a rise from 8 per cent during 1990 and confirmation that this form of investment business is no longer largely restricted to a few specialist houses in London. The figures, revealed in a London Stock Exchange report on the soft commission business, show it is no longer an under-used area of the market. Research last year by Greenwich Associates, the US research company, revealed more than 80 per cent of investment and unit trusts had soft commission arrangements, while the proportion of investment advisers had risen to around two-thirds. Less than half of insurance companies have similar arrangements. Soft commission agreements involve a fund manager agreeing to give a fixed proportion of business to a broker in return for services, such as the provision of data base services or specialist research provided by an independent research house. The rapid growth of the practice in the UK in the past two years, since it was judged an acceptable practice by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief UK investment regulator, has prompted a price war, as well as fears that the arrangements work against the interests of fund managers' clients. In its latest quarterly review of the UK market, the London Stock Exchange reports the practice of 'softing' is likely to become more prevalent. Traditional brokers, which have not actively sought soft commission business before, have already seen their reliance on this type of income jump from 1 per cent to 4 per cent in the past year. The proportion is expected to rise further as a result of cost pressures and the desire of brokers to maintain their share of commission income. The exchange concludes regulatory concerns about soft commissions continue - the SIB recently started a consultation exercise to see if further changes were needed to the regulatory arrangements. Soft commission deals give rise to four concerns: They provide a way for brokers to pay fund managers inducements to place business with them. This concern has largely been resolved, the exchange says. Rules in force in the UK limit the services that can be provided to those which 'assist in the provision of investment services'. The services most commonly covered by such agreements include performance measurement, on-line stock quotation services and corporate databases, according to Greenwich. They could lead to excessive charging by fund managers. This is because fund managers charge a fee for their services and also pass on brokerage commission charges to their customers. If the commissions cover some of the managers' costs, which are normally reflected in the fee, then the customer could end up effectively paying twice for the same service. Fund managers could be tempted to 'churn' a portfolio. These two concerns could be resolved if trustees which employ fund managers are aware of the dangers, and information is provided about what is actually taking place. The exchange warns that even the well-informed trustee finds it difficult to tell the difference between 'good business practice and outright exploitation by the fund manager.' Fund managers may not always be achieving best execution for their clients. This is a concern particular to the UK, whose integrated houses are in theory able to subsidise low commission rates with the spread they make by acting as market-makers. Here, again, regulatory responses are difficult the exchange says. Moves suggested so far 'are incompatible with market practices and thus unenforceable,' it warns.

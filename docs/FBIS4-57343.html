			<p>BFN     [Text] Curitiba -- In the wake of his defeat at the PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] primaries, former Parana  Governor Roberto Requiao yesterday announced that he will  endorse Workers Party [PT] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.  Requiao said he is convinced Lula will win the elections in the  first round. Requiao conceded defeat to Quercia yesterday  morning in a speech he delivered before PMDB delegates at the  Legislative Assembly in Curitiba.    Requiao said: Lula will win because the other parties are  increasingly demoralized. At the PMDB convention, we run the  risk of internally promoting the rehabilitation of Deputies  Genabaldo Correa, Ibsen Pinheiro, and Manuel Moreira, who were  charged by the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating  Committee].    Without directly attacking Quercia, Requiao reaffirmed that  he will not participate in the PMDB campaign.    Requiao said: I said I would do without with Quercia's  support for my candidacy and I hope he will do the same. I  support Lula. No one can prevent me from seeking a Senate seat.    Requiao made it clear that he will not hold the PMDB rank  and  file responsible for the outcome of the elections.    Requiao said: PMDB members cannot be held responsible; that  lies with the slow, weak leaders who adopted an ostrich-like  policy in Congress by sticking their heads in the sand. He  stated that he will continue within the PMDB.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas After the raging storm that was Sir James McKinnon, Ms Clare Spottiswoode's still, small voice of calm comes as quite a shock. The new gas watchdog has agreed with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas's price cap should be loosened a notch. Given that Ms Spottiswoode would have been exposed to judicial review had she overturned a conclusion which the MMC took a year to reach, it should be no surprise. Still, such sweet reason must come as a relief to British Gas. Equally, the abolition of the price cap in the newly-competitive market will help the company fight cherry picking. Yet while the fillip is useful, it hardly transforms Gas's prospects. Pressure will remain on the domestic gas business. And the shares' 5.2 per cent yield reflects the risk that the company may struggle to sustain dividend increases above the rate of inflation.</p>

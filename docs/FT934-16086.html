			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Portillo attacks rightwing tax stance MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night identified the restoration of 'sound finance' as the prerequisite for a revival in the government's fortunes, Philip Stephens writes. Taking a further step towards establishing his credentials as the true inheritor of Lady Thatcher's mantle, he launched a thinly veiled attack on the Tory right campaigning against tax increases. He told a fringe meeting hosted by the Conservative Political Centre that Lady Thatcher had made lower public borrowing the first priority of her governments: 'The restoration of sound public finance overrode all other ambitions even when in 1981 we were forced to raise taxes against our deeper instincts.' He added: 'If a government believe that a policy is right for the country, then it must pursue it, even if it leads to unpopularity.' Mr Portillo combined his call for fiscal responsibility with an equally strong call for the government to stick with policies designed to squeeze public spending and to give individuals more control over their own lives.</p>

His negative answer came in response to a  question from an Interfax correspondent asking whether or not he  promised Guliyev to withdraw Armenian forces within 20 days as  Baku was alleging.    At the same time, Ararktsyan said the withdrawal of troops  was envisaged by the CSCE-proposed peace plan of last November  which both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh had approved.    He called for the Lachin corridor linking Armenia with the  disputed territory to remain intact.    Ararktsyan spoke of the two sides' renewed commitment to a  regional peace settlement. But for this to happen, he said, any  talks on Nagorno-Karabakh must follow a durable regional  cease-fire.    He stressed the need for the enclave to be made party to  regional peace talks.    Ararktsyan spoke of offering his Azeri counterpart to reopen  Armenian roads for Azeri shipments of cargoes and fuel to  Nakhichevan as a way of "restoring mutual trust and ending  charges about Armenia blocking" that Azeri enclave.    State Secretary of Azerbaijan Gabil Huseinli [name as  received] maintains that the Armenian side had offered promises  of withdrawing its troops from occupied Azeri territories within  the next 20 days, at Saturday's meeting between parliamentary  leaders of the two countries.    In an interview with Interfax, he said the Armenian pullout  would be done in two stages. Initially, the warring sides are  to withdraw troops at a distance of 10 km to 15 km away from the  engagement line, observers are to be moved into the buffer zone  and refugees are to be returned to their homes simultaneously.    Huseinli said that if Armenia kept up its promise by  relinquishing at least part of the annexed territory as a  goodwill gesture, the prospect of an Azeri-Armenian summit would  become ever more real. He said the territory to be relinquished  was outside Nagorno-Karabakh while the Lachin corridor linking  the enclave and mainland Armenia would remain under Armenian  control. In the meantime, Lachin and the Karabakh city of  Shusha, whose population was mainly Azeri before the conflict  broke out, are to be discussed during talks on the future of the  disputed territory, he said.    Huseinli said Baku preferred CSCE-brokered talks on regional  peace though praising Moscow's mediation in the peace process  despite its traditional support for Armenia.</p>

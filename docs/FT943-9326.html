			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / India's Schweik fights the rich and strong Govind Rago Khairnar, 52, son of a poor peasant, who rose to become deputy municipal commissioner in the Bombay Municipal Corporation which administers India's richest city, is a national hero. In a country where corruption is rampant, almost accepted as part of the political system, this gaunt bureaucrat has started a crusade against one of India's most powerful politicians, Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra, where Bombay is located. While he has produced no evidence, Mr Khairnar accuses Mr Pawar of corruption and of having links with underworld dons. Mr Pawar has big business interests in Maharashtra, and is one of the country's richest sugar farmers. He is also one of the country's strongest contenders for prime minister. Mr Khairnar, who belongs to one of India's lowest castes, has become a veritable Good Soldier Schweik, a little man fighting officialdom and power, with all the odds against him. As the chief officer of the Bombay Municipal Corporation squad charged with demolishing illegal buildings in the city, Mr Khairnar's course inevitably collided with the underworld dons, film stars, and powerful businessmen-politicians who all contribute to make Bombay the rich, ruthless and powerful commercial capital that it is. It is not the first time someone has sought to establish a nexus between the underworld, Bombay's tinsel world and politicians. But no bureaucrat has gone as far as Mr Khairnar, openly attacking someone as powerful as the chief minister. The common man identifies completely with him. Mr Khairnar is not everybody's saint. Many powerful bureaucrats have felt that he has gone too far, especially when he has no proof to back his allegations. 'My only job is to shout at the top of my voice, whatever I have experienced,' he says, adding that it was 'not his intention to collect proof against any individual'. Mr Khairnar may not have been able to substantiate his charges against Mr Pawar, but whether they are true or not, they have stuck. The chief minister was exercised enough to meet the prime minister to discuss the matter with him. Opposition parties and the anti-Pawar lobby in the Congress(I) party that have tried to use Mr Khairnar to fling dirt at their opponents have not succeeded. He has no political links, hardly any money, and is not afraid if his life is in danger. After his suspension from service in July, Mr Khairnar spends much of his time addressing public gatherings, responding to invitations to travel to cities towns and villages all over India, addressing frenzied crowds of supporters . At his meetings, men break the security cordon (the government has given him an armed escort and top-level security) just to be able to touch him. Women want him to bless their babies. India's most prominent social reformers have joined him in his crusade. His snowballing anti-corruption campaign is developing into a national phenomenon, even if nothing tangible has come of it yet.</p>

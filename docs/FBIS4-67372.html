			<p>BFN     [Text] Announcer: The Chelyabinsk Oblast  Administration has agreed to store radioactive waste from  Hungarian atomic power stations. As our correspondent reports,  the population has not been informed of this. It should be  added that the relevant protocol on waste storage was signed  last Saturday in Budapest by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.  Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov laid out the  position of the president at a briefing today. [begin recording]    Kostikov: We are talking about the processing and  utilization of waste from those atomic stations that were built  according to Russian or Soviet, as they were then, designs with  participation of Russian technology. The agreements signed back  then obliged Russia to process, export to its territory, and  store waste products. [end recording]    Announcer: In the meantime, Aleksandr Shuvalov,  the head of the press service of Russia's Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, has the  following to say: [Begin recording]    Shuvalov: References to the existing practice of  accepting and storing exhausted nuclear fuel from the Czech  Republic, Bulgaria, and Finland will not work in the given case.  The agreement between the governments of the USSR and the  People's Republic of Hungary of 22 December 1966 did not provide  for importing nuclear fuel. The agreement left out this point  and now attempts are being made to repair the omission.  Decisions of this sort are making the already serious  radio-ecological [radioekologicheskaya] situation in our country  even worse and opens the door to a flow of other waste materials  that are no less harmful for the environment.

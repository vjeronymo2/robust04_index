			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Five go to the Olympics - Radio RADIO 5 has the answer to those of us who have been wondering what exactly it was for: Five at the Olympics, every day of the week from 6.30 am to 10 pm, not only covers the Barcelona activities, it helps keep them off the other networks. The five are Danny Baker, Ross King, Caron Keating, Terry Wogan and John Inverdale, each, no doubt, with athletic inside knowledge; but I shall follow the great displays by the professional amateurs and amateur professionals only through the news bulletins. The Message and the Media is a promising four-part series that began on Radio 4 on Wednesday, presented by Sheena McDonald. The first programme, Received Wisdom, dealt with the basic problem: whether the news provided by the media was the news wanted by readers and viewers. Sir David English of the Daily Mail allowed frankly that his choice of news depended on the extent it might influence sales. Max Hastings, editor of the Telegraph, is for stories to interest readers content with the world as it is. Simon Jenkins, retiring editor of The Times, is for the provocation of discussion. The electronic media take a more universal attitude. The BBC's Kate Adie wants every viewer to have the best chance of appreciating her reports; Nick Pollard of News at Ten presents one view to all groups from ABs to hypothetical EFs, which is much the same. John Birt, the BBC's Crown Prince, reckons that in a half-hour bulletin you do your best, and rely on supporting programmes for those who need more. The previous evening, Radio 4 gave us Inside Kosovo. Kosovo is an Albanian enclave in Serbia, and Melanie Friend's report from Pristina, the capital, was full of familiar reports - professors sacked at the university, doctors at the hospitals, young men recruited for the Serbian army, 60 days' detention for hearing Albanian music on tapes. A refugee in London complained that she lived worse here than in Kosovo, for all her money went to family in Albania. At which target is this kind of news directed? Radio 4 believes as strongly as Radio 1 in the magic of familiar voices. Over the last three weeks, Stephen Pile Investigates has queried the social value of sermons, the chance of predicting the future, the life of journalists, though Pile himself is not a padre, a prophet or a reporter, just a voice. What he investigates is how much other people know, and this week he asked about learning foreign languages. This is specially interesting, for nowadays foreign diplomats, politicians, casuals in crowds, often speak English on television that is fluent, even idiomatic. Do our own representatives do as well on the foreign screens? Stephen Pile is no help to monoglots. After some small talk, he was introduced to the Vector method, involving inter-active laser-vision, and made a deliberate ass of himself. No problem, anyway; Sir Alfred Sherman told him that since English was virtually universal, we had no need to learn anything else. The very ambitious might try Japanese or Arabic for commercial purposes. The BBC used to give language lessons. With respect to Sir Alfred, I wish it still did. Languages are used for other things beside commerce. I warned that Radio 3 would offer another 'Unmade Movie', and we got A Night at the Wasteland, by David Stafford. It told of TS Eliot's script for the Marx Brothers, and if I tell you that Chico addressed Eliot as Mr Elephant you may assess the standard of fun. The director was Jeremy Howe, in charge of Radio 3 drama.</p>

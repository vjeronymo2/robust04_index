			<p>BFN     [Text] The North Korean mission to the United Nations said  today that North Korea has already started the work of replacing  fuel rods at a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor without the presence  of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. We have news  by reporter Nam Son-hyon from New York.    [Begin Nam recording] The North Korean mission to the United  Nations said that it sent a telex to IAEA Director General Hans  Blix on 13 May in the name of Pak Yong-man, director of North  Korean Atomic Energy General Department, officially notifying  him that North Korea had started to replace fuel rods at the  nuclear power plant [wonjaryok palchonsoe yonryobong  kyochechakopi sichaktoeumul].    According to the telex message sent by Pak Yong-nam,  specially obtained by KBS, North Korea noted that from late  April to early this month, it had notified the IAEA on four  occasions that it could no longer delay the replacement of fuel  rods. North Korea said that it regrets that it could no longer  delay the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear reactor  because of technical and safety problems [kisuljogurona  anjonsangmunjerona to isang kyochechakopul mirulsuopssu].    Director Pak Yong-nam said in the telex message: In spite of  the special status [tuksuhan chiwiaraesodo] with the IAEA, North  Korea has provided sufficient conditions to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards regarding the replacement of fuel rods,  but the IAEA Secretariat did not respond to North Korea's good  will [sonuijogin yogu], and instead put forward unreasonable  conditions [pudanghan chogonul].    North Korea said, however, that there are many opportunities  for future negotiations regarding the issue because it just  began the work, and stressed that if the IAEA shows its fair  position, North Korea could allow the IAEA to choose and keep  [sontaekkwa pogwan] fuel rods while they are being replaced. It  also said that the future negotiations would be more productive  when they are held at the place near the area where the work of  replacing fuel rods is being started.    North Korea added in the telex message that it believes that  it is fortunate that the IAEA has decided, though belatedly, to  send the inspection team to Pyongyang and that it is ready to  accept the inspection activities of an experimental nuclear  power plant and a radiochemical laboratory, as mentioned  earlier.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, May 3 (AFP) -- Vietnam described Tuesday as  "lies" allegations by the Khmer Rouge [KR] that the Cambodian  government was attempting to recruit Vietnamese mercenaries to  fight the guerrillas.    "This information is a complete lie," a Vietnamese Foreign  Ministry spokesman told AFP of a Khmer Rouge radio report on  Sunday which said government officials had travelled to Vietnam  "to beg for 20 truckloads of mercenaries to come to the aid of  defeated government troops in Battambang."    Khmer Rouge radio had said government defeats at Anlong Veng  and Pailin -- guerrilla bases in Cambodia's north and northwest  taken by government troops but lost again to the Khmer Rouge --  had made the recruitment of new soldiers impossible.    The guerrilla faction often blames Hanoi for interfering in  Cambodia, where dozens of ethnic Vietnamese, including women and  children, have been victims in bloody attacks blamed on the  Khmer Rouge.</p>

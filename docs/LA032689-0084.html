			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: DOWN ZONING STUDIED  </P> <P> The possible scaling down of existing zoning is being studied for more than 400  acres scattered across Monterey Park's most congested areas.  </P> <P> A temporary ban on construction of apartments and condominiums was unanimously  enacted last May by the City Council.  </P> <P> The building moratorium was imposed while city planners and officials study  whether it would help correct problems with sewers, schools and streets  overburdened by rapid growth during the last decade if the zoning on  residential properties in the northeast neighborhoods were reduced.Sixty  percent of the city is now zoned for single-family housing and another 19% for  apartments and condominiums.  </P> <P> Eventually, residents will be able to vote on any zoning changes the council  may decide to enact. A referendum approved in 1987 required that changing the  zoning on more than one acre requires a vote by the community.  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Insurers join outcry against large pay-offs The Association of British Insurers, whose members manage about Pounds 600bn worth of investment funds, has written to several of the UK's largest companies expressing concern over large payments to former directors. Mr Richard Regan, head of investment affairs at the association, said yesterday it had written to the non-executive chairmen of 'four or five' companies where controversial pay-offs had been made. The letters state that non-executive directors should check the service contracts of executive directors annually to ensure that 'they still want them'. Mr Regan added: 'We are writing to companies where these payments have occured saying major institutions are concerned and this is the way we would like to see it addressed.' He added: 'We are not necessarily against three-year rolling contracts, but we want companies to apply the practical principle of review.' Two months ago PosTel, an institution with Pounds 25bn under management, said it would vote against the re-election of directors who have rolling-service contracts longer than two years. It believed that shorter contracts would curb directors' entitlement to pay-offs. The move follows a number of controversial payments, including Pounds 2.02m to Mr Peter Davis, former co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group. The payment, announced last Tuesday, took the total size of pay-offs disclosed in the last year by the largest 250 quoted companies to more than Pounds 20m. The letters will put further pressure on companies to limit pay-offs to directors who resign or are forced out. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, recently stated that institutional shareholders should be doing more to limit payments to directors. The association stressed that it saw pay-offs as the real issue and not the length of directors' contracts. Consequently it wants companies to be tougher in negotiations over pay-offs with former directors. The association refused to confirm which companies it had written to. Some recent payments include Pounds 3.13m to Mr John Cahill, former chairman of British Aerospace; Pounds 2.2m to Mr Chris Greentree, former chief executive of oil company Lasmo; and the Pounds 2.7m to be paid to Dr Ernest Mario, a former director of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group.</p>

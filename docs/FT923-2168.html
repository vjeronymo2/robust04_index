			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (8): 'Bristol trapped by catch 22' - How two of the losers have reacted to their disappointment IT WAS July 16: the day that Hartcliffe, the run-down, largely council, estate on the southern edge of Bristol heard that for the second year running it had lost its bid for City Challenge funding. That evening the riots erupted, a large part of the Symes Avenue shopping mall was vandalised or set on fire, and serious disturbances across the estate lasted three nights. The riots were not, emphatically not, caused by the government's refusal to give Bristol Pounds 37.5m for urban regeneration. A tragic incident - two youths joy-riding a stolen police bike which careered head-on into an unmarked police car - sparked off the troubles, and the loitering youths who joined in had been congregating at the same spots for months. By day three their numbers were swollen by outsiders wanting to get in on the action. But the fact that most evenings dozens of youths, mainly unemployed with few qualifications or interests, have nothing better to do than to hang around Symes Avenue drinking cheap cider and waiting for something to turn up, is a grim reminder of life in Britain's urban blackspots. More depressing still is the thought that the likes of Hartcliffe could lose in a competition for regeneration funding. Hartcliffe highlights the 'downside' of City Challenge in graphic form. The very community involvement which, with 'winning' bids, has given a local dynamism to regeneration, in the case of failure produces real gloom and depression. It is not just the prospective beneficiaries with hopes dashed: it is the teachers, community and voluntary workers, striving to increase opportunities and often feeling isolated and embattled at the best of times, who feel deserted. In Hartcliffe's case the impact of losing was worsened, because failure came not once but twice, because Hartcliffe was also Bristol's bid for the first, pacemaker round of City Challenge. For Bristol council it was a heavy blow: the city gets Pounds 1.6m a year in urban programme funding, and even that could be reduced sharply next year if public spending reductions cut into a budget already top-sliced by two rounds of City Challenge. 'You cannot keep blowing up then bursting a community's hopes like this  - it just breeds desperate cynicism and despair,' says Ms Pat Mundy, manager of Hartcliffe Wythywood Ventures (HWV), a local enterprise and training agency. Ms Mundy is also secretary of the local neighbourhood council which, she recalls, was 'deeply shocked' that they had been turned down again. 'The main casualties are the young people: only two of the 100 leaving the local secondary school this year have jobs to go to: and we don't have any spare training places this year,' she says. Even existing facilities have had to be cut back: HWV had a construction workshop for its British Technology Education Council engineering course, but closed it earlier in the year because of cutbacks in funding from the local training and enterprise council. Why did Bristol lose? Bristol city council is nonplussed. The only explanation it can offer is a seven-paragraph letter from Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, saying that the Environment department had 'very difficult choices' to make but had 'concerns about the development of the Wills site, given its strategic role in providing jobs locally.' The Wills site is a cigarette factory on the edge of Hartcliffe/Wythywood which employed 4,000 until its closure two years ago. It is owned by the Hanson conglomerate, which has no immediate development plans for the factory, but nor as yet is it prepared to sell the site - thought to have a book value about twice its current market value - for a price attractive to would-be developers. Mr Michael Robinson, Bristol city council's chief executive, believes the council was in a 'classic catch 22'. 'The plight of Hartcliffe/Wythywood is largely caused by the closure of the Wills factory and our inability to persuade Hanson to do anything productive with it; yet that is given as the reason for not helping us deal with the effects of the closure.' Worse still, according to Mr Robinson, Bristol was encouraged by ministers to put Hartcliffe forward a second time, even though the Wills factory problems had been cited as a reason for rejection in the first round. To sweeten the pill, Mr Redwood told Bristol that 'the process of preparing the bids has in itself established a range of partnerships that can be built on.' Few of them, alas, will lead to concrete opportunities for the locals. The City Challenge steering group has been kept in operation and is currently producing an 'action plan' to try and bring some of the projects - notably a new leisure centre - to fruition. Surprisingly, Ms Mundy does not see the City Challenge failure as the worst of Hartcliffe's recent 'external' shocks. She awards that prize to Barclays Bank, whose decision to close its Symes Avenue branch, in the teeth of vociferous local opposition, dealt the local trading community a blow from which it may not recover. 'Barclays said they weren't making enough - enough - profit', she says scornfully. Ironically, the City Challenge project office is based in the empty bank. 'People kept coming in wanting to cash cheques,' she adds, with a smile.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] Unable to check the autonomy in southern China,  Beijing is using its clout to ensure Shanghai is controlled,  prosperous and an economic counterbalance to Hong  Kong-Guangdong, says the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). "As  the bonding between Guangzhou and Hong Kong intensifies,  Shanghai is becoming increasingly vital to Beijing," the EIU  says in its report "Shaping a business in Shanghai".    As Beijing's latest darling, Shanghai has the leverage to  set  a 10 to 12 per cent growth target, significantly higher than the  nine per cent national ceiling. Also, it has the autonomy to  approve foreign investment of up to US$30 million, whereas other  cities are limited to US$10 million. Bigger projects need  Beijing's green light.    In return for these privileges, Beijing keeps a firm grip on  Shanghai, more unbending on rules than in Guangzhou, but because  of its trading heritage, it is less officious than the capital.  Although Shanghai's bureaucracy can be tedious, it is more  consistent and less corrupt than that of southern China.    Still, the report notes that "bribery has now begun to  invade  the traditional guanxi (personal connections) domain, and  corruption is definitely on the increase ... most Shanghai  corruption is masked as fees or taxes". Foreign companies  should be aware of these practices and adopt a clear  anti-corruption policy before putting money in the city, the  report says.    Support from Beijing notwithstanding, Shanghai, like most  Chinese cities, is plagued by infrastructure bottlenecks, which  are aggravated by the rising inflow of foreign funds. Unlike  Western cities, which set aside about 20 per cent of urban land  for road systems, Shanghai allocates only five per cent, and its  road system caters to only half of the city's needs.    Despite official statements to the contrary, Shanghai is  also  desperately short of power, although it is making great efforts  to prevent severe shortages. Sources in the business community  estimate supply meets only 85 per cent of demand, although it is  managed astutely to accommodate economic zones, priority foreign  enterprises, and foreign residential and office complexes. "The  prognosis for the future is not bright," the report says.  Demand for power in Shanghai-Pudong is estimated to be rising  by about 15 per cent a year, and the figure could well apply to  the Yangtze Delta.    The shortage of land and labour is another concern. Wage  inflation, staff turnover, and dearth of office space are  particularly worrying. Availability of top-notch office space  declined from 15.2 per cent in December 1992 to 1.1 per cent of  total stock by March this year.    Despite the bottlenecks foreign investors are flocking to  the  city because of its vast potential consumer market, where  discretionary income among urban workers is estimated to be 43  per cent, among the highest in the world. Foreign ventures in  Shanghai producing goods for the domestic market have a range of  distribution options, including the state distribution system  and government wholesalers. "All promise unbeatable  distribution networks. All require careful inspection," says  the report.</p>

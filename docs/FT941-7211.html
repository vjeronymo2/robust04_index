			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (5): Be patient, westerners urged - China Western telecommunication giants eyeing the vast Chinese market will need to be patient since it seems that in spite of domestic pressures the authorities are in no hurry to open this lucrative sector to foreign involvement. Professor Li Yining, an influential economist and member of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, wrote in a commentary last month that the country was 'not ready for a change of policy'. But Prof Li went on to say that when market conditions 'matured' there was 'no reason why foreign businesses cannot take part in the operations of telecommunications networks in China'. He listed three necessary developments: a strengthening of the local telecommunications industry so that it was no longer dependent on preferential government treatment and subsidies; technical improvements that would allow it to compete internationally; and due consideration of charges for services and the sharing of revenues. 'These issues need to be studied carefully,' he wrote. 'And as these problems are essentially technical in nature, it seems highly likely that they can be resolved in the future.'' Prof Li's remarks reflect what is proving to be a hot debate in China between advocates of liberalisation and a state telecommunications sector fearful of losing its monopoly. These issues came to the surface late last year when the Mr Huang Ju, Shanghai's reformist mayor, told leading western telecoms operators that he favoured a 'pilot' project in his city under which foreign operators would invest in building and operating a new network. Mr Huang's remarks were quickly denied by officials of the ministry of posts and telecommunications (MPT) which periodically seeks to dampen expectations of an early lifting of the ban on foreigners becoming involved in the telecommunications business - either as equity partners or in a management role. The MPT's monopoly is, in any case, being eroded in various ways, especially in the area of cordless telephones and pagers. The continuing proliferation of satellite dishes, in spite of a recent government edict banning the unauthorised sale of such dishes, is another affront to MPT control. In Beijing alone, some 70 private paging firms are operating, and there are at least 300,000 pager users in the capital. In a country where there are an average of 1.6 telephones per head of population, the pager market is virtually unlimited. Investment by Champion Technology, a Hong Kong telecommunications firm, in a cellular phone network in Sichuan province, China's most populous province, may well come to be regarded as the thin edge of the wedge as far as foreign penetration is concerned. Champion representatives say that while the company has a 40 per cent stake in the Sichuan network, it will have no direct management involvement in its joint venture with the local Sichuan branch of the MPT and the People's Liberation Army. This 'arm's-length' arrangement could become a model for other such ventures, although it is hard to believe Champion, with its 40 per cent stake and USDollars 30m investment, will either wish to, or be able to, stay out of management decisions. MPT also has a battle on its hands with powerful domestic foes agitating for the right to establish a second national telecommunications network. Three ministries (electronics, railways and electric power), together with the People's Bank of China and the People's Liberation Army, among other enterprises are working behind the scenes to break MPT's monopoly. MPT officials say they are doing their best to meet huge demand for new services, and have outlined ambitious plans to improve the network. China, which has one of the world's lowest per capita ratios of telephone lines - at the end of 1993 the number had reached about 18m for a population of 1.17bn - plans to increase the number of lines fivefold to 100m lines by 2,000. Wu Jichuan, China's minister of post and telecommunications, said recently that by the end of the decade China planned to achieve 'telephone penetration' of 35 to 45 per cent (of families) in the larger cities. At present fewer than one in 10 urban families on average has a telephone. MPT has budgeted about Yn53.6bn (USDollars 6.1bn) in expenditures this year, an increase of 34 per cent over 1993, but given the ministry's vast responsibilities investment available for telecommunications is clearly inadequate. Among MPT's priorities is to extend its network of large and medium-sized satellite earth stations to all provincial capitals by early next century. Some 16 such facilities are either operational or are under construction. China also plans to increase the number of communications satellites in orbit, and to make greater use of other international vehicles. According to a China Daily article, by the year 1995 China will be using seven communications satellites, including two Chinese-made Dongfanghong-111's, each equipped with 24 transponders.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Atlas advances 44% in term Atlas Copco, the Swedish engineering group, yesterday announced nine-month profits of SKr1.31bn (Dollars 176m), up 44 per cent from SKr910m in the same 1993 period. It reiterated its forecast that full-year earnings would be 'considerably higher' than last year's SKr1.32bn profit. Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr15.2bn, due mainly to increased volumes. The group said it had achieved significantly higher sales in France, Germany and the UK during the third quarter. However, it said the trend in Japan, the Middle East and North Africa remained weak. Orders were 13 per cent higher at SKr16.0bn. Mr Michael Treschow, president, said: 'The level of orders received from the manufacturing industry and the mining sector is expected to continue to improve in Atlas Copco's main markets.' Compressor technique and industrial technique were the strongest divisions, both in terms of results and orders. The compressor technique division saw earnings rise 45 per cent to SKr1.03bn, mainly because of increased volumes which lifted sales by 16 per cent to SKr7.22bn. Orders were 14 per cent higher at SKr7.50bn. Profits in the industrial technique division also benefited from higher volumes, rising 105 per cent to SKr308m. A weaker trend was seen in the construction and mining division, where profits fell to SKr32m from SKr97m because of restructuring costs. The company said it planned to close its Bremen drilling equipment plant in Germany, switching production to Orebro in Sweden to achieve synergies.</p>

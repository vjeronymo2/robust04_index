			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (7): No problem with shift around globe - What can be done to assist individuals on the move FOR Gary Montesano and his wife Eileen, moving with International Business Machines from a New York suburb to the south coast of England for a three-year assignment has been made easier by the IBM corporate machine. Mr Montesano is working on the development of the Merlin helicopter for the Ministry of Defence. The Montesanos belong to the Merlin family group, which has its own newsletter, and Mrs Montesano takes their children along to the Merlin mother and toddler group. The Montesanos, like other IBM employees and their families, are unlikely ever to find themselves abandoned in a strange country with no social contacts, no prospect of work for a spouse and an absence of advice on schooling. IBM is practised in shifting its employees around the globe, although the moves have slowed down as a result of restructuring and cost-cutting. Indeed, the company was so practised, the joke used to be that IBM stood for I've Been Moved - or even I've Been Married. Other companies with one-off or infrequent relocation requirements, within the UK or overseas, may decide they do not have enough specialist knowledge to deal themselves with the needs of employees' families. Alternatively, they may decide that if the financial relocation package is generous enough, it is up to employees to get on with sorting out their own problems. Yet organisations may find themselves forced to face issues affecting the relocating employee's family - in particular, spouses' jobs and children's education - for they are increasingly the factors which deter employees from relocating. A survey by the Confederation of British Industry found that nearly three-quarters of companies were meeting resistance from employees more frequently than used to be the case because of worries about the loss of partners' jobs. The cheerful, camp-following 'trailing spouse' is becoming an endangered species. As the CBI points out: 'The phenomenon of the dual earning couple is an established feature of our current society. Not all women have career aspirations but many women, nonetheless, are used to their own earnings and financial independence. Consequently, many women may be reluctant to interrupt their careers or give up lucrative jobs to accompany their partners on international assignments.' The same resistance, for the same reasons, is being shown by employees to moves within the UK. One option open to companies without their own resources to provide advice and support for families, is to use consultants - either approached directly or as part of a package offered by the relocation companies such as Black Horse, and Nationwide Relocation. Andrea Eccles, partner of the City-based consultancy Quantum, specialises in providing career counselling for spouses of employees who need to move because of their jobs. For Pounds 160 a person, for example, Ms Eccles will run a one-day seminar for 10 people, covering the preparation of CVs, assessment of skills, tracking down leads for jobs and how to go about finding childcare. The last may be particularly important, she says, if a family is moving away from grandparents or other relations who may have provided much of the childcare in the past. For those who are not intending to take up paid work in the new location but are concerned about making friends and having a role in their new community, Ms Eccles also provides advice on opportunities for voluntary work or, for example, becoming a Justice of the Peace. For about Pounds 200, a half-day session of individual counselling is added to the day seminar, and for Pounds 425 the person being counselled will finish their session with 50-60 job leads and ready-typed applications. Some companies may wonder why they should bother to spend such sums on individuals who are not even their own employees. First, Ms Eccles argues, it may make all the difference between retaining and losing a skilled worker over a move; second, the employee is likely to be happier and more productive at work if they are happy and settled at home. The same principles apply to help with finding new schools for the children of relocating employees, according to Margret Price, who is retained as a consultant by Nationwide Relocation. She is a partner with Dean Associates, a consultancy based in Emsworth, near Portsmouth, which specialises in giving advice on education. Her charge is Pounds 445 a family, irrespective of how many children she is asked to advise on - Pounds 540 if the family is moving to the UK from abroad. After talking to the family on the telephone about their requirements, she will produce a report on suitable schools in the area and send on school brochures and any other documents. Approaches to the schools contained in the report will already have been made to check places are available. The differences between education systems in different countries may cause relocating families problems, says Ms Price. For example, those coming from the US may expect to see their children graded every couple of weeks and they may be alarmed by a greater emphasis in UK schools on individual research and less on working to textbooks. School starting ages vary from country to country - a six-year-old coming to the UK may be a year behind classmates. Even a move from England to Scotland can present difficulties: in England the academic year runs from the beginning of September, in Scotland it is the beginning of March. All these issues need considering before a move is made. Relocating is a very stressful time for families as well as the employee who is being moved, says Ms Price. 'There's a lot of focus on the property side, but little on education or partners' employment,' she says. By paying for expert advice, 'firms are buying an element of comfort for the family. It shows a caring attitude to the family, as well as providing information which will make it much more likely the family will settle,' she says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EXAMPLE OF RELOCATION COST (EMPLOYEE HOME POUNDS 85,000)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Pounds        VAT       Total     Sub-                                                                  total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Disposal of old home  ------------------- Estate agent fees                1,700     297.50    1,997.50 Legal fees                         425      74.37      499.37 Valuation fees                     300      52.50       52.50 Council tax                        300          -      300.00 Insurance                          150          -      150.00 Maintenance                        300          -      352.50 Bridging finance                 4,250          -    4,250.00 Relocation conveyancing            500      87.50      587.50 Relocation management fee        1,500     262.50    1,762.50 Loss on resale of vacant   house                          4,000          -    4,000.50                                 ----------------------------------------                                 13,425     826.87   14,251.87   14,252 Purchase of new home  ------------------- Legal fees                         425      74.37       499.37 Stamp duty                         850          -       850.00 Land registry fees                 170          -       170.00 Valuation &amp; survey fees            500      87.50       587.50                                 ----------------------------------------                                  1,945     161.87     2,106.87  16,359 Miscellaneous costs  ------------------ Removal                            700     122.50       822.50 Travel                             700     122.50       822.50 Disturbance allowance            4,000     700.00     4,700.00 Temporary accommodation          1,500     262.50     1,762.50 Househunting trips               1,000     175.00     1,175.00                                 ----------------------------------------                                  7,900   1,382.50     9,282.50  25,642 Additional housing cost  ----------------------   allowance                     13,440          -    13,440.00                                 ----------------------------------------                                 13,440          -    13,440.50  39,082  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Source: Black Horse Relocation Services Limited  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

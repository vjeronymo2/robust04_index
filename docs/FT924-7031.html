			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exports add savour to Chile's fruit cocktail - The country leading the southern invasion of northern markets SOUTHERN hemisphere fruit exporters have doubled their sales to the northern hemisphere in the past decade - but Chile's 'exceptional dynamism' has enabled it to grab almost three- quarters of total gains. According to a new study by Mr Jean-Marie Codron in the latest edition of Agribusiness, significant further headway can be expected during the coming decade, though it may be accompanied by rising protectionism, and intensified trade conflict in certain fruits - particularly apples and kiwi fruit in Europe and table grapes in the US. Protection may be best organised in the unified market of the US. But this may be disguised by the use of health and food safety laws, he warns. Best growth will come in currently-closed markets like Japan and South Korea. The gains made by the southern hemisphere exporters - which include Chile, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa and Australia - have been made possible by new technologies and faster transport as well as substantial investment by multinationals, which have been particularly active in Chile. Mr Codron's study charts the startling emergence of Chile to become the southern hemisphere's dominant fruit exporter. Between 1974 and 1990, its exports of temperate fruit soared from 74,000 tonnes a year to 888,000 tonnes. At the same time, all southern hemisphere exporters together raised exports from 824,000 tonnes to just over 2m tonnes. While New Zealand exporters also boosted sales - from 74,000 tonnes in 1974 to 386,000 tonnes in 1990 (mainly due to demand for kiwi-fruit) - all other exporters from the southern hemisphere either stagnated or fell back. Only Chile has managed significant diversification, ranging from new varieties of grapes to a range of stone fruits like plums, peaches and nectarines. Mr Codron traces a number of reasons for the spectacular growth in Chile's fruit exports: It is close to the US, with its fruit industry built up in direct consultation with Californian professionals. A broad climatic range allows it to produce a wide variety of fruits, across a long harvesting season. Grapes, for example, can be picked from November in the northern Valley of Copiapo to April in Talca province 1,100 km (680 miles) to the south. It offers natural protection against exotic diseases and pests, mainly because of its extraordinary isolated position, with the Pacific to the west, the Andes to the east, the Atacama desert to the north and Antarctica to the south. Availability of fruit during the normal 'low' season allows exporters to use cheap transport and to have frequent and regular ship departures. Multinational investors have given Chile access to 'the most modern channels and the most modern markets', using efficient transport and distribution systems, Mr Codron says. The country 'has forged solid commercial experience which it should be able to draw on when Europe ceases to be a mosaic of markets and regulations'. It has comparatively cheap labour and recently a better record of political stability than countries like like South Africa or Argentina. Chile's success is not without attendant dangers, however. In opting to rely on multinationals 'the country has taken a large risk which could one day turn against it', Mr Codron notes. Chile's success is also attracting the anger of Californians, who are 'ready to resort to any methods. . . by manipulating the quality and phytosanitary (plant health) regulations' to block grape imports in the six weeks leading up the start of their season late in May. In Europe, where the market for grapes is 'still a long way from saturation levels', conflict is likely to be focused on easily stockable products like apples, pears and kiwi fruit. While competition will be 'more threatening', Mr Codron forecasts that southern hemisphere exporters will continue to raise sales, reinforcing Europe as the main export market for southern hemisphere fruits. This is not least because of the ineffectiveness of recent protective measures put in place: 'One wonders whether the European Community is not looking today to withdraw progressively its support from producers', he muses. The damp squib of the past two decades has been Australia, which has seen its exports of temperate fruits slump from 115,000 tonnes in 1974 to a meagre 53,000 tonnes in 1990. Argentina has also stagnated, with exports rising over the same period from 305,000 tonnes to 382,000 tonnes. Both have been complacent, Mr Codron argues, because a combination of a small population and a large area of potential farm land has discouraged intensive farming techniques. Argentina has also been diverted by historic demand from Brazil, a strategic mistake given that country's severe foreign exchange problems, and the rapid growth in the output of its own fruit growers. South Africa, so long a pariah, could become a serious competitor with Chile in Europe now that it has turned its back on the policies of apartheid. Few of the gains of the past 20 years would have been possible without new technologies and speedier transport - particularly for perishable fruit like nectarines, plums and apricots. Fast refrigerator ships now allow Chilean exporters to deliver fruits to Rotterdam in less than 22 days - compared with 30 days or more a decade ago. Journeys to Philadelphia take less than 15 days compared with three weeks. Controlled atmosphere techniques have also been important in extending the growing season for fruit - like early ripening of pears using ethylene, or slowing down the ripening process. The effect of these changes will be intensification of competition in Europe, with southern hemisphere exporters like Chile and South Africa continuing to make headway. The wild card for Chile in particular will be Japan - a coveted but still-elusive market that offers the prospect of making Chile not just the leading southern hemisphere fruit exporter, but one of the most powerful suppliers in the world.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                 SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FRUIT EXPORTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------   ('000 tonnes - Apples, pears, grapes, kiwifruit, nectarines)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                   1974-76*    1979-81*    1984-86*    1989-90**  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Chile                  74         253         529         888 Argentina             305         324         292         382 South Africa          255         253         309         358 Australia             115          81          60          53 New Zealand            74         101         233         386 Total                 824       1,012       1,423       2,067  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: FAO, USDA.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *three-year average, **two-year average.  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

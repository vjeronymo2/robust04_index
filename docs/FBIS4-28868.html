			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Chinese President Jiang Zemin Says China Is Not in Favor </F> of Imposing Sanctions"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  China and president of the People's Republic of China, clarified  China's stand regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula in his interview with a chief commentator of the Japan  Broadcasting Corporation in Zhongnanhai on June 10.    He said:    "China is not in favor of imposing sanctions because that is  useless for the settlement of the problem. On the contrary, it  would aggravate the escalation of the situation and lead to a  serious consequence that all parties concerned do not want to  see.    "It is my view that persevering in dialogue and  consultations  is an effective and fundamental way to solve the problem".    "We urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act  with caution," he said, and added: "The goal for the settlement  of the issue is finally to safeguard peace and stability on the  Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization.    "No matter what temporary difficulties may appear, it is  possible to find a proper solution to this problem as long as  these two major objectives are not departed from."    Noting that the door for negotiation is not completely  closed  and that there still exist possibilities of holding dialogue, he  urged all parties concerned to take positive measures so as to  avoid acceleration of the crisis.</p>

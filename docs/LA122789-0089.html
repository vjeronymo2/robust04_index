			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> ENCEPHALITIS VICTIM IS RELEARNING IT ALL  </P> <P> There was a time when Debra Kezer would stay up all night reading romance  novels, unable to tear herself away until the last page.  </P> <P> These days, the Westminster resident must limit her reading to books by Dr.  Seuss and other children's authors. At 30, she is learning to read all over  again.  </P> <P> In 1984, Kezer was bitten by a mosquito and contracted encephalitis, which left  her in a coma for 10 days. The illness caused her brain to swell, and she  suffered stroke-like damage that left her unable to care for herself.  </P> <P> Kezer was one of four Orange County residents to be infected by the  mosquito-carried virus. Its effects can be similar to an attack of the flu, and  some cases go unreported because of the flu-like symptoms. In more serious  cases, there is a possibility of permanent brain damage or death.  </P> <P> "I got sick, but I thought it was a cold or the flu," Kezer said. "Next thing I  knew, it was a month later and I was in the hospital. I didn't recognize my  husband or my son. I was like a baby. They had to teach me how to eat, walk and  go to the bathroom."  </P> <P> After months of therapy, Kezer regained her physical abilities but was still  unable to speak or read. For an avid reader and self-described nonstop talker,  it was quite a blow.  </P> <P> During the first year of her recovery, Kezer also suffered through a divorce  from her husband, Donald, but the two remain friends, and she kept custody of  their son, Donny.  </P> <P> Through it all, Kezer said, she was determined to return to normal, something  that didn't surprise her mother, Beverly Gulley.  </P> <P> "She has such a fighting spirit and always has. That's what has gotten her  through all of this," Gulley said. Through speech therapy at Cal State Long  Beach, Kezer has learned to talk almost as well as she did before her illness.  </P> <P> "Thank God, I can still talk a lot. If I didn't have such a strong desire to  talk, I don't know if I would have come this far," she said.  </P> <P> Learning to read again has come more slowly. For the past two years, she has  been tutored through the Adult Literacy Program at Huntington Beach Central  Library by 71-year-old Jean Smith, a volunteer.  </P> <P> "When Debra came to us, she couldn't read anything but the letters in the  alphabet. Right now, she's reading at about a third-grade level. I have never  seen a young person so determined. She was so determined to learn how to read  before her little boy did," Smith said.  </P> <P> As it turned out, Kezer and her son, Donny, 7, are learning how to read  together. They often spend the afternoon on the couch in their Westminster  apartment, reading books donated by Donny's school.  </P> <P> "When we sit down to read together, a lot of times there will be a word that I  can't say, and Donny will say it for me. He'll just laugh and say, 'Say it this  way, Mom.' Between the two of us, we get through the books," she added.  </P> <P> Kezer said her experience has changed her outlook on life.  </P> <P> "When it first happened, all I could think about was 'why me?' But when I went  into therapy, I met a lot of people who were a lot worse off. People who didn't  have legs and arms. I just thank God I have what I have and have the chance to  get where I once was," she said.  </P> <P> Kezer said she is thinking about becoming a nurse and helping stroke victims  and others who have to experience what she went through.  </P> <P> "I just want to tell them that if I got through it, they can, too," she said.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule &sect;3001.54(j)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(3) was to require that the Postal Service's revenue presentation be disaggregated to the billing determinant level, consistent with rule &sect;3001.54(l), which requires the Postal Service to provide class and subclass billing determinants for each ``rate element'' that it uses to determine revenues. The Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) observes that the wording of proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(3) could have been interpreted as applying to elements other than those covered by rule &sect;3001.54(l). OCA Comments of November 24, 1993, at 3&hyph;4. Final rule &sect;3001.54(j)(3), therefore, adopts the alternate language proposed by the OCA, which requires that the Postal Service's revenue presentation be disaggregated to ``each unique rate element.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule &sect;3001.54(j)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(4) was to require that the method of calculating revenues be described in detail, especially where the calculation involved restructured rates. The OCA's comments propose alternative language that is more concrete and less susceptible to subjective interpretation. Instead of requiring an ``identification'' or ``specific description'' of its methods of calculating revenue, the OCA's proposed language would require the Postal Service to document its revenue calculations in such a way that they can be replicated from ``primary data sources.'' OCA Comments of November 24, 1993, at 4&hyph;5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final Rule &sect;3001.54(j)(4) adopts the essence of the OCA's proposed alternative. Appropriate sourcing of revenue presentations, however, is most often to companion volume testimony and supporting documents, rather than to ``primary data sources.'' We have modified the OCA's proposed language accordingly. The OCA incorrectly inferred from our Notice an intent to limit rule &sect;3001.54(j)(4) to estimates of ``per piece'' revenue. Final rule &sect;3001.54(j)(4) applies to revenue estimates generally, not just to estimates of ``per piece'' revenue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rules &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(iv)&hyph;(v)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed rules &sect;3001.54(5)(j)(iv) and (v) would have required that the Postal Service's revenue presentations include fully disaggregated revenue estimates for interim years (years between the base year and the test year), and for the year following the test year. Interim year estimates would have facilitated tracking of the Postal Service's revenue estimate against actual revenues as a rate hearing progresses. Post-test year estimates would have assisted in evaluating any proposed changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the added value of either exercise is relatively minor, we have decided to drop these proposed rules. They were the focus of the generalized complaints expressed in the Postal Service's Comments of December 2, 1993, and Reply Comments of December 13, 1993, that the amendments to rule &sect;3001.54(j) that we propose in this docket are burdensome and unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(vi) and Final Rule &sect;3001.54(j)(6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As we discussed in our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Postal Service uses average, or indexed, subclass prices as key variables in its volume forecasting models. Billing determinants are implicit in an indexed price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The broad purpose of proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(vi) was to ensure that the Postal Service's volume presentation includes a detailed description of how the indexed prices were constructed, especially where they reflected restructured rates. The specific purpose of the proposed rule was to require that the Postal Service identify instances where the billing determinants implicit in the price indices used to forecast subclass volumes differ from those used to estimate subclass revenues, and that it explain such differences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Partly in response to the Postal Service's general plea that we not add to the complexity of rule &sect;3001.54(j) unless it is clearly necessary, we have decided to delete proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(vi) from our final rules. The broad purpose of the proposed rule was to ensure that the Postal Service provides full narrative explanations of how its price indices are constructed. Having focused attention on that purpose with this rulemaking, we believe that current rule &sect;3001.54(j)(6)(i) and (ii) will be adequate to achieve it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted, the specific purpose of proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(vi) was to require the Postal Service to explain why it sometimes bases its revenue estimates on billing determinants that differ from those implicit in its volume forecasts. We believe that this purpose can be accomplished more economically by adding the following sentence at the end of the current preamble to rule &sect;3001.54(j)(6): Supporting rationale shall be provided for using billing determinants to estimate revenues for any class, subclass, or rate category of mail that differ from the billing determinants implicit in the estimate of volumes for that class, subclass, or rate category. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

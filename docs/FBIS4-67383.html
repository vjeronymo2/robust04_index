			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'International Safety Regulations </F> Are Not Met,' IAEA Experts Said"]    [Text] According to an agreement with COMPETENT Ukrainian  agencies, a group of experts for the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] worked for two weeks at the Chernobyl nuclear  power plant. Certain well-informed sources, preferring to  remain anonymous, sent our newspaper the text of a letter by  IAEA Director Hans Blix to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  summarizing the results of the work done by the experts of his  organization. We have the opportunity to acquaint our readers  with almost the full text of this letter that is of great  interest. Here it is (the original style is preserved):    "...documented were numerous shortcomings in ensuring safety  at the operational nuclear units. Particular concern is aroused  by specific problems connected with the obsolete design of the  old-type No. 1 reactor that are still waiting to be resolved...    "Experts have also pointed to a number of factors that, when  combined, effect the overall safety situation. Difficult work  conditions and a substantial steady drain of qualified  professionals represent a big problem. In addition, a limited  possibility to purchase common equipment results in a deficiency  of necessary spare parts.    "The most serious problem established by the experts is the  accelerated deterioration of the `Shelter' at the No. 4 reactor  unit. The destruction of this unit, if it were to take place,  would complicate safety conditions of operational units and  produce grave ecological consequences.    "Although fully aware of the magnitude of the economic  crisis  that Ukraine confronts, I consider it my duty to bring to your  attention that international safety norms are currently not met  in Chernobyl. Given the graveness of the present situation, you  might want to convene a meeting with the concerned countries to  discuss what measures could be taken to improve the situation..."</p>

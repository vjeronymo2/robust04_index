Keldysh, Russian  Academy of Sciences; UDC 629]    [Abstract] The asteroid Toutatis, which passed near the  Earth in December 1992, was used as the basis for an analysis of  the results that could be produced by sending a spacecraft on a  collision course with an asteroid, thereby preventing a  collision between the Earth and the asteroid. The researchers,  in the first half of the article, examine the effect of the  collision on the basis of model parameters. In the second half,  they perform a more refined ballistics analysis for parameter  that are near actual. An asteroid with a diameter of 1 km could  be deflected some 3,000 km from the Earth for each asteroid  orbit by a spacecraft with an orbital mass of 1,000 tons.

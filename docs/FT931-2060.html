			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fila plans flotation on NYSE FILA, the Italian sportswear group indirectly controlled by Fiat, is set to become the second Italian company to shun the domestic stock market and float shares directly in New York. The company is negotiating with US regulators and bankers for a flotation on the New York Stock Exchange, following a path beaten in 1990 by Luxottica, the spectacle frames group. The decision to by-pass Milan and list in New York reflects Fila's growing penetration of the US market, where sales of its sports shoes have risen sharply to put it in third place behind Nike and Reebok, and ahead of Adidas. The company, which was in poor financial health as recently as the mid-1980s, has made a remarkable recovery. Operating profits rose by 124 per cent to L75bn (Dollars 47.5m) last year, while sales reached L500.2bn, up from L271bn in 1991. Turnover of the group, based in Biella in northern Italy, is forecast to grow to over L660bn this year. Fila was controlled by Fiat's Snia-BPD textiles and chemicals subsidiary until 1988, when Snia-BPD sold for L62bn its 80 per cent stake to Gemina, in which Fiat is the major shareholder. The remaining shares were acquired from private shareholders. Gemina is an investment and financial services group controlled by leading north Italian business families and dominated by Fiat. Much of Fila's recent growth has stemmed from its expansion into sports shoes, which last year accounted for more than 60 per cent of sales. In Europe, the company is still better known for its up-market sports and ski apparel. The Fila flotation may be swiftly followed by that of Natuzzi, a south Italian furniture maker, in which Gemina has a 20 per cent stake. The company is Italy's biggest maker of high-quality leather furnishings.</p>

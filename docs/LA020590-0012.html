			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME -- BACK  </P> <P> Having shown its hand near the cookie jar of military base closings, the White  House has a problem. It can either drop the whole idea or it can join Congress  in reviving an approach that closed 86 assorted forts, camps and bases in 1988  with barely a whimper.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration proposal to close 43 military installations and scale  back others may have been made in all innocence, but it's hopeless to argue  that to House Democrats. More than 90% of uniformed and civilian personnel who  would be moved or mustered out live in Democratic districts. Arguing that the  plan is not politically motivated because it would also embarrass important  Republican senators just makes Democrats put their hands over their ears.  </P> <P> Until 1988, Congress had for 10 years refused to close a single military base,  fearing that voters would punish any member who let a base and its payroll get  away, no matter how little it contributed to national security. Nor was all of  the politics defensive. The Pentagon was not above using a threat of base  closings to persuade members to vote for bigger defense budgets. Then Congress  hit upon the idea of a bipartisan commission that could close bases and leave  Congress blameless for the decisions. It worked.  </P> <P> But now Congress seems to be right back where it was before 1988. With a  crumbling threat of war in Europe and the opportunity to get rid of bases and  forces that are no longer needed, the timing could not be worse. Congress  created the commission in 1988 and the defense secretary appointed its members.  The commission compiled a list of surplus installations that was not  negotiable. Congress either accepted the list or rejected it. That meant that  members could go home after a base closed and argue that they had done their  best but other members of Congress would not listen to reason.  </P> <P> Clearly this is an idea whose time has come -- back.  </P></p>

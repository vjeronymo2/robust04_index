			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Deutsche Bank signals rethink of 28% stake in Daimler-Benz MR RONALDO Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director responsible for corporate finance, yesterday said that Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Bank had decided it was inappropriate for the bank's stake to stay at 28 per cent. However, Mr Schmitz told a conference of international investment managers in Dusseldorf there were no immediate plans to reduce the holding. 'There are those in the bank (Deutsche Bank) who may feel sorry not to have got out (of Daimler-Benz) when the price was better,' said Mr Schmitz. The Deutsche Bank, as Germany's biggest bank, is at the centre of the German system of corporate governance. Its board directors have more than 100 seats on supervisory boards and its influence is consolidated by a network of industrial holdings. While making one of the most outspoken contributions to the debate over German corporate governance to have come from a senior member of the German corporate establishment, Mr Schmitz said German companies should transform their approach to shareholders. If they did not take greater account of shareholders' interests, German industry could face dire consequences in the 1990s as it stood on the brink of 'the most significant industrial reconstruction since the second world war'. This restructuring can only be achieved with the help of foreign capital, he warned. Mr Schmitz, a former finance director of BASF, the large German chemicals company, said German companies traditionally put the interests of shareholders low on the list of management priorities. This was perhaps understandable in the 1980s, when German companies generated so much cash that they could finance all their investments from internal resources. But the era of 'over-capitalised' companies was over and German companies would now have to compete more aggressively on international capital markets to finance the reconstruction ahead. Mr Schmitz said companies should not pay lip service to the idea of shareholder value, they should take a more hard-nosed attitude to the way they managed their assets. He made a call for foreign institutional investors to gain representation on supervisory boards.</p>

			<p>Poisonings   <F P=102>   11111111 [ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII Dec 93,  etc.] </F>  <F P=103> 11111111 </F> <F P=104>  [ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII Dec 93,  etc.] </F>   CSO     [Editorial Report] Russian experts are trying to determine  the cause of mysterious mass mushroom poisonings which occurred  in Voronezh Oblast in 1992, according to a report in the Russian  public health journal, ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII  (Dec 93). A group of scientists from the Voronezh Oblast State  Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate, the Kurchatov  Institute, and the Scientific Research Institute for Preventive  Toxicology and Disinfection propose funding the eight-million  ruble program from Voronezh Oblast funds earmarked for ecology  purposes.    Tn 1992, 335 Voronezh residents were poisoned and 24 died  (Moscow ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII Dec 93). The  outbreak strained local toxicological centers and prompted  oblast authorities to prohibit the sale and processing of  mushrooms (Moscow MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA 12 Aug 92).    Extensive studies by prominent institutes failed to identify  the substance responsible for the poisonings, the journal said.  Possible sources of contamination considered were  radioactivity, heavy metals, agricultural chemicals,  microorganism toxins, and toxins created during cooking.  Researchers also thought that warm weather may have altered the  appearance of poisonous mushrooms so that they resembled edible  species. Studies were conducted at the Volgograd Scientific  Research Institute of Toxicology, Occupational Pathology and  Medical Prevention of Chemical Poisoning, the Komarov Institute  of Botany in St. Petersburg, the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow,  the Voronezh Oblast Epidemiology Center, and the Institute of  Toxicology in Yekaterinburg.    Previous press accounts reported that animal tests detected  ``strong toxins'' in the Voronezh mushrooms (Moscow ITAR-TASS 7  Aug 92, Moscow Russian Television Network 12 Sep 92). The  medical newspaper MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA (Moscow 12 Aug 92),  however, noted that tests had failed to find either toxic  substances or heavy metal salts in the fungi. MEDTTSTNSKAYA  GAZETA also noted speculation that edible mushrooms had mutated  to produce a new toxin. Tn 1993, the Russian State Committee  for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision claimed that death  cap mushrooms had been definitively identified as the cause of  all fatal cases of mushroom poisoning in Voronezh and other  oblasts (IZVESTIYA 14 Aug 93).    Similar mass mushroom poisonings have occurred elsewhere.  In 1991, Lugansk, Donets, and other regions of Ukraine  experienced over 400 cases and 40 fatalities (Moscow ITAR-TASS 7  Aug 92). Krasnodar Kray registered over 330 cases of mushroom  poisoning and 40 deaths during the same year (Moscow TRUD 4 Mar  93). The author of the ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII  article, Voronezh epidemiologist T. Chubirko, thinks  comprehensive studies should be done in these areas as well.</p>

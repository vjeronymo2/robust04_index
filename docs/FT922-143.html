			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Carclo shows 30% decline to Pounds 5.63m CARCLO Engineering Group reported a 30 per cent fall in annual profits after a tough trading year but maintained its final dividend. Mr John Ewart, chairman, said that the order intake in the last three months was higher than in the corresponding period last year and that sales had stopped falling. This period in 1991 immediately followed the Gulf conflict when orders were affected. 'We expected not very good results and we got not very good results,' Mr Ewart said. 'But having had sales 7 per cent lower last year, which reduces profits by a multiple of 7 per cent, order intake is now up.' Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 8.04m to Pounds 5.63m on sales of Pounds 78.8m (Pounds 85m). Earnings per share also fell 30 per cent, to 9.6p. A recommended final dividend of 6.1p gives an unchanged 7.81p for the year. The outcome was struck after a Pounds 1.17m exceptional charge to cover the transfer of a business and further redundancy costs. In addition the group took an increased extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.29m, net of tax, to cover the write down in the value of businesses up for sale and the write off of relating goodwill. All Carclo's main divisions suffered during the year. Sales in the card clothing division were 5 per cent down and operating profits fell 23 per cent to Pounds 2.23m. General engineering sales were 10 per cent lower and operating profits fell 21 per cent to Pounds 1.98m.</p>

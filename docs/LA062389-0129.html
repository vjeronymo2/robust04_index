			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COAST;  </P> <P> BREAKERS UP TO 10 FEET INCREASE WATER RESCUES  </P> <P> The county coastline was hit with unusually high surf Thursday, so lifeguards  were busy along the Southern California coast with an increased number of  rescues.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service reported occasional breakers reaching 10 feet  throughout the day and other waves commonly eight feet high.  </P> <P> Swells and surf were expected to peak during the night. Meteorologists are not  sure whether the high surf will return today or why surf was so high Thursday.  </P> <P> "I'm betting on good surf for a couple of days," said Newport Beach lifeguard  Rob Maier, who said the high waves could be gone today or linger for another  three days.  </P> <P> Maier said lifeguards in Newport Beach logged 110 rescues Thursday, about 80  more than on a more typical day with surf two to three feet high.  </P> <P> "There were big waves and a lot of rip" currents, he said.  </P> <P> Maier said all the rescues were successful, with no injuries reported.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard and officials at major harbors in the county said no damage was  reported from the high surf.  </P></p>

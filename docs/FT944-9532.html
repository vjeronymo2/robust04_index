			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kmart hit by warm weather Problems at Kmart, the US discount store group, appeared to have worsened yesterday when it reported a fall in after-tax profits from Dollars 104m in last year's depressed third quarter to Dollars 39m this time. It was the seventh consecutive quarter of earnings decline. However, Kmart had warned last month that profits would be down, and the shares were little changed. They closed in New York down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 15 5/8 . Kmart blamed the profits fall on unusually warm weather in late September and early October, which affected customer purchases of autumn clothing. It said sales in the core discount store division had strengthened in the quarter as a whole, with revenues up 2.7 per cent at stores that had been open for more than a year. However, the increase failed to translate into profits growth because sales were heavily weighted towards lower-margin goods. Group revenues rose 9 per cent to Dollars 8.89bn. Net income of Dollars 104m for 1993 excluded Dollars 10m of losses from discontinued operations. On the same basis, earnings per share fell from 22 cents to 8 cents. Since the end of the quarter, Kmart has sold its 21.5 per cent stake in Coles Myer, the Australian retailer, for Dollars 928m. It has also cut its stake in OfficeMax, one of its specialty retailing subsidiaries, from more than 90 per cent to 25 per cent.</p>

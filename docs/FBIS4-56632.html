			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- Peruvian Economy Minister Jorge  Camet left today for Washington, although his final destination  is Paris where he will report to the World Bank Consultative  Group on the progress of the government program against poverty,  which is being financed by that organization. In 1993, the  Consultative Group granted Peru aid worth $900 million to fight  poverty, of which $500 million have already been disbursed.    In his stopover in Washington, Camet will meet with Manuel  Estela, Peruvian delegate before the IDB [Inter-American  Development Bank] and director of the National Compensation and  Social Development Fund (Foncodes), who will travel with Camet  to Paris. During the group's meeting on 9 and 10 May, the  Peruvian representatives will explain how the funds provided by  the World Bank are being used.    A study will also be made of a report prepared by an IMF  mission which recently visited Peru to evaluate the degree of  poverty, Peruvian financial needs, and the functioning of the  government organizations in charge of the struggle against  poverty.    According to an Economy Ministry source, the main goal of  the  Peruvian delegates will be to commit the group to act as a  promoter of foreign investment in Peru, and especially  investment for the social sector.    The Paris meeting will also be attended by World Bank  directors; representatives of the governments committed to the  aid approved last year, such as the United States, Japan, and  Germany; and delegates from the IMF, the IDB, and the UN  organizations linked to the struggle against poverty.</p>

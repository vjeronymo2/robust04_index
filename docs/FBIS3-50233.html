Despite the fact that it was  previously announced that the meeting would not be a news  conference, the General Staff chief answered several questions  regarding problems in the Bulgarian Army. General Petrov  considers the new military budget extremely insufficient for the  Army, especially since war is raging along our western border.  However, the Army chief said that contrary to reports that  appeared immediately after the draft military budget was  published, even if the budget is adopted, he would not resign.  "I will not desert the Army, but I also will not be held  responsible for the Bulgarian Army's combat readiness, " General  Petrov said.    The General Staff chief admitted participating in working  out  the presidential decree on the functions and prerogatives of the  president's Military Office but refused to comment on the issue  until the National Security Commission takes a stand.</p>

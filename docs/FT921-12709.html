			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho shareholders' funds fall to Pounds 1.33bn LONRHO, the international trading group, suffered last year from its exposed asset position in Africa. In the year to September 30 1991 shareholders' funds, excluding minority interests, fell by Pounds 53m to Pounds 1.33bn. Mr Philip Tarsh, a director, said yesterday that one of the main reasons for the fall was the continued appreciation of sterling against the South African rand and Kenyan shilling. Pre-tax profits for the year fell to Pounds 207m (Pounds 273m) on turnover of Pounds 4.8bn (Pounds 5.4bn). The fall took the market by surprise but Mr Tarsh said he could not understand why the results should come as a surprise. He added: 'We were badly hit by the recession. The fall in precious metal prices accounts for nearly half of the reduction in Lonrho's profits in the second six months. Why analysts could not see that is beyond me.' Aware that the market had developed an appetite for tycoon-bashing, Mr Tarsh said that only Pounds 800,000 of its Pounds 300m UK pension funds was invested in Lonrho shares or Lonrho related companies. Exchange movements through balance sheet reserves in the period increased by Pounds 40m to Pounds 209m. Lonrho has now suffered a cumulative adverse movement through reserves over the last six years of Pounds 695m. In the past Lonrho has been able to mitigate their effects by revaluing part of the asset base. Over the same period revaluations have added a total of Pounds 882m, the 1990 increase being Pounds 93m. However, Mr Tarsh said the group did not believe it would be prudent to revalue freehold and leasehold properties in the middle of a recession, thus there was no addition to the revaluation reserve in 1991. Net debt increased from Pounds 936m to Pounds 1.1bn over the year but it was less than some commentators feared and gearing stands at 73 per cent. Some analysts have voiced concern that it could be misleading to net off cash against debt when cash is held in soft currencies and debt in hard ones. However, Mr Tarsh pointed out that 87 per cent of the group's cash balances of more than Pounds 280m was held in bank accounts in Europe and the US. Mr Tarsh said that debt would continue to fall. The sale of Lonrho's 50 per cent stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel, the German freight forwarder was part of a wide-ranging review of assets which started eight months ago. Capital expenditure, which has been rising over the past few years, fell from 1990's Pounds 250m. Due to the high rates of taxation of South African profits and the reliefs available for capital spending Lonrho has continued to spend significant sums there. The price of rhodium has fallen from a recent high of Dollars 7,000 (Pounds 3,910) an ounce to a low of about Dollars 2,000. Lonrho owns a 75 per cent stake in Western Platinum, the South African mining company which produces 45,000 ounces of rhodium a year. James Capel, the stockbrokers, said a slump on such a scale could have reduced Lonrho's gross revenue by up to Pounds 100m. Mr Tarsh added that the group's motors division, which includes Dutton Forshaw and VAG, the Volkswagen/Audi distributor in the UK, suffered a particularly bad fall in pre-tax profits. Earnings per share declined from 23.6p to 14.2p and the total dividend is lower at 13p (15.7p adjusted) with a proposed final payment of 5p.</p>

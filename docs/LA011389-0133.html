			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> PLAYING UP TO STUFF;  </P> <P> LARGER SCHOOLS MIGHT WANT ORANGE LUTHERAN TO PICK ON SOMEONE ITS OWN SIZE  </P> <P> David versus Goliath, Underdog, The Little Engine That Could . . .  </P> <P> This season, the Orange Lutheran High School boys' basketball team just cannot  live down the comparisons. No matter how hard it tries.  </P> <P> The real story of Orange Lutheran -- exceptional athletes, increased team pride  and confidence -- has been all but overshadowed by the romantic notion that  Orange Lutheran, having come close to beating schools four or five times its  size, has become the giant killer of Orange County basketball.  </P> <P> Has it? Well, not quite. Though that hasn't discouraged the ever-growing number  of Lancer basketball fans.  </P> <P> The fact is that Orange Lutheran -- a Southern Section 2-A school with an  enrollment of about 500 -- is small compared with the majority of some 65 high  schools in Orange County.  </P> <P> But this season, Orange Lutheran (11-3 overall, 4-0 in the Olympic League) has  proven that it can play with the bigger schools. Because of that, and the  publicity it has brought to the school, the Lancers have received more  attention on campus and from alumni than in the past several years combined.  </P> <P> Home crowds, once numbering fewer than 50, are at an all-time high. More than  1,000 are expected tonight when the Lancers play host to Whittier Christian in  an Olympic League game at 7:30.  </P> <P> "The band's even coming," Orange Lutheran Principal Richard Klatt said.  "They've never wanted to come to basketball games before. Now they're  volunteering."  </P> <P> Whittier Christian (10-3, 3-0), which has won six league championships in the  past 7 years, had to settle for a co-championship last season with Orange  Lutheran.  </P> <P> Tonight's game should begin to settle the question of whether Orange Lutheran  is, as some suspect, ready to step forward and dethrone the Heralds.  </P> <P> Center Pat Bagatourian, forward Daryl Cole and off-guard Jason Neben are the  main keys to Orange Lutheran's success this season.  </P> <P> At 6-feet 2-inches, Bagatourian, who is averaging 21 points a game and shooting  62% from the field, is not one of the tallest centers in the county by any  means. But his height, Coach Jerry Simmons said, is no indication of his  ability.  </P> <P> "Pat's a center in a guard's body," Simmons said. "He's 6-2, but it's a tough  6-2. His heart makes him more like 6-10, really."  </P> <P> Cole, averaging 24 points, is one of the county's best pure shooters. "He'd  always been a scorer," Lancer assistant Chuck Thomas said. "But now he's asking  what else can he do for the team. His defense and rebounding have really made a  difference."  </P> <P> Neben, a talented option quarterback and long jumper, is the team's best  athlete. Only 6 feet, he has a tremendous vertical leap. He has three slams so  far this season.  </P> <P> The other starters are junior forward Kent Dowding, an aggressive defensive  specialist, and point guard Luke Aucoin, who despite being a freshman, has  demonstrated poise and leadership.  </P> <P> Around campus, Lancer basketball, once a non-issue, now is a trendy subject.  Especially after the Lancers came so close to beating three prestigious  programs, each of which is more than four times Orange Lutheran's size.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran lost to San Bernardino Cajon, a 4-AA school with an enrollment  of 2,150, 70-69, in early December. Capistrano Valley (5-A, 2,400) had to go to  overtime to defeat the Lancers, 85-81, Dec. 27. And Long Beach Wilson (5-AA,  2,900) defeated the Lancers, 62-60, Dec. 30.  </P> <P> It was the Capistrano Valley game that generated the most excitement. The  Cougars were the county's seventh-ranked team at the time, but the Lancers  outplayed Capistrano Valley most of the game.  </P> <P> Lancermania was on its way.  </P> <P> "Before the Capo game, a lot of people, like classmates and stuff, were trying  to make Capo bigger than they were," Neben said.  </P> <P> "They were saying stuff like, 'You guys are gonna get your butts kicked.' But  then after the game, everyone's all, 'Wow! You guys are good! We're so  surprised.' A guy from last year's team came up said, 'You guys are awesome!' "  </P> <P> The players say the increased school support has given them a major confidence  boost. But some of the players point out that, in some respects, it has also  become a bit of a bother.  </P> <P> Especially when people start comparing the Lancers to giant killers. Other than  a 71-65 victory over University (enrollment 2,180), the Lancers have not  actually beaten a school with a great difference in enrollment.  </P> <P> "The thing is, everybody's making a big deal out of the Capo game, but we  lost," Bagatourian said. "Even though we lost by 4, what's the difference if  it's 4 or 20? A loss is a loss.  </P> <P> "I'd say we haven't accomplished as much as everyone says we have. I don't  think we're deserving of all of this (attention).  </P> <P> "But everybody's trying to make us into the Little Hooisers story. It kind of  bothers me because it doesn't matter if you're a big school or a little school.  What matters is just that a team goes out on the court, and if five guys can  play, then that's what matters."  </P></p>

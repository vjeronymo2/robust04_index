			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: S&amp;N poised for acquisitions - Healthcare group likely to have net cash position by year end Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group, is 'actively looking for acquisitions', Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said yesterday. A disposal earlier this week left gearing at just 4 per cent, and the company is likely to have a net cash position by the end of 1994, he said. The target could be in a similar business to Smith &amp; Nephew's areas of expertise such as keyhole surgery equipment, said Mr Robinson. It could, however, be in a new area provided there were synergies such as the possibility of using S&amp;N's existing sales staff. This week's disposal of Ioptex, the lossmaking eye surgery products company, led to an exceptional Pounds 148m charge in the interim results, published yesterday. Excluding the charge, pre-tax profit for the six months to July 2 were Pounds 82.2m, within analyst's forecasts and a rise of 12 per cent on 1993 when restated to conform with FRS 4 accounting rules. These call for convertible preference shares then in issue to be reclassified as debt and their dividend as interest. Turnover was Pounds 486m, an underlying sales increase of 7 per cent. Adjusted earnings per share were 5.04p and the interim dividend is 2.02p, both up 7 per cent. With dividend cover now at the company's target of 2, pay-outs would now rise in line with earnings growth, Mr Robinson said. Operating profit margins rose from 16.5 to 17.1 per cent, reflecting higher production volumes and efficiency improvements and an increasing proportion of sales coming from higher technology products. Mr Robinson said that target operating profit margins had almost been reached. Most of the company's product areas saw sales grow by 8 to 11 per cent, about the same as in 1993. The exception was in commodity products like surgical gloves, where sales fell. Consumer healthcare, including Elastoplast plasters and Lil-lets tampons, saw the sharpest increase in growth rates, from 2 per cent in 1993 to 10 per cent this time. The Simple brand of cosmetics did well, but the figure was flattered by restocking. US sales growth slipped from 7 per cent to 6 per cent, although Mr Robinson said that the effect of US healthcare reforms had 'flattened'. Continental European sales growth fell from 7 per cent to 4 per cent as France and Spain clamped down on health spending. Mr Robinson said that France had a better close to the half. COMMENT Disposals and organic growth have been S&amp;N's routes to bring innovation, high margins and decent growth to the mundane end of the healthcare business. The company should make about Pounds 175m for the full year, giving a p/e of 14.5, just under the market average. That combination of lowish risk and steady growth makes S&amp;N an attractive investment compared with the uncertainties of drug companies; but it looks pedestrian compared with cyclical stocks in other sectors. There are few reasons to sell S&amp;N shares but, until management finds some clever acquisitions, even fewer to buy them.</p>

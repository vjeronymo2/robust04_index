The committee, in a statement issued at the end of its  session, praised all parties to the peace process in South  Africa for the spirit of tolerance they showed, which  contributed to achieving this accomplishment.    In its final statement, the South African Committee  emphasized its overwhelming support for democratic process in  South Africa, which serves the great interests of whoever is  living there, regardless of any ethnic considerations. The  committee voiced its regret for the recent acts of violence in  South Africa and called on all parties to show tolerance and a  sincere spirit of reconciliation to put an end to the chaotic  massacres and provide the appropriate atmosphere for holding the  elections in the country. The committee paid tribute to the  urgent efforts exerted by the transitional executive council and  the Government of South Africa to contain the explosive  situation in Bophuthatswana.    The committee called on all political leaders in South  Africa  to take the necessary measures to safeguard and guarantee the  unity and territorial integrity of South Africa. It called on  the international community to continue its backing for the  process of democratic change in South Africa and reject any  attempt to partition the country.    On behalf of the OAU leaders, the committee expressed its  hope to welcome a "new South Africa" as a member in the  organization following the April elections and the formation of  a democratic government.    The following is the text of the statement:    The 10th session of the OAU's South African Committee of  heads of states and governments met in Harare, the capital of  Zimbabwe, on 19 March 1994 to review the developments in South  Africa on the eve of the first democratic and nonracial  elections in that country. Participating in the meeting were  Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the current chairman  of OAU; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, president of the  host country and head of the front-line states; Botswana's  President Ketumile Masire, Cape Verde's President Antonio  Mascarenhas, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, Mozambique's  President Chissano, Namibian President Dr. Sam Nujoma, Tanzanian  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, and Zambian President Frederick  Chiluba.    Also present at the meeting were Angolan Prime Minister  Marcolino Moco; Lieutenant General D. O. Diya, Nigerian Chief of  the General Staff and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive  Council; Benjamin Bounkoulou, Congolese minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation; Ahmed Djebbar, Algerian  minister of national education; Osman Kamaza, Senegalese  ambassador to Zimbabwe [name and title as received]; OAU  Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim; Johnson Mlambo, chairman of  the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania; Alfred Nzo, member  of the African National Congress [ANC] Executive Council [name  and title as received]; and in the capacity of observer, Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's representative in South  Africa.    The committee examined a report prepared by the OAU  secretary  general following his visit to South Africa and his extensive  discussions with all concerned leaders there.    The committee listened to reports on the current situation  in  South Africa presented by the leaders of the PAC and ANC  delegations.    The committee referred to the Harare Declaration, which it  adopted on 21 August 1989 during its third regular session and  which included the principles and directions for the negotiating  process, and the program for ending apartheid and establishing a  united, democratic, and nonracial state in South Africa.    The committee welcomed the considerable progress achieved  since its last meeting and the splendid success achieved by the  multilateral negotiations, which produced historic agreements  providing for democratic elections in South Africa on 26, 27,  and 28 April 1994 and the establishment of transitional  structures to hold those elections.    The committee praised the spirit of tolerance shown by all  parties involved in the peace process and the flexible attitudes  which made the above achievement possible.    The committee voiced regret at the escalating violence in  the  country and grave concern at recent reports about the  involvement of senior officers in South Africa's security forces  in the continuing violence. The committee urged all parties in  South Africa to show tolerance and sincerely seek reconciliation  to put an end to the reckless massacres and prepare a suitable  climate to hold peaceful elections.    The committee welcomed the PAC's decision to halt armed  struggle unilaterally as of 16 April 1994. The committee termed  this decision a contribution toward free and honest elections.    The committee applauded South Africa's Transitional  Executive  Council and Government for their prompt efforts to contain the  explosive situation in Bophuthatswana and urged them to continue  their task of maintaining order, security, and law and  guaranteeing free political action throughout the country so  that the April elections can be held in an atmosphere free from  violence and threats.    The committee voiced support for the efforts to bring about  national accord within the framework of an all-embracing  process. Thanking all the leaders and parties involved in the  electoral process, including those who joined it recently, for  their sense of responsibility and perseverance, the committee  regrets the decision by some parties to boycott the upcoming  elections.    The committee commended the Transitional Executive Council,  which took firm measures to involve Bophuthatswana in the  electoral process.    The committee welcomed the meeting held recently between ANC  Chairman Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi and urged both leaders to continue the  course of dialogue and cooperation, not just between themselves,  but also with all the other political figures to end the  devastating wave of violence and to pave the way for elections  in a secure and peaceful atmosphere to build a new, democratic  South Africa.    The committee categorically rejected and candidly condemned  recent threats and acts of violence by those who deliberately  wish to wear down the people and prevent the majority of South  Africans from exercising their lawful right to choose their  leaders and turn the page on the tragic chapters of the past for  the first time. It appealed to the patriotic spirit of party  leaders boycotting the elections and threatening to obstruct and  dismantle the electoral process to reconsider their position and  refrain from depriving their people of the right to partake of  the biggest and most serious change in the history of South  Africa. It also appealed to them to do their utmost to  guarantee freedom of political activity all over the country and  to hold the elections in a safe, peaceful atmosphere.    In this context, the committee expressed its deep concern  over recent statements by kwaZulu leaders, statements that seek  to destroy the country's unity. The OAU had rejected all  attempts to partition the country, since they dramatically  threaten peace and stability in the southern part of the  continent and the entire region, and viewed these attempts as  absolutely unacceptable.    The committee invited the South African Government and all  political leaders in South Africa to take the necessary measures  to protect and guarantee South African territorial integrity.  The OAU called on the international community to maintain its  support for the democratic process in South Africa and to reject  any attempt to divide the country.    The committee reiterated its firm support for the democratic  process in and the unity of South Africa, the process that  serves and protects the greater interests of those living in the  country, regardless of ethnic, cultural, or religious  considerations. The committee is eager to see a new, democratic  South Africa join the OAU house to enhance the organization and  play its natural role in the greater international community.    It welcomed the participation of the international  community,  including the United Nations, the European Union, and the  British Commonwealth, in monitoring the elections. It urged all  South African parties to cooperate fully with the international  observers in their mission. In this context, the committee  expressed its appreciation of the OAU member states that pledged  to send observers to monitor the elections and urged those that  have not done so to do the same.    On behalf of all OAU member states, the heads of states and  the heads of delegations taking part in the 10th ordinary  session of the Southern African Committee welcome the new South  Africa as a member of the OAU after the April 1994 elections and  the establishment of a democratic government.    The heads of states and governments and delegation chairmen  expressed their deep appreciation and gratitude for His  Excellency President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the  government and people of Zimbabwe for their hospitality and the  excellent facilities they have provided to them during their  meeting.</p>

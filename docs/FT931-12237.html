			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Analysts ease early pressure on steels STEEL groups came under early pressure yesterday after the US announced that it was imposing tariff duties on imports from seven EC countries, writes Our Markets Staff. However, some analysts commented that this measure might have less effect on the sector than instinctive reactions had suggested: the EC only exports about 3.6 per cent of its total steel production of some 136m tonnes to the US. BRUSSELS saw steel stocks recover in late trading: Cockerill, which had been as low as BFr89 closed just BFr1 weaker at BFr94 after saying that it had little exposure to the US. The group also announced that it was to lift prices by between 15 and 20 per cent, in line with increases that have recently been announced by other European producers. Clabecq was flat at BFr366 after seeing BFr345; and Arbed regained BFr1,980 after BFr1,920, BFr15 down on the day. The Bel-20 index was 2.43 higher at 1,180.88 in turnover of BFr1bn. AMSTERDAM fell back as Hoogovens reacted to the US decision, easing 80 cents to Fl 26.10 but off the day's low of Fl 25.30. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to 97.2. Daf remained suspended at Fl 7.20: after the close the government said that 'several more weeks' were needed for the restructuring plans to be finalised. FRANKFURT reversed early losses in the face of poor inflation figures from Hesse and bleak company news from Thyssen, the DAX index finishing 5.52 higher at 1,567.84 after a low of 1,556.36. Dealers, once again, gave the credit for the recovery to thin trading and the influence of the derivatives market. Turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM4.8bn. In the steel sector, shares showed little reaction to US plans to levy duties on steel imports. Thyssen ended DM1.50 higher at DM171, but it had fallen DM7 on Wednesday, anticipating yesterday's forecast of a further deterioration in 1992/93 results. In engineering, KHD fell DM1.80 to DM100 as it confirmed that a rights issue was on the way. PARIS was generally firmer although Alcatel Alsthom, went against the trend with a FFr15 fall to FFr610, reflecting disappointment after a forecast of flat earnings in 1993. The CAC-40 index closed 3.29 higher at 1,780.64, off the day's low of 1,755.90, in turnover of some FFr3bn. BSN was one of the main risers, up FFr11 at FFr923, after estimating a 5 per cent increase in 1992 earnings and saying that it was optimistic about the current year, while Cap Gemini advanced FFr8.30 to FFr148.30 after reporting a net 1992 loss of FFr80m, down from FFr560m in 1991. The banking sector remained weak after Standard and Poor's said on Wednesday that it was placing a number of banks on its creditwatch list. Suez shed FFr4.00 to FFr256.50 and Paribas lost FFr1.20 to FFr373.80. MILAN saw institutional investors emerge as bargain hunters after a weak opening and the Comit index finished 2.36 lower at 478.02. Fiat fixed L160 lower at L4,100 but recovered to L4,170 after hours as the market awaited the group's preliminary 1992 results. In the event, chairman Giovanni Agnelli's letter to shareholders, released after the close, revealed better operating income than expected but a worse net debt position. IFI, the parent company dipped L350 to L9,500. Montedison continued lower, losing L55 to L1,100, on concern that ENI, its former joint venture partner in Enimont, may press for up to L800bn reimbursement and unconfirmed reports that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of a former chairman over a contribution to a political party. ZURICH pulled up after the previous day's lows and the SMI index ended 8.5 higher at 2,072.6. Swissair gained SFr22 to SFr507 as investors welcomed its exploratory talks with KLM on possible cooperation. Adia fell SFr27 to SFr168 after announcing plans to cut its equity capital to cover projected 1992 losses of SFr203m. MADRID, the best performing market in Europe after some three weeks of 1993, took a critical look at itself and dropped the general index by nearly four points in the morning before it recovered to close 2.18 lower at 229.57. Construction stocks led the declines with Cubiertas losing Pta150 to Pta3,850, Dragados Pta45 to Pta1,285 and FCC Pta400 to Pta8,000. STOCKHOLM fell on worries in the banking sector and the Affarsvarlden index lost 13.9 to 879.1. Turnover was some SKr679m after SKr565m. Electrolux B slipped SKr5 to SKr210 ahead of its 1992 results.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 28  THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1066.97    1068.17    1067.88    1068.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1146.87    1145.55    1144.90    1145.26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1069.30    1070.34    1072.50    1072.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1145.39    1146.98    1146.86    1148.06  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 27    Jan 26    Jan 25    Jan 22    Jan 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1072.28   1084.24   1077.68   1091.64   1091.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1147.45   1156.52   1146.87   1156.91   1154.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1072.70; 200 - 1148.31 Low/day: 100 - 1066.09 200 - 1142.28.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

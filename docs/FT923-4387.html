			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italians' vessel risks capsize in choppy water - Rome is linking ratification of the Maastricht treaty with financial reform THE COUNTDOWN to the September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty in France has become a nightmare for the Italian government. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, and his colleagues know full well the uncertainties over the future of the European Community in the wake of a No vote would profoundly affect a member like Italy with a huge public sector deficit, high indebtedness, above average inflation and a weak currency. The judgment of the financial markets was brutally clear last week. The lira was pushed to its floor level within the Exchange Rate Mechanism against the D-Mark on Thursday and Friday. The Bank of Italy on Friday was forced to raise the discount rate by 1.75 points to 15 per cent and to resort to European Monetary System credit facilities enabling it to borrow unlimited amounts of strong currencies for up to 2 1/2 months to defend the lira's parity. It is only the third time in 30 years Italy has had to force such a steep jump in the discount rate to defend its currency. Despite this and the reassurance of the EC finance ministers' commitment to existing parties within the EMS over the weekend at Bath, the government recognises each day in the markets will have to be treated on its merits until the French referendum result is known. The weapons with which Italy can protect the lira are limited and drastic measures such as the discount rate rise risk being self-defeating as they squeeze industry in recession and add to the burden of state debt which in turn complicates the reduction of the overall budget deficit. 'We may be in the same boat as the rest of our (EC) partners but we are having to row twice as hard now and are the ones taking in the water,' said a senior official. Over the weekend Mr Cesare Romiti, chief executive of the Fiat group, called on the government to speed up privatisation with some concrete measures 'to give a signal to the markets that there really is a will to do something'. But the government has its hands tied by parliamentary procedures and the complex process of preparing the 1993 budget. The central feature of the 1993 budget will be structural reforms of four key areas - Italy's generous pensions system, the inefficient civil service, overspending public health and regional administration. The government is seeking special 'delegated authority' from parliament to carry out these reforms. This means both houses of parliament need merely approve the broad outline of the reforms. If this authority is denied, then all budget calculations are undermined - at least their timescale. But equally a traditionally leisurely parliament has to debate in committee and full session - a process repeated in each house - in record time. The budget has to be presented before September 30 by law. At the same time parliament has to process Italy's own ratification of the Maastricht treaty. This should be comparatively easy and ratification could be through the Senate before the French vote on September 20. Only one of the 16 parties in parliament, Reconstructed Communism, has shown reservations about Maastricht in that it links Italy too closely with the disciplines of a market economy. A real debate about Europe has never taken place. Italian politicians have always assumed Italy formed an integral part of Europe, have never questioned loss of sovereignty and have seen the EC as an essentially beneficial institution. This still seems true today even though painful obligations such as defending the lira have supplanted the old privileges. Yet it also means Italy is wholly unprepared for any alteration in the direction of the EC given a No vote in France. The Italian government's confidence about parliament's pro-Europe leanings is such that it is using ratification in arguments for the politicians to endorse its financial reform package. Last week in the Senate introducing the issue of ratifying Maastricht, Mr Emilio Colombo, the foreign minister, said: 'The ratification of the treaty will be credible if the Senate approves textually the law delegating authority (to the government) for the reform of the country's finances.' In other words parliament is being told it would be inconsistent to be pro-European and ratify Maastricht while rejecting fundamental financial reforms which are essential for Italy to be part of the Europe conceived by Maastricht. But the real pressure will continue to come from the markets which will almost certainly demonstrate that, whether or not the French referendum endorses Maastricht, Italy will be expected to put its house in order along the lines of the treaty.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Jian (0657 1696): "Problems in the Three </F> Kinds of Wholly and Partially Foreign-Owned Enterprises--A Look  at the FFE's `Six Problems'"]    [Text] This author recently conducted a study of the three  kinds of wholly and partially foreign-owned enterprises [or  foreign-funded enterprises, FFEs] in northern Jiangsu and  southern Jiangsu and discovered six common problems among them  which urgently need the close attention of leaders at all levels  as well as those working with the FFEs.    1. There are too many enterprises being set up but too  few actually going into production. This is a fairly common  phenomenon in the course of developing FFEs. Often after an  enterprise is approved, both the Chinese and the foreign sides  cannot come through with the capital funds; sometimes the  Chinese side has the money, but the other side does not, or  sometimes both sides have part of the money, but the amount  falls far short of what is stipulated in the contract, so that  the enterprise cannot open as scheduled. Consequently, there are  many FFEs that exist in name only or are only "half-baked"  companies, and ultimately, they become a burden for both sides.  Sometimes the foreign businesses change their minds; they lose  confidence in their investments. For example, a certain city  approved the setting up of 85 FFEs, but the actual start-up rate  was only 17 percent, and only 6 actually put any effort into  construction and installation; the rest are still in a  semi-suspended state.    2. The contracts count on substantial foreign capital  while little is actually available. Today many localities  treat their contracted amount of foreign capital as their  "precious babies." They brag about them whenever they have a  chance. Some even treat them as a great accomplishment and put  them in their reports. Little do they know that the success rate  of utilizing the contracted foreign capital is actually very  low, and sometimes no money will come through at all. For  example, in 1990, a certain county signed a contract worth $30  million with a foreign business. Today, only $150,000 have come  through. This writer has learned that the foreign business has  already cancelled the investment plan. The contracted amount of  foreign capital at best only reflects a trend as we make  contacts with the outside world. Today most foreign businesses  make their investments in the form of equipment purchases on  behalf of the Chinese side. The FFEs rarely make direct use of  foreign capital. For example, a certain city has been listed as  an open city by the State Council back in 1987. Up to the end of  November of this year, it had $85 million in foreign capital  available on contract, but only $6.4 million have come through  so far, and 80 percent of that investment were in the form of  equipment purchased by foreign businesses on behalf of the  Chinese side.    3. There is ample designed, but little actual,  productive capacity. Today's FFEs generally have limited  productive capacity. Their output value is usually only around  20 percent of their designed capacity. Most operate only  intermittently or are in a trial production stage and cannot  engage in batch production. Some cannot begin production because  they have brought in substandard equipment. For example, the  FFEs in a certain township have a total investment of $350  million. At a 1:2 input-output ratio, their output value should  reach $700 million, and even at a 1:1 ratio, they should be able  to produce $350 million's worth of goods. But today, their  output value is only a little over $50 million. Looking at the  14 enterprises already in operation, all but two are operating  at below capacity; some are in a state of "shock." Their  profitability is unpredictable: Only one is making a profit, and  the rest are barely breaking even.    4. There are too many low-to-intermediate grade  projects and too few advanced, delicate, state-of-the-art  projects. Looking at the types of projects undertaken by  the FFEs, most are light industrial and textile projects or  labor-intensive type projects. There are few mechanical,  electronic, or delicate chemical industry-type projects, and  most of their products are in short supply. For example, up to  the end of November of this year, a certain county has set up 15  departments, and the towns and townships have also set up 21  departments, in the FFEs, and there are more than 100 projects  of all types, but not one is a technology-intensive,  state-of-the-art project.    5. A lot of foreign equipment are being brought in but  there are few advanced equipment to help make them work.  The success rate of most equipment brought into this country by  foreign businesses on our behalf is low; most do not meet  contract specifications. Sometimes the parts do not fit--we  either have "a horse pulling a wheelbarrow" or "a pony pulling a  big trailer," and therefore enterprises cannot go into operation  on time. Sometimes the equipment is obsolete, with standards  dating back to the 1950's and 1960's by Chinese standards or  even the 1940's and 1950's compared to international standards.  Some are just "scrap metal" welded together; some are not  designed for use around here because of our production methods  and therefore cannot function properly. For example, a certain  enterprise spent $800,000 and asked a foreign business concern  to bring in a set of equipment from somewhere, but according to  the Commodities Inspection Administration the equipment had  standards dated back to the 1940's. It had no automatic or  safety features; it did not even have transmission and required  a manually installed gear box. It was appraised to be worth  $100,000 at the most.    6. Most enterprises still use the old set of management  methods and few have adopted the latest management  techniques.    Today most FFEs are directly managed by the Chinese side,  and even though a handful of them have foreign representatives  taking part in management, they are mainly for the purpose of  supervising us and tend to overlook, either intentionally or  unintentionally, the importance of studying and bringing in  foreign advanced management techniques. Most enterprises still  continue to use the old piece-work pay system and have not  learned the kinds of approach that show concern and care for the  staff and workers or try to improve workers' benefit and  welfare; but when it comes to other people's seldom-applied  method of deducting wages and penalizing and firing workers, we  not only have learned but are quick to apply those rules.    The above six conditions have serious consequences and are  dangerous. They waste resources, render a lot of funds in  disuse, dampen the foreign investors' enthusiasm, and undermine  the confidence of some units and leaders in doing a good job  with the FFEs, and meanwhile, some bad companies have become  heavy burdens to the local economies. The main reason for all  these lies in our guiding ideology that is too impatient for  quick success and produces haphazard--calling every feathered  object a duck--behavior. When it comes to selecting equipment,  we blindly trust the middlemen, which has resulted in failures  in our import endeavors. In utilizing enterprise personnel, we  lack a scientific attitude, which has resulted in errors in the  enterprise construction and operation processes. With respect to  fund utilization, we fail to follow through to the end, so that  after a project is started, it often runs into difficulties.  Thus, in the future, when we develop FFEs, we should insist on a  development route that emphasize both intensive and extensive  reproduction. We must revolve around the "three rates and one  increase" (raising the foreign capital realization rate, the  business start-up rate, and the production completion rate, and  increase the total use of foreign capital); we must concentrate  on what is important, provide different guidance under different  conditions, seize the critical points, and push the FFEs'  development onto a higher plane.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Spar Aerospace making shift into commercial products Spar Aerospace, best known as Canada's space company, is making a determined shift into commercial products, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. 'We are not leaving the space business,' Mr John MacNaughton, president, told the annual meeting in Toronto, 'but we can raise margins significantly by concentrating more on satellite-based communications and remote sensing systems.' This means Spar will move away from the design and manufacture of satellites, robotic and aviation systems, towards integrated communications and information systems, he said. Recent acquisitions were designed to speed the process. Space-related business will be down to less than 50 per cent of Spar's revenues by 1996. Spar's first-quarter net profits slipped to CDollars 2.9m or 22 cents a share, from CDollars 3m or 26 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 116m against CDollars 104m.</p>

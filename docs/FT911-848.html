			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Labour clash with Tories on taxation: Kinnock speech provokes fierce battle of claims and counter-claims THE FIERCE political dispute over tax and spending policy gathered pace yesterday as senior Tory ministers poured scorn on Mr Neil Kinnock's claim that economic growth and a freeze on tax rates would generate Pounds 20bn in revenue for better social services. While Conservatives dismissed the Labour leader's projections of a 2 1/2 per cent a year growth rate as unrealistically optimistic, he charged that a new tax-cutting Tory government would be forced to axe spending on social services. Meanwhile, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, warned in a speech in London to the Royal Institute of Public Administration that the Tory target of cutting basic rate tax to 20p would mean Pounds 29bn in lost revenues over a five-year parliament. As the political temperature rose, speculation that a June election could not yet be entirely ruled out re-emerged with the release of Tory figures claiming its local election losses still indicated a narrow 20-seat majority at a general election. The prospect was dismissed by senior ministers, who said that, even with a good result at next week's Monmouth by-election, the earliest date would be in the autumn. The tax-cuts-versus-services row began after Labour officials on Tuesday released highlights of a keynote lecture on the party's social policies, delivered by Mr Kinnock to a Community Care Journal annual conference in London last night. In the speech, the Labour leader attacked the Tories for reiterating their promise to reduce tax. 'A government cannot raise standards of public services which are currently underfunded and at the same time cut taxation,' he said. 'And a government which pledges tax reductions must say just what essential services are to be cut to pay for them.' In their place he pledged that Labour would maintain the real value of tax allowances and 'keeping tax rates where they are, an average growth rate in the economy of 2.5 per cent will generate Pounds 20bn of revenue for the Exchequer'. This had already provoked a flurry of counter claims from the Tories, with Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary, saying Labour governments were incapable of producing such growth rates. Speaking in Monmouth, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, cast doubt on Labour's spending plans while indicating that the Conservatives did not necessarily guarantee to cut tax to 20p in the course of a single parliament.

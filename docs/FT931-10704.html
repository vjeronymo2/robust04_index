			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Night walks in winter - Practical Traveller MY FIRST experience of winter walking was in the mountains above the small Swiss town of Lenzerheide, 17 kilometres south of Chur, where the tourist office has produced a map of the 35km of forest paths kept open during winter months. The sun shone and the air was crisp. The only sound was our own footsteps. There were stops for hot chocolate in mountain cafes and, in the evenings, the spectacle of 'full moon skiing' - instructors skiing down the mountains carrying flaming torches. Several companies are offering UK winter walking holidays. Some, involving small groups, offer guides; others allow you to walk independently but have accommodation arranged. Acorn Activities (tel: 0432-357335), in Hereford, offers guided walks in the Wye valley and the Black mountains. Prices vary according to farmhouse or hotel accommodation. Alternative Cornish Holidays (tel: 0841-540147) runs independent walking holidays along the north Cornish coast from Bude to Bedruthan Steps, where huge breakers come crashing up the wide beaches (Pounds 255 a week). Several local councils have produced books listing guided walks in their areas. Some of the walks are free, for others you pay a charge of Pounds 1 or Pounds 2. Exploring Sussex (Pounds 1), for example, from East Sussex County Council (tel: 0273-481654) lists 336 circular weekday and weekend walks and cycle rides. For those who like to walk on their own and return to the comfort of a luxury country house hotel and a gourmet meal, there is Congham Hall, a Georgian manor house near Kings Lynn, Norfolk (0485-600250). Maps for local walks are supplied and the owners are happy to pick up exhausted walkers at the end of the day and return them to the same spot the next. The 17th century, 15-bedroomed Cotswold House Hotel in Chipping Campden (0386-84033) has the Cotswold Way (90 miles to Bath) starting on its doorstep. And Seckford Hall at Woodbridge in Suffolk (0394-785678), where Queen Elizabeth I is said to have held court, has beautiful panelled rooms, low-beamed ceilings, carved doors and a swimming pool in a courtyard barn. Further afield, Explore (0252-319448) takes walkers to the Taurus mountains and the Berber villages of Morocco; the Ramblers Association (0707-331133) visits Madeira, the Himalayas and the Hawaiian islands; and you can explore Argentina with Waymark Holidays (0753-516477). If you fancy walking by night rather than day, Bavaria has the answer: take a guided walk in the snow with torches to light the way and mulled wine at the end of the journey.

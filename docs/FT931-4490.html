			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Olivetti joins communicator group OLIVETTI, Europe's largest maker of personal computers, is to become the European partner in an international strategic alliance seeking to exploit the nascent market for 'personal communicators' - pocket telephones with inbuilt fax and computing capabilities. The company is taking an equity stake in EO, a Silicon Valley start-up company which is marketing personal communicators in the US. The other members of the alliance are AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, Matsushita of Japan, the world's leading consumer electronics company, and Marubeni, a leading Japanese trading company. Each member of the alliance has invested about Dollars 10m in EO. The alliance has been seeking a European business partner since late last year when it announced availability in the US of its first personal communicators which combine the functions of a cellular telephone, facsimile machine and pen-operated computer. The device communicates over digital radio telephone circuits which are already available in the US and will be operational in the UK and Europe later this year. EO communicators cost between Dollars 1,999 and Dollars 3,299 in the US; UK pricing has not yet been announced but is likely to be about Pounds 1,500 (Dollars 2,168) for a basic model. Mr Corrado Passera, Olivetti managing director, said it was a small investment for Olivetti in a market expected to grow explosively. World demand has been estimated at 1m customers next year, growing to 100m by 2000, equivalent to Dollars 20bn in annual hardware sales.</p>

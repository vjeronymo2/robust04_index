			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pharmaceuticals behind advance at Sumitomo STRONG pharmaceuticals sales helped Sumitomo Chemical to a 28 per cent increase in consolidated profits before tax in the year ended December, the company reported yesterday. However, on an unconsolidated basis, pre-tax profits fell 63.6 per cent to Y8.9bn (Dollars 74.1m), the third successive annual decline. Overall unconsolidated sales fell by 11 per cent to Y624bn. Sales of basic chemicals, which account for about 60 per cent of overall sales, fell by 13.4 per cent. Aluminium sales dropped by 21.1 per cent. Sumitomo Chemical's consolidated income before tax rose to Y40.2bn from Y31.2bn. Net income fell by 19 per cent to Y16.3bn. Net sales fell by 6 per cent to Y1,018bn. However, a 19 per cent drop in basic chemicals, mainly petrochemicals supplied to the rest of Japanese manufacturing, was largely offset by a 8 per cent growth in sales of speciality chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Operating income was marginally lower at Y53.7bn, compared with Y54.2bn the year before. The growth of the comp-any's speciality chemicals division was mainly due to a 21 per cent growth in sales of its pharmaceuticals. Sales of fine chemicals were also up largely through supplies to other pharmaceuticals producers.</p>

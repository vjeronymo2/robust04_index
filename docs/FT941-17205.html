			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / India rejects Pakistan's attempt to link bilateral dialogue India yesterday rejected Pakistan's attempt to link bilateral dialogue to a change in New Delhi's stand on the Kashmir issue and cautioned Pakistan that this might cause a delay in settling other bilateral problems such as the Siachen glacier, the demarcation of a maritime boundary in the Sir Creek area, nuclear non-proliferation, and stabilisation along the line of control between the two countries, Shiraz Sidvha reports from New Delhi. Mr JN Dixit, India's foreign secretary, told a press conference yesterday that a stalemate on the Kashmir issue had not been broken during talks with Pakistani officials which concluded in Islamabad on Monday. Indo-Pakistan relations could not be viewed through the prism of the Kashmir issue alone, he said, and India was prepared to continue bilateral discussions as long as no pre-conditions were set. Mr Dixit said India had earlier planned to send proposals within two weeks which could result in the resolution of almost all outstanding issues between the two countries. These might be delayed, with Islamabad virtually rejecting India's proposal to hold the next round of foreign secretary-level talks in four months.</p>

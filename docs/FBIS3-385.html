			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty by </F> unidentified correspondent in Geneva; date not given--recorded;  in English with superimposed translation into Portuguese]    [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Which countries provide  aid to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola]? Is South Africa directly involved?    [Chikoty] Yes, we know that South Africa continues to deny  that. As you know, recently there was a court case involving  three South African pilots accused of ferrying weapons from  South Africa to Angola in 1993. That confirms what we have been  saying all along.    We also know that there is an important logistical base in  Zaire. It is headed by Colonel (Karizer). You should know that  I was also a UNITA member. Col. (Karizer) lives in Kinshasa,  and he supervises all the logistical aid earmarked for UNITA  camps. Basically, all neighboring countries -- namely, Namibia,  Botswana, and Zambia have revealed that in 1993 a considerable  number of aircraft from South Africa overflew their territories  and landed in southern and eastern Angola. Now the aircraft  land in Zaire and then proceed to Angola.    So, as you can see Zaire and South Africa are involved in  the  dispute. UNITA enjoys a great deal of assistance. UNITA has  offices in the United States, Portugal, England, and France. We  do not know what form of assistance they get from the  governments of those countries, though we think there is a  degree of tolerance.    We believe UNITA has become a terrorist organization now  that  elections have been held in Angola. There is no justification  for the claim that UNITA is fighting communism in Angola and for  human rights and democracy. We believe the cold war is over.  The only way of assisting Angola's democratic development is to  stop the war. One cannot allow UNITA to destroy everything and  kill innocent people.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Dresdner's 13% rise in line with forecasts DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second biggest bank, yesterday became the last of the country's 'big five' banks to report a healthy rise in profits for last year. Dresdner's total operating profits - which include a contribution from own-account trading - rose by 13.1 per cent to DM2.81bn (Dollars 1.74bn), in line with analysts' expectations. The results follow a 7 per cent increase in Deutsche Bank's operating profits, a 20 per cent increase at Commerzbank, and high rates of growth at Bayerische Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank. Mr Wolfgang Roller, who next month will step down as chief executive, said that in the first two months of the current year profits were 'slightly ahead' of the high level of January and February last year. Mr Roller said provisions against bad and doubtful debts had increased substantially over the course of the last year. Dresdner's figures were driven by a 7.4 per cent increase in net interest income which rose DM399m to DM5.79bn. Reflecting lively securities business, net commission income climbed 16 per cent to DM2.3bn. Operating expenses rose by 9.6 per cent. Mr Roller said the bank reduced its loans to problem countries from DM5.5bn in 1991 to DM4.5bn last year, with DM3.4bn provided for. Provisions for loans to the former Soviet Union were increased from 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the total. Net earnings rose DM314m to DM966m, an increase of 48 per cent, of which DM466m was transferred to reserves. This figure includes loan-loss provisions against what the bank called 'the unsatisfactory risk situation over the broad range of lending business'. None of the banks give a figure for loan provisioning, as is allowed under German accounting rules, but disclosure will have to be made in the current year figures under a new European Community accounting directive. Mr Roller said the clear priority for last year had been to increase provisions over transfers to reserves and dividend payment: for that reason the bank was paying an unchanged dividend of DM12 per share. Earlier this week the bank announced a two-for-19 rights issue at DM350 per share, which will raise DM1.4bn.</p>

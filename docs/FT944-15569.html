			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Endorsing a growing manufacturing reputation When the world's 18th-largest company opted to spend Pounds 450m on extending its Cleveland factories, it gave a further vote of confidence in the quality of British manufacturing. The activities of Samsung, South Korea's biggest industrial group, range from semiconductors, electronic watches and computers to shipbuilding, heavy engineering, petrochemicals and medical equipment. In the past month NEC, the Japanese electronics giant, Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics company and Philips of Holland have all announced further investment in their UK manufacturing operations, chiefly in the areas of semiconductors, television picture tubes and white goods. In addition, Mr Phillip Samper, president of the computer division of Sun Microsystems, the US workstation manufacturer, said the quality of portable computers produced by Sun's Scottish plant was on a par with any other manufacturing region. Samsung is following this pattern. The company's expansion corresponds with its stated corporate strategy which is to concentrate investment in promising sectors of international industry rather than weakening its thrust by over-diversification. Mr Chan Bea, managing director of Samsung Electronics in the UK, said manufacturing in Europe would also avoid regulatory problems with the European Commission. The company has been in the UK for 10 years. Its sales have grown 100 per cent since 1989. It markets microwave ovens, television sets, portable audio systems and midi systems as well as facsimile machines, computer monitors, printers and typewriters. It already manufactures 700,000 television sets a year on Teesside for export to Europe. Mr Bea pointed out the proximity of Cleveland to Scotland's Silicon Valley where there are a host of computer companies which could become customers for Samsung's products. Further afield the market is also buoyant. More than half the personal computers sold throughout Europe are manufactured in the UK. About 10.3m machines worth about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.6bn) were shipped to Europe in 1993. A recent Economist study suggested demand was set for double-digit growth. It said: 'Business in the 1990s cannot compete without the efficiency and technology provided by computers . . . the massive price reductions of the past two years have played a vital part in promoting continued growth in the sale of PCs.' The picture for microwave ovens is less clear-cut. While the number of first-time buyers is continually replenished, it is becoming a replacement market. The UK is reckoned to be ahead of the rest of Europe, however. Almost 90 per cent of European households have a washing machine, but only about 33 per cent have microwave ovens. Samsung's decision to move its European headquarters to the UK underscores its decision to centralise European servicing operations at Telford. The company believes that only eight key electronics brands will survive the next decade. Its decision to expand in the UK and in Europe is a key element in its strategy to be one of the survivors.</p>

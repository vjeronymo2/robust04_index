			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canadian cement group sharply reduces its losses St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, sharply reduced its losses in 1993. The group said it expects to be profitable for all of 1994, benefiting from a stronger Ontario market and better prices in Canada and the north-eastern US. Sales rose by 8.6 per cent to CDollars 507m (USDollars 378m) in 1993, helped by higher spot market sales, while the loss was cut to CDollars 7.8m, or 20 cents a share, compared with a deficit for 1992 of CDollars 39.9m, or 94 cents. In the final quarter of 1993, St Lawrence showed a profit of CDollars 2m, or 4 cents a share against a loss of CDollars 18.2m, or 43 cents (after a special provision), a year earlier. Sales advanced by 6 per cent to CDollars 144m. The company, which is controlled by the Swiss-based Holderbank group, said it would reap the full benefits of cost reductions and asset restructuring in 1994-95.</p>

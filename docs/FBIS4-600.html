			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] would strengthen the Natal/kwaZulu emergency  regulations, the TEC decided on Tuesday [12 April]. The effect  of the additions to the emergency regulations would be to  empower the Independent Electoral Commission to conduct  elections in the territory in the face of kwaZulu government and  Inkatha Freedom Party opposition to the poll.    TEC delegate and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo  introduced a resolution which he said would remove the element  of discretion from the kwaZulu authorities in deciding on what  facilities it would make available for the elections. He said  the kwaZulu government could not be allowed to exercise its  discretion because it had not displayed goodwill towards the  elections.    The exact nature of the additions to the regulations was  left  to the TEC's structures to decide.    Mr Slovo said the new regulations would empower the  Independent Electoral Commission further.    TEC Chairman Dawie de Villiers said in a briefing after the  TEC meeting that the purpose of the new regulations was to  promote an atmosphere conducive to the elections.    The new regulations would be released on Wednesday.</p>

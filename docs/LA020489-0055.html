			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALES, NOT FEMALES, SHOULD MAKE AN ISSUE OF THE SWIMSUIT ISSUES  </P> <P> A tip of my Alan Alda MASH cap to Mike Downey for showing the courage to take  on those so-called "sports" magazines and their sexist swimsuit issues.  </P> <P> Who knows the devastation caused to the sports world by these misguided  magazines? I can't begin to describe the disappointment I feel when I turn the  page and get a picture of Kim Alexis running on the beach in a bikini. . . .  </P> <P> If he wants to be a magazine critic, Downey should switch to the Calendar  section.  </P> <P> BILL MILLER  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

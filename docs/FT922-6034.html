			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Mountleigh It is not entirely clear why the banks should have pulled the plug on Mountleigh, as opposed to any of the other walking wounded in the UK property sector. The lenders, to be sure, already have their hands on most of the available security, and have no obvious incentive to throw Pounds 56m of good money after potentially obstreperous bondholders. Mountleigh, though, is hardly unique in this respect. Perhaps in the end patience simply ran out with a company whose conspicuous extravagance had become a symbol of the late 1980s and whose top-heavy 14 man board was disparagingly but aptly described by one small shareholder at the last annual meeting as a football team with three reserves. Judging by the market's calm reaction to the news yesterday, it may be that the wider implications are indeed slight. After all, everyone knew that Mountleigh's assets had to be sold to repay its debts: all that has happened is that the administrator rather than the company will now get on with the task. The problem with this cosy theory is that the timetable for disposals will now presumably be that much tighter, the risk being that today's forced sellers ultimately become the market. With very few signs of a pick-up in demand vendors in the commercial property sector may prove to be behaving as unrealistically as home owners throughout most of last year. The banks have to balance the cost of further rescues against the damage to confidence and the impact on their balance sheets of letting other companies go bust. It is a delicate and dangerous game.</p>

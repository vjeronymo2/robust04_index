			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Elf shares priced at FFr385 for sell-off Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday announced a price of FFr385 per share for the public offer of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is the largest company to be privatised so far in the programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. The offer price, which was largely in line with forecasts, compares with yesterday's closing price of FFr430. Industry analysts said they expected healthy demand from individual investors, who have until February 10 to buy or confirm existing orders for shares. In line with previous privatisations, the largest single tranche of shares - 33.21m, with a possible clawback from institutional investors  - will be allocated to individual investors. The price for the 27.17m shares to be offered to institutional investors is being set through a process of book-building. The price for this tranche, which will be above that offered to individuals, will be set on February 14. In the case of oversubscription from individual investors, the institutional allocation can be reduced by up to 20 per cent. Elf employees and former employees will be offered 6.7m shares. In addition to the other tranches, 22m shares will be reserved for a core of long-term stable investors in the group. These are six French industrial and financial groups - the insurance companies, Axa and Union des Assurances de Paris, the banks, BNP, Credit Agricole, and Paribas, and Renault, the state-owned car group. The sale of most of the state's 51 per cent stake, which values Elf at just under FFr100bn (Dollars 17bn), is expected to raise about FFr33bn. Net profits fell last year, from FFr6.2bn in 1992 to FFr1.1bn. But most industry observers expect the privatisation will be a success, pointing to the large discount from the current market price and the potential for improved profits. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Night of errors THE Royal National Theatre's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by the French Canadian, Robert Lepage, ought to be retitled Bottom in the Underworld or Nightmare in Hades. The company plays the full Shakespeare text, if not the verse, but any other connection with the original is tenuous. Lepage has said that there is no reason why the dream should be assumed to be a happy one and, even on a conventional reading, it has its nightmarish aspects. Here, however, we go for the extremes, not the subtleties. There is not a tree, let alone a wood, in sight; the only flowers are those brought by Puck to administer his spells. The setting is something out of Dante: a huge underground swamp in which fairies crawl, everyone else wades and around which the lovers jog. The swamp, although only about three inches deep, is a tremendous technical achievement. Those sitting in the front two rows of the stalls are given protective clothing to guard against the splashing, and one of the wonders of the production is how the water does not drip through the boards. The daily laundry bill for the mud-covered cast must be enormous. One of the principal props is a bedstead. The lovers are asleep on it at the start. It is punted around the swamp as though this were purgatory. Then it reappears in various modes. When Titania finally makes love to Bottom, the lovers are lying curled up in the water beneath it. At the end, the bedstead, still in the water, serves as the precarious stage on which Bottom and his fellow workmen give their play. There is a great deal of athleticism, as one would expect from Lepage. In the Dream the great physical feats come from Angela Laurier's Puck. She does a circus-like aerial spinning act while putting a girdle round the earth in 40 minutes and spends much of her time upside down. Instead of giving Bottom an ass's head, she twines her legs round his neck with her feet sticking out looking likes ass's ears - a pose which is only abandoned when Titania gets round to ravishing him. Apart from Hades, there is a touch of the east. Hippolyta looks like an Asian queen, the servants are distinctly Indian and when the lights go up beyond the swamp, the background is eastern. Some Indonesian music, though including western instruments, has been especially devised for the play. So much for the novelties: the question is whether they work. On one level, the answer is yes. After all, this is the National Theatre, which has so much talent and so many resources that it could get away with playing Twelfth Night backwards. On the more rational level, however, the answer is no. The production makes a travesty of the play. Whether dream, nightmare or a mixture of both, the piece is plainly set in midsummer. But there is no midsummer in the world of Lepage. The fairies might well be seen as somewhat sinister, but they are not primeval creatures crawling out of a swamp. Why else are they called Peaseblossom and Mustardseed? When Bottom asks for the honey bag, you reflect only that that is the last thing he is likely to get in these nether regions. Some readers may regard the Dream as a comedy, and it is true that it is such a funny play that not even Lepage can extinguish all the laughs. Yet his Bottom, played by Timothy Spall, is a sad figure, more frightened than puzzled by his transformation, more in danger of going mad than into ecstasy. A few of the errors are more elementary. For instance, when Hermia and Helena have their first quarrel, Demetrius and Lysander go in for a wrestling match in the swamp. This distracts attention from the dialogue, and indeed such carelessness with the words is a general tendency. The emphasis on spectacle leads to some excessively slow playing. Once you have the swamp on stage you can't get it off again, even when it has ceased to be relevant. Those who admire the Dream for the beauty of its language as well as its comedy are likely to be disappointed. The case for this production is simply curiosity to see something different.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Shigenobu Kishimoto, Yokohama National </F> University]    [Text] When exports threaten the very existence of a  trading partner's industrial sector, they are clearly excessive.  Excessive exports are the cause of Japan's trade surplus. As  Professor Kishimoto argues, a nation with a bulging trade  surplus virtually invites excessive imports, in the end becoming  completely dependent on imports to maintain its standard of  living.  <H5>  Excessive Export Threshold </H5>   I believe that Japan's bloated trade surplus is caused by  excessive exports, and that any plan to reduce this surplus must  include export restraints. This assertion applies not only to  our trade surplus with the United States but with Europe as well.    Two objections arise immediately. How exactly are exports  "excessive"? In comparison to what? And if these "excessive"  exports were to be curbed, would it not put an end to the  continuing expansion of world trade?    Let me respond. First, the argument that exports are  "excessive" in comparison to imports assumes that exports should  be largely counterbalanced by imports. I nstead of addressing  the relative problem of whether exports are too high or imports  too low, I believe that we should arrive at a judgment based on  a more fundamental standard.    I propose the following standard: Japanese exports should  not  be allowed to threaten the existence of key industries in our  trading partners. If, for example, the viability of the U.S.  automotive industry were threatened by exports of Japanese  automobiles, I would argue that these exports were excessive.  Here we are not simply talking about a mere loss of market  share, but a threat to the very existence of an entire industry.  It is only natural that such exports generate strong opposition  from threatened industries in our trading partners.    Exports soared because Japanese industry long enjoyed  comparative advantages in terms of quality and price. For this  reason, I believe that the problem is not a matter of exports  being too high or too low. Based on my proposed standard,  however, I would conclude that Japanese exports are indeed  excessive. I will explain why in a moment.    As for the second objection, the argument that world trade  would constrict if Japan were to curb exports is based on the  inflated assumption that Japan is somehow the engine of global  trade expansion. In fact, world trade would probably grow faster  if Japan were to make way for other nations to expand.    My ideas have been described as "autistic." In other words,  I  have been accused of adopting an extremely passive attitude,  bowing sheepishly and waiting for the problem to pass us by. My  detractors charge that I have failed to address the issue of  economic development. I believe they are mistaken.    It would be great if there were latitude for an expansion in  world trade. However, there will be no room for growth until  Japan ends its overbearing presence in the world economy.  <H5>  Import Expansion Argument Wrong </H5>   I am opposed to the argument that Japan is importing too  little, which is another way of saying that if Japan only  imported more it would reduce its overall trade surplus.    Our huge bilateral trade surplus with the United States is  the result of the fact that exports to the United States far  exceed imports from the United States. U.S. imports of Japanese  manufactured goods surpass our imports of U.S. manufactured  goods by an even greater margin.    In per capita terms, however, U.S. imports of Japanese  products and Japanese imports of U.S. products are roughly even.    If one were to insist that bilateral trade between the  United  States and Japan be balanced, we would have to consume nearly  twice as many U.S. imported goods per capita in monetary terms  than vice versa. That would be virtually impossible to achieve.  Because the break-even point has been attained on a per capita  basis, I have a hunch that imports have reached a ceiling.    At the conclusion of the most recent round of comprehensive  trade talks between the United States and Japan, Assistant  Secretary of Commerce Joan Spero issued a terse statement. She  said that Japan spent only 3.1 percent of its GNP on imports of  manufactured goods, less than half the G-7 average of 6.6  percent (excluding Japan). This level, she insisted, was  unacceptable to the United States.    However, in addition to manufactured goods Japan purchases  large amounts of agricultural produce from the United States,  including wheat, soybeans, meat, and citrus fruits. Japan has  only 30 percent self-sufficiency in these foodstuffs. If Japan  were to attempt to meet Ms. Spero's demands, it would have to  purchase more agricultural products in addition to manufactured  goods. In order to reach bilateral trade parity, Japanese  purchases of U.S. products would have to increase by more than  double the current level.    Thus, we have the argument that Japan cannot stimulate  domestic consumption enough to meet American demands. If imports  were increased to these levels, domestic consumption would fall.    If I were to purchase a foreign automobile, a domestic  automobile would not be sold. Domestic demand would therefore  decrease. In other words, I believe that we have reached a stage  at which boosting imports and stimulating domestic demand is a  zero sum game.    Economic theory, moreover, instructs us that increased  imports do not necessarily lead to decreased surpluses. This  assertion is validated by empirical laws and historical  experience.    If Japan attempts to expand imports beyond what is currently  possible, domestic demand for certain products will fall. This  will force manufacturers to attempt to sell these unsold  products overseas . Thus, exports will rise. In the end, this  mechanism may lead to an even larger trade surplus.    Because Japan is resource-poor, it has to import raw  materials and energy. In order to import these essentials, it  has to earn foreign exchange by exporting. As has often been  stated in the past, this is no doubt how Japan developed as a  modern nation.    However, Japan currently earns far more foreign exchange  through exports than it needs. This is what I mean by  "excessive" exports. As a result of excessive exports, we now  face the problem of excessive imports.    Take, for example, the recent uproar over the rice issue.  Although Japan is small, the lands from the Kanto plain  southward are some of the best in the world for paddy-field rice  cultivation. However, these lands are not being used to grow  rice. Instead, we have attempted to cultivate rice in the less  suitable colder regions of Tohoku and Hokkaido where yields are  lower. Now, we are forced to consider purchasing foreign rice.  However, to purchase this foreign rice we need to earn foreign  exchange through exports.    If Japan were to become self-sufficient in rice by growing  more of it in the temperate regions of the country, we would not  have to earn as much foreign exchange. Thus, we would be able to  construct a more harmonious global trading order.  <H5>  Surplus Utility Theory Wrong </H5>   Last year, the following argument became popular among  influential economists and bureaucrats: "The Japanese current  account surplus is caused by the fact that domestic savings far  exceed investments; thus the idea that the Japanese ma rket is  closed to outsiders is macroeconomically incorrect." These  economists and bureaucrats advocate a long-term "surplus utility  theory." I believe this theory is wrong.    The economic behavior of households and companies takes into  account a variety of factors. When economists base their  calculations on categories called "savings" and "investments,"  the result is that Japan has an excessive savings rate. The  implication is that an economic mechanism exists which  determines that Japan has an excessive savings rate. When  economists base their calculations on categories called  "imports" and "exports," the result is that Japan has an  excessive current account surplus. These results are believed to  be produced by the same economic mechanism. However, this does  not mean that it has been theoretically established that the  so-called excessive savings rate is the cause of the current  account surplus.    Even if a cause-and-effect relationship did exist, couldn't  we ignore it altogether and just reduce our trade surplus?    A trade surplus is not always desirable, even in the case of  Japan. Currently, Japan is amassing dollars and  dollar-denominated assets as part of its trade surplus. As the  yen appreciates on account of this surplus, these accumulated  dollar-denominated assets gradually lose value. This extremely  inefficient process feeds on itself.    Currently, Japan has a huge trade surplus with the world.  Practically every nation has a trade deficit with Japan. These  nations, overburdened by this trade deficit with Japan, are  drained of foreign exchange. In other words, they are deprived  of purchasing power.    The United States, guarantor of the world's dominant  currency, issues paper dollars to finance its trade deficit with  Japan. This action naturally produces global inflation.    Japan continues year after year to amass huge trade  surpluses. This causes severe disruptions of the world economy.  For the sake of the world economy, this must come to an end.    The pros and cons of a trade surplus have been discussed at  length elsewhere. It has been argued that the trade surplus and  current account surplus are reinvested in the world economy,  increasing global financial liquidity. This argument resembles  the surplus utility theory. Unfortunately, it inverts the cause  and effect relationship. While a decrease in global financial  liquidity is certainly undesirable, so is Japanese domination of  global finances. If Japanese behavior creates a liquidity  shortage, it is naturally up to Japan to provide financing.  However, we should not accept the notion that if Japan breaks  the bones of its trading partners it ought to play a role in  mending them.    What I am saying is different from criticizing the Japanese  government for encouraging exports to the United States through  unfair practices such as subsidies and dumping, and for  restricting imports through tariff and nontariff barriers. The  United States is to blame for its own trade deficit. Japan  accounts for only half of the U.S. trade deficit with the world.  Nevertheless, I believe that we should still consider ways to  reduce our bilateral trade surplus with the United States for  our own sake.    The huge overall U.S. trade deficit is the result of a  significant deterioration in its bilateral balance of payments  with most of its trading partners. It would be a mistake to  attribute the problem exclusively to Japan.  <H5>  Curbing Exports </H5>   In reducing Japan's surplus, it will be necessary to curb  exports. In order to curb exports, it will be necessary to  curtail domestic industrial overcapacity.    Industrial capacity was increased not to meet domestic  demand  but to export to overseas markets. This capacity was expanded to  the point where it threatened the very existence of entire  industries in these overseas markets. This overinvestment has  placed Japan in a serious quandary.    Unless they find a way to absorb more foreign manufactured  goods, Japanese corporations will fail to recover their  profitability. This is what caused the problem of excessive  exports.    The current industrial overcapacity was caused by the  behavioral pattern of Japanese corporations which compete  fiercely against each other for market share. At the root of the  problem is a simple question: Why were some of these  corporations still involved in manufacturing ? In the absence of  a comprehensive corporate strategy, they merely pursued  increased market share by default. The founders of these  corporations were by nature goal-oriented. Over time, however,  these corporations lost sight of practical business goals and  production targets. They continued to manufacture out of force  of habit, seeking merely to expand market share.    Why then do these corporations continue to manufacture? At  one time they were locked in a battle for survival, but as  markets have matured they have settled into trench warfare. They  take and retake the same stretch of terrain from each other.    Even though they suffer from overinvestment in plant and  equipment, Japanese corporations continue with business as  usual. They become excited about every new innovative product  they develop and invest heavily in it. But they have gone to  extremes. A bit of soul-searching is in order. This kind of  behavior is all too human. Instead of attempting to fix blame,  we should be forgiving.    My export restriction theory has come under attack with the  onset of the recession. If the automobile industry were to  curtail exports in the midst of a domestic slowdown, it is  argued, automobile production capacity would be needlessly  squandered. However, I do not believe this would necessarily be  true. Export restriction, in fact, would be a means to prevent  further economic deterioration.    It can be argued, for example, that U.S. automobile  manufacturers continue to suffer from the onslaught of Japanese  automobile exports. In order to curtail automobile exports, the  Japanese Government could use voluntary export restraints and  export tariffs. A 100-percent export tariff would raise the  price of Japanese cars in the United States, thus having the  effect of curtailing exports.    With a 100-percent export tariff, a car which retails for  1.3  million yen in Japan would sell for 2.6 million yen in the  United States. The 1.3 million yen export tariff would be paid  by American consumers, but would go to the Japanese Government.    Let's say that sales of Japanese automobiles in the United  States fell by 1 million units as a result of the 100-percent  tariff. The Japanese automobile industry would sustain a big  hit. However, those 1 million cars would, in effect, be  purchased by the Japanese Government. In other words, the  Japanese Government should use the export tariff revenue to  place orders with Japanese automobile companies. The purchase of  standard prod uction vehicles is one possibility, but the  purchase of expensive special vehicles which cost several  million yen is another.    As I have mentioned in earlier proposals, Setagaya ward in  Tokyo owns only two special vehicles for transporting the infirm  and elderly. With my proposal we could realize a goal of 100  special vehicles per every several hundred thousand people. This  is but one example of how we could convert exports into domestic  demand.    It is possible to convert excessive exports into domestic  demand. In so doing, we could bring an economy suffering from  reckless over-investment to a soft landing.  <H5>  Eve of U.S.-Japan Trade Reversal </H5>   There is something else we should not forget. We are on the  verge of a great reversal in U.S.-Japanese trade relations, even  as our trade surplus with the United States reaches a record  $150 billion dollars.    This may seem paradoxical to many, but I was predicting this  situation seven or eight years ago. The yen has continued to  appreciate along with our expanding trade and current account  surpluses. As a result, cheaper foreign goods are slowly  changing consumer behavior in Japan. With the exception of some  regions, imports have grown dramatically. If this pattern  continues , Japan will soon become a "completely import  dependent country" (CIDC).    If this happens, the yen will begin to depreciate vis-a-vis  the dollar because Japan will no longer be a net exporter.  Manufactured goods will be purchased from offshore facilities  owned by Japanese corporations, and almost all agricultural  goods will be imported from abroad.    When this occurs, currencies depreciate. Since CIDC's are  profitable to global producers, CIDC currencies become cheaper.  Thus, the Japanese currency will once again lose value. This is  my scenario for the U.S.-Japan economic reversal.    I have a hunch that we are too optimistic about import  expansion. For example, many in the financial community believe  that both our cost of living and standard of living will improve  without wage increases because of cheap agricultural imports.  With wage increases in check many expect a revival in Japanese  competitiveness, but I think it is highly unlikely.    It is because we are on the verge of a great reversal that  the yen is so high. I believe there is a possibility of the  dollar dropping below the 100-yen level to the 90-yen mark. This  will intensify the outward migration of Japanese corporations.    Until recently, Japan earned most of its foreign exchange  from four industries: automobiles, consumer electronics, general  machine tools, and steel. With the exception of a few product  lines, most of these industries will move production offshore.  The export industries which generated the huge surpluses will  disappear from Japan. Dependence on agricultural imports,  however, will continue. We are setting record trade surpluses  because we are in the final stage as an exporter.    However, the record trade surplus does not mean that Japan  is  strong. Japan's clay feet are already crumbling. Japan, however,  still appears to be a giant because of these clay feet. Thus,  Japan bashing has ironically become more intense. Japan is  passing through a very paradoxical phase.    In order to avoid this scenario, we must undertake  "emergency  evasive maneuvers."    For example, consumers should make a clear "declaration of  intent" to eat only Japanese rice except in times of emergency.  It would then only be a matter of time before we reached  self-sufficiency in rice. If the world thinks we are foolish for  eating expensive Japanese rice instead of cheap American or Thai  rice, we should remain unfazed. We should not base our  purchasing decision exclusively on price.    Industries continue to move offshore. If this trend  continues  unabated, it would be a tragedy. However, it may be too late to  prevent even key industries from leaving. For this reason, we  will have to develop new industries.</p>

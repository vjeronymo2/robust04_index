			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Edmund Szot: "Old Farm Machinery Is Selling, New </F> Is Not"]    [Text] Polish producers of farm machinery assured us for  many years that they were not afraid of foreign competition. The  farm machines produced in the West, they said, are on average  two to three times more expensive than ours, and the slightly  cheaper machines from the East are two to three times worse than  ours.    The possibility of importing used machines from the West was  forgotten. They are generally much cheaper than the Polish  machines, and the quality of materials used in them is equal to  ours, as are their operating advantages. What happens,  therefore, is that a farmer buys a machine that is already  several years old but figures that, on his small farm, the  machine will still work for 10 or perhaps even more years. The  effects of this kind of thinking are felt most by the producers  of combine-harvesters.    Last year Polish farmers bought 2,101 used  combine-harvesters  in the West, while, during this same period, the Plock factory  was able to sell only 195 "Bisons." It is said that three times  more farm trailers and beet harvesters were imported than were  sold domestically. In other types of farm machinery, the effect  of import was not as great; nevertheless, it was not looked upon  with joy by domestic producers. For example, last year farmers  bought the following equipment abroad: 374 spraying machines,  1,800 plows, 247 cultivators, 570 harrows, 229 sowing machines,  186 planters, 199 fertilizer spreaders, 510 presses for  gathering hay and straw, 783 combines and diggers for gathering  potatoes, 332 root toppers and combines for gathering beets, 14  manure spreaders, 3,023 farm trailers, 468 minitractors, and  3,340 tractors. And, although the above figures include both new  and used equipment, one can guess that most of these machines  have already done their job for the bauer [German word for  farmer] and are now helping the farmer in Poland do his  work--because the imported machines come mainly from West  Germany. Import from Austria, second on this list, is several  times smaller.    The import of this used farm machinery is causing Polish  producers a great deal of trouble. Union members in the farm  equipment factories recently protested against it, and the  Ministry of Agriculture and Food Management is also looking at  it with displeasure. In the past, it supported the attempts to  protect domestic production of tractors, and today the import of  tractors of the type produced by "Ursus" carries a 35-percent  duty (on the import of others, the duty is 15 percent).    There is only a 6-percent border tax on the import of used  farm machines, which is too small an impediment. And so other  methods of halting or limiting the import of used machines are  being sought. A requirement to obtain a so-called energy  certificate has been instituted, and now there are plans to  require possession of a "B" symbol, which machines that fulfill  Polish work-safety requirements receive.    "There is a proposal that the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Cooperation request the Tribunal in The Hague to halt the sale  to Poland of used combine-harvesters, says Jerzy Szymanski,  deputy director of the department of land management and  countryside infrastructure in the Ministry, but, after a year,  the situation will return to its previous state anyway.</p>

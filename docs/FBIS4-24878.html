			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese trade minister  today urged Japan to implement as early as possible its planned  fourth package of yen loans to China through official  development assistance, so as to help China with its shift to a  market economy.    Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, made the request during a 15-minute meeting with  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutoma Hata in the Japanese Diet  (parliament) building, a Chinese trade official said.    The official quoted Wu as saying that yen loans had played a  vital role in developing the Chinese economy and in boosting  Japanese investment in China since 1979, when Japan began to  implement its first package of loans to China.    Hata, who met Wu last November in Seattle, said that Japan  should try to develop long-term relations with China based on  repentance for its wartime invasion of its neighbor,    He mentioned former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's  remarks  about the war that have been roundly condemned by Japan's Asian  neighbors.    Nagano resigned in early May after saying that the 1937  Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an  aggressor during World War II.    The prime minister also hailed the "rapid increase" in  bilateral trade, the volume of which reached some 39 billion  U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 54 percent over 1992.    Wu, who arrived here on Tuesday [31 May], is on a week-long  visit to Japan at the invitation of the minister of  international trade and industry. She is also leading a  ten-member delegation to the regular conference on investment  between China and Japan.</p>

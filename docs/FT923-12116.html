			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian farmers switch from jute in search for profit FARMERS IN India and Bangladesh are no longer finding the raw jute prices remunerative. As a result, they may progressively switch to paddy cultivation, according to the Dhaka based International Jute Organisation. Already Thai farmers are moving out of production of kenaf, a jute-like fibre, as cassava, the competing crop is giving a 'significantly' better return, says the organisation. The area under kenaf in Thailand fell to a 27-year low of 312,800 acres in 1991-92. Meanwhile the IJO fears that jute output in India and Bangladesh, the two largest producers, will suffer a setback in the current year because of inadequate rainfall. Last year, world production declined to 3.5m tonnes from 3.64m tonnes in 1990-91. While the Indian crop remained unchanged at 1.62m tonnes, that of Bangladesh declined to 948,600 tonnes from 954,000 tonnes. China produced a lower crop of 650,000 tonnes, compared with 726,000 tonnes in 1990-91. The Thai kenaf production fell by 15,000 tonnes to 166,000 tonnes but Nepal reported a 3,000-tonne increase in production to 19,000 tonnes. In spite of the anticipated setback in the jute crop in Bangladesh, supplies are expected to be sufficient to meet the domestic requirement of 3.3m bales (180 kg each) and allow export of anything up to 2m bales. This is because the country opened the current jute season this month with stocks of 1.46m bales. Bangladesh is the largest exporter of jute and jute goods in the world. India, which opened the 1992-93 season with huge stocks of about 3m bales, compared with 1.6m bales a year earlier, will also sail through comfortably. But the Indian mills that are producing fine jute yarn and cloth for the world market will have to import high grade fibre.</p>

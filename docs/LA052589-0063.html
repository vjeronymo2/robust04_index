			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TALKS RESUME IN TEACHERS' STRIKE; END MAY BE IN SIGHT  </P> <P> With signs pointing toward a possible settlement, talks stretched from  Wednesday afternoon into early today in an effort to bring the eight-day-old  Los Angeles teachers' strike to an end and restore labor peace in the nation's  second-largest school district.  </P> <P> In his most optimistic statement yet, teacher union President Wayne Johnson  said he hoped "we can get movement today and settle this thing. I don't think  we are that far apart."  </P> <P> Describing herself as "cautiously optimistic," school board President Roberta  Weintraub said she was "just very hopeful that we will go into this bargaining  session and emerge with a contract. . . . I hope we have conciliation rather  than confrontation." Weintraub declined, however, to give details on what her  side would propose.  </P> <P> According to Johnson, the last sticking point before the strike can be resolved  is the issue of restoring pay docked during job actions, such as withholding  grades.  </P> <P> Teams of three officials from each side entered the Westin Bonaventure Hotel  downtown about 3 p.m. for talks under the supervision of a state mediator. The  school board and the union's board of directors were put on call to quickly  review a proposed settlement.  </P> <P> Both sides attributed the newly upbeat mood to their trip to Sacramento on  Tuesday and assurances from state legislators there that the district was to  receive at least $40 million in extra state funds this fiscal year. However,  still up in the air is how much of that money can be designated for salaries.  </P> <P> According to Johnson, legislators "brought a sense of realism" to the  situation. He particularly praised Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)  with helping defray tempers. On Monday, the district and union swapped barbs  about their respective bargaining positions and a quick resumption of  negotiations appeared unlikely.  </P> <P> Weintraub said Wednesday that she hoped schools could be back to normal as soon  as today. However, the union was planning for a possible ratification vote at a  noon meeting today at the Sports Arena, which would keep teachers out of the  classrooms until at least Friday even if a settlement is reached.  </P> <P> In the days leading up to Wednesday's bargaining session, there had been some  misdemeanor arrests and sporadic incidents of unruliness. On Wednesday, one of  the most serious incidents occurred when a striking teacher at Andrew Carnegie  Junior High School in Carson was arrested and held on suspicion of assault with  a deadly weapon when he allegedly threw a rock at a car crossing a picket line  and hit a 12-year-old student. A spokesman for the county sheriff said teacher  David Torgersrud, 30, of San Pedro, was being held with bail set at $5,000. The  girl was treated at a hospital for cuts and then released.  </P> <P> School police said two other teachers were arrested in less serious incidents  Wednesday, one of them for attempted trespassing at district headquarters.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the school district asked a Superior Court judge Wednesday to  limit pickets at entrances to schools and other district property and to  prohibit other striking teachers from picketing, marching or standing within  100 yards of those areas.  </P> <P> Judge Kurt Lewin agreed to temporarily bar striking United Teachers-Los Angeles  members from blocking entrances to school sites, threatening those who cross  picket lines and disrupting classes. Lewin refused to limit the overall number  of demonstrators but did order the pickets to remain in pairs 12 feet apart.  </P> <P> "The spirit of this order is that peaceful picketing is appropriate and  necessary but that acts of vandalism and violence are not appropriate and not  parts of peaceful picketing," Lewin said. His order will remain in effect until  a June 12 hearing if the strike continues.  </P> <P> More students and teachers continued to trickle back to the classrooms  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Student attendance rose to 305,029 at morning rolls, 4,085 more than on  Tuesday, the district said. Wednesday's figure is only slightly more than half  of total enrollment.  </P> <P> The district also reported that 10,390 regular teachers were at work Wednesday,  390 more than the day before and 3,650 more than on May 15, when the strike  began. But the union says about 20,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and  counselors remain out of school.  </P> <P> Before Wednesday's session began, Johnson said the union would accept a pay  offer of a guaranteed 24% raise over three years and would be willing to  compromise on some other issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subject of Dispute  </P> <P> Whether the district ever made such a pay offer, either formally or informally,  on Sunday has been the subject of dispute.  </P> <P> Before the latest negotiating session began, district spokeswoman Diana  Munatones again emphasized that the district's current offer over three years  is 21.5% to 24%, depending on the state surplus. Although district officials  claimed they had offered the guaranteed 24% Sunday when talks broke off in  bitterness, that amount was not slated to be the first offer discussed  Wednesday, Munatones said, because the union had rejected it Sunday.  </P> <P> "There is a possibility of a hard 24%, but that possibility has to come from  the people sitting in that room," she said. "All I know is that our formal  position is a soft 24%."  </P> <P> Johnson said he was willing to compromise on the docked pay. He said he would  agree to half being paid back automatically and the rest earned back in extra  duties if the 24% was on the table. Johnson also said there was room for  compromise on the issues of the membership and power of proposed school  governing councils, which would help decide scheduling and curricula.  </P> <P> According to the district's chief negotiator, Dick Fisher, the district opposes  paying teachers the full amount of the docked wages, which are estimated to be  about $5 million, because it would encourage similar actions.  </P> <P> "It's not a question of money but whether the district should pay for a partial  strike," Fisher said. "They may still do it in the future but the district  doesn't want to reward it. To let them work it off is a big concession."  </P> <P> Johnson acknowledged that hostilities of the last few days probably have ended  a few friendships. "I don't think there is any question," he said, that school  board member Jackie Goldberg, Supt. Leonard Britton and Weintraub "hold an  intense personal dislike for me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expresses Own Feelings  </P> <P> "I will tell you honestly, I'm not crazy about them and wouldn't want to have  dinner with them. . . . So much water has gone under the bridge. But I think we  can work together on a professional level." Johnson conceded that his recent  words about district officials may have been too personal "and not enough on a  philosophical level" and said that he still regards many district officials as  "decent, reasonable" people.  </P> <P> In a related matter, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered Wednesday to mediate  the strike should it continue, an offer he made several times earlier during  the 15 months of maneuvering over the teachers' contract.  </P> <P> One of the first outward signs that a compromise could be near came about  midnight Tuesday at Gate 2 of the San Francisco Airport.  </P> <P> After missing the last flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles because the talks  with legislators had gone on longer than expected, district representatives  took a short flight from Sacramento to San Francisco, where they could make a  Los Angeles-bound flight.  </P> <P> Johnson and his aides were given a ride to the San Francisco Airport by a  security guard who was on duty at the state Capitol. The two sides met at the  gate, where Weintraub and Johnson sat back-to-back on plastic airport lounge  chairs.  </P> <P> Union official Enola Henry motioned district negotiator Fisher over to her  side. The two talked briefly about one of the issues separating the two sides.  It seemed the problem was wording of one sentence.  </P> <P> "The area of difference is so narrow," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Henry answered, "I know. Let me sleep on it. I bet I can come up with  something."  </P></p>

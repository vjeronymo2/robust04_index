			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / People: British Coal Kevan Hunt, 55, director of employee relations at British Coal, is taking over as chairman of British Coal Enterprise, the arm of the industry charged with creating new employment opportunities in former mining areas. Hunt, a member of the British Coal board, will replace John Northard, who is retiring after 50 years in the coal industry.  Hunt was a founding director of BCE in 1984 when it was launched to help staff cope with the shrinking market for coal.  In the last nine years it claims to have created 80,000 jobs.  Another of its roles is to help former employees seek work outside the industry.  Hunt said that BCE would be investing Pounds 50m in coalfield areas in the coming year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters requested HCFA's position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the penalties assessed against a provider for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failing to file its cost report electronically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that no payments will be made to a hospital unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has furnished the information requested by the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to determine the amount of payments due the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Medicare program. Section 405.371(d) provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension of Medicare payments to a hospital by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary if the hospital fails to submit a cost report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submits an incomplete cost report, or fails to furnish other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed information. Section 2409.1(A)(1) of the Provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reimbursement Manual (PRM 15&hyph;I) addresses the procedures an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary will follow when a provider fails to submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost report or when the cost report is overdue. Unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider has received a waiver from electronic cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting, the intermediary will consider a timely filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost report that is not filed electronically as an overdue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost report for purposes of section 2409.1(A)(1). We will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update this section of the manual to reflect our position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding sanctions for failure to file cost reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Cost of Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter disagreed with our statement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact analysis of the proposed rule that hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be significantly affected by electronic cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting. The commenter stated that some hospitals had to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make expensive changes in personnel or software to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the regulations and that the cost of maintaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required software was an additional burden on providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter suggested that HCFA pay providers for the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of implementing the electronic cost reporting requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the cost of equipment, software, additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel, external consultants, and any related overhead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize HCFA to subsidize any of the costs hospitals incur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in implementing electronic cost reporting. However, it does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize the waiver or delay of the implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic format in cases of financial hardship. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, if computer support required for electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting will cause financial hardship, the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may request a waiver from electronic filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Provisions of the Final Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rule with comment, we are revising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions set forth in the proposed rule. Based on public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, we are eliminating the requirement that providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file a hard copy cost report in addition to the electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file. Also based on public comment, we are adding a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (iii) to &sect;413.24(f)(4) to provide that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the electronic file, a hospital must submit hard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copies of a settlement summary, a statement of certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worksheet totals found in the electronic file, and a signed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manually prepared cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes made based on public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, we are adding a new paragraph (ii) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.24(f)(4) to provide the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All cost reporting software must be able to disclose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that changes have been made to the electronic file after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider has submitted its cost report to the intermediary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The intermediary may not alter the cost report once it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been filed by the provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The intermediary rejects any cost report that does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass all specified edits and returns it to the provider for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the above changes to the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> text, proposed &sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated as &sect;413.24(f)(4)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Collection of Information Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 413.24 of this final rule with comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains information collection and recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that are subject to review by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection and recordkeeping requirements are not effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until they have been approved by OMB. We have submitted a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copy of this final rule with comment to OMB for review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information collection requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 90 percent of hospitals participating in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare have filed electronic cost reports before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of this regulation, that is with cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These providers will now have to file a diskette containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required cost report data in a standard format. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diskette will contain input data only. We believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal time would be needed for hospitals to become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiar with the revised software furnished by their cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting vendor. The remaining 10 percent of the hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously filed manually prepared cost reports. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these hospitals will initially experience an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting burden, we believe that once they are familiar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with electronic reporting, there will no longer be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional burden and there may even be a decrease in burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the time needed to compute the cost report will no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

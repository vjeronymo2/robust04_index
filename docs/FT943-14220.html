			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jones Stroud shares fall on 23% decline Jones Stroud (Holdings) reported pre-tax profits down 23 per cent at Pounds 5.01m in the year to March 31, against Pounds 6.51m. The Nottingham-based textiles company blamed difficult trading and closure costs. The shares lost 33p to close at 270p, a new low for the year. Turnover edged up from Pounds 70.9m to Pounds 71.7m. The pre-tax figure was struck after Pounds 315,000 costs of closing the US division of Jones Stroud (Australia). Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said that some subsidiaries were reporting improved results because of reduced costs but the market for stretch yarns 'has yet to reach a satisfactory level'. This would have an adverse effect on interim results. He added that it was too early to forecast results for the year, but 'we will be very disappointed if they do not exceed those of last year'. Earnings per share came out at 19.12p (24.85p). The final dividend is being held at 5.5p for an increased total of 9p (8.8p).</p>

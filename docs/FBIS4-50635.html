			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today urged Japan to  immediately stop its attempt at developing nuclear armaments and  declare the total amount of plutonium in its possession.    A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official KOREAN  CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) today, said that the recent discovery  of 70 kilograms of plutonium -- enough to make nine nuclear  bombs -- at the nuclear fuel-making plant in Tokaimura, Japan is  a "breach of the publicly recognized international law which  must be dealt with seriously and condemned."    He said this shows Japan's "much-touted 'three non-nuclear  principles' are merely a 'screen' for stepping up its nuclear  armament to a full scale.    He criticized the noise Japan has made over the so-called  nuclear issue of the DPRK saying it was a petty trick to conceal  its own nuclear program and divert the public attention  elsewhere.    "Japan has been engaged in nuclear development over the past  decades and the amount of plutonium it has held in hiding is by  no means less than what has been discovered," said the spokesman.    He asked the secretariat of the International Atomic and  Energy Agency (IAEA) to give much attention to the question and  take necessary measures accordingly.    "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being  promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality," the  spokesman noted.    He said the Korean Government calls upon the governments of  all countries in the world, international organizations and  anti-nuke groups to exert "unbiased efforts to remove the danger  of nuclear development."</p>

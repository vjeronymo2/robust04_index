			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Gowrings back in the black Gowrings, the motor dealer and leisure group, swung from losses of Pounds 531,000 to profits of Pounds 172,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. The result was bolstered via an exceptional Pounds 170,000 credit (debit Pounds 150,000) representing a gain on the sale of a residential park in Oxfordshire. Turnover reached Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 23.5m) with the motor contribution up at Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 20.3m) helped by a 'significant' increase in new car sales. The interim is maintained at 1p from earnings of 1.62p (losses 5.9p)</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Electrical engineering output rises STRONG output by the steel and computer industries was behind the good performance by manufacturers in January highlighted in government figures released yesterday. Metals production jumped by a provisional seasonally adjusted 17 per cent between last December and the following month - mainly a result of stronger steel output following shutdowns during the Christmas break. Over the same period the output of electrical and instrument engineering including computers rose by 3.2 per cent. In the three months to the end of January, metals production was down 3.5 per cent compared with the previous three months. On the same three-monthly basis electrical and instru-ment engineering increased by 2.9 per cent, while the whole of the engineering sector saw an output rise of 0.2 per cent. Chemicals and artificial fibres showed a three-monthly increase in production of 2.7 per cent while textiles and footwear registered a 0.3 per cent rise. Between the two consecutive three-month periods output of food, drink and tobacco, and of minerals and related products recorded declines of 1.6 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively. Elsewhere in engineering, vehicles and components suffered a 5.2 per cent production decline on the same three-monthly basis. Metal and mechanical goods registered respective falls of 0.6 per cent and 0.2 per cent. In the latest three months - compared with the corresponding period a year ago - engineering production increased 0.9 per cent, while metals output fell by 7.1 per cent. Minerals and related products registered an output fall on the same basis of 5.9 per cent, and textiles, chemicals, and the food, drink and tobacco sector recorded production increases of 3.4 per cent, 1.7 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.</p>

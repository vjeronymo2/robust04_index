			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Marilut Luis O'Hara: "So long, Mr. Glassman"] </F>   [Text] Perhaps he will not receive an award for being the  best diplomat, because maybe he isn't. He ignored the rules  many times because he considered it necessary. He gave priority  to the human facet of his work. Being a foreigner, he involved  himself in internal affairs when he believed it would benefit  the people. He condemned what was condemnable, he did not hide  his annoyance over the government's arbitrary measures and,  committing the serious crime of interference, he prevented a  coup d'etat with a fierce communique, which possibly merited the  disapproval of experts in international relations.    It cannot be doubted, Mr. Glassman, that you have done a lot  more for this country than many politicians who stress that they  are fighting for the needs of the people, and yet take advantage  of them when they can.    It is a pity that he is leaving. Even at the risk of  sticking my nose into the internal affairs of your country, I  decry your government's decision to deprive us of a much valued  and honorable person who was not afraid to lose the confidence  of the Paraguayan authorities if that helped consolidate the  national process.    It would have been very significant for us for him to have  continued as head of the U.S. Embassy in these times. We  Paraguayans know that things are not going well, that there are  too many people interested in returning this country to the  past, and that it is those people who have the decisionmaking  power within the government.    Up to the present, we have only had you to confront the  power  of those persons, their lack of decency, and their arrogance.  The only hope we have now is that your successor will not  respect diplomatic rules, and yes, that he will respect  democracy, the banner that you raised so bravely.    There are very powerful sources in Paraguay that have  decided  that the country must return to the dark age of dictatorship.  We decent Paraguayans have decided not to allow this backward  step, because in this process we have taken risks, and have many  times lost too many things and dear ones, which demands from us  the final victory.    But we also need the international community to support us.  Paraguay was an island that the world ignored during the  Stroessner dictatorship. Your country supported the dictator  when this coincided with its interests. We do not want that to  occur again. Only with the help of the world's democratic  nations can we prevent a return to the dark ages, a move desired  by those who hold power today.    For this reason we need experts in diplomacy. We do not want  people who stick to the rules, to protocol. We want persons who  will stick out their necks when it is necessary to consolidate a  process that has lasted too long already and has shed so much  Paraguayan blood. We need someone like you.    There is no doubt about it: You will not receive an award as  the best diplomat, but please accept the thanks of a people who  are trying to get out of the dark, and who have mortgaged all  their efforts in order to achieve this.    Thank you, Mr. Glassman, and so long.</p>

Her mother,  Grace (who died when Ada was 8), was a newspaper columnist who fabricated some  of her best stories, the most popular of which was about her prodigy daughter:  Ada, she reported, could read and write both English and Latin by age 3 and  play violin, piano and compose music.  </P> <P> In fact, Ada is partly handicapped.  </P> <P> Her father, Reynard, a violinist for the Indianapolis Symphony, is committed to  a sanitarium by the time Ada is 16. But the early music training that he indeed  gave her finds her a place in the circus: composing and playing music on the  steam calliope.  </P> <P> Ada's memories of her past, as well as the secret that caused her to flee  Richmount, Ind., are interwoven into the narrative of circus life. An  entertaining first novel.  </P></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann hopes to make profit this year Mannesmann, the German industrial group which lost DM513m (Dollars 298m) last year, yesterday said it hoped to make a profit in 1994. Earnings at the company's mobile telephone operations have increased and cost-cutting in other divisions contributed to the improved outlook, said Mr Werner Dieter, chief executive. Sales in the first four months rose 11 per cent to DM6.4bn while orders jumped 21 per cent to DM8.4bn, up from DM6.9bn in the same period a year ago. Eight of the group's 11 divisions were growing, Mr Dieter said, although domestic demand was slight compared with improving export orders. Foreign business, including overseas subsidiaries, rose 2 per cent to 59 per cent of group turnover. Mannesmann operates D2, one of Germany's two mobile phone networks, where losses of DM224m contributed to last year's results. However, the company said the telecommunications division, which accounted for 3 per cent of group turnover, was the fastest growing unit within the company with a first-quarter turnover of DM340m, up 136 per cent on the year before. The D2 network has 580,000 clients. Orders at the company's engineering and plant division, which represents 42 per cent of group turnover, rose 37 per cent to DM4.1bn while orders at the automotive division, which accounts for 20 per cent of group turnover and last year lost DM160m, rose 19 per cent in the first four months to DM1.7bn. First-quarter turnover at the electronics and electrical engineering divisions fell 6 per cent, with Hartmann &amp; Braun unable to repeat a series of big orders which it received in the same period last year. The company shed about 8,000 workers last year, leaving it with 126,300 employees worldwide. The company said 'certain adjustments' to the workforce were still necessary but would give no figures.</p>

It is no accident that the most "drastic"  congresses of people's deputies have been in the spring. But  there are no congresses, no Supreme Soviet. But some people  constantly want to play at political crises. I admit that when  I read the now renowned "scenario no. 1" document reminiscent of  an amateurish parody of "information to consider" from  "Seventeen Moments of Spring" [television series from the  sixties, set during World War II), I was surprised that anyone  was still attaching serious importance to it.    At any Moscow get-together there will unfailingly by a  former  teacher of scientific communism who now calls himself a  political scientist. And he will buttonhole us and unfailingly  start to expand on his predictions regarding the struggle in the  Kremlin corridors and the prospects of political development in  Russia. These predictions were once so popular and well paid  that everyone from journalists to theatrical producers set about  producing them. But it emerged very soon that for all the  subtlety of some constructs they suffered a very important  shortcoming: They had only a very indirect bearing on reality.  And for that reason they are failing to come true. To make at  least some real forecast you must know at least something. In  economics, social psychology, sociology, it doesn't matter. The  press cuttings which our political scientists employ are useful  but not enough. The forecasters' market has begun to empty.    And suddenly passions are being heated over the most  commonplace political fantasy. Statements and  counterstatements, the start of an investigation, the  expectation of new and even more scandalous "scenarios," there  can be no doubt that they will appear. On the basis of the  principle: If you like it, I will draw another one. So that  what is interesting is not the document itself but the utterly  inappropriate reaction to it by some of our political elite.  And in my view the present situation in Russia was reflected to  a far greater degree in that reaction than in the document  itself.    This situation is very complex. Primarily in the economy,  where the decline of production is continuing and the crisis of  nonpayments is growing, followed by a wave of strikes. The  government and the president are faced with an extraordinarily  difficult task: selectively financing sectors of vital  importance to the state and at the same time not starting to  print unsupported money, not sliding into hyperinflation.    But for all that it is a case of complexities of a different  order from those which existed a few months ago. There is  social tension in Russia but no serious political tension can be  discerned. One very high-ranking German politician admitted to  me that, when he set off for Moscow recently, he expected to see  a city overexcited by plot rumors. In reality he was struck by  the existing stability. People do not want to go to meetings or  even to elections. And if they do nonetheless elect someone  they give their preference not to those who promise the  "delights of paradise" but to those who intend to ensure the  streets are cleaned.    Which, actually, is what a sizeable proportion of Russian  politicians seem to be trying to do in their daily practical  deeds. Chernomyrdin and Chubays, Kozyrev and Shakhray, Luzhkov  and Zaveryukha are different people who adhere to different  views. But they are united by one thing: They have to resolve  specific problems of the state's life. They are putting  together the budget and determining the priority of particular  tasks. Sometimes they make mistakes. But sometimes they also  achieve success.    Success like the talks with IMF executive director Michel  Camdessus. The point here is by no means the possibility of  obtaining $1.5 billion in systemic credit. The point is that  Western financiers, who take nothing on trust, having studied  the draft budget and analyzed the economic situation in Russia,  have reached the conclusion that the government's plans to lead  the country out of the crisis are realistic.    But nor can we fail to see something else: In this situation  the politicians who are geared toward a struggle with someone or  something, the "Storm und Drang" politicians, remain unwanted.  They were irreplaceable when the old system had to be destroyed.  But because of their lack of specific knowledge they are utterly  useless in building the Russian state. And it was they who  needed the stories about plots. Because in a situation of  mutual suspicion and intrigue they are like fish in water. I am  more than convinced that playing at plots or countering them is  an effective means of struggling against unemployment.    It is true that this is the unemployment of a quite narrow  circle of underqualified politicians and just as underqualified  experts. It was they who organized a festival for themselves  this week -- a small coup. It is merely a pity that yet again  they have taken serious people away from their work. And not  only in Russia but also beyond.    But on the other hand this type of escapism, that is a  departure from reality, is no bad thing for Russia. Of course,  it costs society a lot to maintain such politicians but they are  better off playing with their "scenarios." God forbid they try  to do something for real. On two occasions already this has  been tried by people who were threatened with idleness.  Everyone is well aware what came of it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sandrine Briclot report: "Strange Visit by Libyan </F> Minister; Victims of Bomb Attack Against UTA DC-10 Protest"]    [Excerpt] A (private) visit by Libya's foreign minister to  Paris this weekend raises pressing questions and indignation on  the part of families of victims of the bomb attack against UTA's  DC-10 in September 1989, who criticized Charles Pasqua.    What in the world was Libya's foreign minister doing in  Paris? The mystery remains 48 hours after he left France.  Although the Libyan Embassy in France and the French Foreign  Ministry vigorously state that 'Umar al-Muntasir's visit was  definitely a "private" one, his short stay in Paris is still  raising controversy. Yesterday, Interior Minister Charles  Pasqua's comment that he had not been "informed" about this  visit only added to a general feeling of skepticism. It is  indeed nothing short of incredible that the interior minister  would not be aware of the presence in Paris of a member of  Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's government. Especially in view of the  fact that Mr. al-Muntasir's visit had been scheduled at least 10  days earlier, according to both the Libyan Embassy and the  Foreign Ministry. A transit visa was issued to him by the  French Embassy in Tripoli before he left for South Africa, where  he attended Nelson Mandela's swearing in ceremonies.    Versions differ as to 'Umar al-Muntasir's time of arrival in  Paris: either very early on Sunday morning, via a South African  Airlines flight from Johannesburg, or the day before. And he  left in the afternoon of the next day [16 May] for Tripoli via  Tunis. His stay of some 30 hours, or more likely the whole  weekend, in the French capital raises some major questions:  What did he do, who did he see, what did he talk about?    It is known that 'Umar al-Muntasir stayed in the Crillon  Hotel, which often accommodates foreign ministers on an official  visit to France. First question: Who took care of the  logistics of the Libyan minister's visit? According to  "reliable sources" of AFP, that would be...Adnan al-Khaskji  [presumably al-Khashoggi], the prominent Saudi Arabian  businessman, who reportedly acted as a middleman to ensure the  informal visit took place smoothly. However, the Libyan Embassy  firmly denied al-Khaskji's involvement yesterday, stating that  it alone had made arrangements for the minister's stay. At any  rate, the embassy could hardly acknowledge any participation  from the Saudi Arabian, as it would imply that, through its  foreign minister, Libya may have been trying to negotiate some  arrangement with the Americans or with the Mossad (Israeli  intelligence service).    More prosaically, the lawyers representing the victims of  the  bomb attack against the UTA DC-10, Messrs Levy and Szpiner, are  convinced that there is a connection between Mr. al-Muntasir's  visit in Paris and the case they have been working on. The  airliner exploded in 1989 while flying over Niger, killing 170  people. The bomb was presumably planted by Libyan terrorists.    "Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has almost completed his  investigation," insisted Jean-Paul Levy; "This is why they (the  Libyans) are getting restless!" The lawyers, who were informed  about the Libyan minister's visit on Monday night, cannot see  another explanation for the successive visits to 'Umar  al-Muntasir's room in the Crillon Hotel by "Adnan al-Khaskji, by  one of the French lawyers defending the Libyans in the DC-10  affair, and by British and American businessmen." "The  pro-Libyan lobby has a lot of clout," says Mr. Levy. "We are  faced with states and international companies that are eager to  do business with Libya."    It is true indeed that 'Umar al-Muntasir had "no formal  contact" with French political figures. [passage omitted]</p>

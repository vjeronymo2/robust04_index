			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> DOUBTS INCREASE AS VALENZUELA FAILS TO CONTACT STEWARDS ABOUT ABSENCE  </P> <P> Del Mar stewards are trying to keep an open mind on Patrick Valenzuela, but his  recent disappearing act is making that increasingly difficult.  </P> <P> Valenzuela, the leading rider at Del Mar with 34 victories, was supposed to  have contacted the stewards Monday about a Wednesday meeting and subsequent  drug test. But Steward Dave Samuel said late Monday that he had not heard from  Valenzuela.  </P> <P> "His agent (Bob Meldahl) said he'd call," Samuel said. "But we don't know what  happened."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, who has not ridden since winning four races Friday, is being  questioned about calling in sick at Pimlico Saturday. He was scheduled to ride  Sunny Blossom in a $350,000 stakes race, but complained of a stomach virus and  missed his eight mounts.  </P> <P> Samuel said that Valenzuela, who still has a 10-victory lead in the jockey  race, should still be able to ride Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Presuming we're satisfied with his answers, he'll ride Wednesday," Samuel  said. "We really feel he hasn't done anything."  </P> <P> Last October, Valenzuela tested positive for cocaine and was suspended for 60  days.  </P> <P> Eighty days after suffering broken legs and a broken arm at Hollywood Park,  jockey Chris McCarron is scheduled to ride in the fifth and sixth races  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Scotty McClellan, McCarron's agent, said there is still a slight possibility,  however, that doctors will not clear McCarron.  </P> <P> "He was waiting on the X-rays (Monday night) just to make sure everything  checked out OK," McClellan said. "But Chris feels great and he's ready to go."  </P> <P> McClellan said he finds it hard to believe than his client is ready to ride  again.  </P> <P> "I saw the X-rays on the (left thigh bone) and I thought five or six months,  easy," he said.  </P> <P> But McCarron's doctors were able to insert a screw in the center of the bone,  allowing McCarron to put pressure on it and not let the leg atrophy. McCarron's  right leg healed on its own.  </P> <P> McClellan said his client will ride two horses each Thursday and Friday, then  will take three or four mounts on Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> "We're concentrating on the better horses in the better races," McClellan said.  "You have a better chance of getting hurt with cheaper races."  </P> <P> Jockey Laffit Pincay was suspended for five racing days for his actions in  Sunday's Del Mar Derby. While riding Tight Spot, stewards ruled that Pincay  crossed over sharply after the start, causing interference. As a result, Tight  Spot was dropped from first to 10th.  </P> <P> The suspension does not include certain designated races. Therefore, Pincay  will be allowed to ride in Saturday's $300,000 Cabrillo Handicap.  </P> <P> Ron McAnally, trainer of Tight Spot, will file a protest against the ruling  that gave Itsallgreektome the victory in the Del Mar Derby.  </P> <P> Monday was a day of upsets. Masai Chief, an 87-1 shot ridden by Christine  Davenport, won the second race. The $177.40 payoff was the biggest at Del Mar  since More Influence paid $212.40 on Aug. 22, 1974. The biggest payoff at Del  Mar was $263.40 by Cipria in 1955.  </P> <P> In the sixth race, Gold Fleece, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, paid $41.80.  </P> <P> Davenport's victory was her first of the meeting and marked her first time in  the money. Last year at Del Mar, she rode two winners.  </P></p>

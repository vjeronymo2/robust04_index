			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Air of mystery around utility pay packages: British Gas's defence of its executive salaries Confusion, as well as condemnation, greeted the news of pay rises of up to 75 per cent awarded to the top directors of British Gas. Attempts to get an overall view of the salary changes have so far been frustrated by a lack of detailed information. British Gas attempted to paint the pay rises as compensation for a shake-up in the executives' perks and pay structure, as well as bringing their pay up to the level of comparable companies. The company said that the increases were part of a pay restructuring that involved shorter contracts, the abolition of annual bonuses and the replacement of a share option scheme with a long-term incentive plan. It added: 'They have gained something. They have lost something. There is an element of compensation in there.' But this argument was marred by British Gas's inability to give details of its new long-term incentive plan, which will pay bonuses related to British Gas's performance compared with other companies in the FT-SE 100 index. The company said: 'We will just have to wait for the package to be unveiled next year.' Depending on its size and performance criteria, the long-term incentive plan could substantially increase the salaries of the British Gas executives. According to New Bridge Street Consultants, a pay consultancy, the long-term incentive plans that have already been introduced in 76 big companies typically give a maximum annual award worth between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of salary. British Gas said the introduction of a long-term incentive scheme in place of an annual bonus and share options would help make managers 'perform on a long-term view'. Compensation consultants were critical about British Gas's decision to abolish annual bonuses while increasing basic pay. Mr Brian Friedman, head of compensation and benefits at Arthur Andersen, said: 'I would say it was counter trend. The trend is towards more bonuses and less basic pay.' The existence of an annual cash bonus allowed the company to cut pay levels in bad years, he pointed out. Consultants were less critical of the decision to set the new levels of basic pay received by British Gas directors by making comparisons with the median salary paid in 30 big international companies such as BP, British Telecommunications, Glaxo and Grand Metropolitan. Mr Friedman said: 'For a company of that size the absolute pay level does not look out of line.' Mr Mark Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants, said, however, that choosing a peer group of companies to make such a comparison involved 'a great element of subjectivity'. Consultants said it was unusual for both chairman and chief executive to receive such high salaries. Mr Richard Giordano, as non-executive chairman, will receive Pounds 450,000 while Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, will receive Pounds 475,000. Several aspects of the British Gas scheme are considered to be forward-looking by pay consultants. Among big companies, Reuters, Courtaulds and GEC have announced plans to scrap share option schemes, which are often viewed as depending on a flawed link between share price and performance. There is a growing trend for companies to put directors on shorter contracts and give greater details about their remuneration. In the case of British Gas the promise of greater disclosure does not extend to disclosing the name of the consultants which advised the remuneration committee.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Euro Disney rights priced at top of forecast Euro Disney, the leisure group, has secured shareholders' agreement for a FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) emergency financial restructuring package and announced details of FFr6bn rights issue offering seven new shares at FFr10 each for every two existing shares. The company's share price fell FFr3.50 to FFr33 immediately after the announcement, which was accompanied by news of a decline in attendance and expenditure at the EuroDisneyland theme park in the first half of this year. The shares recovered to close 90 centimes down at FFr35.60. The rights issue, which marked the final stage of Euro Disney's intricate rescue negotiations, was priced at the upper end of expectations. Observers had anticipated a price of between FFr5 and FFr10 until last week's deal when Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, the Saudi investor, offered to sub-underwrite the issue. 'Prince al-Waleed's arrival on the scene must have made Euro Disney more confident in its pricing,' said Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, analyst at Morgan Stanley. The size of the prince's eventual stake will be determined by investors' response to the rights issue. He has offered to buy any surplus shares left after the issue and is entitled to acquire up to 13 per cent from Walt Disney, the US group which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. However his eventual stake must be under 24.5 per cent. Euro Disney, which last month reported a reduced net loss of FFr1.06bn for the six months to March 31, from FFr4.34bn, yesterday cautioned that trading conditions had been difficult so far this year. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said the group anticipate a reduced loss for the second half. However last year's FFr5.3bn net loss was inflated by restructuring costs. Attendance at EuroDisneyland fell 6 per cent to 3.13m in the first half of this financial year and expenditure per guest was 7 per cent lower at FFr229. The declines reflected the pressures of the European recession and the French franc's strength against the pound, lire and peseta. These problems have persisted into the second half. Euro Disney does not expect to move back into profit at least until 1995/96. This prompted the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market watchdog, to include a routine warning in the rights issue prospectus.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: France seeks higher fish price floor FRANCE WILL today ask the European Commission's fisheries council meeting in Brussels for a 30 per cent increase in the minimum prices imposed on fish imports and for the suspension of imports of Russian cod. Mr Charles Josselin, the French secretary of state for fish, announced these proposals at yesterday morning's cabinet meeting in Paris. He said he also planned to press the fisheries council to extend the minimum pricing system to cover more types of fish. However, Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister, said that what was needed was to ensure that the current minimum import price regime was enforced properly. Meanwhile French fishermen, who have for the past few weeks staged stormy demonstrations against the increase in imports, stepped up the pressure on the government on the eve of the Brussels meeting with a series of violent protests throughout France. More than 10,000 fishermen and their families marched in silence through the streets of Quimper in Brittany carrying banners emblazoned with the slogans 'Do something. We're dying' and 'Fish in Distress'. The march ended with a rowdy demonstration outside police headquarters when fishermen pelted the building with missiles and rotting fish. Riot police fired tear gas pellets at more than 800 militant fishermen in Nantes following a violent scuffle, in which protesters bombarded the police with stones, bottles and other makeshift missiles. Seven policemen were injured in the violence. There were also clashes in southern France. Riot police used tear gas to try to calm a crowd of angry fishermen demonstrating in the old port of Marseilles. A policemen was seriously injured in a clash with fishermen at Bayonne when he was hit on the head by a missile. Protest marches in Nimes and Montpellier ended with fishermen unleashing cargoes of fish outside the town halls. In Bourdeaux fishermen handed out free fish to passers-by during a peaceful demonstration. The import problem is imposing intense financial pressure on the French fishing industry. Credit Maritime Mutuel, the bank specialising in the fish trade, yesterday called on the government to take action to alleviate the financial problems now hitting many businesses. Mr Curry, who met fishermen from Humberside in Brussels yesterday, said Russian white fish imports were still coming into the Community via Denmark and Germany. He ruled out the possibility of a total ban on Russian fish. 'We've got to be realistic,' he said. 'There's not going to be a majority in the Council to impose a flat import ban.' Instead he proposed: Effective policing of the minimum import prices set last month by the European Commission; Enforcement of hygiene rules; A re-examination of the tariffs and quotas agreed with the contries like Norway and Iceland, members of the European Free Trade Association; And a unilateral UK ban on British fishermen landing haddock and ungutted white fish, to discourage the current glut of small fish that is pulling down market prices. Last October the UK set minimum landing sizes for whiting above EC sizes, and is shortly expected to do the same with lobster.</p>

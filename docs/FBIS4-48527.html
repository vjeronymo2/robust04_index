			<p>BFN     [Text] Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] has  admitted issuing marketing permits to the South African  armaments industry to supply military equipment to Rwanda.  However, the manager of import and export at Armscor, Mr. Peet  Smith, said that this had been stopped as soon as the civil war  had started. He said the Rwandan Government had decided last  year to standardize the country's military equipment and to buy  only South African products.</p>

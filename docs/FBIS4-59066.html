			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "call"] </F>   [Text] O lofty and honorable Yemeni people, pride and glory  are yours because you are the makers of great deeds and glories.  You have our greetings, love, loyalty, and all heroic  sacrifices since you represent the origin, right, and the source  of all that is good and all powers. O dear steadfast people,  you have our thanks and appreciation, because your Armed Forces  achieved continuous victories against the elements of apostasy,  rebellion, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] for  the sake of foiling the plan of hostility to the people, which  is aimed at destroying the homeland, and of checking the  intrigue of sabotaging the constitutional institutions in the  country. Congratulations to you and to all the sons of our  people in all the governorates of the republic, in Sanaa, Aden,  Sa'dah, Abyan, Ta'izz, Lahij, al-Bayda', Hajjah, al-Maharah,  al-Jawf, al-Hudaydah, Hadhramaut, Ma'rib, Shabwah, and all over  Yemen. Congratulations to you on the victories of unity,  freedom, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. You have our  heartfelt greetings and thanks in all positions, on coasts, in  valleys, and on mountains while you are supporting your  legitimate leadership, constitutional institutions, and valiant  Armed Forces in the battle of unity and fate, the battle of  defending unity, freedom, and democracy, the battle of existence  and fate, and the battle of defending unity, freedom, justice,  and equality.    Greetings and appreciation to your gigantic Army, which is  fulfilling the pledge to safeguard unity and democracy through  its confrontation with the tyrannical secessionists in the YSP  and their attempts to ignite the military situation and to  foment sedition for the sake of achieving their personal  purposes and fragmenting the homeland and undermining the  people's unity. The army of unity and democracy confronted  treachery and aggression and performed its sacred duties so as  to uproot all the secessionist and traitorous fortifications and  to destroy them one stronghold after another. Your army is, at  this moment, on the brink of crushing with its confident mighty  hand the secessionists' wicked fortifications by besieging their  dens with cordons of fire. It will write with its hands on the  gates of free Aden the true and profound meaning of freedom  after this freedom has been abused for the past 30 years under  the coercion and repression of the party's dictatorship and its  theory of rancor against the people and all its classes, which  have lived under all woes of humiliation, fear, and death under  the policies, conflicts, and massacres of the unjust  secessionist clique. We address the members of this clique:  You may turn to the right and turn to the left, but you will  always find behind you the angry sea with roaring waves that  will toss you asunder, and in front of you the army of the state  and the people, the army of wisdom and faith, whose battalions  and brigades are devouring you.    O treacherous secessionists, remnants of the collapsing red  communism, whichever way you turn your face and no matter what  cloak of deception and trickery you try, no one will trust you  because you have never trusted anyone. You have not even  trusted each other. You did not trust the fortress of unity,  the giant revolutionary and historic achievement that you sought  to be a part of. Those who are conspiring against fate and the  people for their selfish and personal interests and ambitions,  will only reap ignominy and defeat. It has become clear that  the red star fluttering above your heads, with which you have  decorated the walls of your houses and camps, remains vivid  evidence of your rancor, infidelity, sinfulness, and  disobedience.    You, brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and  soldiers  in the military units under the control of the secessionist  clique, must join the army of unity, freedom, and democracy, as  some of your brothers did in 'Imran, Dhamar, Yarim, Sanaa,  Abyan, Shabwah, and in the Aden Governorate. This is so that  your loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, and  constitutional legitimacy. This is especially important since  this loyalty constitutes the course of safeguarding your life  and the blood of your comrades-in-arms, through which you will  restore your prestige and position in life and in the Armed  Forces. Then you may return to your honorable position of  defending the unity and democracy in the battles of defending  right, freedom, unity, democracy, and of safeguarding the  sanctity of constitutional legitimacy.    Here are the dens of treason and the strongholds of the  secessionists, collapsing before the soldiers who have faith in  God and the homeland, and in unity and democracy. Do not be  late in joining the ranks of the advancing forces of unity and  legitimacy so that you will have the honor to triumph with them,  for the will of the people, and so that you may safeguard  history, which is now back on its true course after the  achievement of unity and of fortifying it with democracy. Let  the people be above all parties and have the upper hand. Let  their interests be above all interests, selfishness, and  parochial party policies, God willing.</p>

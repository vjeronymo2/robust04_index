			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Poetry in painting IT IS too easy, in reactionary and fogeyish times, for the critic to give the impression that he is against all art that is difficult, openly experimental, avant-garde, simply because it is, well, difficult, experimental . . .But two concurrent exhibitions in the same building afford some countervailing encouragement and relief. Hamish Fulton, with uncharacteristic long-windedness, calls his latest exhibition at Annely Juda 'only art resulting from the experience of individual walks', but we should not be put off. Here again are the photographic works that marry image to text. And here are the drawings: the mountain silhouettes, again with allusive and evocative texts; and the texts that are the entire work, the letter-forms painted directly on the wall. It all sounds conventional enough, and within its particular modernist orthodoxy. Fulton is not the only artist to present work of this kind, and in such a way; like his sometime fellow-student and travelling companion, Richard Long, he derives his work from the walks he takes - which might be the far wilderness or the domestic countryside, the far side of the world or no farther than the Home Counties. The conceptual proposition is that the walk itself, set to a rigorous, self-imposed programme - 'no talking for seven days', for example, or 'fourteen days walking, fourteen nights camping', or 'a continuous 106 mile walk without sleep' - constitutes a work of art in itself, an act defined and realised, a palpable line, albeit instantly ephemeral, traced across the surface of the earth. The work in the gallery is something quite else, resolved in its own terms, the spring of imaginative recollection or sympathetic association. Such things are easy enough to mock, but the very mocking too easily misses the point. What makes Fulton so special and distinguished in his field, as it were, is his disciplined acceptance of the rules and limitations of what he does. He makes no alterations where he goes, builds no cairns, marks out no lines,nor brings back sticks and stones to set out in circles in the gallery. He is no sculptor, though he responds acutely to the sculptural qualities he confronts in the natural world. There is no fuss, no dissimulation, no self-parade. If he called himself a poet rather than an artist, even though one of a peculiarly visual nature, he would perhaps encounter less vehement prejudice of the kind that would ask: 'what kind of art do you call that?' The poet, after all, is one who takes his path through life, with his notebook in his pocket and images in his head, his poem the distillation of his experience, his images but metaphors, the purest of conceits. Downstairs, Leon Kossoff fills Anthony d'Offay's principal gallery with a group of recent drawings, of the nude and the portrait head, and of urban landscape and architecture, most notably of Christchurch at Spitalfields. Kossoff is, with Frank Auerbach, outstanding among those figurative painters of his generation who have continued in the tradition of direct, intense and expansive expressionism, after the example of David Bomberg, who taught them in the years just after the Second World War. The mark, the intuitive gesture is all, to be trusted absolutely, a romantic commitment to canvas of immediate vision, an act of faith. But nothing in art, true art at least, is ever quite so simple and arbitrary. Beyond the surface image and the apparent flurry of marks lie repetition and reconsideration, thought, decision and start again. Was there ever an accident in art that was not contrived? To look into these rich, active and complex drawings is to begin to recognise a profound deliberation and authority. The charcoal runs across the surface just so, the pressure delicate and exact the image achieved, resolved, beautiful. Hamish Fulton: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until March 6. Leon Kossoff: Anthony d'Offay Gallery, 23 Dering Street until March 6</p>

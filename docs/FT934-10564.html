			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Futures firm fined Dollars 2m for hiding cattle trades THE US government has fined a prominent Memphis futures trading firm Dollars 2.22m for concealing the fact that it controlled huge blocks of orders in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's live cattle futures pits during most of 1991. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission stopped short of barring the company from trading, an act that analysts say could have dealt a death blow to the CME cattle contract. In an administrative complaint, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said McVean Trading and Investments, under the direction of its officers, doctored reports it sent to the CME and the CFTC to disguise the fact that it consistently controlled as much as 25 per cent of the open positions in the cattle market for a period of at least a year. The exchange and the CFTC impose strict limits on the size of any individual position in US futures markets, to avoid the danger of market manipulation. The CFTC complaint said McVean's positions were sometimes 10 times the allowable limits. The company maintained those positions by falsely reporting ownership of trades and trading accounts, both of which violate CME rules. Although the agency did not accuse McVean of market manipulation, the extremely large positions detailed in the CFTC's complaints were taken during a rally in the cattle market, and were often concentrated in contracts that were close to delivery, when volume is relatively thin. The complaint, which McVean and six of its officers and employees chose to settle without admitting or denying responsibility, highlights a dilemma facing the CME and, to a lesser extent, the CFTC. The CME detected the McVean's bogus accounting and issued a 'cease and desist' warning in February, but failed to take stronger action despite the threat these very large positions might have posed to market integrity. Barring McVean from the market could have weakened a product the exchange has been doing its best to preserve. Live cattle is the CME's biggest agricultural contract, but has gradually been losing volume. The loss of what traders call a 'major player' such as McVean would have reduced liquidity and market viability. 'I don't like to hear about these things, because I am concerned about the sanctity of the contract,' said one long-time livestock analyst. 'However, I wouldn't be happy if it forced McVean out of the market. They add volume.' The CME said only that it co-operated with the CFTC. McVean is a family-owned futures firm, which manages about Dollars 75m in customer accounts as well as its own positions. Cocoa producers called on the European Community to abandon a plan to allow more non-cocoa fat in chocolate and urged Indonesia to join production management efforts, Reuter reports from Abidjan. The head of the Cameroon delegation to the Cocoa Producers Alliance said if the EC allowed more non-cocoa fat in chocolate it could lead to a fall of 200,000 tonnes of cocoa a year in the European market.</p>

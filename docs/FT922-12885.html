			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: NY Times doubles profits A RECOVERY in advertising revenue and lower newsprint costs helped The New York Times to more than double net profits to Dollars 13.9m in the first three months of 1992. The profits rise, which translates into earnings of 18 cents per share, against 7 cents in the first quarter of 1991, was struck on revenues of Dollars 440.4m, up by 5.6 per cent. The company attributed the much higher 1992 advertising revenues in its newspaper and magazine divisions partly to the weakness experienced during the opening months of last year, when advertising in US media was generally depressed by the mood associated with the war against Iraq. Increased advertising rates also helped revenues. The flagship New York Times, together with 32 regional papers and a 50 per cent stake in the International Herald Tribune, turned in an operating profit of Dollars 32.2m in the first quarter, up sharply from Dollars 18.6m in the first quarter of 1991. The group's magazines division made an operating profit of just under Dollars 2m in the first quarter of 1992, compared with a Dollars 2.4m loss in the same period last year. The broadcasting and information services division of the group benefited from higher advertising revenues and achieved operating income of Dollars 2.9m in the opening quarter of 1992, against Dollars 2m a year ago. Net interest expenses declined to Dollars 6.5m in the first quarter, from Dollars 7.9m for the same period a year ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] The National Defense Secretariat has issued a  bulletin denying the Mexican Army's alleged participation in the  murder of three people in the area of Morelia, Altamirano,  Chiapas State.    In reply to a request made by various political and human  rights organizations that requested clarification of the  incident, the National Defense Secretariat said the Mexican Army  never carried out any action to arrest, much less to murder  these individuals, given that on 7 January there was no military  presence in the area.    The Defense Secretariat added that at the request of the  people, the Army arrested 32 individuals who had broken the law,  clarifying that this occurred five days after the armed  confrontation began. The Army turned over the 32 arrested  individuals to local authorities after a public medical  examination was made to determine their physical condition, the  bulletin concluded.</p>

The minister stressed that right now it is essential for the  Washington agreements on the autonomy of occupied territorities  to come into operation as soon as possible. Solana was  confident that in spite of this catastrophe the peace process  will not be slowed down but, on the contrary, speeded up.    Javier Solana recalled that Spain is committed to the Middle  East peace process. He added that there is no decision in the  direction of UN troops going to the occupied territories and he  mentioned the meeting which the UN Security Council will be  holding in New York this afternoon to produce a resolution or  declaration.</p>

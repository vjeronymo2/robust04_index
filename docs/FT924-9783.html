			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Trade News: New threat of trade war over oilseeds THE European Community and the US last night failed to achieve a hoped-for breakthrough in their oilseeds dispute, heightening concern that the US may announce trade sanctions and touch off a damaging trade war. The EC-US talks in Chicago had stretched into a third day in an effort to reach a deal before trade diplomats from the 105 Gatt signatories meet in Geneva today. The dispute over the EC's controversial system of oilseed subsidies is a key issue blocking agreement in the so-called Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, said the US and the EC had hit an impasse in the oilseeds talks, although they had come 'very close'. Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, said he would recommend to President Bush that the US go ahead with trade sanctions against EC foodstuffs. But Mr Madigan added he was willing to continue to meet EC officials on the issue. Mr MacSharry, too, said he was willing to have a further meeting, though none has been set. Mr Madigan said he envisaged that the US and EC could continue meeting on the oilseeds dispute even if the US announced trade sanctions, which would not take effect until 30 days later. 'We can withdraw concessions and continue to meet and I think the US would be willing to do that,' he said. The EC would have, 'no moral basis' to impose counter-sanctions, he added, as it had not suffered financial injury yet in the case. Earlier, Mr MacSharry had voiced optimistism, suggesting there was 'a deal in the making, all the pieces are there'. But in the end few new proposals emerged, and EC negotiators seemed satisfied at least to have made the gesture. Ms Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, has already prepared a list of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in sanctions. Mr Madigan said a second list might be in preparation. US farm interests expect that sanctions will be announced at today's Gatt meeting in Geneva and that talks will continue during the 30-day waiting period before the penalties become effective. US soyabean producers first filed an official complaint against the Community's oilseed subsidies programme in 1987 and twice won their case before Gatt panels. Earlier yesterday, senior EC officials said that, apart from oilseeds, the farm trade elements integral to a Uruguay Round deal were all but settled. They were hopeful of a deal including the following: The volume of subsidised exports would be cut 21 per cent over six years, rather than by the 24 per cent prescribed in the Uruguay Round 'final act'; EC compensation payments to farmers, for the price and production cuts in its reform of the CAP, would be exempt from cuts under the Round; The US would agree to a 'peace clause' undertaking to settle future trade disputes multilaterally through Gatt procedures; The US would undertake to 'prevent any surge' in exports of cheap cereals substitutes to the EC, which could undercut even the near-world market price for cereals introduced by CAP reform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Maputo, June 12 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Government will  persuade President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique to accept the  proposal put forward by the Mozambique National Resistance  (Renamo) for a government of national unity after the elections,  said Renamo leader in Washington.    According to the local newspaper "SUNDAY" today, Renamo  leader Afonso Dhlakama [name as received] said this before  winding up his visit to the United States.    He said the U.S. Government is preparing to make President  Chissano see the significance of establishing such a government  in Mozambique after the elections in coming October.    During his visit to the U.S., which began early this month,  Dhlakama also held meetings in New York with U.N.  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and some representatives  from member states of the U.N. Security Council. He said that  they are also for the proposal.    Meanwhile, Dhlakama said the U.S. Government has decided to  provide one million U.S. dollars to help enlarge the Renamo  guerrilla force into a political party.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Castro to the First International </F> Small Island Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, in  Bridgetown, Barbados, on 5 May -- recorded]    [Text] Mr. President, Your Excellencies:    The powerful are discussing the outlines of the new  partition  of the world. Poor and small countries are trying to figure out  how we are going to survive in the upcoming decades. Since we  are islands barely a few meters above sea level, we ask  ourselves: What will happen when the water level rises? Will we  be able to withstand the droughts, hurricanes, and other weather  disasters awaiting us?    It is more than an issue of our cultural and human wealth;  what is at stake is our very lives, our existence as nations. We  are not responsible for this. Others colonized and exploited us.  Consumer societies destroyed the environment; annihilated  millions of plant and animal species; poisoned the seas, rivers,  and lakes; polluted the air; saturated the atmosphere with  carbon dioxide [as heard] and other noxious gases; tore apart  the ozone layer; depleted oil, coal, natural gas, and solid  mineral deposits of enormous wealth; cut down our forests, and  ruined theirs.    What is our inheritance? Underdevelopment, poverty,  dependency, backwardness, debt, and uncertainty. What are they  talking to us about now? About sustainable development. Great.  We believe in that. To that we aspire. However, is such  development possible with immensely wealthy societies that can  survive only on the basis of continuous growth and only at the  expense of exhausting natural resources?    What do they need more wealth for? While Switzerland has a  net per capita income of $34,000; Bangladesh, with over 100  million people, and threatened with being swallowed by the sea,  has a per capita income of only $210. The chasm between the rich  and the poor grows larger everyday. Is this contrast the absurd,  irrational example given to the peoples of the Third World?    The arms race continues. The weapons trade is on the  increase. The most powerful nations sell the most weapons; they  do not mind profiting from the death of others. Why should they  care about the environment and the fact that islands are sinking  underwater? To highly developed societies, the problem is not  one of growth, but of distribution; not only of distribution  among themselves, but distribution among all. The so much  discussed sustainable development is impossible without a more  equitable distribution among all nations. There cannot be  sustainable development for a part of the world, and  underdevelopment for the rest. Whether they like or not, mankind  is today one large family and we will all meet the same fate.    Let deceitful words be used less, and let there be a change  in philosophy since such a selfish philosophy has yielded only  the catastrophes we endure today, and the worse ones we will  endure tomorrow.    Let us hoist above our islands the banners of truth. The  poorer and smaller we are, the more firm and courageous our  words should be. Let us not resign ourselves to the sad role of  those Roman gladiators who bid goodbye to their masters with the  well-known, sad phrase: Farewell Caesar, those about to die  salute you.    We ought rather to tell them: We will die if necessary, but  not as slaves. We will die proclaiming that we will fight for  our futures, that we will fight for our truth, and that our  people, children, and grandchildren also have a right to live.  Thank you very much.

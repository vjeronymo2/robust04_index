			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional background and rationale for the measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above are contained in Amendment 2, the availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 29, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (59 FR 44398).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would eliminate unnecessary language;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change the scientific names of corals to conform to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of the American Fisheries Society; add definitions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional terms; correct the address and telephone number of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Director, Southeast Region, NMFS; clarify that all coral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a habitat area of particular concern (HAPC), including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable octocoral, is prohibited coral; require identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markings on vessels in the live rock fishery; prohibit the use or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession of a toxic chemical in the EEZ; prohibit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession of coral in the Flower Garden Banks HAPC; prohibit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of dredges in the Flower Garden Banks HAPC; prohibit making a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> false statement to an authorized officer concerning the taking of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coral, coral reefs, or live rock; and prohibit interference with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an investigation, search, seizure, or disposition of seized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property in connection with enforcement of the Magnuson Act. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for identification markings and the added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions are necessary for effective enforcement of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and added management measures and would conform the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to current standards applicable to other federally-managed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southern Atlantic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS proposes to simplify the existing permitting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements. Specifically, this rule proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove the requirement for Federal permits for and reports on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking allowable octocoral that are landed in Florida and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking fish with an allowable chemical that are landed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida. Florida requires permits and reports for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, whether or not the allowable octocoral or fish are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvested in the EEZ or State waters. Currently, all but one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal permits for these activities involve landings in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida. Duplicate Federal/State permitting and reporting serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no useful purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS proposes to broaden the ban on the use of power-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assisted tools. Amendment 2 proposes to ban the use of power-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assisted tools for the taking of aquacultured live rock, wild  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> live rock in the Gulf EEZ during the phase-out period, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable octocoral. Since chipping of wild live rock would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banned in the South Atlantic EEZ during the phase-out period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power-assisted tools implicitly would be banned in the EEZ in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that area. Amendment 2 does not explicitly address prohibited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coral in either area or allowable octocoral in the South Atlantic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEZ. NMFS believes the rationale for the ban on power-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tools is equally applicable to prohibited coral and allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> octocoral throughout the EEZ_extension of the ban to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species and additional areas is necessary to enhance enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a council within 15 days of receipt of an amendment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. At this time the Secretary has not determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 2 is consistent with the national standards, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the data, views, and comments received during the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Councils prepared an FSEIS for Amendment 2 that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for public review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and comment; a notice of its availability for public comment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 days will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FSEIS, the proposed actions would benefit the natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment by phasing out activities that result in damage to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> live bottom habitat areas. Potential adverse economic impacts on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishermen would be mitigated by the harvest of aquacultured live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

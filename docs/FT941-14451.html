			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Kita takes the blame for Hanwa's big losses: The Japanese group's withdrawal from speculation Mr Shigeru Kita has resigned as president of Hanwa, the Japanese steel trading company, taking responsibility for huge investment losses in financial markets. The losses, blamed on the sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market, will result in an extraordinary write-off of Y120bn (Pounds 720m) this year and an after-tax loss forecast at Y47.2bn. This is believed to be one of the largest write-offs related to financial transactions made by any Japanese company. Hanwa said the Y1,300bn funds still invested in financial instruments would be withdrawn over three to four years, as it ceased all transactions aimed at making profits on the financial markets. It would instead concentrate on its core business of trading in steel and other products. The decision by Hanwa, whose enormous influence on the financial markets at one time earned it the nickname of 'shadow Bank of Japan', came as a stark reminder of the damage wrought by speculative financial trading. In particular, the resignation of Mr Kita, who will become a consultant to the company, marks a humiliating end for a man whose keen financial instinct once brought the company power and wealth. At its peak, speculative financial trading, known as zaitech, supported record annual pre-tax profits of Y38.4bn, of which more than 70 per cent came from non-operating profits. Mr Kita will be succeeded initially by his elder brother, Mr Jiro Kita, who is chairman. Mr Jiro Kita will resign both posts when his son, Mr Shuji Kita, a former bureaucrat with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and managing director of Hanwa, assumes the helm in the near future. Mr Takashi Iwami, vice-president, said the company's core business of trading in specialised steel products was firm, leaving its sales estimate unchanged at Y570bn. However, pre-tax profits would be Y11.7bn instead of the previously expected Y4bn as losses from financial transactions would no longer arise at the pre-tax level. The final dividend is being passed.</p>

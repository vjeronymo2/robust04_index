			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Customs launches charter MEASURES to speed up clearance through customs for people entering the UK were announced yesterday, with the publication by Customs and Excise of a Traveller's Charter. The charter sets out the standards to which customs officers will work, and promises surveys of performance. A training programme has been created to ensure that service is 'courteous and helpful'. Among moves to speed up travellers are a target of a maximum of 10 minutes waiting time to declare goods. Ministers are also arguing for an increase in the value of duty-free goods which can be imported from countries outside the EC. Observer, Page 18</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Doeflex rises 51% and seeks Pounds 1.3m for expansion DOEFLEX, a supplier of thermoplastic materials, yesterday unveiled a 51 per cent rise in interim profits, a Pounds 1.6m cash acquisition and a share placing and open offer to fund the purchase. For the six months to June 30 profits rose from Pounds 580,000 to Pounds 876,000 pre-tax from turnover 39 per cent higher at Pounds 12.9m. The directors said the growth in sales reflected in part the inclusion of Horizon Industries for the first time. Organic growth was about 11 per cent. They added that profits have yet to benefit from the inclusion of Horizon - Doeflex took a 60 per cent stake in the Belgian-based group towards the end of 1991. Earnings worked through 53 per cent ahead at 7p (4.57p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.32p to 1.6p. The acquisition is that of the Iridon technical sheet division of Lawson Mardon Group UK, primarily funded via a placing of 1.5m ordinary shares with institutions at 98p apiece to raise Pounds 1.33m net. The balance will be financed from existing banking facilities. Ordinary shareholders can apply for the new shares on the basis of one new share at 98p for every 5.67358 shares held. Doeflex shares closed 5p higher at 112p.</p>

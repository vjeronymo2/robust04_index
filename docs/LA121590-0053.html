			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. MARTIN IS BUSH CHOICE FOR LABOR SECRETARY  </P> <P> President Bush tapped outgoing Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois as his new  secretary of labor Friday, rewarding her for party loyalty in giving up her  safe Republican House seat at the urging of the White House to run an  unsuccessful campaign last month against Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.  </P> <P> Martin, 51, who was caught off guard by the timing of the announcement, is a  fiscal conservative who voted against the interests of organized labor during  most of her 10 years in Congress.  </P> <P> Her nomination received a cool reception from Lane Kirkland, president of the  AFL-CIO, who said that "her voting record has not reflected a sensitivity to  the needs of workers."  </P> <P> If confirmed by the Senate, Martin would become the Administration's principal  contact with major labor leaders. She would inherit a difficult-to-manage  department whose functions include supervision of billions of dollars in  pension funds and the enforcement of health and safety rules in the workplace.  </P> <P> The sharp-tongued lawmaker, known for her acerbic wit, was at her home in Loves  Park, Ill., after being told there would be no action this week on the labor  post. Her office said she had no prepared statement. Martin would replace  Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who was the only woman in the Bush Cabinet until she  resigned in October to head the American Red Cross.  </P> <P> Martin's closest competitor for the labor post was believed to be another  outgoing Republican congresswoman, Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, who had the strong  support of Elizabeth Dole's husband, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of  Kansas. White House sources said Bob Dole phoned John H. Sununu, Bush's chief  of staff, immediately after the Martin announcement to push Saiki for the  vacant education secretary post.  </P> <P> Lauro F. Cavazos resigned the Education Department post earlier this week after  his management skills were sharply criticized by Sununu. Saiki tried  unsuccessfully last month -- as did Martin -- to defeat a Democratic incumbent  senator.  </P> <P> Besides Saiki, other top candidates for education secretary include Lynne V.  Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities and wife of  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, now  president of Drew University, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,  president of the University of Tennessee.  </P> <P> Bush also is seeking to fill the post of Republican national chairman following  this week's announcement by former drug policy adviser William J. Bennett, the  man he had selected for it, that he was declining the position because of  ethical considerations arising from his intention to carry on a simultaneous  speaking and writing career.  </P> <P> Martin, who favors legal abortions and supported the rejected equal rights  amendment, is married to a federal judge in Chicago, Harry Leinenweber. She has  two children by her first marriage to a Rockford, Ill., businessman. She has  sponsored day-care projects and is a former high school economics and  government teacher.  </P> <P> The President made the announcement on the White House lawn before departing by  helicopter for a weekend at his Camp David retreat in the Maryland mountains.  </P> <P> Referring to Martin as "an outstanding member of Congress" who had served as  "an unofficial adviser to me," Bush added: "She's a mother who knows the need  for child care." The President also commended her as "a professional" who  understands the relationship between business and labor.  </P> <P> Martin helped prepare Bush in 1984 when, as vice president, he debated the  Democratic vice presidential candidate, Geraldine A. Ferraro. She was a  national co-chairman of his presidential campaign two years ago.  </P> <P> Martin made her Senate bid this year with the help of Roger Ailes, who served  as Bush's image-maker in the 1988 presidential campaign. Critics blamed Ailes  for the bitterness of her attacks on Simon.  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human  Resources Committee, said he looked forward to holding confirmation hearings  for Martin early next year.  </P> <P> "The Department of Labor needs a strong secretary who is willing to stand up  for hard-pressed families against the constant pro-business tilt of the White  House," Kennedy said.  </P></p>

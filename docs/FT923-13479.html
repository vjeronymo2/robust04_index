			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (4): A lot of brave faces - Banking BAHRAIN's tight banking community has never been short of brave faces, nor of recent reasons to don them - not least because this community has tightened somewhat over the past few years. In the oil-booming early 1970s, when international and Arab bankers converged on the island to recycle the region's sudden petrodollar riches, 75 offshore banks made their base in Bahrain. An oil price slump and two Gulf wars later, the figure now stands at 48; and it is falling. Bahrain Arab International Bank is liquidating assets in readiness to close. Question marks hang over others - such as Kuwait Asia Bank - which have been unable yet to claw back into profit, despite huge retrenchments. Other small Bahraini Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) which have returned to the black have done so modestly, and some, such as Bahrain Middle East Bank, are energetically putting down roots overseas. Some have slimmed their operations down to a very bare minimum. The emirate's contraction as a banking centre is as much a natural consequence of the region's banking and economic evolution as any response to the series of political shocks which have buffeted the region - most recently, of course, the Gulf war, which shattered confidence in the OBUs and sliced their net assets to a record low of just over Dollars 48bn. (They have since recovered to Dollars 55bn, but remain well below 1988's record of Dollars 68bn). The honey which drew the world's bankers to Bahrain was the servicing of Saudi Arabia's sudden wealth in the 1970s; in project lending and treasury operations beyond the sophistication of the insular banks in Riyadh and Jeddah, while offering international expertise and connections to recycle petrodollars. Today, Saudi's fast-matured banks can manage all these tasks profitably and without assistance. Furthermore, the kingdom's growing domestic capital market, fuelled by the government's thirst for budget deficit finance, has reduced the need for Saudi banks to place money offshore in Bahrain. The liquidity of Saudi government instruments during the Gulf war contrasted with Bahrain's short period of banking isolation, as foreign banks ran scared and cut off lines to the island's bankers. The upshot has been to sow disarray among the smaller OBUs, as project lending, interbank markets and even a large portion of trade finance have all fallen. Much of it has moved south to Dubai, with the growth in the more southerly emirate's trade - particularly with Iran. Allied to this is the diminution of Bahrain's role as a foreign exchange market stopover between the US, European and south-east Asian markets; a role Bahrain has seen eroded by technology and the increasing overlap of trading hours between dealing centres. A second wave of closures and cutbacks among the international banks on the island is therefore under way, following that of the mid-1980s, occasioned by the bad debts caused both by the oil price slump and intemperate Latin American and other sovereign lending. A concomitant of this is to leave the field more profitably open for some of those banks which have survived. As a rule, the best placed of these are banks either with strong shareholder support, with a clearly defined market niche or with a head office overseas prepared to retain a commitment to the area. Of the locally-incorporated OBUs, three in particular stand out: Gulf International Bank (GIB), Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) and Investcorp. They have always been the strongest performing trio on the island. None has been immune from the recent shocks, although Investcorp, which plugs the wealth of 'high net worth' Gulf locals into direct investments in the US and Europe, has been affected more by depressed markets there than by shocks in the Gulf. Its net profits last year shrank to Dollars 52.2m from Dollars 66.3m - but 1991 was the bank's second best year. Neither GIB nor ABC survived the Gulf war without losses, but both returned to the black in 1991, with GIB turning around a loss of Dollars 422m, after restructuring, into profits in 1991 of Dollars 46.5m. ABC steered from a loss of Dollars 91m to pretax profits of Dollars 45m. GIB has undergone the most convulsions, having shed a large tranche of what included (its managers now admit) some very good assets to stay liquid during the crisis. It has cut staff by a quarter and trimmed costs by Dollars 17m a year, to Dollars 40m. To shake off its awkward Iraqi shareholding, the other bank's other six owners, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Abu Dhabi Investment Fund, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, this year approved the bank's takeover by the Gulf Investment Corporation - in turn owned by the Gulf Co-operation Council states, which injected Dollars 450m to recapitalise the bank after GIB's original shares were written off. Thus restructured, Mr Peter Sura, the bank's assistant general manager, is predicting 'a very good year' for GIB, based particularly on the bank's potential pickings in regional syndicated lending for the numerous oil, gas and power projects, along with corporate lending to the buoyant Saudi private sector and strong local trade and treasury work. Mr Abdulla Saudi, ABC's president and chief executive, has led the bank overseas in search of profitable growth; in 1991 it established ABC International to consolidate its large European operations. ABC is now turning its attention back to the Arab world. Mr Saudi says he wants ABC to develop a retailing presence in as many Arab countries as possible; in the last 18 months, in spite of unpromising economic circumstances, he has opened seven ABC branches in Jordan. Algeria is ABC's next likely target, and, possibly, the Gulf - though Mr Saudi says he would prefer to establish a retailing operation in more than one centre at once, possibly through acquisition. Political developments in Algeria may put that project on hold. ABC and GIB are Bahrain's biggest banks, and best known internationally. They are sanguine about their immediate prospects, given the present relative buoyancy of oil prices, booming private sectors in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and the appetite among the region's governments for borrowing to fund their biggest projects. These factors are putting good business in the way of those few foreign banks, many of them American, which have retained a substantial presence in Bahrain through the thinner years. Chase Manhattan, for instance, is optimistic about the outlook for lending to government and parastatal institutions, while Citicorp retains a substantial treasury operation in Bahrain, putting Dollars 170bn through its dealing room monthly - 'I wouldn't write this place off,' says one local banker. 'There's just too much money in the region.' However optimistic these institutions are about banking prospects, Bahrain is unlikely to blossom afresh as an international banking centre. As the Gulf's - indeed, the Middle East's - banking hub, Bahrain has no immediate peer, in spite of the Saudi banks' strength and liquidity and Dubai's flourishing trade business. Neither the kingdom nor the UAE offers the strength of financial regulation offered by the Bahrain Monetary Authority (advised by the Bank of England), nor do most bankers based on the island feel that Riyadh, Abu Dhabi or Dubai can offer the same attractive mix of good communications, congenial working environment and breadth of associated financial services. But further growth in Bahrain's financial sector would seem to depend on the island's becoming the centre of a bigger, better co-ordinated and more sophisticated capital market in the Gulf. This is an ideal the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar) have long espoused, but never embraced. Bahrain's determination to foster regional developments along these lines has led it to create a new unit in the finance ministry, advised by Mr Michael Lee, a former senior director at Dean Witter Capital Markets, to promote the idea, both locally and to international bankers. 'I see opportunities everywhere,' says Mr Lee. 'The question is, whether there will eventually be a logical financial centre, or will the market place fail to come about for artificial reasons.' Two factors in particular have conspired to prevent the GCC from developing into a single capital market. One is the region's corporate culture, whereby most large enterprises are privately (and jealously) held firms; financed privately, and without any apparent desire on the part of most owners either to sell shares or to look for finance. The second is the ambition of each Gulf state to develop its own capital markets, even if such developments run defiantly against any logic of scale. Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman all have their own stock markets of varying degrees of activity. Until such sovereign pride is overcome, and a Gulf-wide capital market given a political push by the GCC, Bahrain's aspiration to become the Gulf's booming capital markets centre will remain just that.</p>

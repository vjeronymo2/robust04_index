			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sotheby's hits Dollars 19m on back of sales boost in Europe and US SOTHEBY'S Holdings, the auction house, more than doubled pre-tax profits from a recession-induced low of Dollars 9.09m to Dollars 19.1m (Pounds 12.6m), in the six months to June 30. The group is controlled by the Detroit-based Taubman family but is still quoted in London and New York. Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive officer, ascribed the profits advance both to the rise in the auction sales volume in Europe and the US and to the increase in the buyers' premium. Previously, buyers and sellers were charged 10 per cent of the hammer price on all lots sold; since January 1, buyers have paid 15 per cent on the initial Pounds 30,000 of all purchases and thereafter 10 per cent. Operating income from auctions leapt to Dollars 17.4m (Dollars 6.41m) on revenues of Dollars 114.5m (Dollars 101m). Pre-tax income from auctions totalled Dollars 19m (Dollars 9.05m). Also real estate profits grew to Dollars 1.36m (Dollars 913,000). However, income from financial services declined to Dollars 1.45m (Dollars 1.82m) 'principally due to the lower revenues associated with a smaller loan portfolio', which has been reduced in line with the general economic as well as art market conditions. Corporate operating expenses swelled to Dollars 3.06m (Dollars 2.72m). Earnings expanded from 10 cents to 21 cents per share. Auction sales were ahead 31 per cent at Pounds 418m, or 12 per cent at Dollars 635m allowing for a Dollars 40.5m reduction for adverse currency exchange rates. The renewed activity had come from both buyers and sellers, said Mr Ainslie. This time 40 lots were sold for more than Dollars 1m, against 33 last time. Impressionist and Modern art increased sales from Dollars 72.4m to Dollars 135.5m, with one painting by Cezanne - Nature Morte: Les Grosses Pommes - fetching a record Dollars 28.6m. Jewellery also saw 'significantly improved sales'.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Swiss newspaper report suggested that Romania is secretly trying to sell off  Western shipments of humanitarian food aid to get U.S. dollars. Neue Zuercher  Zeitung, a Zurich newspaper, said its information came from documents received  from Romania. It said they indicated that a foreign trade agency in the  Romanian capital had offered North Korea, a Communist ally, a discounted  shipment of rice, flour and other foods for payment in dollars. Romanian  authorities thus stand accused "of seizing Western aid shipments for the  starving, freezing population and bartering them away for hard currency," the  newspaper said. Officials at the Romanian Embassy in Bern said they were not  aware of any problem.  </P></p>

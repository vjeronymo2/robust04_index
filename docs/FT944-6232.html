			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Chancellor points in right direction The move to a unified Budget in late autumn has already had one advantage. A large part of the speech dealt with public spending. In almost every other country national budgets are concerned mainly with spending and how it will be financed; now the UK has at long last moved into line. The predictability of this year's Budget measures is all to the good. Treasury officials have been working for decades to put the public finances on a medium-term basis. What came to their aid was the political shock of the high 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement (originally overestimated at Pounds 50bn) plus the desire to correct gradually until recovery from recession was secure. Thus it is not surprising that the main headline tax measures are simply a confirmation of tax increases to which the government committed itself in the two Budgets of 1993. But because of faster-than-expected economic recovery and lower-than-expected inflation, the public finances are coming under control more quickly. There are several innovations in this year's Financial Statement. As reformers have long advocated, the Treasury now separates public sector current from capital spending in its very first summary table, and draws up a 'current balance'. In fact, such reform has become inevitable as the 'private finance initiative' makes the total of public sector net capital spending a somewhat misleading indicator. For much of what would have been called public capital spending is now disguised as private sector investment. The net result is that the Maastricht guideline of public sector borrowing not exceeding 3 per cent of GDP is expected to be reached next year. The Treasury's projections now show the current deficit disappearing around about 1997-98. The PSBR is due to disappear in 1998-99. The financial markets were initially disappointed that the Treasury maintained a cautious estimate for the PSBR in the current financial year. The big change is its reduction by Pounds 8bn, compared with the projection in the last Budget Red Book, for both 1995-96 and 1996-97. Much the greatest reduction has been in public spending in cash terms, due to lower inflation, which - as widely predicted - the chancellor has allowed to be reflected in an improvement in the public sector balance rather than an equivalent increase in real programmes. There are, however, some modest economies, especially from 1996 - reflecting the private finance initiative, housing benefit reform and lower spending on roads. Much the most interesting aspect of this Budget is, however, the widely foreshadowed measures to improve incentives both for potential workers to take low-paid jobs and for employers to offer them. Of course, this is second best to high-skilled workers taking better-paid jobs. But in a non-ideal world low pay is very much better than no pay. The chancellor has gone rather further than I expected he would, given the departmental caution of both the Treasury and the Department of Social Security. The thrust towards shifting benefit from the dole to top-up payments for those re-entering employment or working in low-paid jobs is most welcome. The chief measures here are the increase in family credit for those in full-time work, and the accelerated payment of housing benefit and family credit to those moving off the dole. We also at last have a pilot scheme to extend family credit to people without children, who make up about two-thirds of the long-term unemployed. The sooner it moves to a regular across-the-country basis, the better. The 0.6 percentage point reduction in employer National Insurance Contributions for the low paid is welcome, as is the one-year National Insurance holiday for taking on the long-term unemployed. It is unfortunate, however, that the long-term unemployed are defined as people who have been without a job for more than two years. In most studies of the question, one year, or even less, is the threshold. But if these measures work, they can be extended further by this or another government. The Treasury has also been very cautious about the likely offsets from lower dole payments and higher tax receipts resulting from these measures. If this caution is shown to be excessive, the way will be open for further extensions. Two other detailed measures caught my eye. One was the changes to be announced by the Department of Trade and Industry to discourage creditors from putting companies into unnecessary liquidation. This plus the late payment of bills is probably the greatest curse of the small business sector. I was also attracted by the idea of a tax on landfilled waste, the proceeds of which would be returned to industry in the form of lower national insurance contributions. The idea of putting more tax on environmental degradation and reducing the tax on labour is a sensible switch and an intelligent use of the price mechanism. There were no innovations in monetary or macro-economic policy. The most interesting aspect is that Kenneth Clarke reaffirmed Norman Lamont's commitment to securing inflation within the lower half of the 1 to 4 per cent per annum target range. The Treasury's projections do indeed show most underlying measures of inflation, such as the RPI excluding mortgage interest, producer prices and the GDP deflator, within a 2 to 2 1/2 per cent tunnel, despite a modest upward blip next year due to the rebuilding of margins and higher commodity prices. If these projections are to remain credible, interest rates will have to rise again soon. As might have been expected, the Treasury has been quite cautious about upgrading its overall growth forecast. Non-oil GDP is estimated to rise by 3 1/2 per cent in 1994, which - although substantially up on previous official forecasts - is still likely to be an underestimate. From 1995 onwards, the difference between GDP and non-North Sea GDP thankfully disappears. Both are set to grow at 3 1/4 per cent, which again looks cautious. For later in the decade the Treasury puts average annual growth at 2 3/4 per cent, which is still regarded as above the underlying growth trend and sufficient to reduce unemployment and take up slack. The longer-term projection is for the growth of nominal GDP of slightly under 5 per cent per annum, of which 2 per cent would be the irreducible inflation minimum. If, however, recent supply side movements continue, and the measures to encourage employment really work, it might be possible to envisage a somewhat faster rate of both nominal and real growth without re-igniting inflation. But the credibility test will come very much earlier in making sure that demand does not grow at excessive speed in the months ahead. There is here an uncanny similarity with the US, where the Federal Reserve vice-chairman, Alan Blinder (a Clinton appointee and hardly a fanatical hard-money man), has just warned about the speed of the upturn.  ------------------------------------------------------------ THE PUBLIC SECTOR'S FINANCES  ------------------------------------------------------------ Revenue and expenditure (% of GDP)*  ------------------------------------------------------------                               1994-95       95-96       96-97  ------------------------------------------------------------ Receipts                       37 3/4      39 1/4      39 3/4 Current expenditure            42          41 1/4      40 1/2 Current balance                -4 1/4      -2            -1/2 Net capital spending**          1 3/4       1 1/2       1 1/2 Financial deficit               6           3 1/2       2 Privatisation proceeds and  other financial transactions               1 1/2         1/4 PSBR - per cent                 5           3           1 3/4      - Pounds bn               34 1/2      21 1/2      13  ------------------------------------------------------------                                 97-98       98-99     99-2000  ------------------------------------------------------------ Receipts                       40          40 1/4      40 1/4 Current expenditure            39 1/2      38 3/4      38 Current balance                   1/2       1 1/2       2 1/4 Net capital spending**          1 1/4       1 1/4       1 1/4 Financial deficit               2 3/4       0          -1 Privatisation proceeds and  other financial transactions     1/4       0           0 PSBR - per cent                   3/4       0          -1      - Pounds bn                5          -1          -9  ------------------------------------------------------------ * constituent items may not sum to totals because of rounding ** capital spending net of depreciation and less capital transfer receipts  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: The Red Book  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

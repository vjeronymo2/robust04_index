			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 135 handlers of oranges and grapefruit, and 120 handlers of papayas subject to regulation under their respective marketing orders each season. In addition, there are approximately 2,500 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas, and 300 papaya producers in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the orange, grapefruit, and papaya producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respective marketing orders require that the assessment rates for a particular fiscal year shall apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled from the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rates recommended by the Committees are derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of oranges, grapefruit, and papayas. Because these rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. The recommended budgets and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committees will have funds to pay their expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule was issued for the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (TVCC), on July 7, 1993, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [58 FR 37635, July 13, 1993] effective for the period August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994, with a 30-day comment period ending August 12, 1993. The interim final rule authorized expenses of $984,319 and an assessment rate of $0.15 per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. No comments were filed on the expenses and assessment rate in the interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TVCC met again on August 3, 1993, and unanimously recommended increasing authorized expenses to $1,180,925, a $196,606 increase from the previously authorized amount. The TVCC also unanimously recommended increasing the assessment rate from $0.15 per 7/10 bushel carton to $0.18 per 7/10 bushel carton, a $0.03 increase per 7/10 bushel carton from the previously established assessment rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An amended interim final rule was issued on October 7, 1993, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [58 FR 53111, October 14, 1993] effective for the period August 1, 1993 through July 31, 1994, and provided a 30-day comment period. This amended interim final rule increased authorized expenses to $1,180,925, and increased the assessment rate to $0.18 per 7/10 bushel carton of assessable oranges and grapefruit for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year under the order. The $196,606 expense increase is necessary to provide additional funds for order operations, including $172,606 to fund increased administrative and compliance expenses, primarily for the maintenance of road guard stations, and $24,000 to cover a shortfall in the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. The increase in the assessment rate along with the withdrawal of additional funds from the TVCC's reserves, will adequately fund the increased expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: SIB's regulated progress The Securities and Investments Board discussion paper on equity trading is full of good questions. It would be nice if some of the answers were found in reasonably short order. Several of the issues which the document raises have been causing concern for years - including the familiar problem of controlling the derivatives markets. On several of the detailed points, action could be forthcoming. Markets could, for instance, be made more transparent by reporting information faster and allowing investors to use the professional broking market. But institutions who press for such changes risk removing the incentive for anyone to act as market makers. Greater transparency may thus reduce liquidity. The easiest changes may be the least necessary. More serious is the widely perceived failure of the criminal law, civil action or the Financial Services Act to rein in crooks, incompetents and market manipulators. At the risk of being churlish, the fact that the SIB is consulting about these issues only throws into stark relief how slow progress has been thus far. Given that investors have had to wait for the current review of equity trading, it is surprising that its tone is so leisurely. The debate also seems to accept that the current regulatory framework is more than adequate to deal with any problems. That view is questionable. The government may well be reluctant to introduce new legislation to reform financial services regulation. But it does not follow that there is no need for fundamental change. The SIB devalues its arguments if it appears to hide from the more difficult problems it faces.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SOVIETS AND THE SUMMIT;  </P> <P> BALTIC SECESSION A TOUCHY ISSUE FOR MULRONEY;  </P> <P> CANADA: THE PRIME MINISTER MUST TREAD LIGHTLY, SINCE HE'S FACED WITH HIS OWN  THREAT OF A BREAKAWAY BY QUEBEC.  </P> <P> When embattled Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev landed here Tuesday,  protesters in the Canadian capital took advantage of his two-day visit to call  for a tough stance opposing the Soviet economic blockade of the breakaway  republic of Lithuania.  </P> <P> But Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney seems unlikely to give them much  satisfaction, for recent weeks have brought him face to face with a growing  secessionist threat of his own, in the province of Quebec.  </P> <P> The Mulroney government has kept its language on the Baltic republics subdued  in the days leading up to Gorbachev's arrival, not only to show support for  Gorbachev's reforms but also to avoid sending the wrong signal to Canada's  restive French-speaking province.  </P> <P> "He's probably aware that if you encourage this issue there, you can have the  same thing here," said Gerald LeBlanc, a Quebec nationalist newspaper columnist  in Montreal.  </P> <P> No Canadian has forgotten what happened when a head of state visited Canada  during an earlier bout of Quebec separatist sentiment: In 1967, French  President Charles de Gaulle unexpectedly took to a balcony in Montreal and  called out "Long Live Free Quebec!" to the crowd, igniting French-Canadian  passions and shocking English Canadians.  </P> <P> Turbulence in the Soviet Union makes Mulroney's domestic problems look small.  Still, the two leaders are meeting at a time when Mulroney's approval rating in  the polls is the lowest of any prime minister in Canada's postwar history.  </P> <P> In addition, the Gorbachev visit began just as Mulroney was trying to  orchestrate a week of whirlwind "diplomacy" among Canada's 10 provinces,  sending an emissary across the country and holding an unusual series of  one-on-one meetings of his own in the capital with the all-powerful provincial  premiers.  </P> <P> The negotiations are a last-ditch attempt to save a package of constitutional  amendments intended -- when written three years ago -- to appease dissatisfied  French Canadians in Quebec. Three English-speaking provinces have been fighting  the package, known as the Meech Lake Accord, and the divisions have grown so  deep that numerous Ontario municipalities have voted themselves "English-only"  towns. And Quebeckers are concluding that English Canada will never understand  them.  </P> <P> Analysts are predicting that if the accord isn't ratified by the June 23  deadline, the failure will prompt Quebec to set in motion a process of  separation from English Canada.  </P> <P> In light of this prospect, the plight of the Baltic republics has captured the  close attention of political observers in Quebec.  </P> <P> "I remember the day I heard that Lithuania had declared independence -- I was  glad," said Stephanie Martin, a 23-year-old graduate student in Quebec  literature whose deep but non-militant nationalism represents the thinking of  many young Quebeckers. "I was thinking about (the Lithuanians), but I was also  thinking about Quebec."  </P> <P> But, while English and French Canadians have bickered, Canadians of Ukrainian  and Baltic heritage have expressed deep resentment at any parallels drawn  between Quebec and the restive Soviet republics.  </P> <P> "If Quebec had been treated since the 1700s the way Ukraine has been treated,  there would be no Quebec," said Lubomyr Luciuk, a Canadian professor of  geography whose ancestry is Ukrainian. He pointed out that Quebec entered the  Canadian confederation of its own free will, while the Baltic states were  forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.  </P> <P> And Quebeckers are allowed to choose their representatives from an assortment  of political parties and enjoy as-equals negotiations with English Canada,  rather than economic strangulation.  </P> <P> "I have no intention of spending my life in an outpost in Quebec suppressing my  friends, who happen to be Quebecois, who want independence," Luciuk said.  </P> <P> He was speaking at a "Baltic Freedom Days" luncheon staged by Canadians of  Ukrainian, Baltic and East European descent to coincide with Gorbachev's  arrival. Canadians from these ethnic groups number more than 1 million, and  they make up a sizable force in a country with a population of about 25  million.  </P> <P> Citing Canada's reputation for following a foreign policy based on morality and  acting as peacekeeper in world trouble-spots, they have been calling on  Mulroney's government to extend diplomatic recognition to Lithuania.  </P> <P> The protesters also are staging a round-the-clock vigil at the Soviet Embassy  during Gorbachev's visit. They will hold a rally in front of the Canadian  Parliament today, where the Soviet leader is scheduled to have a private  session with Mulroney.  </P> <P> There has been speculation that Gorbachev canceled a previously planned speech  before Parliament because of the protesters, but some say he simply wished to  save his message for Washington.  </P> <P> Amid pressure to grant diplomatic recognition to Lithuania, Canadian External  Affairs Minister Joe Clark has promised only to seek "international guarantees"  by which Lithuania could achieve a negotiated independence, one that wouldn't  endanger Gorbachev's imperiled reforms.  </P> <P> Clark has said that Canada would be willing to help the breakaway republic  establish government ministries and train bureaucrats, and he said the  government is considering ways of shipping livestock feed into Lithuania via  Poland to combat Moscow's economic blockade. But he rejected suggestions that  Canada break the embargo on oil and gas by sending in Canadian fuel.  </P> <P> "How sad it is that Western governments are intent on shoring up the last  remaining empire," said Father Sigitas Tamevicius, a Lithuanian priest who  appeared at the protest luncheon with the red, yellow and green of his national  flag pinned to his clothes. "How painful it is that excessive caution by the  Western nations turned the threat of the blockade of Lithuania into reality."  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Eastern Electricity to rebate Pounds 50m Eastern Electricity, the Ipswich-based power distributor, is to rebate Pounds 50m to its 3m customers. The company said yesterday that standard customers would have Pounds 10 credited against their next quarterly bill, and customers on Economy 7 would get Pounds 16. Customers on prepayment, token or card meters would get an extra Pounds 4. The amounts are related to the standing charges that customers pay. The move follows claims in a number of consumer reports that electricity companies have increased their charges faster than inflation since they were privatised in 1989. Last week the National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association accused the electricity industry of imposing Pounds 650m of unjustified price increases on domestic users. Eastern denied that its rebate was a response to these accusations. The plan was put for board approval last month. Eastern also pointed out that its customers had already had their bills frozen at April 1992 prices, and had received two Pounds 5 efficiency bonuses. Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said: 'Our customers are continuing to benefit to the full from our ability to manage our business costs effectively.' The company said its average domestic bills had gone up by 14.2 per cent since privatisation - but if the credits and rebates were taken into account this amounted to only 6.1 per cent. This compared with inflation of 15.4 per cent over the period. Other electricity companies are expected to announce similar rebates in the weeks ahead.</p>

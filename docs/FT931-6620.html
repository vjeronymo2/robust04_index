			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / German states agree on need for more Bonn cash THE 16 federal states in Germany have agreed a common plan to finance the soaring costs of unification by stating that central government must bear the overwhelming burden, and taxes must go up by next year at the latest to finance it. A summit meeting of the 16 state premiers in Potsdam at the weekend reached little agreement on where they can save more money, but clear agreement on the need to wring more cash out of the central state exchequer. The deal was immediately denounced by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, as one which would cause an 'unjustifiable increase' in the German federal government deficit, and make the central government 'incapable of action'. The states agreed that some form of tax increase would be needed before 1995, the first date from which Mr Waigel is prepared to consider such a move. He said yesterday that tax rises could not be considered until growth resumed in the German economy. It means that there is still a wide gap to bridge between the central government and the 16 states on how they will pay for an estimated DM110bn (Pounds 46.5bn) in annual transfers to east Germany from 1995 onwards. Mr Waigel said the states' plan would mean the central government would have to pay 90 per cent of the total bill. The 16 state premiers agreed they could only afford to shoulder a share of the burden if the central government agreed to give them a much larger share in its revenues from value added tax: they want 45 per cent of the total VAT take in future, against 37 per cent at present, or an extra DM20bn. They also agreed that the financial needs of the five 'new' federal states of east Germany would amount to at least DM60bn from 1995, if they were to carry out their normal functions, including the financing of education, housing, and police forces. There was little agreement about the precise size of the transfers needed in 1995. The western states proposed DM60bn, while the eastern states said between DM75bn and DM80bn. In addition to the DM60bn, the central government estimates that a further DM40bn is required to pay the debt service costs of inherited east German debts from 1995, and DM10bn for costs of supporting east German industry, and making subsidy payments to the poorest western states. The state premiers discussed several proposals for savings, including the abolition of the 13th school year in the German school system, and a rise in the public sector working week. In spite of the flimsy nature of the agreement, the state premiers congratulated themselves on their apparent unanimity at talks. The two-day conference opened on Friday in Potsdam, the capital of Brandenburg. Both Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the premier of Saxony in east Germany, and Mr Waigel stressed yesterday that the debate on financial burden-sharing went to the heart of Germany's federal structure. But that was as far as their agreement went. Mr Waigel said he would present to the cabinet on Thursday the necessary laws to put into effect the government's alternative plan for both savings and tax increases. However, the two sides will meet on March 11, and both insist they are prepared to consider compromises.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MIRA MESA ERRS LESS THAN MADISON FOR VICTORY  </P> <P> For all the wrong reasons, you could tell Wednesday's Mira Mesa-Madison City  Eastern League game was a big one. Errors were popping up like land mines all  over the field.  </P> <P> First-place Mira Mesa and second-place Madison combined for eight, plus a  handful of wild pitches and a couple of passed balls.  </P> <P> By the time the dust had cleared -- and there was a lot of it -- Mira Mesa  walked away with an 8-3 victory.  </P> <P> After the second inning, each team had two errors. The gaffes stopped there for  Mira Mesa, but host Madison went on to collect four more -- three by shortstop  Terry Magnett.  </P> <P> "Mentally we played our worst game in a long, long time," Mira Mesa Coach Mike  Prosser said.  </P> <P> It could have been Madison's day, but instead it was kid's day. Mira Mesa's top  two pitchers, Travis Arnold and Eric Martinez, spent the afternoon watching the  game from the bleachers. Arnold (6-1) has the chicken pox; Martinez (3-1) is  academically ineligible and not expected back for two weeks.  </P> <P> So Prosser went with sophomore Marc Nielson. And after Nielson, a right-hander  who had a pinched nerve in his left shoulder, allowed three runs in the second  inning, Prosser went with sophomore Mike Bovee, who made his first pitching  appearance.  </P> <P> Trailing, 2-0, Madison scored three runs off Nielson in the bottom of the  second with three walks, Pete Valdez's triple, Lamont Allen's bunt single and  Albert Mendiola's ground ball, which bounced off second baseman Rickey Hastey's  glove.  </P> <P> Hastey, batting more than .400 this season, redeemed himself with four runs  batted in on a three-for-four day at the plate.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa (15-2, 7-0) tied it in the fourth when Josh Green, two weeks removed  from the junior varsity, scored on an error by right fielder Mike Jones. The  Marauders went ahead, 4-3, in the fifth when Beau Champoux was hit by a pitch  and scored on Magnett's second error.  </P> <P> Madison is 13-5, 4-2. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

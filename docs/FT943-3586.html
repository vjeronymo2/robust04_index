			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: United Healthcare boosts expansion plan with Dollars 520m cash acquisition United Healthcare, one of the largest managed healthcare companies in the US, announced a Dollars 520m cash deal yesterday, the latest in a series of acquisitions aimed at expanding into new markets across the country. United has agreed to buy GenCare Health Systems, which operates in St Louis, Missouri, with revenues last year of Dollars 197m. The purchase is being made with part of the Dollars 2.3bn United received from the sale of its pharmacy benefit management company, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, to SmithKline Beecham earlier this year. The company made clear at the time that it planned to use the money to continue buying regional healthcare companies. At the end of June, United had Dollars 2.6bn of cash and securities, giving it the resources to accelerate its acquisition programme. Earlier this year it made two all-stock acquisitions, worth around Dollars 900m at yesterday's market price. GenCare operates managed healthcare programmes in St Louis, including health maintenance organisations, with 194,000 members; preferred provider organisations, with 98,000 members; a workers' compensation plan covering 41,000 people; and a dental programme with 31,400. The consolidation of the managed care industry is rapidly throwing up a small number of big companies with the power to negotiate lower prices from hospital groups, drugs companies and other healthcare providers. GenCare's shares closed up Dollars 6 1/2 at Dollars 46, while United Healthcare's shares slipped by Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 53.</p>

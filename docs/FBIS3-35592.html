He predicted "consequences that are difficult to  foresee" if Riga does not change its policy vis-a-vis the  Russian minority in the country.    Kozyrev's intervention was caused by a new election law in  Latvia that deprives the strong Russian minority of its right to  vote in local elections. According to Kozyrev, about a third of  Latvia's population is affected by this rule.    "Thus, political rightlessness is turned into law," Kozyrev  complained. He warned against the "fatal consequences of  aggressive nationalism." Strong warnings were expressed in  several passages: Political extremism might lead "to a  confrontation between Latvia and its neighboring states."  Russia is Latvia's neighbor.    Within the framework of international law, Russia will do  "everything possible to ensure the protection of the rights of  ethnic Russians in Latvia," the minister stressed. Latvia is to  blame for the difficulties. Its policy aimed at driving out the  country's population that belongs to another ethnic group and  its efforts to create a state with a single ethnic group may  lead to "consequences that are difficult to foresee."    Kozyrev demands -- he apparently considers this the last  opportunity -- that the international organizations raise their  voices. The "mechanism of preventive democracy" must be  initiated.    The majority of the Russian minority moved to Latvia in the  past 50 years where living conditions were more agreeable than  in the rest of the Soviet Union. In the period between the  wars, the Baltic states were independent. Before that, they had  been part of the Tsarist realm for a long time. Russian troops  continue to be deployed in Latvia.</p>

"The plan is part of the government's much-publicized  `southern strategy' to strengthen economic ties with Southeast  Asia," Sheu explained.    "It is devised to provide more assistance to Taiwan  entrepreneurs in their business and investment activities in the  region," Sheu noted.    "By doing this we hope our manufacturers will divert some of  their investment from Mainland China to Southeast Asian nations  and thus help reduce Taiwan's growing economic dependence on the  mainland," Sheu said.    Under the plan, Sheu said, the government will seek to  eliminate investment barriers and expand bilateral trade and  technological cooperation with ASEAN member states and  Indochinese countries. In the initial stages, the plan will  target Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia, he explained.    The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand, while Indochinese countries include Vietnam, Laos and  Cambodia.    Sheu said government research units will intensify study of  economic activities, investment climate and trade regulations in  Southeast Asian nations, and delegations will be organized to  visit the region to collect first-hand information.    The economics ministry will help local manufacturers find  suitable sites to accommodate production facilities and  distribution centers in Southeast Asian countries, Sheu noted.    The ministry will also make good use of the international  economic cooperation and development fund to boost economic  relations with Southeast Asian countries.    In addition, the ministry will hold regular trade  consultations with its Southeast Asian counterparts to resolve  bilateral trade issues and work out possible cooperative  projects.    Over the next three years, Sheu said, the government will  invite influential Southeast Asian finance officials, bankers  and business leaders to visit Taiwan.    "The move aims to help Taiwan businessmen with interests in  Southeast Asia get loans to finance their operations there,"  Sheu noted.    The government will also ask Southeast Asian countries to  simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen and set up a  "Taipei desk" in their government investment offices to offer  information and counseling services for Taiwan investors.    Sheu said the plan will be sent to the Executive Yuan for  deliberation and approval. A special committee formed by  high-ranking officials from related government agencies will  meet every three months to check the plan's progress, he added.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (10): Aiming for all round benefits - Case Study / Hambros Leasing/CHP Consulting / New, easier-to-use system will provide better information and cost-savings, too WHEN HAMBROS Leasing started work on a new administration system, it decided straightaway that it could save money if the system could later be sold as a package to other leasing specialists. That decision is set to boost the system developer, a small, young software company called CHP Consulting, by giving it its first entry into the software products business. Hambros Leasing, a subsidiary of Hambros Bank, describes itself as a medium-sized operation handling medium-sized business, typically funding capital investments of Pounds 1m and above. It also manages other companies' leasing portfolios. Its income was Pounds 106.8m last year, and it has 36 staff at its headquarters opposite the Tower of London. Hambros Leasing started life in 1983 with a Wang VS/100 business minicomputer running the Leasepac software package from Andersen Consulting. 'In the early days, the leasing business was driven by tax allowances and leasing companies offered very much a standard product,' says Mr Tony Curtin, a director of Hambros Leasing, 'but when that all changed with the 1984 Finance Act, we had to become more flexible to write and retain business.' Leasepac had been written in 1980, when the old rules applied - 'no transaction is the same as any other these days,' Mr Curtin says. 'This means we spend a lot of time doing things manually and trying to get round the system so it can cope with what we are doing. This has been happening more and more: staff have been spending late nights doing things they shouldn't have to do, because of the system. Andersen have been in constantly to upgrade our system.' Andrew Page was the man doing much of that upgrade work for Andersen. In 1990 he left the company to become the 'P' in CHP Consulting, which was set up in May that year with two other financial computing specialists from Andersen: Justin Cooper and Ian Hargrave. The company now has 10 staff and had a turnover last year of Pounds 410,000. It concentrates on consultancy and systems in the leasing and asset finance business. IN October 1990, Hambros Leasing decided the time had come to get a new administration and treasury system. The treasury function was being handled by a combination of a box of cards and the Lotus spreadsheet package running on personal computers outside the administration system. 'We wanted improved ease-of-use and better information, but we had to have real cost-savings as well,' says Mr Curtin says. 'That did not necessarily mean through job cuts, but rather by expanding our existing business and moving into new areas with the same number of people. 'In addition, on the treasury side we didn't think we were getting enough efficiency from our funding. This is a very competitive business: almost 30 per cent of all new capital expenditure in the UK is leased, but all the clearing banks, most merchant banks, and many equipment and other asset suppliers offer leasing services, so we need to look at opportunities to cut funding costs. 'Another consideration was that Wang was in fairly deep trouble, so we wanted to replace the computer.' Hambros Leasing's knowledge of Andrew Page's work while he was at Andersen led the company to call in CHP to look at the options for the way ahead. 'In the past computing had been considered in isolation, largely because of the inflexibility of the package,' Mr Page says. 'There was no consideration, for example, of integrating the automation of all areas to get maximum benefit from the overall system. So our study looked at the total business, the bigger picture.' CHP says there were four or five packages available but these were mostly either old or reworked from old systems. In January 1991, Hambros Bank's central information technology steering committee decided to commission CHP to design a new bespoke system for an IBM AS/400 business minicomputer - 'we didn't consider any other bespoke software companies,' says Mr Curtin. 'We knew that CHP understood the business, which was important. 'We also knew we would get high-level people, whereas with a big company we might have high-level people at the very top but they might devolve the real responsibility to others who might not know our business and could get into problems.' A key issue was the possibility of the software developer turning the system into a package which could be sold to others - 'this was always in our mind, right from the start in October 1990,' Mr Curtin says. 'The costs of bespoke system development would be too great unless you were one of the very biggest players. We agreed terms with CHP which were substantially lower than if we had gone for a one-off development.' CHP says it was happy with the arrangement - 'we saw there was a market need because the business has changed so much since 1984,' says Mr Cooper. CHP's small size was also something of an issue: at the peak of development eight of its 10 staff were working on this one project. 'Concern about CHP's size is always there - but we knew from the cash flow we'd be giving them that they'd keep going,' Mr Curtin says, half jokingly. 'They're big enough now to carry on even if one of the partners was run over by a bus.' Mr Page at CHP says, 'We'd been going for eight months when we got the design contract, so we'd showed we could survive. We have eight clients. Leasing is a very close-knit community and that worked to our advantage, because Hambros knew our other clients.' His fellow director, Ian Hargrave, adds, 'This is our biggest contract. We haven't got all our eggs in one basket, but quite a lot of them. We're investing in getting it right, because in effect we're investing in our own future.' Hambros Bank has a computing centre at Brentwood, Essex, with a Unisys mainframe. It has 90 computing staff, including 16 based at the London headquarters. 'Using them wasn't an option,' Mr Curtin says. 'They are dedicated to the banking side and have no special knowledge of the leasing business. In addition, gearing up for the project and then gearing down, would have created problems.' The computing department is involved to an extent, however: systems group manager David Nisbett is in the project steering group. The new system has to feed information to the central group exposure system and has to fit in to the bank's overall information technology strategy. That strategy, oddly at first glance, led CHP to propose the IBM AS/400 for the leasing system. 'We chose the AS/400 because we are familiar with it, it's very friendly for development because of its built-in relational database system, there are some well-established CASE (computer-aided systems engineering) tools available and a lot of appli cations software packages, notably nominal ledger products,' says Mr Hargrave. Hambros Bank is looking towards open systems, normally associated with the Unix operating system - which is not supported by the IBM AS/400. 'The bank has talked about its commitment to open systems to improve information transfer but it's also pragmatic and wants bespoke work done quickly,' says Mr Cooper. 'The AS/400 is good for quick development and has good connectivity with other systems. With Unix you have to bolt on the software development tools. 'The benefit of Unix is that you can transfer software from one Unix machine to another, but this is a one-off development for just one area of the bank, so portability isn't a factor.' As well as handling system development, CHP has helped select a new nominal ledger package, which will be linked in. CHP helped draw up the selection criteria and identified around 50 possible packages for the AS/400. 'We chose the JBA package because it was one of the few which can handle different year ends,' says Mr David Shindler, an assistant director in charge of administrative staff at Hambros Leasing. 'Hambros companies have different year-ends, but they also have to report for the group year-end. Price was a factor: it was similar to that of others, but it covered an unlimited number of users.' CHP interviewed Hambros staff on their way of working, from taking client instructions over a telephone to posting items to the general ledger. The interviews were written up and shown to staff for further comment. From this process, CHP produced a system description and then a design, which was approved in August 1991. The AS/400 was delivered in October. All the development work is being done at Hambros Leasing by a CHP team sitting in the open-plan general office; development work is done on personal computers linked to the AS/400 by a local area network. CHP is using the Lansa computer-aided systems engineering products from Aspect. The JBA nominal ledger package has been set up, the opening balances are being keyed in and the system was due to go live in June for the current financial year. The treasury system is being tested by CHP and Hambros and was also scheduled to go live in June. The main leasing and asset finance administration package is scheduled for testing in July. The target for live operation is next February. Testing of the integration of the different parts of the overall system is due to continue until August. Mr Curtin has overall responsibility for the project: 'I was chosen because I had minor information technology experience,' he jokes. 'I trained as an actuary and that's very computer-based these days, so I'm used to computing.' Mr Hargrave of CHP is the project manager. Under him at present are Mr Cooper, who is the database administrator and technical designer for the project; two people working on the general ledger; three more, including Andrew Page, on the treasury system; and two on the main asset finance system, all from CHP. Mr Hargrave says CHP is balancing bespoke work against package development. 'We make sure that as much as possible can be driven by parameters,' he says. 'When we come to package it up, we will take out certain special things which Hambros has requested and put in other things that might be needed.' Mr Cooper adds: 'Between the three of us we have 25 years' experience of 40 banking and leasing companies, so we feel we know what the market wants.' There is also a user team of David Shindler, plus assistant financial controller Miss Maureen O'Connor and administrative staff supervisor Mr Michael Hoffman, who spend 80 per cent and 50 per cent of their time respectively on development and testing - 'this is affecting the rest of the 11 administrative staff, who have to work harder,' says Mr Shindler. 'The extra work is balanced by their interest in the new system: they work in the office alongside CHP, so they're aware it's going on . . . initially, there was concern about possible job losses but we tell people that the system means they will be able to work more quickly and take on more, as our business grows.' Part of that business growth is expected to come from taking on other companies' leasing business, running what Tony Curtin calls a facilities management service, including computer processing of all the administration, and offering services such as chasing arrears. And, as Hambros had in mind from the start the cost benefits of getting CHP to develop its system as a package, so, too, it was thinking about future business expansion. For although the main system will not go live until next year, Mr Curtin says: 'We got an AS/400 which is much bigger than we need, partly with facilities management in mind.'</p>

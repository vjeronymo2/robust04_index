			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa seeks a stake in Luxair LUFTHANSA, the loss-making state German airline, is pressing ahead with talks which may lead to its taking a stake in Luxair, the Luxembourg carrier. The companies confirmed yesterday that negotiations were in progress with the aim of either intensifying existing co-operation or Lufthansa's buying part of its tiny neighbour. Luxair said in statement that the aim was to sign 'a detailed accord, before the end of the year', although Lufthansa refused to commit itself to a particular timescale for the deal. A maximum of 38.3 per cent of the Luxembourg airline is up for sale. Luxair's own shareholding of 26.2 per cent has to be reduced to 10 per cent by next year to conform with new legislation and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, the Luxembourg-based broadcasting group, wants to sell a further 12.1 per cent. Luxair said it had issued its statement to dispel rumours in the Luxembourg press that the talks - which began about six months ago - had been abandoned because of Lufthansa's financial difficulties. Luxair itself announced a profit of LFr122m (Dollars 4m) for 1991. Although it is racked by losses and preoccupied with a massive internal restructuring programme, Lufthansa continues to press ahead with plans to build its international presence through co-operation and acquisition rather than organic growth. Lufthansa, government controlled but earmarked for privatisation, announced a pre-tax loss in the first half of DM542m (Dollars 384.30) and recently unveiled plans to cut 6,000 jobs over the next two years, following a 1,800 reduction in the current year.</p>

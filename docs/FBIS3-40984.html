			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  Tuesday [1 February] brushed aside a reported move toward the  possession of nuclear weapons and renewed a commitment to its  long-held nonnuclear policy.    "Our country has been maintaining three nonnuclear  principles  and our use of nuclear energy is limited to peaceful purposes,"  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference.    "It is impossible for us to develop nuclear weapons," the  top  government spokesman said.    Japan has long adhered to a policy of not possessing or  producing nuclear weapons or allowing them into Japan.    Takemura's comment was intended to refute reports by a  British newspaper that Tokyo might alter its nonnuclear policy  and opt to possess nuclear weapons.    The SUNDAY TIMES reported Sunday that Britain's Defense  Ministry has warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development program may compel Japan  to give up its nonnuclear policy.    Takemura said the British Government has acknowledged it has  no reason to doubt Japan's nonnuclear stand.    He also denied a report carried Monday by another British  paper, the independent, that Tokyo plans to develop  intercontinental ballistic missiles in connection with its  imminent launching of the first all-Japanese satellite-launch  rocket.    "I want to emphasize our nation's space development  activities are strictly limited to peaceful purposes," Takemura  noted.</p>

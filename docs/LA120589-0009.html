			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HYUNDAI WILL BUILD CONTAINER PLANT IN TIJUANA;  </P> <P> MAQUILADORAS: SOUTH KOREAN COMPANY IS THE SECOND HEAVY-INDUSTRY FIRM TO  ANNOUNCE PLANS IN BAJA IN THE WAKE OF RELAXED MEXICAN GUIDELINES.  </P> <P> Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries of South Korea, the world's largest  manufacturer of seagoing shipboard containers and chassis, disclosed plans  Monday to build a 28-acre plant in Tijuana that may eventually employ up to  1,500 people.  </P> <P> Hyundai's planned move into the El Florido business park about 5 miles east of  downtown Tijuana makes it the second heavy industrial company to plan a plant  in Baja California in the wake of liberalized investment guidelines announced  by the Mexican government last summer. The guidelines enable foreigners to own  100% of Mexican corporations.  </P> <P> Louisiana-Pacific, a Portland, Ore.-based lumber company, began construction  last month on a large plant in El Sauzal, north of Ensenada, where it will dry  and plane rough-cut redwood timber barged down from Northern California. Most  of the redwood will then be shipped back, mainly for sale in Southern  California.  </P> <P> With 1988 sales of $1.2 billion, Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries controls  about 35% of the worldwide steel shipboard container market. The containers  measure from 20 feet to 53 feet in length and are sold to shipping companies,  said B. M. Ahn, president of Hyundai Precision America, the company's U.S.  subsidiary based in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Y. K. Youm, a Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries official, said in a telephone  interview from Seoul that Hyundai selected the Tijuana site to take advantage  of the low costs of labor and to be close to the U.S. market. The plant will be  in operation by next November, and, once fully operational, should produce up  to 3,000 containers and 500 chassis a month, Youm said.  </P> <P> The first phase of construction will contain 270,000 square feet in three  buildings, at a cost of $10 million, but a second phase could double the square  footage, Youm said.  </P> <P> Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries is one of 30 independent South Korean  companies, including Hyundai Motor, under the symbolic Hyundai Business Group  umbrella, Ahn said.  </P> <P> The El Florido industrial park is a 200-acre development of San Diego Baja, a  Solana Beach-based real estate development firm whose principals include Hugh  McCaffrey and Paul Scheibe.  </P> <P> In an interview, McCaffrey declined to identify his firm's financial backers,  but did say the park will be financed partly through a "debt swap," a technique  by which foreigners buy Mexican debt and exchange it for pesos at a heavily  discounted rate, under the proviso that the pesos be reinvested into  preapproved projects in Mexico.  </P> <P> The Hyundai plant received government approval for the debt swap in part  because the plant will provide jobs mainly to men. A criticism of the  maquiladora boom has been that an estimated 90% of the light industrial jobs it  has created have been taken by women.  </P> <P> McCaffrey said Hyundai was drawn to the El Florido business park in part  because of its access to the San Diego &amp; Imperial Valley Railroad, a line  running through the property that connects San Diego with Tijuana and Tecate.  Although Hyundai's first plans are to transport most of its finished containers  by truck to Los Angeles, the company will eventually use the rail line to  deliver products to more distant destinations in the United States, Youm said.  </P> <P> Hyundai once operated a container manufacturing plant in Long Beach, but closed  it in October because of the relatively high cost of U.S. labor, Ahn said. Youm  said the South Korean company expects to pay workers an average hourly wage of  $1.30, contrasted with the $12.60 it would pay to hourly workers in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Construction on the plant will begin in February, Youm said. At its opening,  the plant should employ 1,000 workers.  </P></p>

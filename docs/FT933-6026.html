			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Shimadzu in Allied-Signal link SHIMADZU, a leading Japanese precision equipment maker, and Allied-Signal of the US have agreed a wide-ranging partnership for the joint development and production of jet engine parts. The Japanese group said the deal might lead eventually to an equity relationship between the two companies. The bilateral accord calls for Shimadzu and the aerospace division of Allied-Signal to adopt a risk-revenue sharing system in the tie-up whereby profits are split between the two companies according to the respective share of funds injected into the product development of particular projects. It follows a deal made last October for Shimadzu to supply engine gearboxes to Allied-Signal, which is headed by Mr Lawrence Bossidy. The Japanese company will start shipping gearboxes to Allied-Signal next month. The two will also co-operate in developing market opportunities in China and other Asian countries, which are expected to be growing markets. Furthermore, they are considering taking equity stakes in each other or setting up a joint venture company. The latest agreement between the two companies reflects the growing pressures aerospace groups are experiencing in the post-cold war environment. The worldwide economic slump is also dampening demand from commercial customers and the deal between the two groups is an example of the restructuring that is likely to spread in the aerospace industry. Shimadzu, which has supplied components mainly to Japan's defence forces, is facing a slowdown in business for its aircraft equipment. The two companies will set up respective teams to discuss specific projects in which they might be able to co-operate in the autumn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 17 Feb (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf has urged the UN Security Council to fulfill its  obligations and move immediately to lift the economic embargo  imposed on Iraq.    In a speech he delivered at the general session of the  disarmament conference in Geneva today, al-Sahhaf said: Iraq has  fulfilled all of its obligations as stipulated in the relevant  UN Security Council resolutions. The Security Council must, for  its part, fulfill its obligations that are stipulated in  Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and lift the economic embargo,  which it imposed on Iraq and which is no longer justified even  on the basis of the Security Council resolutions themselves.    The foreign minister added that the continuation of the  unjust blockade on Iraq provides clear evidence that certain  hegemonistic states wish to impose on the world community their  own political stands which are not related to the UN Charter,  the international law, and the principles of justice and  fairness.    The foreign minister urged the disarmament conference to  work  for halting the arms race in which some Middle Eastern states  are engaged. He said Iraq was one of the first states to demand  that the Middle East be freed from the weapons of mass  destruction.    He noted that Iraq and the other Arab states had warned that  the Zionist entity possesses large stockpiles of nuclear,  chemical, and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles  that can deliver these weapons to targets thousands of  kilometers away and refuses to sign the nonproliferation treaty.    The minister said: Paragraph 14 of UN Security Council  Resolution 687 stipulates the setting up of a zone free from the  weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Three  years after that resolution was issued, we have not yet seen any  serious move to implement this paragraph. Instead, we see a  feverish race by certain Middle Eastern states to acquire arms,  including major efforts to possess and develop weapons of mass  destruction.    In his speech, the minister wondered about the reasons  behind  the zeal shown by certain states to pursue Iraq, threaten it  with the use of military force, and then actually using brutal,  military force against it, while at the same turning a blind eye  to, and even helping others, the Zionist entity for example,  acquire and develop weapons of mass destruction.    He said: Is it not the right, and even the duty, of the  world community and this conference to ask if security, peace,  and stability can be achieved through such biased and twisted  methods and policies.    The foreign minister emphasized that Iraq's position on  chemical weapons was made clear at the Paris Conference of 1989.  Iraq, he said, asserted its commitment to the Geneva Protocol  of 1925 and support to the world efforts to halt the armament  drive. Iraq was one of the first states to sign the  nonproliferation treaties and agreements. Iraq also emphasized  that the call for a complete ban on chemical weapons must be  associated with a call for a complete ban on nuclear weapons.    The foreign minister urged the international community to  deal fairly with the issues of security and stability in the  Middle East and to abandon double-standards. He also called on  the Security Council to expeditiously implement Paragraph 14 of  Resolution 687.    He said: We believe that the conference's top priority is to  take swift measures to guarantee the implementation of Paragraph  14 of Resolution 687 to turn the Middle East into an area free  of mass destruction weapons. The conference should not allow  certain countries, which are known to all, to exploit the  delicate stage through which the Middle East is passing, to make  suspicious transient gains which will certainly lead to further  imbalance, which will undermine security and stability in the  region, and which will expose the security and interests of the  people in the region to very sever dangers.    The foreign minister added in his speech: The development in  international relations, during the past decade and at the  beginning of the present decade, calls on all members of the  international community to accept that the equal-footing  participation of all states in developing human common interests  is necessary. This participation should be based on the  provisions of the UN Charter, the rules of the international  law, and on justice. This participation also should be far away  from double standards and selectivity in implementing these  provisions and rules; it should be in the service of genuine  security and stability in the various parts of the world.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf stressed that the achievement of  this requires the adoption of disarmament arrangements and  measures on fair and objective bases which guarantee the  countries' natural rights to security and peace and which  respect their sovereignty and independence. No country or a  group of countries should be allowed to make gains or privileges  at the expense of other countries.    Al-Sahhaf said: Proceeding from this understanding, included  in the final document of the 10th extraordinary session of the  UN General Assembly, Iraq took part in the disarmament  conference in 1989 as an observer. On the basis of this  understanding also, Iraq built its stand which calls for  expanding the membership of the conference so that it will  include the countries which have a desire for membership.    The minister added: In 1991, a comprehensive aggressive war  was launched against Iraq. More than half a million soldiers  from the armed forces of more than 30 countries, including  superpowers and major countries, took part in this war. They  used in this war all the conventional and nonconventional  weapons they have in their arsenals, including some  internationallybanned weapons. Immediately following the  cease-fire, difficult -- in fact unique and unprecedented --  conditions were imposed on Iraq.    In his speech, the foreign minister touched on Resolutions  687 and 715 issued by the Security Council in 1991. These  resolutions contain a series of measures to destroy some weapons  and the material and equipment associated with them as well as  to lay down a mechanism for continuous monitoring.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf stressed that Iraq has cooperated  with the UN Special Commission and the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] to implement the measures included in  Resolution 687.    He said: After three years of work with the UN Special  Commission and the IAEA, it has become clear that Iraq has  implemented the required steps stipulated in Part C of  Resolution 687. This fact was clearly stated in the reports and  joint minutes adopted during four sessions of high-level talks  between Iraq and the IAEA.    Addressing the 50 members taking part in a session held by  the UN Human Rights Commission which began in Geneva today,  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that Iraq's genuine belief in the  principles of the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights and  the 1993 Vienna Declaration emanates from its history and  civilization. He said that respect for and enhancement of human  rights since they are an essential human reality are taken for  granted.    He added that proceeding from this belief and true  understanding, Iraq ratified many international charters dealing  with human rights, the last of which was the ratification of the  child's rights convention. Iraq is also studying those charters  that were not ratified. In addition, it is actively and  effectively participating in conferences and meetings that deal  with human rights.    Al-Sahhaf spoke about the violations of human rights. He  said that what is actually happening in the world today is that  human rights are regrettably being used as a political weapon to  shake the political regimes of states, interfere in their  internal affairs, and fragment their national unity and cohesion  just like what is happening in many parts of the world including  my country, Iraq.    He affirmed that as a result of this, the issue of human  rights has become an issue of interests that is somehow affected  by the policies of some major powers in our modern world. There  is no issue that is more controversial in terms of standards and  selectivity than the issue of human rights.    Our evidence is that the UN Human Rights Commission is  always  abreast of all the terrible violations of human rights and the  human international law in Palestine and the occupied Arab  territories. Many resolutions were issued condemning these  violations. Moreover, in light of the world community's  inability to implement these resolutions, Israel continued to  disregard the basic human rights in these areas and pursued its  violation of these rights. The world today is witnessing what  is happening in Yugoslavia while the United Nations is unable to  find a solution to this tragedy. Without doubt, this is  attributed to the stands of some major powers which follow the  policy of selectivity and double standards in their  international dealing.    The foreign minister continued: Through its constitution and  laws, Iraq sought to establish the state of law by following a  realistic and practical policy that adopts the requirements of  establishing a community that is balanced in its economic,  political, and cultural growth.    This balance gave priority to economic, social, cultural,  and  scientific infrastructures. This reflected positively on  building the individual and on the requirements for the growth,  prosperity, and development of human rights. This was actually  accomplished by combating illiteracy and making education  compulsory at all levels and by taking care of the status of  women, children, and the handicapped.    This reflected clearly on all economic, social, and cultural  rights. It is enough to note here what Prince Sadruddin Aga  Khan, former executive delegate of the UN secretary general,  said on 15 July 1991 in his report to the UN secretary general  when he referred to the background of the situation in Iraq. In  his report Khan said: As of mid-1990 Iraq, in certain ways, was  rapidly approaching a level similar to that reached by some  European countries.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said he regrets the attitude  demonstrated by certain states toward these Iraqi trends. He  said: That independent course was received with negative  reactions from abroad, demonstrated by an unfair campaign of  accusations and allegations on human rights violations in Iraq.  The human rights issue was used as a weapon to obstruct Iraq's  development plans and national programs to build the  institutions concerned with democracy and human rights.  However, Iraq's determination to continue with its programs has  not, and will not weaken. Iraq has adopted several laws and  measures and made several decisions which emphasize respect for  the will of the Iraqi individual and his right to a dignified  life, and which allow him to exercise his basic rights even  under the hard conditions facing our country.    The minister said: It is difficult for human rights to  flourish during crises and armed conflicts, but their respect is  enhanced when security, peace, and stability prevail. We began  to feel this after the end of the war between Iran and Iraq on 8  August 1988 and until August 1990. During that short period of  time, discussions started on a draft for a new constitution.  Also, emergency laws and resolutions issued during the period  in which Iraq was defending itself against the Iranian  aggression were reconsidered and several of them were annulled.  Citizens were allowed to travel abroad and a new phase in  building a multiparty system was launched. The Party Law and a  new law guaranteeing the freedom of the press were issued.  Emergency laws and legislations which Iraq had to use because of  the war with Iran were annulled. This new reality soon changed,  and was adversely affected by the comprehensive war launched  against Iraq on 17 January 1991 in which all types of  destructive and internationally-banned weapons were used.  Undoubtedly, the respected members of the human rights  committee realize that these conditions, which were imposed on  my country, as well as the unjust economic embargo, have  produced negative effects on human rights in general.    Al-Sahhaf denounced the inhuman attitude of the states that  seek to blemish Iraq's reputation in the field of human rights.  He said: Those who call for human rights, accuse the Government  of Iraq of violating human rights and try to show the world that  they care for the Iraqi people, have committed the ugliest  crimes against Iraq before and after the military aggression in  January 1991. They still insist on continuing their genocide  crime against our people by insisting on maintaining the  comprehensive blockade despite the fact that the reasons on  which these states based their decision to impose the blockade,  are no longer valid.    He added: One of the constant serious effects of the  blockade, which has affected all segments of the Iraqi society,  is the deterioration in the food situation to dangerous rates.  Here, I wish to refer to a report by the UN Food and  Agriculture Organization, FAO, issued in August 1993 on food  expectations. I also wish to note the acute shortage in  medicines and medical needs, especially after the medical  shipments contracted by the Health Ministry before 2 August 1990  were halted although their price was paid in advance to the  supplying companies. Additionally, health institutions, medical  equipment, and utilities sustained heavy damage in the hostile  air bombardment. The level of medical care also dropped because  of the spread of diseases and epidemics, which principally  affected women and children.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf described the immense damage that  the people of Iraq have suffered as a result of the continuation  of this blockade, which has not only harmed the dignity and  livelihood of the Iraqi people, but also their economic, social,  cultural, civil, and political rights. He said: The lack of  stability, high prices, and scarcity of basic food commodities  and medicines has had terrible consequences despite the  exhaustive efforts of the Iraqi Government.    Al-Sahhaf added: This embargo has seriously affected many  aspects of the human rights situation on the one hand, and the  overall development process on the other. For, it is widely  known that international human rights conventions make it  incumbent upon world states to cooperate to uphold these rights.  Meanwhile, what is happening to Iraq as a result of the embargo  is the outcome of a calculated decision to obstruct the  government's efforts to honor its national and international  commitments as enshrined in these conventions.    The foreign minister indicated that the continued  enforcement  of the economic embargo has not only undermined the  humanitarian, economic, social, and cultural activities of  average citizens, but also contributed to the obstruction of the  national political program of democracy devised by the Iraqi  Government.    The minister recalled that several of these moves pertaining  to the Constitution, the freedom of press, the multiparty  system, and other aspects that constitute the main focus of this  esteemed commission were expected to have been accomplished.  However, the minister noted, there is a fact that we must  enlighten you about, namely, that the politicians who  contemplated launching political parties in accordance with the  government program have been forced to abandon their plans by  the harsh circumstances imposed by the embargo. This is because  their main concern right now is the harsh living conditions and  health situation to which their families are being subjected.  Consequently, the lifting of the economic embargo that has been  clamped on the Iraqi people will be instrumental in the rapid  consummation of the moves the Iraqi Government has made in the  area of human rights, al-Sahhaf maintained.    The foreign minister held the international community in  general responsible for redressing the Iraqi people's  sufferings, saying: Lifting the unfair embargo imposed on the  Iraqi people and ending the injustice meted out against them is  a humanitarian responsibility that must be shouldered by all,  including the UN Human Rights Commission.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf urged the UN Human Rights  Commission  to endorse a policy banning the use of economic embargoes and  starvation, because this blatantly contravenes the most basic  human rights principles and rules the Human Rights Commission  upholds.    The foreign minister said he hopes the commission will adopt  a stand that calls for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq,  because such a stand would be in line with its humanitarian  approach and the rules of the humane international law.</p>

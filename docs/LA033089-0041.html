			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS HOPE BRIDGE FALL WON'T DELAY TROLLEY LINE  </P> <P> Los Angeles County transit officials were cautiously optimistic Wednesday that  the collapse of a partly completed 400-ton trolley bridge will not  significantly delay the summer, 1990, scheduled opening of the first line of  the region's multibillion-dollar mass transit system.  </P> <P> While the cause of Tuesday morning's spectacular accident was still to be  determined, contractors were developing plans to make up construction time lost  when the concrete trestle for the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach trolley fell onto  Firestone Boulevard in an unincorporated area of South Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Eight people were injured, none seriously. They included two men who were  trapped in a pickup truck that was crushed by the falling bridge, five bridge  workers and a pedestrian.  </P> <P> Workers moved quickly to reopen the busy thoroughfare, which officials  originally predicted might be blocked for three days. By early Wednesday  morning, the 110-foot span had been broken up and removed and all four lanes  were open to traffic.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an interagency team of state and county engineers began a  two-pronged investigation to determine the cause of the near-tragedy and to  ensure that other bridge-building projects in the county are safe.  </P> <P> Attention focused on the timber-and-steel temporary structure that had  supported the bridge. One transit official told The Times that, for no apparent  reason, the temporary support structure, or "falsework," appeared to shift  several feet and toppled "like a domino."  </P> <P> There was still no estimate of total damage Wednesday. But officials with the  county Transportation Commission, which is building the trolley system, said  their insurance would cover losses.  </P> <P> The $720-million, 22-mile Long Beach trolley, dubbed the Blue Line, is about  70% complete and will be the first in the system to carry passengers.  </P> <P> A segment from Long Beach to the southern edge of the Central City financial  district is scheduled to open in July, 1990. A final leg, which will drop into  a subway station beneath 7th and Flower streets in downtown Los Angeles, is not  expected to open until 1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Connecting Links  </P> <P> The Blue Line will connect with the Metro Rail subway, or Red Line, and the  Century Freeway trolley, or Green Line, which are both scheduled to open in  1993.  </P> <P> Tuesday's bridge collapse was the largest mishap so far in the county's  ambitious mass transit construction program, which includes the RTD's Metro  Rail subway and the commission's trolley lines that planners hope will some day  extend for 150 miles. Thus far, the mass transit program's problems mostly have  been construction delays.  </P> <P> Last year, however, there was an embarrassing foul-up on another Long Beach  trolley bridge being built across Compton Creek. Cracks developed in the  surface of the bridge because steel reinforcing was placed improperly and  commission inspectors did not catch it. The problem has since been corrected,  with the contractor agreeing to pick up the added costs.  </P> <P> The investigation of Tuesday's collapse -- a mishap that engineering experts  described as highly unusual -- was expected to take several weeks. A task force  of bridge experts and public works engineers from Caltrans, the county Public  Works Department and the Transportation Commission was being assembled  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We're going to get in there and do a thorough investigation and analysis of  exactly what occurred," said Ed McSpedon, the commission's rail construction  chief. "What we do know is that something unusual happened on that south  abutment" where the trestle fell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temporary Structure  </P> <P> McSpedon has emphasized that it was a temporary support structure that failed,  not the bridge itself. He noted that the span was "still very much intact"  after the accident, he said.  </P> <P> Concerns about the quality of construction on the Firestone bridge contract,  which includes two separate spans, were raised last year in an internal memo by  a design engineer on the project.  </P> <P> Those concerns included possible soil settlement problems with a temporary  support structure similar to the one that apparently failed Tuesday, as well as  the need for field engineers to be more aggressive in enforcing contract  requirements.  </P> <P> A Transportation Commission official insisted Wednesday that those concerns  were addressed shortly after they were raised last year, as the first of the  two spans was being built.  </P> <P> "All of the issues were responded to and reviewed," said commission spokeswoman  Erica Gobel. She said the memo was part of the "normal checks and balances" and  "healthy dialogue" between engineers on such projects.  </P> <P> The engineer, who works for a consulting consortium hired by the commission,  has declined to comment. He referred inquiries to the commission.  </P> <P> Gobel said it is the commission's policy that its own officials, rather than  contractors and their employees, respond to news media inquiries.  </P> <P> Morrison-Knudsen, the bridge contractor, also declined comment.  </P> <P> SURVIVOR'S STORY  </P> <P> "My only thought was to get out" after bridge collapsed on his vehicle, driver  says.

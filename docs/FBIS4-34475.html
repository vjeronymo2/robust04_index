			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Christine Stewart, Canadian  minister of state for Latin America and Africa, arrived in Cuba  today on a two-day working visit to review bilateral ties.    The top Canadian official will meet with Cuban Government  officials and deliver a speech at the International Conference  on Business Opportunities in Cuba promoted by the British  magazine THE ECONOMIST, which will begin here on Monday.    A Canadian Embassy representative told PRENSA LATINA that  this visit to Cuba falls within the framework of the political  dialogue between the two countries, which has increased since  1989 with the exchange of official visits.    Former Cuban Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon traveled to  Ottawa that year, and the following year his Canadian  counterpart, Louise Frechette, visited Havana, where she met  with President Fidel Castro. Both countries have expressed  their satisfaction over the development of the political  dialogue and the expansion of economic ties.    Since the administration of Conservative Prime Minister  Brian  Mulroney, Canada has been strengthening its relations with Latin  America. The current Liberal administration of Jean Chretien  wants to consolidate those relations, particularly in the  commercial arena, and has taken steps in that direction.    At the recent OAS General Assembly, Stewart called for  breaking the isolation orchestrated against Cuba and advocated  Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization.    Prior to that time, Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet  stressed Ottawa's rejection of the U.S. blockade against Cuba  and called for an end to the policy.    Canada and Mexico were the only countries in the hemisphere  who in 1962 refused to accept U.S. demands that OAS  member-countries break relations with the island.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 1 (CTK) -- "We have not dropped the  idea of union and we will not do so," Miklos Duray, Chairman of  ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles [Coexistence] told journalists today.    "If we fail to form one now, we will come back to it after  the elections. However, at present we are willing to negotiate  with other parties about a tight coalition," he added.    Some of the Hungarian parties have announced they oppose the  idea.    Duray defined the "essential conditions" for creating the  coalition of Hungarian groupings: after successfully entering  the Slovak parliament the Hungarian representatives must, first  and foremost, create a joint deputies group. The Egyutteles  (with 9 deputies in the 150-member Slovak parliament the  strongest Hungarian party) will demand from them a unified  strategy in local elections with joint candidates for mayors.  Duray is also pushing for a unified strategy of Hungarian  deputies in foreign policy issues.    "Should any of the parties breach the accord, it will not be  allowed to claim the relevant sum from the state contribution  for the elections," Duray warned.</p>

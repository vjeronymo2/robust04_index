			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. A. Titkov, Scientific and Technical Institute </F> of Interbranch Information, Ministry of Science of Russia]    [Excerpts] The developed countries of the world are  presently involved in the global exchange of materials,  information, and specialists. The direction of the flow of high  technology is decisive in this process. Theoretically, one can  quantitatively measure the volume of these exchanges across  national borders; however, practically speaking, the scale of  the transmission of high technology in three such streams can be  determined only qualitatively. For example, the influx of high  technology from the West into Japan greatly exceeds the influx  from Japan to the West, judging from some unsystematic data, for  example, statistics on Japanese students and graduate students  studying in the US and Europe or the exchange of scientists.    In essence, today's high technology is global, and one  cannot  avoid the aforementioned contacts. Especially interesting is the  problem of systemization, classification, and analysis of the  number and quality of specialists in high technology, the  "generators" and bearers of this technology.    The success of Japan in developing high technology areas of  industry and science, as well as the active positive role of the  government in this process, have made Japan's experience  important for the reform of science and industry in Russia.  Thus, it is especially interesting to study Japanese specialists  in high technology areas (primarily microelectronics, computing,  etc.) as well as the scientists who provide for the development  of these fields. An instrument, and at the same time, an object  of study is the NAMES database, which includes the leading  Japanese scientists, businessmen, and specialists in high  technology.    The objects of study were: 1. analysis of the sources of  information; 2. the method of selecting specialists for  inclusion in the database; and 3. a quantitative estimate of the  level of competence of the specialists (optimal number of  parameters characterizing a specialist, elimination of the  subjectivity of expert opinions, etc.).    [passage omitted]  <H3>  Description of the NAMES database (``Who's who in the high  technology of Japan'') </H3>   The NAMES database is an automated information research  system which includes a card file and specialized software based  on the dBASE IV database management system with a list of  classification headings. The database includes about 5000 names  of Japanese scientists, engineers, and managers working in high  technology fields such as computing, microelectronics, automated  design and production, robotics, etc. A record in the database  includes personal parameters (full name, presence or absence of  name written in Japanese characters, address of employing  organization, telephone, fax, etc.) as well as professional  parameters (degree/title, post, area of scientific interests,  patents, etc.). In addition to these fields there is also a text  field for additional information.    A program module has been developed to calculate a  generalized estimate of the level of competence, for which a  special field is reserved.    Information in the card file has been collected since about  1975.    In the future, NAMES will have a modular structure including  thematic files (computers, semiconductors, robots, etc.), a  patent file (patent abstracts, patent holders included in the  database), a statistical module, and possibly an organizational  file on the structure of organizations whose employees are  included in the database. The database language is English,  because the product is primarily oriented toward a Western  market. Of course, as the situation in Russia improves it will  be easy to adapt the database to the domestic market.    Specialists in the database may be grouped by firm,  government scientific research institute, governmental  department, professional society, association, or corporations  of Japan.    At present the database does not require a knowledge of  programming and enables one to work in the following modes:  query by example, editing of records, editing of the screen,  addition of new records, and printing of the current record. In  query mode one can search the following fields in the record:  name, organization, area of scientific interests, degree/title,  and patents.    Additional database capabilities enable the user to join and  sort data in different ways, to verify information, to organize  interactive work modes, and to protect in formation.  <H5>  Prospects for further development </H5>   The world is involved in a constant battle for the  possession  of intellect and access to its sources. A consequence is a  continuing migration of intellect across national borders, and  this requires a practical estimate of the potential of the  scientists and specialists of various countries. Here a database  of the scientists and specialists of various countries can play  an irreplaceable role. Such databases make it possible, with the  appropriate depth of development and entries, to determine the  number and level of competence of specialists in various fields  of science and technology and detect trends and features of  development, priorities, and goals in the scientific and  technical progress of various countries.    Our NAMES database may be used as a prototype database for  various countries, and is a useful instrument for researchers  and private companies. It is also a methodological basis for the  creation of similar database. Such databases have good  commercial prospects, because the participation of high  technology specialists is key in determining the success or  failure of new firms.    In the Russian Academy of Sciences and in industry there are  specialists from the countries of the Far East and Southeast  Asia who may be drawn to the development of such databases,  which would make it possible to solve another problem, that of  the optimal use of scientists and specialists in our country.    We can use the existing methodological and factographic  materials right now and fill the niche in the Western  information market for a database of personal information on  Japanese specialists in the area of high technology. According  to our estimates this niche will remain empty for a maximum of  2-3 years. The market for a database on Japanese specialists in  areas of high technology in industry and science may attract  thousands, even tens of thousands of users and may constitute a  sum of several million dollars.    Our plan, given minimum financing, is to develop a  full-scale  relational database of personal information, programs for  statistical analysis and quantitative evaluation of the level of  competence of the specialist in interactive mode, independent of  the contents of the database, as well as active sounding of the  Western information market with advertisements and the formation  of demand for such software products.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Boeing and Airbus work on super jumbo: European consortium confirms launch of Dollars 275m A319 airliner programme BOEING and Airbus are making progress on plans to develop jointly a super jumbo airliner carrying up to 800 passengers, it was revealed at the opening of the Paris Air Show yesterday. Airbus also confirmed yesterday the launch of a Dollars 275m (Pounds 178m) development programme to build the A319, a new 130-seat airliner which will extend its family of twin-engined narrow-body aircraft. The super jumbo proposals involve an aircraft with a range of more than 7,000 nautical miles with a possibility of building even bigger derivatives. Mr John Hayhurst, Boeing's product director for the super jumbo programme, said preliminary marketing studies suggested demand for 400 to 500 very large airliners during the first decade of the next century. Although no technical obstacles had so far emerged, Mr Hayhurst said the parties were still a long way from deciding whether to launch a big aircraft. However both Boeing and Airbus are continuing their own competing large aircraft development studies. Airbus has recently stepped up discussions with potential Japanese partners in the development of a new super Airbus - the A3XX - which if developed would compete against Boeing's dominance of the jumbo aircraft market. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, is considering developing a larger derivative of its 400 to 500 seat Boeing 747-400 airliner. The Airbus consortium's new A319 is a smaller derivative of the 150-seat A320 twin jet airliner. It will complement the Airbus narrow-body aircraft range which also includes the 186 seater A321. The A319 is designed to boost its competitive drive against the US Boeing company which yesterday announced six orders worth Dollars 700m for its 767 airliners. The orders included two Boeing 767s for Gulf Air, another two for EVA Airways and two for Japan Airlines. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, said he believed there was a market for 400 A319 airliners. He said the consortium had decided to launch the new programme at a time of recession in the civil aircraft market to position itself for the market's eventual upturn in 1996. First deliveries of the A319 to airline customers are expected in spring 1996Mr Pierson added. British Aerospace announced a Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) order from a US corporate jet operator, Executive Jet Aviation of Columbus, Ohio, for up to 20 of its BAe 125-1000 executive jets. BAe has just sold its corporate jet activities to Raytheon of the US for Pounds 250m but under the sale agreement will continue to build the structure for the 125 family at Chester for at least the next three years.</p>

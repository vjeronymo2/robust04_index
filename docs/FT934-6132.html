			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Portuguese airline sues BAe for Dollars 70m British Aerospace was yesterday sued for more than Dollars 70m (Pounds 47m) by a Portuguese regional airline for alleged breach of contract and recurrent defects in three BAe advanced turboprop aircraft it operated between 1988 and 1992. EuroAir, formerly a regional subsidiary of the Portuguese state-owned airline TAP, issued the writ in the Commercial Court saying that it had been persuaded to acquire the aircraft by the 'negligent misrepresentations of BAe'. It says that from the time it started operating the aircraft on the Oporto to Lisbon route it experienced 'recurrent technical breakdown due to faults in the aircraft designed and manufactured by BAe'. It says that the three aircraft 'were not of merchantable quality or fit for use by a commercial operator on short-haul Portuguese domestic routes'. EuroAir is claiming 'in excess of Dollars 70m' damages from BAe and CIBC Finance Plc, the lease financiers of the aircraft, for being in breach of the implied terms of the leases. The airline is now in administration but is still operating two German built Dornier aircraft. It says that due to the defects it was frequently forced to cancel flights. The court documents show that CIBC Finance, part of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, repossessed the three aircraft at the beginning of this year and claims EuroAir owes it Dollars 37.9m. But the airline disputes this indebtedness and claims credit for the value of the three aircraft upon repossession of about Dollars 39.3m. EuroAir says it lost Dollars 11.1m in the period it operated the aircraft, and is claiming an additional Dollars 66m for the effect on future trading profits of early termination of the leases. BAe declined to comment on the writ except to say that 50 advanced turboprops were in service with airlines in the UK and overseas and were 'operating successfully'. BAe is seeking an international joint venture partnership for its Jetstream and advanced turboprop activities at Prestwick as part of its commercial aircraft recovery strategy.</p>

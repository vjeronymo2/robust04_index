			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters claimed that a careful reading of 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.7(b) indicates that waste which is treated using a specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment technology is not subject to further testing to exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle C and claimed that the rules for debris treated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the alternative treatment standards specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 268.45 should be the same. Their interpretation of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the CFR is incorrect. With regard to wastes for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies have been specified as the treatment standard, 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 268.7(b) contains the wording of the certification stating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the waste has been treated in accordance with &sect;268.42; this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification must be signed before the waste may be land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed. 40 CFR 268.7(b) does not say that this waste is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer subject to subtitle C regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that, at a minimum, EPA should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish health based numerical standards for exclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous debris from subtitle C. This commenter made no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion as to what test method should be used. The issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basing LDR standards on the basis of risk rather than technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance is addressed in Section III A 2 a of this rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Risk-based Universal Treatment Standards.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter suggested that EPA allow the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stainless steel as an encapsulant, claiming that its performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be superior to that of other encapsulants, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> polymeric organics, which allegedly fail due to the radiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects to their chemical bonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conclusions: Although commenters were in general agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a number of issues (e.g. inappropriateness of the TCLP for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debris, use of a 50 psi structural test as a performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, use of a leach test performed on intact debris), no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting data or other information was submitted to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their claims and requests. Therefore, the Agency is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating any modifications to the debris rule at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is evaluating exclusions as part of the HWIR process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will reassess appropriate action on debris if HWIR does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately address debris.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Deep Well Injection Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Prohibition of Dilution of High TOC Ignitable and of TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Pesticide Wastes Injected Into Class I Deep Wells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule prohibits the disposal of two types of waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into deep-well injection via Class I Underground Injection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control (UIC) wells unless the wastes first meet the land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal restrictions promulgated in today's rule for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, or the wastes are injected into a well that is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a no-migration determination. These wastes are nonwastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhibiting the characteristic of ignitability at the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation and containing greater than 10 percent Total Organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carbon (``high TOC ignitable liquids subcategory'') and also TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic halogenated pesticide wastes (DO12&hyph;D017). Thus, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating, as proposed, regulations excluding these two wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the portion of the rule at 40 CFR 268.1(c)(3) that allows a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste to be injected into a Class I deep injection well if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste no longer exhibits a characteristic at the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injection. Today's rule also includes a one-year capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance for these injected waste streams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For D001 High TOC ignitables, the treatment standard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed as methods of treatment that must be used prior to land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal: combustion (i.e. incineration or fuel substitution) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of organics. The preamble to the proposed rule stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that high TOC ignitable nonwastewaters contain high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of organics that can either be recovered directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reuse, or can be burned in combustion devices. These wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not injected in significant volumes, so that redirection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastes to treatment technologies will not have significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on well operators. 58 FR 48118&hyph;48119. EPA received no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the contrary from commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The treatment standards for TC pesticide wastewaters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also expressed as methods of treatment: biodegradation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incineration. On the other hand, the treatment standards for EP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticide nonwastewaters are expressed as levels that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved by using any treatment technology, other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermissible dilution. (The Third Third rule had already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disqualified these wastes from the exception that allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilution of characteristic wastes that were to be managed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Water Act treatment systems including surface land disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, &sect;268.3(b) and 55 FR 22657.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed at length in the preamble to the proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency's initial reading of the D.C. Circuit Court's decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is that wastes that are characteristically hazardous at the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of generation must typically be treated to destroy or remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous constituents before land disposal, or be disposed of in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a no-migration unit. 976 F.2d at 24. This is certainly a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible interpretation of the opinion. Furthermore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision encompasses underground injection wells, specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class I deep wells, since they are permanent land disposal units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 976 F.2d at 25. Thus, under this reading of the court's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinion, these ignitable and pesticide wastes would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated to remove hazardous constituents before injection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's decision to prohibit injection of these untreated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, however, is based not only on its initial interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Chemical Waste Management opinion (which, as noted below,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may still evolve), but also on the particular wastes involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> here. The wastes at issue are ignitable wastes with potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very high concentrations of hazardous constituents, and pesticide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes containing very toxic constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment is also warranted to reduce the amounts of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic wastes being land disposed. RCRA section 1003(a)(6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``statutory goal of minimizing the . . . land disposal of hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste by encouraging . . . properly conducted recycling and reuse,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and treatment'');  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Steel Manufacturers' Association  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  F.3d  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , (D.C. Cir. July 9, 1994) (``We conclude that minimizing the overall volume of slag that is to be disposed is by itself, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient justification for the zinc treatment standard . . .'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (slip op. at 13). Finally, only small volumes of these wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are injected, and segregation of the wastes should not prove to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unduly difficult. For all of these reasons, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes it appropriate to prohibit injection of these wastes at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this time, unless the wastes are treated to satisfy section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3004(m) or are disposed in a no-migration unit. In this regard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency emphasizes that no-migration petitions for Class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhazardous wells receiving decharacterized wastes may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to EPA or the Authorized States for evaluation at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. The petitions may encompass not only the pesticide and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-TOC ignitable wastes prohibited in this rule, but other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of decharacterized wastes (which are not yet prohibited but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are scheduled to be addressed in Phase III) as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most comments to the proposed rule requested independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of Class I injection wells, because they believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that underground injection differs from other forms of land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal, such as landfills and impoundments. Other comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned EPA's interpretation of the Third Third court decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Agency's belief that treatment of these waste streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be the preferred management approach for them. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters indicated that aggregation of waste streams meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize threat standard and expressed their opinion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segregation of these wastes for treatment poses substantial risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the environment and that underground injection is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherently safer waste management practice. The Agency intends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consider all the above arguments (e.g., risks posed by wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> going to deep well injection) in the identification of alternatives for land disposal standards. The Agency will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to investigate any and all information received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning these comments, and intends to address land disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for underground injection of characteristic wastes in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive manner in the Phase III rulemaking. Until these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards become effective one year from the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of this rule, they may continue to be injected into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class I injection wells without prior treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

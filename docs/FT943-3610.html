			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UK Safety tops Pounds 1m at midway UK Safety, the specialist footwear manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.02m on turnover of Pounds 15.3m for the six months to July 2. The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 302,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.02m for the 1992 first half. Last year's interim figures however consist of only two months' trading of the group in its present form. The company came to the market in May last year through the reverse takeover of TSW, the former independent television contractor for the south-west of England. Mr Colin Dunmore, chairman, said the outcome had been achieved against a background of uneven demand and a competitive marketplace. The figures had also been depressed by higher net interest costs of Pounds 464,000, against positive income of Pounds 81,000 received on the large TSW cash balances last time, Mr Dunmore said. In addition, the first phase of the group's restructuring plans had led to an exceptional cost of Pounds 215,000, although this had been more than offset by a Pounds 730,000 profit on the disposal of its investment in Socit Europenne des Satellites, he added. Earnings per share emerged at 1.78p (1.96p) and the interim dividend is being maintained at 1.04p.</p>

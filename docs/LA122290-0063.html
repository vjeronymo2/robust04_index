			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> JUDGE REFUSES TO LET GOTTI GO FREE ON BAIL  </P> <P> Reputed mob boss John Gotti must spend Christmas in jail because a federal  judge refused to release him on bail pending a trial on racketeering and murder  charges set for next year. District Judge I. Leo Glasser said the government  had proved in a "clear and convincing" manner that there were no conditions of  release that could "reasonably assure the safety of any other person in the  community." After the three-hour hearing in the Brooklyn federal court, Glasser  set Jan. 18 for the next hearing in the case.  </P></p>

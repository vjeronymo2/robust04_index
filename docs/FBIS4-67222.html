The center for asylum applicants in Niederwangen was  used as the hub for this trafficking. A total of 10.8 kg of  cocaine and 2.2 kg of heroin were seized and 30 individuals were  arrested, according to the Bern police force.    The investigations were carried out in cooperation with the  Central Narcotics Office; the police forces of the Cantons of  Zurich, Fribourg, Tessin, Vaud, Geneva, Basel; and foreign  police forces. The magistrate in charge of narcotics affairs  and Bern cantonal police officials have announced that the  investigations are now completed.    In 1992, the Bern police collected information on a group of  traffickers, most of whom were Nigerian asylum applicants. At  that time, 31 Nigerian traffickers were apprehended in  Switzerland along with a total of 50 kg of drugs, mainly cocaine  and heroin.  <H5>  Hub </H5>   The investigation led by the Central Narcotics Office made  it  possible to dismantle the network passing through Niederwangen;  illegally obtained visas helped traffickers conduct their  business. Late in 1992, suspicions prompted investigators to  search the Niederwangen center, which turned out to be an  important hub for international drug trafficking.    Until the summer of 1993, Nigerian carriers would come to  Switzerland each week to deliver drugs. Several individuals  were then arrested. The drugs were forwarded to other centers  for refugees in Bern and disseminated all over Switzerland. The  dealers used the profits from the sales to buy old cars,  electronic and domestic appliances, and tools which they shipped  to Nigeria.  <H5>  Twenty-Two Individuals in Jail </H5>   Of the 30 individuals apprehended after the  investigations--other arrests are still possible--22, including  three women, are currently being held in custody in Switzerland,  Austria, Denmark, France, and the United States. In many cases  it has been impossible to determine their real identity. The  Bern police added that the quantity of drugs brought into  Switzerland through this network undoubtedly exceeds the 10.8 kg  of cocaine and the 2.2 kg of heroin that were seized, even  though it has not been possible to say exactly how much.</p>

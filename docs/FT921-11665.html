			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Separatism poll jolts Scottish businesses SCOTTISH business leaders were gradually recovering their composure yesterday after an opinion poll suggested that 50 per cent of Scotland's electorate favour independence. The ICM opinion poll, for The Scotsman newspaper and Independent Television News, shows a departure from the pattern of the past four years in which about 45 per cent of polled Scots have said they would like a devolved Scottish parliament and 35 per cent have opted for outright independence. Support for devolution dropped to 27 per cent in the latest poll, while backing for the status quo was unchanged at 19 per cent. Mr David MacLehose, director of the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland, said: 'I don't think if we had an election today we would end up with a result like that. But the pendulum is definitely swinging towards separatism.' Several business chiefs took comfort from the fact that backing for the Scottish National party, the only party that offers independence, was 26 per cent. Although this marked a jump of 7 per cent, putting the SNP at its highest level since 1989, it suggested that only just over half those who want independence would actually vote for it. Members of the Scottish business, professional and administrative class accept with varying degrees of enthusiasm that some form of Scottish assembly is likely after the general election. A tax-raising Scottish parliament has been promised by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, while the Conservatives, in spite of repeated denials, are widely expected to offer some kind of assembly if they win. The SNP has gained support from British Steel's decision to close the Ravenscraig steel plant in Lanarkshire, and from the performance of Mr Alex Salmond, the party's leader, in a televised public debate on Scotland's constitution. It has also been helped by the decision of the Scottish edition of The Sun newspaper to support independence. The poll put Labour's share of support at 41 per cent, one point less than it won in Scotland at the 1987 general election. This raises the possibility that Labour might not win extra Scottish seats from the Conservatives in the election. Instead the Tories, who stood at 23 per cent, one point less than in the 1987 election, might lose some seats to the SNP. Yesterday Mr Malcolm Bruce, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, did not rule out independence completely. He said: 'What is really needed now is a united front behind a Scottish parliament as a first step. A further step to full independence can be argued over once the Scottish parliament is secured.'</p>

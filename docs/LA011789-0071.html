			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO BOMBING PLAN, REAGAN SAYS  </P> <P> President Reagan said Monday that the United States had not planned to bomb  what U.S. officials identified as a Libyan poison gas plant despite his comment  last month that no decision had been made on such a bombing.  </P> <P> "No, . . . we were not planning such an option," Reagan said in a interview  with Cable News Network.  </P> <P> Reagan prompted widespread speculation that the United States was considering  such a bombing raid when he was asked in a television interview broadcast Dec.  22 whether there was a possibility of removing the plant by bombing.  </P> <P> "Well, let me say that's a decision that has not been made yet," Reagan replied  then.  </P> <P> But Reagan said in the interview broadcast Monday night that bombing the Libyan  chemical plant at Rabta south of the Libyan capital of Tripoli had not been an  option after all.  </P> <P> He made the comment when asked if he had decided against "taking out" the plant  because that might adversely affect President-elect Bush, who will succeed  Reagan on Friday.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 --> 6. Design Specifications Verification Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> These procedures apply to all instruments installed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of complying with opacity monitoring requirements (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1.1, Applicability). The source owner or operator is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for the overall COMS performance demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the applicable standards. As an alternative, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COMS manufacturer may conduct the COMS design verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures called for in this section and provide to the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner or operator a Manufacturer's Certificate of Conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (MCOC). These procedures shall be conducted, detailed, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results submitted in the MCOC (section 9.5) as an integral part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each COMS demonstration required by the applicable standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to assure that the design and procedures to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformance with this section coincide with the design procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as stated in the MCOC, the manufacturer is encouraged to seek an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation by the Administrator of the manufacturer's conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration practices. The procedures to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformance with this section may require modification to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate instrument designs. All procedural modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to demonstrate conformance with the specifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section must be approved, in writing, by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The owner and operator or the manufacturer, as appropriate, shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain any approvals of modifications to the specifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section before regulatory agency review and acceptance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the overall COMS performance evaluations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each analyzer design shall be selected as follows, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to demonstrate conformance with the design specifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.10. The MCOC, section 9.5, for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments subject to this specification shall detail the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration procedures as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.1&blank;Selection of Analyzer. For conducting the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test in sections 6.2 through 6.6, the manufacturer shall randomly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> select (1) a COMS model from each month's production, or (2) a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COMS model with a serial number in a distinct lot of 20 such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitors produced, whichever is more frequent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.2&blank;Spectral Response. The owner and operator, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer, shall conduct a laboratory measurement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument's spectral response curve. The procedures of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory evaluation are subject to approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator and shall be provided to the Administrator upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request. The owner and operator or manufacturer, shall measure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop, and report the effective spectral response curve of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COMS at 10 nm intervals. Determine and report in the MCOC the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peak spectral response wavelength, the mean spectral response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wavelength using equation 1&hyph;9, and the maximum response at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wavelength below 400 nm and above 700 nm expressed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of the peak response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.3&blank;Angle of View. In the laboratory, set up the COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detector as specified by the manufacturer's written instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draw a circular arc with the center of the circle located at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centroid of a plane described by the COMS photodetector housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the radiation from the nondirectional light source first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encounters. The arc shall have a radius of 3 meters in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizontal plane of the COMS photodetector housing. Using a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small (less than 3 cm) nondirectional light source, measure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record the COMS receiver response as the light is moved at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5-cm interval on the arc for 30 cm on either side of the COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detector centerline. Identify the point on the arc furthest from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the centerline which corresponds to the point where 2.5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the peak COMS detector response is recorded. Repeat the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the vertical direction. Then, for both the horizontal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vertical directions, calculate the response of the COMS detector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a function of viewing angle (26 cm of arc with a radius of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 cm equals 5 degrees), report relative angle of view curves, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine and report the angle of view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.4&blank;Angle of Projection. In the laboratory, set up the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COMS light source as specified by the manufacturer's written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions. Draw a circular arc with the center of the circle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located at the centroid of a plane described by the last part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the COMS lamp assembly housing encountered by the light radiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected from the light assembly. The arc shall have a radius  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 3 meters in the horizontal plane of the COMS lamp assembly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing. Using a small (less than 3 cm) photoelectric light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detector, measure and record the COMS light intensity as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> photoelectric light detector is moved at each 5-cm interval on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the arc for 30 cm on either side of the centerline of the light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source projection. Repeat the test in the vertical direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

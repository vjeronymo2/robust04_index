			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Elipton From the  Potty" on pages 26 and 27 of the 21 February edition of the  Belgrade weekly VREME, Dragan Todorovic reports on a  fact-finding trip to investigate the manufacture of the  "elipton" bomb, "a superpowerful electronic-laser weapon which  no one else possesses, after the use of which nothing remains  alive, and which does not produce the aftereffects of  radiation." VREME reports that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy, the leader  of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, had given the elipton  to Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan. Key components of the bomb, VREME  adds, are to be produced at the "Elektron" factory in Sabac  owned by Tomislav Simic. In a Sabac news conference, VREME  states, Simic had described the elipton as "a small box like a  Geiger counter with a small antenna which serves as the personal  weapon of every soldier" and announced that his factory would  begin serial production of electronic parts for the elipton "in  the middle of next year."    According to VREME, Elektron is located on a large square in  a one-story building pasted over with Arkan election posters.  There was a blue Mercedes belonging Mr. Simic in front of the  building, so "we thought we were in luck." However, the VREME  group found only a doorman and a "close associate" of Simic, who  informed them that Simic was not there, that he has been  traveling a lot lately. The associate said that he was not  competent to discuss the elipton but that Elektron was a  reputable, well-established firm that is presently involved in  the wholesale marketing of a "wide assortment of goods."    VREME reports that the associate was unable to tell them  anything about the firm's production but that he showed the  group a brochure on the town of Sabac in which Elektron is  presented as an export-import firm dealing in electronics  production and services. "Thus, we remained convinced that any  type of production, if there is any, is a secret, because,  except for the doorman, a close collaborator, and a long  corridor with several doors, we did not see anything. It seems  that Mr. Simic is above all a philanthropist, because his close  associate kept repeating how much he had given and continues to  give to children and the socially deprived. He mentioned a sum  of 200,000 German marks and the construction of a church, and he  led us to a room with a sign on the door that said `Trade  Office,' where there were piles of used clothing. He told us  that the room used to be full but that everything had been given  to the people."    The VREME group, leaving the factory, went down the road to  an Elektron store to see some of the factory's products. In the  window there were a little plastic crocodile and an inflated  duck. "Not a single trace of technology, especially not a secret  one," VREME comments.    VREME reports that the brochure on the town of Sabac states  that Elektron employs about 60 workers, that it has retail  stores, that it produces microtransformers for main telephone  exchanges, and that it conducts business all over the world. It  also notes that Elektron manufactures a potty-chair which plays  music. VREME found out from Sabac residents that most of the  data in the brochure were no longer valid. "If there ever was  any production, there is none now," VREME states, adding that  "only a potty-chair which plays music remains. Mr. Simic  patented the potty-chair in the mid-1980's, building into it a  mechanism which, in contact with fluid, plays music. It was a  good deal, people say. Kids used to run to the potty," VREME  concludes.</p>

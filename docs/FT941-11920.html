			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Statistics standardised A revised system of national accounts (SNA) that sets new standards for countries to monitor economies was unveiled yesterday, writes Peter Norman. The system modifies the accounting framework used for economic and statistical analysis since 1968. It will be used by former communist countries that once monitored economies using the 'material product' accounting system. The US will also use the system.</p>

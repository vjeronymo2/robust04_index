			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividend evidence IF A non-taxpayer buys an ordinary share holding before the stock goes ex-dividend, but not in time to get registered at the company's registers, the dividend has to be claimed from the seller via one's stockbroker. However, there is no tax certificate to send to the Inland Revenue. What evidence does the Inland Revenue require in order for the tax credit to be reclaimed by the non-taxpayer? There is no problem: the stockbroker will provide a tax voucher, showing the day on which you bought the shares cum div and giving details of the dividend collected from the seller. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

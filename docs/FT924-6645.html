			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Fears on council contracts calmed THE GOVERNMENT yesterday moved to reassure companies which contract to provide local council services that they are not affected by new regulations protecting workers' pay and conditions when they transfer to the private sector. The regulations, which stem from a European Community directive, mean that the pay and conditions of staff cannot be cut when there is a transfer of undertakings. Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, said yesterday the new regulations did not alter the legal position of people working in the private sector whose work was contracted out. In a reply to a parliamentary question, he said that the regulations applied only where there was a transfer of an undertaking or part of an undertaking.</p>

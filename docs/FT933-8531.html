			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Sport: Crewman courageous - Yachting BEFORE each Admiral's Cup, arguments are advanced that the 605-mile Fastnet Race has no place in what has become a series of inshore races for yachts more like giant dinghies than blue-water vessels. Yet the three-day classic always furnishes excitement and drama that no afternoon dash round the buoys could provide. This year was no exception. The most gripping racing was between three 50-footers: Indulgence (UK), Ragamuffin (Australia) and Corum Saphir (France). They raced the entire course virtually within hailing distance of one another and finished in the above order with only 23 seconds between first place to third. 'This has to be the closest yacht-racing available in the world,' said Indulgence owner Graham Walker as the crew celebrated under television lights at the Plymouth finish line. It was a boat packed with experience. During long nights sitting out on the weather rail, the Indulgence team calculated they had 67 Fastnets between them. Before leaving Cowes last Saturday, Peter Gilmour (skipper of Ragamuffin) had said: 'If we're a scoring boat then it's all over', referring to Australia's excellent chance of winning the Admiral's Cup for the first time. What threw the calculations out was not Ragamuffin's storming second place, but the dismasting of the Aussie two-tonner Great News II. She was leading the mid-size fleet, homeward-bound 44 miles north-west of Land's End in rough weather, when the mast snapped at deck level. Twenty minutes' work with bolt-cutters saw the slender - and expensive  - spar on its way to the sea bed. Meanwhile, close by in time and distance, an identical mishap befell the Italian two-tonner Larouge. She had been lying just behind Great News II. This was a calamity for the Italians. In spite of going into the Fastnet with a two-point series lead over Australia, they had only two boats. Mandrake, Italy's 50-footer, had been written-off in a horrendous collision with Promotion of the Netherlands during an earlier race. Since the Admiral's Cup 1993 scores points from only the best two yachts, the elimination of Larouge meant that, as in 1991, the well-prepared and talented Italian AC team were once more the bridesmaids, not the bride. Victory in the end fell to the Germans. Leaving Cowes three days earlier, Harold Cudmore, the Irish team captain, had warned commentators not to dismiss the Germans' chances. 'They've heavy seaworthy boats, not very fast, but competently sailed. If everyone else blows up they could come through,' he warned. Earlier in the regatta he had sunk his own team's one-tonner, Jameson I, by cutting a Solent corner and ramming the rocks at Gurnard Ledge. Germany's eventual victory over Australia was by the narrowest margin in AC history - a quarter of a point. The key was the storming performance of their smallest boat, Pinta. Not only did she come in over two hours ahead of the nearest one-tonner but on corrected time was seventh in the fleet overall, ahead of much bigger boats. The denouement did not come until the final miles of the Fastnet, creeping eastwards under the Cornish cliff towards Plymouth. To protect Australia's almost certain team win, their one-tonner Ninja had to finish not more than six places behind Pinta. She missed by one place. But the most compelling drama of the Fastnet concerned a man-overboard from the Japanese one-tonner Nippon. Bowman Kazuhiko Sofuku was swept off the deck at night in rough weather. He had no life jacket but was clutching a torch. 'At first we could see the light,' said Nippon's British skipper, Andrew Hurst. 'But when the torch went out I began to feel sick.' In broken water and complete darkness the small yacht began a search pattern. Some of the time they could hear cries from the lost crewman, but could not see him. One of the biggest problems was the noise from the engine - necessary for an effective search but drowning the shouts of the man overboard. Hurst knew the boat's exact position at the time of the incident from the GPS navigation system, but in such conditions even someone only 200 yards away can be nearly impossible to locate. 'After about 15 minutes we were all becoming very worried and quiet,' said Hurst. 'We'd been launching parachute flares to illuminate the area and I was beginning to worry if we'd drifted off our search area. The last flare was 6ft from landing in the water when we saw Kazuhiko. He was looking very weak and going under water rather too often.' With the crewman restored to his bunk and being treated for potential hypothermia, one of the most fortunate sailors and yachts to compete in any Fastnet headed back to Plymouth.</p>

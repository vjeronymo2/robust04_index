			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> DAMAGE CONTROL AT THE BELEAGUERED CORCORAN GALLERY OF ART  </P> <P> Now that Christina Orr-Cahall has taken the fall for the outlandish shenanigans  of Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art during the past six months, observers  immediately have begun to ask: Who will replace her as director of the  once-venerable, now-sullied, museum?  </P> <P> Alas, we ought to be asking something slightly different: Who in their right  mind would want to?  </P> <P> Let me explain.  </P> <P> The Corcoran's problems are far from over. Following months of national  protests, artists' boycotts, staff defections, patron withdrawals and more, all  in the crippling wake of the cancellation of a long-planned exhibition of  photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, the announcement Monday that the  director would relinquish her post at the helm of the museum is news to be  received with both a yawn and a groan.  </P> <P> The yawn comes from recognizing that, when Orr-Cahall decided, on June 13, to  cancel a potentially controversial show for fear of upsetting Congress on the  eve of budget hearings for the National Endowment for the Arts, she set into  motion a great, whirring machine of righteous (and appropriate) horror that  could only be shut off by insightful and decisive action.  </P> <P> Simply put, the cancellation was shocking because it placed the security of  federal arts funding ahead of the very ends of art itself. It was difficult to  believe that a museum professional who did not understand the gravity of that  decision -- indeed, who didn't even seem to know that was its consequence --  could possibly possess the skill to pull out of a screaming nosedive. She  didn't, and Monday she crashed and burned.  </P> <P> The groan comes from something else. We are not talking here about the  momentary failure of judgment on the part of a single museum employee, which  can be neatly swept away with her departure. We are not even talking about a  director's repeated failures. After all, the cancellation of the Mapplethorpe  exhibition was accomplished with the official backing and continued support of  the Corcoran's board of trustees. There was virtually no indication Monday, as  there has not been from Day One, that the museum board has in any way changed  its mind about that calamitous decision.  </P> <P> In fact, board chairman David Lloyd Kreeger, a member of a special trustees'  committee appointed Sept. 25 to find ways to repair the damage to the museum's  credibility, was quoted in published reports of Monday's announcement as saying  that the board was less concerned about the cancellation of the Mapplethorpe  show than about the "continued barrage" of criticism leveled at the Corcoran.  (Kreeger was subsequently unavailable for comment.) Amazingly enough, six  months later the crisis still is being perceived as a gross public relations  problem, an ever more nagging menace that might miraculously disappear with the  director.  </P> <P> It won't. Public life is forever being confused with public relations, but the  Corcoran scandal is at heart a catastrophe of public life. For it is finally  the board of trustees, not the director, that holds the museum, its collections  and its programs in trust for the public. It is the board of trustees, not its  employee, in whom ultimate fiduciary responsibility is vested. That is what the  word trustee means. Except for a staff change, the Corcoran Gallery of Art  today is no different than it was last week, when public confidence and support  were virtually nil.  </P> <P> So, what is the museum to do to begin earnestly repairing the damage it has  wrought? Indications are that, in a report approved in principle and to be  publicly released next month, the special trustee committee has recommended a  structural overhaul of the museum's unwieldy board. It's a crucial decision.  Indeed, a newly configured, less divisive board might now actually take the  step it should have taken -- and almost did -- many months ago. The Corcoran  might apologize to the public whose confidence it has breached, and whose trust  has been seriously violated.  </P> <P> In September, a few days before the trustees' special damage-control committee  was assembled, the board and the director did issue a joint statement, which  was billed as a public apology. When it turned out not to be, the supposed mea  culpa immediately blew up in their faces.  </P> <P> For what did the Corcoran apologize? Certainly not for having erred in  rearranging its exhibition program according to a perception of the political  winds blowing through the corridors of Congress. No, the Corcoran humbly  apologized for having created a public relations nightmare for itself. "By  withdrawing from the Mapplethorpe exhibition," the statement said, "we, the  board of trustees and the director, have inadvertantly offended many members of  the arts community, which we deeply regret."  </P> <P> Apology not accepted, because apology not offered. If the Corcoran wants to  appear strong, thus restoring at least a modicum of public confidence, then the  Corcoran has got to be strong.  </P> <P> A formal apology is not necessary because of any vulgar need to embarass  anyone, nor to force an admission of guilt on bended knee. A formal apology is  necessary simply because the public needs to know that the museum truly knows  what happened. So far, there is still no indication of that, and Monday's  musical chairs didn't help.  </P> <P> Handicapping the potential replacements for the directorship of the Corcoran  Gallery of Art is not the appropriate line of inquiry now, because this is not  a business-as-usual situation. As it stands, it's hard to imagine a candidate  worth his or her salt even considering the post -- which is not the same as  saying that someone might not get the job.  </P></p>

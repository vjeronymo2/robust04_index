			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Fund raisers rein back their ambitions - In a Nutshell Venture capitalists have encountered tough conditions when trying to raise new funds over the past year. Despite these difficulties, two venture firms have made good progress with fund-raising though they have had to modify their ambitions. Phildrew Ventures raised Pounds 62m towards its target by its first closing in mid-March and plans to complete fund-raising by the end of June. Phildrew initially hoped to raise up to Pounds 150m for its third fund but is now talking of a final target of around Pounds 100m. Phoenix Fund Managers has raised Pounds 35.5m towards its first fund and expects to reach its target of up to Pounds 50m (initial target up to Pounds 75m) within the next six months. Mitsubishi provided one third of the funds with Pounds 14m coming from UK investors.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING THE DESERT  </P> <P> Glidden's view of the desert is obscured by smog so thick that he has lost  touch with reality. He attempts to convey the illusion that the desert is  populated by 19th-Century squatters living in shacks next to slag heaps.  </P> <P> The fact is that the vast majority of the 300,000-plus people in the California  desert are living in the 20th Century and are against the desert closure bill.  </P> <P> Mining is the largest industry in the desert, and the value of industrial  minerals mined in the California desert is greater than any other state. We  cannot afford the cost of losing this industry upon which urban and desert  dwellers depend every day of their lives.  </P> <P> The so-called beautiful "crown jewels" when viewed in the smog-free air and  compared to other mountain ranges become ordinary mountains not worthy of the  title jewels but simply rhinestones.  </P> <P> Urban dwellers like Glidden have only viewed the desert on TV, but if they  would try to walk across the desert in the summer heat (120-plus degrees) they  would be exposed to stark reality. This desert "wilderness" is no place to be  without roads.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most important fact Glidden failed to see is that the Bureau of  Land Management (a federal agency) already has in place a federally approved  multiple-use land management plan, which includes wilderness areas, but which  also allows the best land use planning, accommodating urban and desert dwellers  as well.  </P> <P> The desert belongs to the people and is now accessible to them. The desert  should not be protected from them.  </P> <P> HOWARD BROWN  </P> <P> Apple Valley  </P></p>

It opened at 2,812 and dipped to 2,809 before embarking on an upward course. It hit its high of the day of 2,846 at about 3pm when profit-taking set in to take off the shine. The closing rate was 2,834 and volume 9,108 contracts. September finished the week 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash. In traded options the most activity in stocks was seen in Prudential as sellers acted on fresh regulatory plans. It traded 2,985 lots.</p>

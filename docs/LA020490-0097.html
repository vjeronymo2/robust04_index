			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: FELIX AND OSCAR II?  </P> <P> Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, writer Neil Simon and producer Howard W. Koch --  last seen together in 1968 working on the hit film "The Odd Couple" -- recently  powwowed at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club. Subject of conversation: an "Odd  Couple" sequel.  </P> <P> "This is not a sequel like 'Police Academy 5,' " Koch told us. "We would pick  up their lives 20 years later. They're older people now, not old men, but  older. They have families and children. The comedic values are there, plus the  dramatic values are there."  </P> <P> Prior to the meeting, Matthau said of a possible sequel: "I'm sure (Koch) would  prefer to call it 'The Odd Couple 2' to cash in on the words 'Odd Couple.' I  was never for sequels, myself. Always avoided them. But I'm open to anything. I  certainly wouldn't close my mind to fellows like Neil Simon, Jack Lemmon and  Howard Koch."  </P> <P> Simon's "The Odd Couple" has resurfaced in several forms since premiering on  Broadway with Matthau and Art Carney in 1965, including a hit TV series and a  female stage version.  </P> <P> "We've always talked about doing a sequel through the years," Koch said. "It's  been bothering me that we hadn't done it." So Koch asked for the meeting. "We  came up with an idea for a story that we all agreed on. Neil said he would do  it as soon as he can get some free time to write it, and then we'll go from  there." Daniel Cerone  </P></p>

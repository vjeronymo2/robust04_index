			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 6, IRNA -- Iran and South Africa are to  resume bilateral relations from May 10 after 15 years of severed  ties, following the historic victory of the black majority in  the country's first multi-racial elections this week which put  an end to apartheid and its racist policies. In a joint  statement released simultaneously in Tehran and Johannesburg  today, the two sides announced their readiness for resumption of  ties after talks between South African Foreign Ministry  officials and the Iranian interests section at the Swiss embassy  in the South African capital.    In Tehran, a foreign ministry spokesman congratulated the  South African nation on the victory of the African National  Congress (ANC) which polled 66.9 percent of the votes counted.    Iran broke ties with South Africa after the triumph of the  Islamic revolution in 1979. Switzerland had been looking after  the interests of the two countries since then. Iran, which was  South Africa's main oil supplier in the time of the defunct  shah, stopped all oil supplies to the racist regime after the  revolution.    Thereafter the Islamic Republic supported the South African  people's struggle against racial discrimination and sided fully  with liberation groups at international forums.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, March 19 (XINHUA) -- There are now  180,000 more adults who can read in northwest China's Ningxia  Hui Autonomous Region -- thanks to a three-year farmer's  education and training project implemented there to help rural  residents out of illiteracy.    The ten-year project aims to wipe out illiteracy and improve  the overall talents of rural people in this comparatively  backward region of the country.    Previously, illiterate people aged between 14 and 40 made up  22 percent of the 4.8 million rural population of the autonomous  region.    During the past three years, local government has earmarked  six million yuan to set up 2,158 cultural and scientific  schools, 2,800 popular science associations and 200-plus  specialized technique societies for local farmers.    Some 318,000 rural people have participated in literacy  classes and 180,000 of them can now read and write.    Two million farmers have learned some farming techniques  that  can help them make more money, thanks to the fruitful work of  training programs offered by the project.    All over the region, more than 20,000 local teachers and  technicians have enthusiastically taken part in the project and  work with much patience and devotion.    The Asia-Pacific Committee of the United Nations  Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization has also provided  assistance to the widely-praised project.</p>

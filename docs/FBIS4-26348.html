			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Vice Foreign Affairs  Minister Chen Hsi-fan said Monday [20 June] he is not optimistic  about the possibility of President Li Teng-hui's desired visit  to the United States.    Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting,  Chen said that although several American congressmen have  invited Li to visit the United States, the invitation does not  represent the American Government's stance.    "Without the US Government's approval, President Li still  cannot visit America," Chen noted.    As the US administration still insists on its so-called "one  China" policy, he said the chances for Li to visit the United  States remain slim.    Chen said the US is expected to finalize a comprehensive  review of its policy toward the Republic of China [ROC] at the  end of this month, and may allow the ROC to rename its  representative office in America to make its presence more  conspicuous.    Taiwan's representative office in the US is currently called  the Coordination Council for North American Affairs. The ROC  has long hoped to change the title to the "Taipei Representative  Office."    Barring unexpected developments, Chen said, the US will  approve the renaming proposal when it makes public the results  of its Taiwan policy review.    Reports from Washington said the Clinton administration may  also ease restrictions on high-level contacts with Taiwan in  response to mounting congressional calls for upgrading ties with  Taipei.    The reports said the United States may not formally announce  the lifting of its ban on high-level contacts with Taiwan, but  it will instead send suitable ministerial-level officials to  visit Taiwan at appropriate times in the future.    In late 1992, then US Trade Representative Carla A. Hills  became the highest-level incumbent American official to visit  Taiwan since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979.    The reports said the US State Department completed a 60-page  review of the country's policy toward Taiwan late last year.  The document was, however, then shelved because of escalating  tensions between Washington and Beijing over the renewal of the  mainland's most-favored-nation trade status. Because the issue  has been resolved, the reports said, the Clinton administration  is scheduled to publish the review in late June.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: GEC Alsthom nuclear deal GEC ALSTHOM Engineering Systems, part of the Anglo-French engineering group, has won an important contract from Paks Nuclear Power Plant of Hungary for a proposed spent nuclear fuel store at its 1,760MW nuclear power plant. The contract will provide a spent fuel store for all four of Hungary's VVER-type pressurised water reactors. Before the Soviet Union collapsed, it supplied fuel to VVER-type reactors in eastern Europe, pledging to take the spent fuel back. But Russia will no longer do this, making east European countries find an alternative to switching the plants off. The system chosen is GEC Alsthom's modular vault dry store system, approved in the US to store a wide range of spent fuel types and in service at a Colorado gas-cooled reactor plant.</p>

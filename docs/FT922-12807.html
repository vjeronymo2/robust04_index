			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Gould seeks to offer radical agenda: The race to lead Labour IT IS a measure of the task facing Mr Bryan Gould that his candidacy for the Labour leadership is being championed in terms of the need for a frank post-election debate on what direction the party should take. Mr Gould is a thoughtful man who campaigns effectively and has the knack of getting on with people. He can claim to have leadership qualities. But instead his candidacy is being presented as a means to an end, so as not to be seen as a spoiler prepared to sacrifice party unity on the altar of personal ambition. If he is to upset the already formidable Smith bandwagon, Mr Gould will have to demonstrate that he has a cogent and distinctive view of what the future should hold. This may be easier said than done, not because the shadow environment secretary lacks vision but because the traditional categories of left versus right are of limited value in delineating how his and the shadow chancellor's views differ. A more fruitful tack, as Mr Gould's supporters may find, could be to portray their New Zealand-born protege as the radical alternative to Mr Smith's small 'c' conservatism. This was the approach Mr Gould appeared to be groping towards yesterday when he spoke of the need to 'move forward with a positive and radical agenda'. A key aim of his campaign would be to convince party power brokers  - in the words of one aide  - that 'reassuring people who defected in 1983 and 1987 is no longer the name of the game'. To triumph in 1996 the party would need to do more than elect a safe pair of hands as leader. Mr Gould's radical bow has several strings. On economics he has argued strongly that a realignment of sterling within the exchange rate mechanism is necessary. Devaluation should be a once and for all step and could be accompanied by a move to the mechanism's narrow band. This stance is in tune with his notion of the 'proper purpose' of the exchange rate being to 'allow the economy to grow at a reasonable rate'. As a champion of the interests of industry against City short-termism, he has never been slow to highlight the link between an over-valued currency and poor manufacturing competitiveness. On Europe he still has a reputation as a sceptic but his true position is more complex and pragmatic, as he was anxious to point out yesterday. Britain's position in the European Community should be accepted and exploited, he argues. Although an advocate of 'subsidiarity', or power being exercised at the lowest possible level, he concedes there are areas of policy where a Europe-wide mandate could be desirable and appropriate. On Labour's internal reform he is a strong believer in one member, one vote. He said yesterday that he would favour the phasing out of the union block vote more rapidly than is currently timetabled. Mr Gould is one of the staunchest remaining apologists of redistributive taxation among senior party figures and sees a key role for employee share ownership in achieving a more equal society. On proportional representation, by contrast, he is almost as tortured as his opponent, resorting to the formula that he has so far endorsed the Plant Commission's recommendations. He yesterday advocated setting up a convention to deal with important constitutional matters but he gave no inkling of where his personal preferences lay. Mr Gould may also be able to exploit his yuppie flair in so far as it contrasts with Mr Smith's caution and dependability.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Born 1939 at Hawera, New Zealand Educated: Dannervirke High School; Victoria and Auckland University;           Balliol College, Oxford Previous occupation: TV reporter/presenter First elected MP: 1974 Constituency: Dagenham, east London Shadow environment secretary since 1989  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 17, BNS -- Estonian Defense Police on  Wednesday [16 March] formally brought charges against Pyotr  Rozhok, the representative of Russian radical nationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic  Party in Estonia.    Rozhok told BNS the charges brought against him were about  fanning inter-ethnic hostility. Rozhok in his speech in Narva  on Jan. 25 and in an interview with the Russian-language  SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK local newspaper of the northeast Estonian  town of Sillamae "fanned inter-ethnic and political hostility,"  the indictment says.    The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party at a meeting of  the Narva Union of Russian citizens had said President Lennart  Meri was a "president of the Estonians in the best case, not of  Russians," because the country's Russian-speaking population had  not participated in his election. He said the same of the  Estonian parliament.    In an interview with the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK Rozhok said  Estonia is a traditional Russian domain. He said the retired  Russian military living in Estonia should set up paramilitary  units "for defending their honor and dignity" in the case if  Estonian authorities decided to send them out from the country.    The indictment was read to Rozhok in the presence of a  deputy  consul of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, Valeriy Chalovsky.    Rozhok said he has to sign a document on not leaving his  permanent place of residence. He said he hasn't signed the  paper yet.    Rozhok had told the police he was no more going to appear  before police for interrogation. Security police officials had  then said he would be brought before police under compulsion if  necessary.    The Zhirinovskiy party representative last appeared before  Estonian police for interrogation on March 10. Deputy Consul  Chalovsky was also present then.    Rozhok on March 10 said he was not going to use the services  of Estonian lawyers and added he had no intention to pay to any  lawyer at all. "You yourselves have made up this soup, now you  also eat it," he said in explanation.    Holger Siigart, deputy head of the Estonian Defense Police,  said investigation into Rozhok's case was going to continue and  that Rozhok will in any case have to appear before investigators  to give his statements. Siigart also said the issue of the  defense lawyer was going to be resolved, but he didn't elaborate.</p>

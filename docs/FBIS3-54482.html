AL-DUSTUR has learned that the follow-up committee in  charge of preparing for this meeting has asked the leaders of  parties and national forces that will take part in this  celebration to get ready for departure to Amman next Sunday.    In the meantime, Yemeni Parliament Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar is still dissatisfied with the way the  document of understanding was issued. He insists that this  document, which was initialed on 18 January, should be ratified  by the House of Representatives, which is the constitutional  body in the country.    The Yemeni parties are engaged in controversy over the point  advanced by al-Ahmar. A bloc comprising the Yemeni Socialist  Party, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the Right [al-Haqq]  Party, and the Nasirite Popular Unionist Organization has  emerged. It says that, based on past experience, what the House  speaker is demanding is unnecessary. These parties, supported  by many independents, do not believe the new document should  pass through parliament. They say that none of the previous  unity accords was ratified by the House of Representatives and  that the new document is a covenant of honor and not a legal  pact. [passage omitted]</p>

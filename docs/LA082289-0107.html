			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILLMAN STUDYING $1-BILLION PROJECT ON SITE OF UNOCAL;  </P> <P> COMPLEX ON L.A.'S 'WEST BANK' WOULD BE ONE OF CITY'S LARGEST  </P> <P> Hillman Properties, which late last year acquired the Unocal headquarters  high-rise in downtown Los Angeles, wants to demolish the building and replace  it with a huge commercial complex valued at more than $1 billion, the company  confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> If approved by the city, the mammoth project would be one of the largest of its  kind ever built in downtown Los Angeles. It would take 10 to 15 years to  complete and include 5 million square feet for commercial offices, retail  shops, parking and a 500-room hotel, according to Robert V. Neary, vice  president for Hillman Properties.  </P> <P> "It will bring a world-class, multi-use project to that part of downtown Los  Angeles," Neary said, referring to the west side of the Harbor Freeway, also  known as the West Bank of downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Hillman Properties, based in Newport Beach, is part of the empire built by  Pittsburgh billionaire Henry L. Hillman. With investments in real estate,  industry and high technology, the 69-year-old Hillman is one of the richest men  in America, worth an estimated $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> The company paid $205 million for the land in a deal that included the 13-story  Unocal building, where about 1,200 oil company employees now work, and 13  surrounding acres of property.  </P> <P> Hillman Properties wants to build the project in three phases. The complex  would include the hotel, five office towers and an open air retail plaza,  according to Neary. Although he declined to estimate the cost of the  development, he said the project would have a value of more than $1 billion  when completed.  </P> <P> The first phase calls for twin 42-story office towers plus parking both above  and below ground; phase two would add two more office buildings, one 10 stories  and the other 65 stories, plus parking, and phase three would have a 25-story  hotel, a 35-story office building, parking and a shopping center.  </P> <P> Real estate experts in Los Angeles said the Unocal headquarters, built in 1958,  is an outmoded facility that needs expensive renovation work to rid the  structure of its asbestos insulation and provide it with a sprinkler system.  </P> <P> A law passed last year by the Los Angeles City Council in the wake of the  disastrous fire in the First Interstate bank building requires certain older  commercial office buildings in the city to install sprinkler systems within  three years.  </P> <P> Hillman Properties hopes to have the first phase of the project done in time  for Unocal employees to leave their old office digs and move into the new ones,  Neary said. But a spokesman for Unocal said the company had not decided what to  do.  </P> <P> "We have no concrete plans now," the spokesman said. "It's all under study  now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potentially Controversial  </P> <P> Hillman Properties is working on an environmental impact report, after which it  will formally apply to the city for building approval, according to city  planner Daniel O'Donnell. The company hopes to break ground on the development  in the third quarter of 1990.  </P> <P> The project may prove controversial because it promises to add more office  space in downtown Los Angeles, where several other pending projects are  eventually expected to lead to an oversupply of space.  </P> <P> According to Ralph Jackson, a downtown real estate consultant, "there's going  to be an awful glut soon," if all these buildings are approved.  </P> <P> The Hillman Properties project also has yet to get the blessing of Councilwoman  Gloria Molina. Most of the West Bank lies in Molina's district, although the  Unocal headquarters is actually just across the border from her legislative  area.  </P> <P> Molina has pressed hard to ensure that West Bank developers provide affordable  housing in the area in return for approvals to build.  </P> <P> City planners are developing a building plan for the West Bank that is expected  to be submitted to the City Council for approval within the next few months,  O'Donnell said.  </P></p>

This week the cabinet heard a report by Jeszenszky on the  consequences of the embargo, she said. According to the report,  UN member-states are not automatically entitled to financial  compensation for losses caused by UN actions, Juhasz said.    On a Hungarian proposal, the UN Security Council declared  that Hungary needs assistance in solving economic hardships  stemming from observance of the UN resolution. For this reason,  the Security Council appealed to the UN member states to provide  direct technical and financial assistance to easing the harmful  consequences.    The United Nations qualified Hungary's temporarily  suspending  its contribution to the UN budget as an acceptable way of  alleviating economic difficulties.</p>

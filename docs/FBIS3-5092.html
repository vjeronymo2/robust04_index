The premier declined to elaborate on what was discussed,  made  just after midnight Thursday Japan time, but a Japanese  Government source said both Hosokawa and Clinton agreed to make  efforts to avoid retaliatory action being taken. [sentence as  received]    The measure gives the U.S. Government power to retaliate  against trading partners deemed to be engaging in unfair  practices. The two leaders failed in talks on February 11 to  agree on a new trade framework to reduce Japan's surplus in  bilateral trade.    Government sources said the Hosokawa government will shortly  issue a statement to express its regret over the Super 301  announcement.</p>

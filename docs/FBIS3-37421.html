			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Bay report: "Moscow Has Drafted Program for </F> Protection of 30 Million Russians in Former Union Republics"]    [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has drawn up an  extensive program to protect the interests and support more than  30 million ethnic Russians living outside the Russian Federation.    As Teymuraz Ramishvili, chief of the Foreign Ministry's  International Humanitarian Cooperation and Human Rights  Administration and an author of the program, told IZVESTIYA,  this is a program designed for a period of years.    The program consists of three sections envisaging political,  economic, and cultural measures. The section on the creation of  the institution of dual citizenship stands out in particular.  This is the main theme at bilateral talks on the rights of  Russian-speaking minorities in the former republics.    The point on the creation of a special radio station, a TV  channel, and a press organ which would unite the whole Russian  community abroad is noteworthy. The program envisages help in  preserving the old and opening new Russian universities,  institutes, and high schools, and in funding Russian schools and  theaters.    In the event of ethnic conflicts or any acute aggravation of  the situation in any particular region it is proposed to  elaborate a mechanism for the emergency evacuation of Russians  and the provision of assistance to refugees and migrants in  extreme circumstances.    A special role in the protection of Russians will be played  by Russia's economic ties with the various states of the CIS.  It is planned to impose rigorous restrictions on the export of  Russian raw materials and energy sources to countries where the  rights of ethnic Russians are violated. One point speaks about  the establishment of a continuous, technically equipped state  and customs border with those states.    In the allocation by Russia of upcoming credits to states of  the former USSR it will be specially stipulated that a certain  proportion of the resources in question (20-30 percent) must be  used for the development of Russian education, language, and  other needs of the Russian diaspora.    Teymuraz Ramishvili acknowledges that the program will work  only if budget financing is found for it. According to  preliminary estimates it will cost around 3 trillion rubles.  Assistance from the private sector is a matter for the future,  although that sector could be given an interest in the project  through the generally accepted practice of a tax concession in  exchange for philanthropic activity.    The authors of the plan hope that, despite the enormous  financial difficulties, the program will be adopted as early as  the second quarter of this year.</p>

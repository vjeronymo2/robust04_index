			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: West drawn into Russian maelstrom WHEN Mr Yeltsin reaches Vancouver today he will be embarrassed to learn that his countrymen have provided a dramatic portrayal of Russia's plight. The cruise liner Maxim Gorky has been arrested off Vancouver Island with a full complement of passengers aboard - charged by a Miami company with not paying its bills. Mr Yeltsin has not paid his debts either. He has already secured a rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club, but he still comes with his hand out. For if a new package of reforms elaborated by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance and the economy, is to be implemented, it requires a vast amount of aid to be made available, quickly, and without the kind of conditions which have blocked critical parts of the assistance, set aside last year, from being paid. This summit is less a getting to know a new president, more a test of his - and his fellow western leaders' - ability and will to help. He has going for him the west's obvious concern over the continuing threat to the reform process which Mr Yeltsin is held to embody. This concern has drawn declarations from the west that it means to apply assistance more directly and more visibly than it cared, or was able, to do last year. Mr Fyodorov's package, unveiled to the Group of Seven 'sherpas', or senior officials in Hong Kong last month, is set at Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn); officials close to the negotiations say he might get Dollars 10bn. The money is to support specific projects in the energy, military conversion and agriculture sectors. It will help create a stabilisation fund for the rouble and support the budget, whose deficit is expected to rise to about 12 per cent of gross national product this year. It will pay for employment schemes at a time when unemployment , now officially over 1m, is likely to soarto more than 5m, with millions more in only part-time work. Vancouver will be the most conspicuous of the various the various meetings scheduled for this spring and summer to mesh Russian demands with foreign governments' ability to pay and with their own estimations of the ability of the Russian government to use what money will be provided. For though there are few doubts about the severity of the interlocking political and economic crises now convulsing Russia, there are even more doubts than last year as to the usefulness of western support. The struggle between Mr Yeltsin and the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies has left no clear result. The Russian president has dropped plans to hold his own plebiscite in order to brave a much tougher referendum set by the Congress. It means Mr Yeltsin faces a near impossible task, unless he can secure new terms, either through the constitutional court or in backroom negotiations with the parliamentary leadership. Until the April 25 referendum, he will be a super populist. He has already issued decrees almost doubling the minimum wage. Savings are to be protected from the ravages of inflation and has raised benefits for the military. If this is to be financed, further credits will have to be issued by the central bank. Yet it is precisely here where his government must act if it is to be credible in western eyes as a a reform cabinet. Inflation is estimated to be about 30 per cent a month and rising although Russian government officials claim it can be kept relatively stable at that level - below the hyper-inflationary mark - others are not so sure. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, adviser to the Government, says it could easily go out of control. 'The corrosive effect of the (present) inflation is eating into the very marrow of the reforms,' he says. A strong advocate for substantial foreign aid, he insists that the causes of inflation must be stemmed before it can be properly used. The key blockage identified by Mr Fyodorov is the the central bank and its chairman, Mr Victor Gerashchenko. Mr Fyodorov has asked Mr Yeltsin to fire Mr Gerashchenko - but the latter, constitutionally responsible to the parliament rather than the president or the government, remains in place. Western governments will naturally turn to the International Monetary Fund for advice on what to do. The IMF was, after all, given the job of acting as the lead agency in the former Soviet states. The agency had the task of telling the west when the Russian government should receive the various parts of the Dollars 24bn G7 package earmarked for such projects as, rouble stabilisation. Nearly half of the Dollars 24bn was made up of bilateral trade credits from G7 countries. Most of these have been paid in the past year and most has been used, often corruptly, for imports such as western liquor and cigarettes. A central problem for western governments is to ensure that the new funds will go to the projects for which they are designed. President Clinton this week called on the IMF to be more 'flexible' in its criteria for lending to Russia. Two days later, Mr Jean Foglizzo, the IMF's station chief in Moscow, uncharacteristically made an oblique public reply to the US president saying that 'lack of decisiveness' and no agreement between different levels of the Russian government on how to reform would stop the Fund lending until clarity was achieved. The west, he said, faced an 'historic choice' - between being seen to be doing something with fast aid, and continuing to make slow progress towards creating a virtuous circle of reform. 'The situation in Russia today is very alarming,' he said. Mr Yeltsin thus comes to Vancouver at the head of a desperate country - posing a desperately difficult problem. Can the west feel confident putting aid into such a political maelstrom? Can it feel safe in withholding it?</p>

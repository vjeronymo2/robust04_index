			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Generators told to pay part cost of pit rescue: Government ultimatum on five-year coal plan THE GOVERNMENT has warned the two main electricity generators in England and Wales that they or their customers must agree to carry part of the cost of taking more coal to keep pits open or it will force them to do so through legislation. The threat - revealed in a leaked memorandum and letter by Mr John Baker, the chief executive of National Power - was made earlier this month in heated talks between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and National Power and PowerGen. It demonstrates the difficulties that the government is having in persuading the two companies to take the 65.5m tonnes of extra coal over five years that it believes is necessary to win backbench approval for a pits rescue plan. If it is unable to secure a deal it would have to completely revise its strategy for saving about a dozen of 31 threatened pits. The documents, sent anonymously to Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, show that the generators have agreed that they could use an additional 40m million tonnes over the five years. They are also prepared to stockpile a further 15m tonnes against future usage provided British Coal - or the government - is prepared to meet the cost. That is not on offer. However, the generators say there is no market for the 65.5m tonnes. The government plan, revealed in the documents, involves British Coal supplying 15.5m tonnes next year and 15, 14, 11 and 10 in the subsequent years. Although the memorandum and letter were written in the first week of February, the generators have not changed their position substantially since then. Unless the government is prepared to lower its targets - and thereby risk backbench opposition to any plan it produces - the likelihood is that a white paper is unlikely this month as the government had hoped. In his memorandum, intended for use within the company, Mr Baker quotes himself as having told Mr Heseltine that 'matters had come to an extraordinary point if the government saw itself at risk of losing office, of sacrificing the whole of its energy policy and of intending to restructure several of the energy industries all because of the sake of 10.5m tonnes of coal'. The minute says that Mr Heseltine 'said that if we couldn't take the additional tonnage he would be forced to legislate . . . in so far as there were further costs, they should simply be passed to the customer'. In his letter to Mr Heseltine, Mr Baker says of the tonnages above 40m: 'Yesterday . . . you indicated for the first time that you expected the shareholders (of National Power and PowerGen) to carry the burden. It is now clear to us that in responding so positively to your requests to find more space for British coal, we were unwittingly invited to dig our own grave somewhat deeper.'</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (5): Marketing in the aisles - A visitor's guide to exhibitions HOW DOES an avid visitor select which exhibition to attend and which to avoid? To make sure of not being disappointed, spend a little time carrying out adequate pre-planning and research to ascertain precisely what an exhibition or conference offers; do not simply spin a globe in the search for exotic locations, and beware of hyperbole. According to Ms Vanessa Cotton, a partner in the Event Organisation Company, one of the ways of telling whether an exhibition will be worth visiting is good quality advance literature, 'with clear information and some real hard facts, about who is attending and so forth. If the advance brochure is full of pure hype, then I would say: beware. Also, look for support from other organisations. A good exhibition is a bit like a magnet: if it's going to deliver lots of stands, then it will generally attract support from trade associations and journals.' It is equally important to assess in advance what other events are going on around the exhibition as an indication of what extra benefits can be gained. For instance: is there a seminar programme? Are there any technical clinics? Are there opportunities to pre-book special meetings with exhibitors? The last is a trend which is growing in US-located exhibitions. Ms Cotton believes that the location of a venue is not the best guide to the quality of the exhibition: 'You can have a good exhibition in an inferior venue and some of the most fantastic venues have in the past hosted terrible shows. Much depends on the quality of the organiser and the organiser's long-term commitment to the exhibition.' Ms Diana Ambrose, vice- president of the International Association of Professional Congress Organisers (Iapco), agrees that there are no easily fixed rules about the best choice of venue, either for conference and exhibition organisers or visitors: 'People call and ask how best to arrange a venue, to which the best response is in turn to ask them 'how do you choose your holiday?' You look at where you want to go, how much you have to spend and what facilities you want when you get there.' Exhibitions, perhaps even more than conferences, provide a relatively cheap and easy means of keeping a watchful eye on new developments, as well as a chance informally to bump into competitors and customers. Their importance as a marketing tool is likely to grow, as advertisers become increasingly wary of spending vast sums for no easily measured return from conventional advertising, be it in television or press. But the industry consensus is that there is no handy guide as to which exhibitions to attend and which to avoid. There are criteria which visitors would be wise to consider before attending any exhibition, which can be summarised as the balance between the intangible gains - such as networking with competitors, customers and suppliers - and the practical costs of spending time away from production. 'It's at least a day out of your life, maybe more, and you may just end up walking up and down aisles looking at inferior exhibits; nobody has really thought building in any more opportunities for you to do business. When a show gives you a catalogue in advance of who is going to be exhibiting, that signals it will probably be a good show,' says Ms Cotton. Ms Ambrose believes that it is also vital for those considering staging an exhibition or conference to plan the objectives carefully. 'You need to know, as an organiser, where are people coming from, how easy is it for them to get to the venue and how many meeting rooms you want. There isn't really a top ten list of best venues because it depends so much on what the event is. 'People at a top management meeting may want to cloister themselves in a luxury five-star country hotel where no-one can get to them; they have a different set of venue criteria from an international association meeting for 5,000 people.' Mr Paul Swan, managing director of Spectrum Communications, suggests that an event venue is often a combination of the pragmatic and the appealing: 'International associations tend to choose those venues that have some kind of associated tourist appeal, and those cities which tend to be great tourism cities also tend to be great conference cities. 'A combination of both is essential; it is vital to have the infrastructure to support the show - you need flights from all over the world, a good range of hotel accommodation, adequate transport around the venue itself - but you also need lots of fun things for visitors to do after the event is over for the day.' Whatever the pros and cons of trudging round an exhibition, there are a number of factors which suggest that the visitor will have an increasingly wide range of choice. Primarily, the changing nature of marketing communications - a continuing explosion of television, radio and other broadcast media - plus a reluctance of companies and associations to return to the pre-recession days of high spending on conventional advertising, means that all forms of narrow-cast marketing (such as exhibitions) have become more attractive. Traders who put marketing cash into exhibitions can build a database of visitors who, by definition, have already shown an interest in their products and services by simply turning up to see what is on offer. For advertisers, the media world is becoming ever more complex; in 1978 90 per cent of all US television viewing was on the three major networks; now NBC, CBS and ABC combined have about 60 per cent. What advertising, if any, is the missing 30 per cent now watching? The same pattern is occurring with magazines. In the UK there were almost 4,000 consumer and business magazines in 1980; a decade later the figure was closer to 7,000. An exhibition can give both buyers and sellers one vital ingredient which broadcast advertising generally fails to achieve - personal contact. Competition will get fiercer, in all aspects of business. If anything, exhibitions are likely to become even more attractive, with more little extras to tempt the visitor than ever before.</p>

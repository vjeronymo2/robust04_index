			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Sues Insurer: The ad agency sued New Hampshire Insurance  Co. for refusing to pay for its defense in a number of investor lawsuits  pending in federal court.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Superior Court suit said New Hampshire Insurance issued a  directors and officers liability policy, agreeing to indemnify them against  most legal claims. The suits, filed by holders of Saatchi's American depositary  receipts, claim that Saatchi artificially pumped up the price of the receipts  and did not reveal its problems in absorbing a number of acquisitions.  Saatchi's suit seeks more than $100,000 and a court order that New Hampshire  must pay to defend the investor suits. (Filed June 19, 1990. Case No. BC003822)  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The NATO summit and the Lajes base were broached  by Foreign Minister Durao Barroso today. This morning the  minister met the defense committee in parliament to say that  Portugal's objectives for the NATO summit had been achieved and  that the Lajes base [Azores] negotiations are on the right  track. Lacalete Marques reports.    [Lacalete] Barroso briefed the defense committee on the  results of the NATO summit. The opposition also wanted to know  the state of the Lajes negotiations. The minister spoke of  cooperation and the wish to move away from the idea of financial  quid pro quos, obtaining other types of support for Portugal.    [Begin Barroso recording] The idea we wish to move away from  is the idea of quid pro quos: The idea that we give the base  and in return we receive a particular financial or other quid  pro quo. No, the concept we want -- moreover because it is more  in line with the dignity of a country such as Portugal, an  active NATO and WEU [Western European Union] member -- is one of  collaboration or cooperation toward a common objective that is  Atlantic security, Western security. [end recording]    [Lacalete] [passage omitted] As for the NATO summit, Barroso  said that Lisbon's negotiating objectives were met and he  explained what the Partnership for Peace accord meant for  Portugal.    [Begin Barroso recording] Partnership for Peace as an  answer,  I believe, is good, skillful, pragmatic, flexible, to the  problem of knowing how to, on the one hand, respond to the  security fears of the Central and East European countries,  without, on the other hand, creating a new border in Europe with  enemies further afield, namely Russia.

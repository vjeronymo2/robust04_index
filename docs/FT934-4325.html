			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Prison officer protest on rights to be blocked Legislation clarifying prison officers' trade union rights and preventing them from taking strike action is to be introduced by the government in the current parliamentary session. Last month Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, won a High Court injunction against the Prison Officers' Association establishing that, since prison officers had the status of constable, they could not withdraw their labour. The union plans to contest in court the loss of the right to strike. It appears that, even if it won, the victory would be short-lived because the proposed legislation would overturn it. Mr Howard said yesterday: 'I intend to introduce legislation this session which, while maintaining the position that it is unlawful for them to call industrial action, also extends normal trade union status to organisations representing staff who currently have the powers of a constable.' This would give the POA and its members access to industrial tribunals, pay bargaining procedures and other trade union activities. The government further strengthened its legal grip on the POA yesterday with a separate injunction against officers at Preston prison who had refused to accept new admissions. Mr John Bartell, POA chairman, told a special delegate conference earlier this week that constables had a duty to prevent breaches of the peace, and said officers would be within their rights to refuse admissions if they believed disruption or disturbances were likely. Officers at Preston turned prisoners away on Thursday but Mr Howard yesterday obtained an injunction against six POA representatives who, the Prison Service said, had contravened the instructions of their governor. Similar action had been proposed by officers at Hull prison on Monday. Mr Howard yesterday issued the first set of key objectives for police forces. The police bill in the present parliamentary session provides for the annual setting of key objectives to measure and enhance police performance, and the 1994-95 exercise will be a trial run before the bill becomes law. The objectives will require forces to seek to increase detection rates for violent crime and household burglaries, to provide high visibility policing, to respond promptly to emergency calls, and to target and prevent particular local problem crimes in partnership with other agencies and the public. Success will be measured by a series of performance indicators including the number of crimes detected per 100 officers, public satisfaction with levels of foot and mobile patrols and the percentage of responses to incidents achieved within target times.</p>

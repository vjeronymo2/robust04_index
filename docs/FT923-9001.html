			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Bully beef President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, though proud of his free-trade colours, has drawn in his horns of late. On his recent visit to Britain, Salinas dug in his heels and refused Douglas Hurd's advocacy of the Pounds 8m worth of Northern Irish beef which the Mexican authorities claimed was contaminated but which met all international health standards. But it would seem that Salinas has been stampeded into his protectionist stance. Patricio Chirinos Calero, a close friend of the president and his former environment minister, was publicly thanked by Veracruz cattle-breeders for keeping out foreign beef earlier last month. Chirinos, then standing for re-election as governor of Veracruz in Sunday's election, told the delighted farmers that accepting the foreign beef would have violated national sovereignty and endangered Mexican health. Now that the election is over, will Salinas get down off the stockade and let the beef in?</p>

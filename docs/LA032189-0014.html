			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW CHAIRMAN STEADIES COURSE OF CIPHER DATA  </P> <P> When Gary Liebl took over as Cipher Data Products chairman and chief executive  in January of 1987, he faced problems that would have daunted the most gung-ho  of executives.  </P> <P> Cipher Data's dependence on a single major product -- a tape drive used as a  back-up data storage device for minicomputers -- had come back to haunt the  company. The market for "minis" was under siege by the new generation of  powerful personal computers and workstations. As a consequence, demand for  Cipher Data's tape drives fell off and the company reported a drop in both  sales and earnings for 1986.  </P> <P> Moreover, Cipher was low on cash, suffered from a bloated inventory and faced  serious quality-control problems. To add to Liebl's worries, the company was  stuck with an apparent lemon: the Optimem optical disk drive unit it had  acquired in July 1986 that was losing millions of dollars trying to develop  elusive technology for an "eraseable" or re-recordable optical disk drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Total Restructuring  </P> <P> "The issues that I faced did not lend themselves to simple fixes but to a  fundamental . . . restructuring of the total company, including its top  management," said Liebl, who came to Cipher Data after eight years with  McDonnell Douglas. He had left as a group operating officer in charge of the  information systems group, a $1.2-billion, 18,000-employee unit.  </P> <P> Liebl wasted little time with the overhaul. The number of employees has been  reduced by 25%, to about 1,800, since 1986 and will be reduced by another 200  by the end of June. Only two of 10 corporate officers at Cipher Data in 1986  are still with the company. Organizationally, the company has been carved into  four groups, each with profit and loss responsibility.  </P> <P> To cut costs and improve efficiency, Cipher Data has moved the bulk of the  company's manufacturing operations to Singapore from plants in San Diego and  Garden Grove. The company has instituted a "quality college" for all employees  that has raised customer acceptance of its products to 99% from the 85% level  two years ago, Liebl said.  </P> <P> At Optimem, research on the eraseable optical disk drive has been scrapped as  the company focuses on its existing "write once, read many times" (WORM)  products marketed to mainly government customers with heavy document storage  needs, including the U. S. Patent Office.  </P> <P> Liebl's most recent move is Cipher Data's $74-million tender offer for Irwin  Magnetic Systems of Ann Arbor, Mich., a manufacturer of "minicartridge tape  drives" that provide backup data storage for personal computers and  workstations. The acquisition will add 3.5-inch tape drives to Cipher Data's  product line, which now starts at 5.25-inch drives and goes up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strengthened Position  </P> <P> The acquisition of Irwin, which reported a $1.5-million profit on $49.2 million  in 1988 sales, is being made possible by Cipher Data's strengthened cash  position of $82.2 million, up from $13 million 10 quarters ago, Liebl said.  Cipher Data will pay roughly half in cash for Irwin and the rest with bank  loans, treasurer Thomas Anderson said last week. The tender is expected to be  complete early next month.  </P> <P> The jury is still out on whether Liebl's restructuring will translate into  significantly higher profits, observers say. Cipher Data's $10.4-million profit  on 1988 sales of $185.4 million was an improvement over the $4.3-million profit  on $178.2 million in 1987 sales but not enough to satisfy David Claridge,  senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment bankers in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> "Two factors that I have concern about is that neither Cipher nor Irwin have  high pre-tax margins." Less-than-desired profit margins "have been a  longstanding issue with Cipher," Claridge said. And, although the Irwin deal  makes long-term sense by expanding Cipher Data's product line, it may reduce  earnings in the short run because Irwin's profit will be less than the interest  income Cipher has been making on its cash, Claridge said.  </P> <P> The stock market has responded less than enthusiastically to the Irwin merger.  Cipher Data stock closed Monday at $8.375 a share, off from a 52-week high of  $11 set last month before the deal was announced.  </P> <P> Liebl acknowledged the Irwin deal may hurt profits at first. But he said the  earnings dilution is an acceptable price to pay for entry into a growing market  that is 52% controlled by Irwin.  </P> <P> High growth prospects for Irwin's 3.5-inch tape drives were attested to by Bob  Abraham, vice president of Freeman Associates, a Santa Barbara-based market  research firm that tracks computer peripheral-product sales. He said unit  shipments of 3.5-inch tape drives should triple from 500,000 units shipped in  1988 to 1.5 million units in 1992. The dollar value of the 3.5-inch tape-drive  market will grow over that time from $120 million to $320 million, he said.  </P> <P> "Irwin has dominated that market, so if Cipher Data can simply maintain that  dominance, they are in a growth market," Abraham said. The growth afforded  Cipher by Irwin is needed because the market for Cipher's existing  bread-and-butter products will grow only at a 5% to 8% rate in coming years, he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-Billion Company  </P> <P> Liebl said the Irwin acquisition will bolster his goal of Cipher Data becoming  a $1-billion company by 1996 as well as the world's largest supplier of  "removable media" data storage equipment. To round out Cipher Data's product  offerings, Liebl said, the company may well buy a floppy disk drive  manufacturer at some point.  </P> <P> And he defended Cipher's profit margins, saying the company has made heavy  investments in the development of new products that will pay off later. The  future of one of those products, Cipher Data's 3000 line of half-inch removable  cartridge tape drives, is still unclear however. Cipher Data had hoped to  introduce the product last year with an International Business Machines  imprimatur in the form of a major supply contract. But IBM passed on the  product, whose development it had helped finance, and now Cipher Data is  marketing the product on its own.  </P> <P> Those issues aside, Claridge and others commended Cipher's chairman for  crafting a leaner, more focused and broadly based company. "Liebl has made a  big difference," said David Claridge, "He has stabilized the company and has it  focused on internal operating disciplines."  </P> <P> Bob Katzive, vice president of Disk/Trend Report, a Mountain View market  research firm, said: "I think they've come from a long way back. For a while,  people wondered if (Cipher Data management) knew where it was going."  </P></p>

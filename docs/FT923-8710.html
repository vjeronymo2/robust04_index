			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Using force in the Balkans CONFRONTED with the escalating conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the mounting evidence of barbaric behaviour by the parties, it is hard to avoid an overwhelming sense of helplessness. Understandably, western public opinion clamours for military intervention to halt the fighting, or to mitigate its worst excesses. Equally understandably, western governments approach that idea with the utmost caution, seeking ways to avoid exposing their own soldiers to mortal danger on the ground. Yet events have developed a logic that poses a stark choice for political leaders in western Europe and the US: either they can seize the initiative now and start making a clear-headed calculation of how they might sensibly use force; or they will face the danger of being sucked into the conflict in an ill-planned and ineffective fashion. Which way will they go? So far, the signs are not encouraging. President George Bush, gripped by pre-election paralysis, says he will go along with any course of action agreed in the United Nations Security Council but states flatly that he will not succumb to political pressure to send troops no matter what the circumstances. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, proposes enhancing the UN relief effort by setting up armed aid convoys, but on a basis so modest as to be almost irrelevant. Meanwhile, the voices urging direct military intervention on one side of the conflict - to punish Serbia and its Bosnian proxies, to 'take out' their heavy weaponry, or even, as Lady Thatcher has proposed, to arm their Moslem enemies - grow louder all the time. Misguided voices Those voices are misguided. True, offensive action against the Serbs might serve to suppress the worst of the fighting for a while - for example, by destroying artillery emplacements or tanks. But to have such an impact force would have to be used on a massive scale and over a protracted period; given the highly localised nature of much of the fighting, it would almost certainly entail bloodshed among civilians as well as among the foreign troops reminiscent of the Lebanese civil war. Nor, although the Serbs bear a disproportionate share of the blame for the conflict, are they by any means the only guilty party. Doing nothing, however, is no longer an option. The Serbs' deliberate strategy of grabbing land and driving Bosnian Moslems from their homes is so morally repugnant as to cry out for a response. It is creating a refugee problem that will haunt the rest of Europe for years, if not decades. And there is a constant danger that unless the west is seen to act, the conflict will spread, dragging in neighbouring and Middle Eastern countries and setting a precedent that will be noted by would-be dictators all over the former Soviet empire. No guarantee These problems are vast and intractable; no strategy to confront or contain them is assured of success. But there are practical ways in which the application of western force might help. First, European countries and the US - perhaps working through Nato, under authorisation from the UN Security Council - could undertake a significant expansion of the humanitarian relief effort, backed by military force on a scale sufficient to ensure its reliability. The mission would be to establish permanent relief corridors from the Adriatic and from Sarajevo airport to besieged Bosnian cities; any violent attempt to interfere with it would be met with equivalent force. Second, air and sea power might be deployed to tighten and strengthen sanctions on Serbia, establishing a blockade on its borders, its airspace, on trade routes such as the Danube and on its supply lines to its surrogates in Bosnia. Third, military assistance could be provided for the establishment and protection of 'safe zones' for displaced persons close to their homes. This needs to be accompanied by the provision of adequate refugee facilities further afield - including in Britain. All these forms of action must now be explored in practical detail, at the same time as the diplomacy continues in yet another international conference in London. From now on, western governments will have to consider force as an inescapable complement to diplomacy. It is time to weigh the scale and purpose of military intervention rather than to debate its need.</p>

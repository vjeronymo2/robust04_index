			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Liberals look to exploit Tory split on Europe The Conservatives were fighting to bridge a renewed split over Europe yesterday, as the Liberal Democrats tried to outflank the government by pledging to hold a referendum on further moves towards European integration. As campaigning for the June 9 European parliament elections resumed, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, appealed to the Tory party's Euro-sceptic wing to unite behind the election manifesto to be issued today. The manifesto, A Strong Britain in A Strong Europe, will focus on Euro-sceptic concerns such as the preservation of the UK veto on European initiatives on taxation, defence and immigration. Mr Hurd, trying to allay rightwing fears, described himself as a 'Euro-realist', and accused the European Commission of going 'too far into the nooks and crannies of all our lives'. His remarks, in a BBC interview, echoed his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference two weeks ago when he committed the government to seeking a flexible Europe of nation states. The comments were reinforced in a letter sent to thousands of voters in marginal seats by Mr John Major, pledging the Tories to block any moves towards federalism. But the government's claims that Britain is winning the argument for a less centralised Union were rejected by Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 1992 group of rightwing MPs. Writing in the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group's summer magazine, Sir George said the party's natural supporters were 'totally opposed to being sucked by degrees into a federal Europe'. The Liberal Democrat manifesto, also published today, promises to seek 'popular assent' for 'fundamental changes' agreed at the European Union's next intergovernmental conference in 1996. The stance contrasts with Mr Major's refusal to consider a referendum. The manifesto also proposes cuts in the size of the Commission and the Council of Ministers, and a stronger European parliament elected proportionately to size of population. It also calls for a federal Europe, an independent central bank, and progress towards a common foreign and defence policy and a European army. 'We don't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for Britain's sake,' said Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader. Labour's manifesto, also published today, will commit the party to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and an eventual single European currency.

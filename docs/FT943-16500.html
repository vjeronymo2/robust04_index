			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: News round-up - Thailand The acquittal of Sia (Tycoon) Song, an influential stock market speculator has prompted Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission to consider setting up a task force to investigate the trading of suspected share cheats. The Police Department's economic crime suppression unit, which investigates the activities of market manipulation, is felt to be technically weak and too open to political influence. The two-year-old stock market watchdog lost its first prosecution case when one of the local courts - which are always reluctant to find against the socially well-connected - said last week that there was insufficient evidence to show that Mr Song Watchararirong and eleven associates had ramped the price of Bangkok Bank of Commerce shares in 1992. The House of Representatives committee looking into stock market regulation has suggested a task force similar to Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department, which has the power to subpoena witnesses and to confiscate evidence.

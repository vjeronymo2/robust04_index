			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Bosnia peace hopes rise after sanctions threat THE United Nations and European Community were last night close to winning agreement on two major documents that could form the basis for bringing peace to the Balkans, including Bosnia-Hercegovina. This emerged after the first day's intense negotiations behind closed doors at the London conference on the former Yugoslavia. The conference, sponsored jointly by the UN and EC, opened as the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo suffered the most intense mortar attacks and gun battles in more than a month, with at least six people killed. EC diplomats said that if the two documents were accepted by all the republics of the former Yugoslavia, this could pave the way for discussions on the foundations for a future constitutional arrangement for Bosnia. The first document, a Statement of Principles, says all sides involved in the bitter ethnic fighting in Bosnia, and all the other republics, must accept the principle of the inviolability of borders. The second document, an Action Programme which was last night accepted in principle by all the feuding sides, will set up six working committees once the London conference ends later today. The committees, among other things, will try to promote a constitutional settlement for Bosnia, as well as seeking a long-term solution to the region's ethnic minority problems. The Statement of Principles stipulates that all sides must guarantee human rights, condemn forcible deportation, allow the safe return of those deported from their homes and stop seizing territory. EC diplomats said last night Serbia was still reluctant to agree to this document. But Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump Yugoslav federation, said he would try to persuade other Serb leaders to accept it. Mr John Major, prime minister of Britain, which holds the EC presidency, warned that Serbia would face more isolation if the Belgrade government did not take steps to stop the fighting in Bosnia. Attempting a 'carrot and stick' approach, he promised to speed reconstruction aid and integration into the international community of those who co-operate with the peace process. But he added in a clear reference to Serbia, that it faced 'economic, cultural, political and diplomatic isolation' if it failed to act. The day included diplomatic posturings by Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic, who briefly stormed out in protest at his observer status. British and EC officials, meanwhile, said the conference was close to a formal agreement on the planned expansion of the UN force in Bosnia so that troops could guard convoys taking food to the civilian population. Canada announced yesterday it would send 1,200 troops to support such an operation. Britain last week said it would contribute up to 1,800 troops and Italy and France are among other nations who have already pledged contributions.

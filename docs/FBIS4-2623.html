			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Spark Program has  been very fruitful since it was launched eight years ago.    More than 14 million experts in different fields have been  trained in 367 state and 173 provincial centers, who have played  a key role in the development of rural economy, especially in  the coastal provinces.    Some 50,000 projects have been implemented through the  program, covering 85 percent of the country's counties. Half of  the projects have generated obvious economic and social profits.    These were revealed at an international conference on  China's  Spark Program, which ended in this capital of Zhejiang Province  Friday [8 April].    The conference was jointly sponsored by the SCST [State  Commission for Science and Technology], the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation and the U.N. Development Program.  Participating were delegations from 18 countries and from 17  provinces in China.    The Spark Program was launched eight years ago, aimed at  spreading modern farming techniques and train technical  personnel for both farming and industrial enterprises.    Experts attended the conference agreed that the shift of  focus in the program will make rural enterprisers to be "ready  for the market economy and world economic competition" in the  country's better off coastal areas, in addition to training more  technicians and experts in certain lines of production.    "Technical training and product development will be combined  in the process to better transform science into productivity," a  SCST official said.    In the less developed inland rural regions in the country,  the program will center on promoting production and product  development based on their local natural resources, according to  the SCST.    The SCST and local science and technology commissions will  help to establish more pilot group companies in the countryside,  whose annual output value will hit 100 million yuan (11.63 U.S.  dollars), and generate an output value of more than 10 million  yuan a year. Some 100 such companies have already been  established through the program.    The SCST cited Li Lianzhi as an example. Li, now president  of Tianjin driving school, used to be a farmer peddling  vegetables. After being trained in the spark program, he now  possesses 4 research institutions, 89 branch companies and 35  enterprises, whose annual output value has reached 100 million  yuan.    The Spark Program provided township enterprises with easily  applicable technologies and better management expertise, the  SCST said.    It is also conducive to narrowing the gap between the rural  and urban areas and between the coastal and inland economies,  experts said.    Groups of technicians in research institutions and  universities were organized by the state and local science and  technological commissions to spread technologies, solve  technical problems and launch technical projects for the rural  and inland regions in winter or summer vacations and holidays.    Brought to the farmers are not only advanced and easily  applicable technologies, but also new bio-technology.    "Farmers have come to realize the importance of science and  technology in farming, livestock and fish breeding, and running  enterprises," a scst official said.    As a result, many training centers and research institutions  have been established spontaneously by the farmers-turned  entrepreneurs, the official said.</p>

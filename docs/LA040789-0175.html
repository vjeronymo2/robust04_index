			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RESTART OF RANCHO SECO APPROVED  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today it will not interfere with plans  for restarting the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear power plant near Sacramento.  </P> <P> The commission's action came after a briefing by the staff in which it said it  disagreed with the conclusion of a private industry watchdog group that recent  troubles at the plant were the result of pressure to avoid a required shutdown  if it did not operate enough.  </P> <P> Victor Stello, the commission's executive director for operations, told the  commission that if it did not object, "it would be our intention to allow the  restart of" the 913-megawatt plant operated by the Sacramento Municipal Utility  District.  </P></p>

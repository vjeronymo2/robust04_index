			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Hard lessons ahead for class of '92 - Restoring order to EC is main aim of summit LIKE most gestures born of panic, the idea of an emergency summit of European Community leaders seemed like a good one at the time. Four weeks ago, the money markets were in chaos, and the result of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty appeared in doubt. The sense of an imminent political and economic explosion has now passed, and this may explain the lack of enthusiasm in Brussels and other European capitals for today's special one-day summit in Birmingham. The British presidency under Prime Minister John Major has set its sights low for Birmingham. In part, this reflects a lack of time for adequate preparation; but it also highlights the fear of failure. As Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, observed yesterday: the importance of the Birmingham summit is as much psychological as political. Ever since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty on European Union in last June's referendum, the EC has been suffering from a crisis of confidence in its leaders, its institutions, and its future. This crisis erupted in Denmark, and then spread during the summer to the UK, and finally to France, when popular frustration with the government almost led to the defeat of the Maastricht treaty in the September referendum. Germany has not been immune - popular disenchantment with the EC is growing, fuelled by resistance to giving up the Deutschemark in return for the single European currency prescribed by Maastricht. The accelerating economic downturn in Germany and elsewhere in Europe has raised further doubts about the common drive for economic convergence and future European monetary union. What is striking about today's summit is how little attention this new political and economic reality is likely to command - despite its direct relevance, not just to the ratification of Maastricht but also to the prospects for implementation of the treaty's provisions. Thus, it is unlikely that any serious debate will take place on how to pull member states out of their deflationary spiral; nor how to overcome French objections to a Gatt multilateral trade agreement which British, German and American officials say is within reach. Equally, a discussion on possible reforms to the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) will be confined to generalities. Instead, EC leaders will focus on presenting a consensus which covers three essentials: early ratification of Maastricht, without a renegotiation of the treaty; subsidiarity - the Brussels buzz-word for devolving power to the lowest appropriate level, be it national, regional or local; and transparency, a loose term which means opening up decision-making to more public scrutiny and emphasising the benefits of the Community to the ordinary EC citizen. The devil lies in the details. A British commitment to early ratification has partially restored Mr Major's battered EC presidency, removing the suspicion among its partners which followed sterling's withdrawal from the ERM last month. But it does nothing to solve the Danish question. Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, will today propose opt-out possibilities from the Maastricht treaty. Such an intervention is viewed in Brussels as more than a foretaste of Danish demands for Maastricht modifications. These spell protracted negotiations over the next two months, the outcome of which is by no means a foregone conclusion. The subsidiarity debate is also fraught with difficulty. The best that British and other European diplomats in Brussels expect from Birmingham is a declaration of principle - in plain English rather than the convoluted Euro-jargon in the Maastricht treaty - which may be sweetened by the promise of future action to stamp out unnecessary meddling by Brussels. One idea gaining support is for Mr Delors to produce 10-20 planned EC directives which could be scrapped early next year (just in time to impress British MPs who are likely to be scrutinising the Maastricht treaty line by line in the House of Commons). Scrapping existing Euro-legislation is another matter. Despite British interest in rolling back the frontiers of some Community legislation, Commission officials have found it difficult to come up with examples which would avoid challenges in the European Court. The British pet-hate - the 48-hour working week directive - cannot be cited because it would upset France and Germany, the chief proponents, according to UK officials, even though it captures precisely what many people in the UK resent most about harmonised rule-making in the Community. In recent weeks, propelled by the shock of sterling and the lira leaving the ERM and the imposition of temporary exchange controls in Ireland, Portugal and Spain - there has been a good deal of talk about a two-speed Community. Some of the rumours have been aimed at prodding Britain to stop hiding behind the Danes and ratify Maastricht; others, particularly in Germany, derive from resistance to giving up the D-Mark. Birmingham will seek to emphasise that, whatever the difficulties, the EC remains a Community of Twelve. It is not a privileged club. The image of unity will be paramount. Yet however well the British stage-manage this briefest of summits, the lingering impression is that the Community has yet to contain - let alone conquer - the crisis which has been gathering since the Danish mutiny last June.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONABLE STYLE OF SOVIET CHIC  </P> <P> Some of the Soviet-inspired fashion items mentioned in "Bloc Busters" by  Rose-Marie Turk (Feb. 23) are indications of some very sick minds.  </P> <P> In particular, I am referring to Harvey Russack and his Unique Clothing  Warehouse using Soviet prison uniforms to make a fashion statement.  </P> <P> My parents were both sent to Russian slave labor camps during the 1940s --  where they both perished -- so don't blame me for not getting exactly  enthusiastic about this extremely insensitive way of making a "fashion  statement." I bet Russack thinks this is all very funky and humorous.  </P> <P> PAUL VOZNESENSKY, Long Beach  </P></p>

For the nine months to the end of  September 1993, pre-tax income reached SKr1,855 million, more  than 15 times the Skr122 million recorded in the comparable 1992  period.    The net result was a SKr347 million profit for the third  quarter of this year compared with a loss of SKr205 million in  1992. In the January to September 1993 period, net income was  SKr928 million versus last year's SKr9 million.    Net sales rose 54.7 percent to SKr15,021 million in the  quarter and 41.3 percent to SKr42,415 million in the nine-month  period. Order bookings in the January to September 1993 period  totalled SKr49,210 million which was SKr11,483 million more than  the amount of orders booked in the same period in 1992. 1993's  sales and order bookings were boosted by a decline in the  exchange rate for the Swedish kronor and, if this was taken into  account, Ericsson noted that the increase in net sales was 20  percent and the order bookings increase about 10 percent.    The United States is currently Ericsson's largest market,  measured in net sales, followed by Italy, Sweden, and the United  Kingdom. Over the past year, China's share of net sales has  risen from three to six percent, which makes this country  Ericsson's fifth largest market.    "Radio communications" is the product area showing the  strongest growth and is now the largest of Ericsson's business  areas, both in terms of order bookings and net sales. The sharp  increase in net sales within this product group was mainly  attributable to sales of mobile phone systems and mobile phones.  Notable among the most expansive markets were China, Germany,  and Australia. Order bookings also rose sharply, with large  orders reported in China, the United States, Mexico, Germany,  and Australia.    "Public telecommunications" reported third quarter and  nine-month sales increases of 17.2 per cent and 15.6 percent,  respectively, despite the divestment of the former operator  activity in Argentina and the transfer of telecommunications  exchanges for mobile telephone system to "radio communications"  which took effect in January 1993. The increases were mainly  attributable to Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, and Malaysia.  Order bookings rose most in China, Spain, Australia, and  Thailand. Important orders were also signed in Saudi Arabia and  Lebanon. Ericsson's new switches for broadband transmission  based on ATM [asynchronous transfer mode] technology have been  ordered in Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Italy. SDH [synchronous  digital hierarchy] for digital signal transfer has been ordered  in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland.    "Business networks" reported strong increases in net sales  and order bookings. This was mainly due to the consolidation of  the Austrian company, Schrack. Major order bookings were  recorded in Spain, Argentina, and the Philippines.    "Components" showed an increase in net sales following a  number of deliveries of power equipment to markets in Germany,  Spain, and the Far East.    The increase in net sales for "defense systems" was only  marginally affected by currency rate changes, since most of the  customers are based in Sweden. Order bookings were slightly  lower than during the corresponding period in 1992 due to last  year's substantial JAS orders.

Of the totals,  SKr1,796 million was invested in Sweden compared with SKr786  million in the comparable period in 1992.    Since the beginning of this year, Ericsson has increased its  work force by 2,681 employees, bringing the total to 68,913 at  the end of September 1993.    Ericsson expects pre-tax earnings for the whole of 1993 to  be  "somewhat more than double" 1992's SKr1,306 million level.</p>

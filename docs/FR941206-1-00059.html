			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, existing affected sources will be required to submit the following reports:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The initial notification required by &sect;63.9(b);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The compliance status information report required by &sect;63.9(h) that should include calculations or performance test results demonstrating compliance with the emission limits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Semiannual reports certifying compliance with the Work Practice Implementation Plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If compliant finishing materials, thinners, or adhesives, or an averaging approach is being used, semiannual reports demonstrating on-going compliance with the emission limits; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If a control device is being used, reports as required by &sect;&sect;63.6 through 63.10 of the General Provisions to subpart A of part 63.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary of Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Environmental Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section will discuss the incremental increase or decrease in air pollution, water pollution and solid waste generation that would result from implementing the proposed standards. Nationwide impacts are provided for existing sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Air Pollution Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HAP emissions from finishing and gluing operations are controlled through emission limits on the finishing materials and contact adhesives used by the industry and through work practice standards. Emissions from cleaning operations will be reduced through work practice standards and an emission limit for strippable spray booth coatings. Emissions of VOC that are both HAP and non-HAP may be controlled in the process of meeting the requirements for HAP reduction. The quantity of those non-HAP VOC's that will be removed, however, has not been quantified. The estimated primary and secondary air pollution impacts that would result from implementing the proposed standards are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primary Air Pollution Impacts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The immediate air pollution impacts resulting from the proposed standards would be a reduction in the emission of HAP by the source category. At baseline conditions (i.e., the conditions that exist in the absence of NESHAP), total estimated HAP emissions from existing sources are 50,584 Mg/yr (55,744 tons/yr). If the proposed standards were enacted, these emissions would drop to approximately 20,825 Mg/yr (22,949 tons/yr). This is a total estimated HAP emission reduction of 29,759 Mg/yr (32,795 tons/yr).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actual reduction in emissions may be larger than that estimated here because the estimate did not account for the reduction of HAP from a number of the work practice standards. While most of the work practice standards are expected to reduce emissions, it is difficult to quantify the actual reduction. Emission reductions resulting from the restrictions on the use of conventional air spray guns and the operator training program were estimated, but no emission reduction was assigned to the other work practice standards. Therefore, the emission reduction presented here does not reflect the total reductions that may be achieved through the work practice standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standards could also potentially result in a decline in VOC emissions and a reduction in ozone or photochemical smog. While the HAP limits do not require the use of lower-VOC materials, the work practice standards should reduce the use of VOC containing materials and, therefore, VOC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Secondary Air Pollution Impacts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards are not expected to result in any secondary air pollution impacts. Secondary emissions of air pollutants typically result from generation of the energy needed to operate control devices. If some facilities choose to meet the proposed standards through the use of control devices there could be some secondary air pollution impacts resulting from the use of these devices. These have not been quantified here because it is anticipated that most facilities will meet the limits through the use of reformulated materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

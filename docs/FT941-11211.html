			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Enriching ecclesiastical experience that was part of life in the City Sir, The article by Colin Amery, 'Smiting the Philistines' (Arts, January 31), warning that once again the City churches are under threat, is one that all lovers of this unique heritage should heed. When in 1969 I undertook articles with a City firm of chartered accountants, the only advice I received from my father, who had trained likewise in his time, was: 'Take time off to see the City churches.' I happily followed his advice, visiting all 39 of them, John Betjeman's guide in hand, and singing in both of the two then remaining City church choirs. It was the most enriching experience of my City years. Tim Coghlan, managing director, Braunston Marina, The Wharf, Braunston, nr Daventry, Northamptonshire NN11 7JH</p>

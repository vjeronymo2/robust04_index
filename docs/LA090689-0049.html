			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) will get a seat on the House Agriculture  Committee if he wins a Sept. 12 special election for a vacant congressional  seat, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gebhardt (D-Mo.) said in Fresno. San  Joaquin Valley farm interests traditionally have had a seat on the powerful  committee. Condit is running against several Republicans and a Libertarian for  the seat vacated last May by Democrat Tony Coelho, who resigned when questions  were raised about his ethics in business dealings.  </P></p>

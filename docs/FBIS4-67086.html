			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News feature: "The Life of Thanong Siriprichaphong"] </F>   [Text] Thanong Siriprichaphong was born to a middle-class  family on 24 February 1952 in Si Chiang Mai District, Nong Khai  Province. He graduated from the University of Honolulu in the  United States with a B.A. After completing his secondary  education, his parents moved to Nakhon Phanom Province where  they started their business of bringing consumer goods into Laos  for sale and returning to Thailand with forest products and  scrap iron.    During the Vietnam War, Nakhon Phanom was thronged by  American G.I.'s. Therefore, it was not hard for Thanong to  boost his status to that of a tycoon by sending all kinds of  goods for sale to an American camp. Then, he was called Sia  [tycoon] Po Pet [Thai nickname meaning duck]. As he became  rich, he invested in various areas such as the Little Duck Hotel  in Chiang Rai Province, and also operated tour and entertainment  businesses in the Phatthaya beach resort town in Chon Buri  Province. At the end of 1992, the Little Duck Group comprised  19 companies. Among them was the Little Duck Travel Agency  Company which was granted the right to sell advertisement for TV  Channel 9 and thus ran into controversy. The company had to  face an investigation by the Counter Corruption Commission and a  lawsuit demanding compensation in a private case.    In 1993, Thanong planned for a huge land and real estate  development project in Chiang Mai Province. The project would  see the building of a hotel, a department store, an  entertainment center, an aquatic park, an Amusement park, a  business center, a market, and a wholesale market, all on 300  rai of land. At present, he is in the process of entering into  a joint venture with the Imperial Group in the Lat Phrao  Imperial World project in Bangkok.    By doing so, business circles wonder what successes he has  had to enable him to make such huge investments.    In politics, Sia Po Pet, or "Peter" as he is known in  English, was elected as MP [Member of Parliament] of Nakhon  Phanom Province for the first time in 1983 as a member of the  Social Action Party. In 1986, he moved to the Muanchon Party led  by Police Captain Chaloem Yubamrung. In that year, he stood  against General Mana Rattanakoset, former leader of the Ratsadon  Party in a general election in Nakhon Phanom Province and met  failure for the first time. In 1988, he moved to a new  constitutency to gain support from sub-district leader Kamnan Po  in another election but failed again. Despite joining hands with  General Mana in March, 1992, he failed once more. In September  of the same year, he ran in an election in Nakhon Phanom  Province as a member of the Chat Thai Party. This time, he  succeeded in being elected MP for the second time. Despite of  his reputation in business circles, it seems that not many  people know him as an MP.</p>

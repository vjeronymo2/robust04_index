			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Berlusconi backs down over curbs on powers of arrest Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, suffered his first serious reverse yesterday when he was forced to redraft controversial legislation restricting the judiciary's powers of arrest. The legislation, approved in cabinet last Thursday as a decree, split Italy's rightwing coalition and threatened to bring down the two-month-old government. The decree will now be formally blocked in parliament and the government will introduce new legislation in the form of a draft law. It will address the most criticised aspects of the decree that provoked the resignations last week of the Milan anti-corruption magistrates responsible for exposing the corrupt practices of Italy's political and business elite. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and one of the main critics of the decree, said yesterday he had no wish to bring down the government. However, he has taken advantage of Mr Berlusconi's difficulties to undermine the prime minister's authority. Yesterday Mr Bossi is reported to have blocked plans by Mr Berlusconi to make a nationwide televised address on the issue. Mr Bossi, in Strasbourg for the European parliament, co-ordinated his position with Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. These partners in the coalition, who have both campaigned hard against corruption, became increasingly critical of the decree as the public outcry grew. The compromise was patched up after 24 hours of hectic and angry exchanges between the coalition partners. The decree, which had immediate effect, will be superseded by a draft bill whose text can be amended during its course through parliament. The draft will restore the discretionary powers of magistrates to use preventive detention in cases of bribery, corruption and extortion that involve the public administration. These cover many of the cases in the anti-corruption drive of the past two and a half years that has changed the political face of Italy. It was the exclusion of these cases from preventive detention that caused much of the public outcry and allowed nearly 1,800 people to be released from jail. Of these, only 167 had been held on corruption charges. The government did not clarify whether those just released would be obliged to go back to jail. But the new law will not be passed by parliament, probably until mid-August. The new draft allows magistrates to retain the secrecy of their investigations of persons suspected of belonging to the mafia to beyond three months. The decree obliged magistrates to inform anyone immediately they were the subject of investigations. Proposed restrictions on the press have also been lifted.

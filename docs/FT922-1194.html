			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Price rises boost Wessex Water 16% to Pounds 76.9m WESSEX Water, the supplier of water and sewerage services from Bristol to Bournemouth, yesterday continued the flow of recent strong results from the privatised water industry. For the 12 months to end-March profits at the pre-tax level rose to Pounds 76.9m, a 16 per cent improvement over the previous year's Pounds 66m. The increase mainly refelected average price increases of 14.5 per cent. Wessex Waste Management, the 49.9 per cent-owned joint venture set up last year with Waste Management of the US, made a first contribution of Pounds 900,000. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman of Wessex Water, said the venture's profits were 'on track and it's going well.' Group turnover increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 190.8m. However, operating costs rose by 16.8 per cent due to inflation and one-off charges. These included Pounds 1.8m of extra severance provisions and Pounds 1.3m of bad debt provisions - a 50 per cent increase. Wessex has one of the lowest disconnection rates for non-payment of bills. Interest receivable, earned on money raised through the sale of a 14.99 per cent stake to Waste Management of the US, was unchanged at Pounds 8.5m. Capital investment on improving water and sewerage quality increased to Pounds 138m (Pounds 97m), although the depreciation and infrastructure renewal charge was stable at Pounds 29.4m (Pounds 29m). By the year-end the company's net cash position had declined from Pounds 94m to Pounds 15m. Although it was likely to become slightly geared in the current year it would return to net cash by the year end. Fully diluted earnings rose to 57.9p (50.3p) and a recommended final dividend of 12.9p (11.6p) makes a 19.5p (17.7p) total, an increase of 10.2 per cent. Dividend cover increased slightly to 3.4 (3.3) times. Mr Hood said Wessex was 'fully supportive' of recent moves by the National Rivers Authority to reduce abstraction from low flowing rivers. Wessex had cut in half its abstraction programme for the River Piddle in Dorset, he said. See Lex</p>

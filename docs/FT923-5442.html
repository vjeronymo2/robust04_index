			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The case for action THE London conference on the former Yugoslavia had one overriding purpose: to find ways of bringing peace to Bosnia and stability to the Balkans without the use of external force. Ultimately, this may prove to be impossible. But it is up to the United Nations and the European Community to implement all its conclusions with the utmost sense of urgency. The conference agreed on four documents which they will try to start implementing in Geneva later this week. But if the documents are to have any meaning, time is of the essence - as confirmed by the Serb bombardment of Sarajevo at the weekend. First, the UN Security Council must quickly amend the mandate of the UN forces in Bosnia. All humanitarian aid convoys must be accompanied by armoured personnel carriers, and protected by troops committed by Canada, France, Spain and the UK. These convoys must be ready to move in and keep the aid rolling when the Serbs lift their sieges of Bosnia's towns. If there is any time lag, the Bosnian government forces will, understandably, try to regain territory seized by the Serbs. This will encourage the Serbs to continue the war. Backed by a military machine from Serbia proper, they are in a position to do so. The UN must also be ready to place all Serb artillery and heavy weaponry under its control. There is no point in believing that Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, will order his forces to give up their weapons without international monitors on the ground. The UN should commit itself to a specific timetable as to when these monitors will be sent, how the flow of reinforcements from Serbia into Bosnia can be stemmed, when the ban on all military flights over the republic will be implemented, and when tougher sanctions will be imposed on Serbia. A lax timetable, or none at all, would be a recipe for failure. Banning military flights should be coupled with placing all military aircraft in Bosnia under international control. In Geneva, there must be moves towards reining in Serbia's own military machine. If this is not done, there is no reason to doubt that Serbia will use its aircraft and tanks against the ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo. Were that to happen, then Macedonia, whose independence has still to be recognised by the EC, will be dragged into the war: its own ethnic Albanian minority will defend their confreres in Kosovo. Since the UN and EC are not prepared to arm the Moslems or back the documents with force, this form of containment is essential. The UN and EC must then draw up a financial package to provide shelter for the tens of thousands of Bosnians whose homes have been destroyed by the Serbs. There is also a need to create safe havens within Bosnia. Without action now, the London Conference will have failed to stop the war, and failed to stop it from spreading.</p>

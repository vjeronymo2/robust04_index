			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: SQUID -- IT ONLY TAKES TWO HANDS TO FIX 'EM  </P> <P> For those unfamiliar with squid, the first experience of tackling the cleaning  of these mollusks with eight legs and two tentacles protruding from the head  can be intimidating. Actually it's a very simple task.  </P> <P> Thaw the squid if frozen. Rinse well under cold running water and drain on  paper towels.  </P> <P> Gently pull apart the head and mantle, or body tube (Step 1). Set the mantle  section aside.  </P> <P> Cut the tentacles off just in front of the eyes (Step 2) so they remain in a  ring. Discard the eyes and attached material.  </P> <P> The hard beak is often still attached to the tentacles. To remove it, squeeze  the thick center part near the cut end, pushing the beak out (Step 3). Discard  the beak, rinse the tentacles and again drain on paper towels.  </P> <P> Returning to the tube section, reach inside and pull out the long, clear quill  (Step 4); discard. Beginning at the uncut end, squeeze the tube between your  thumb and forefinger to remove the entrails (Step 5).  </P> <P> Peel off and discard the speckled skin with your fingers (Step 6). Rinse the  mantles inside and out and drain again on paper towels.  </P> <P> Frying is one of the easiest ways to prepare squid. Slice the mantles crosswise  into 1/4-inch rings (Step 7). Dredge the tentacles and rings in flour, dip into  beaten egg and then dust with fresh breadcrumbs. Deep-fat fry until golden  brown. Serve warm with lemon wedges.  </P></p>

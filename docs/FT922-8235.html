			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Sainsbury profits rise 21% to Pounds 628m J. SAINSBURY, the supermarket group, has overtaken Marks and Spencer as the most profitable UK retailer, announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 628m for the year to March 14, a rise of 21.2 per cent. The group's shares rose 20p to 459p on the news. Lord Sainsbury, chairman and chief executive who confirmed that he would retire in November on his 65th birthday, said that when he became chairman in 1969, M and S made profits nine times those of Sainsbury. In 1969 Sainsbury's annual profits were Pounds 4.3m - or Pounds 33m at 1992 prices - and the group had 244 shops, of which only a third were self-service supermarkets. Lord Sainsbury, who will become the group's president, said that over the past 20 years the compound growth rate of profits was 23 per cent a year. He said the 1991-92 figures represented a 'very good year's performance' and although he felt the economy was improving, 'I do not see any concrete signs of recovery'. The group's share of the retail market for food, drink, toiletries, confectionery, tobacco and newspapers had risen from 10 per cent to 10.4 per cent, a greater increase than that achieved by Tesco or Safeway, while Asda and Gateway, the other leading supermarket groups, had lost market share. Lord Sainsbury also said that the opening of a third of the shops on Sunday had increased the group's trade. Mr David Sainsbury, Lord Sainsbury's cousin, who is to take over as chairman and chief executive, said Sunday trading had been marginally profitable. Group sales for the year were 12.2 per cent higher at Pounds 9.2bn, and operating profits rose 14.1 per cent to Pounds 667.7m. Following the Pounds 489m rights issue last June there was interest receivable of Pounds 12.7m (against Pounds 35.6m payable last time), with the rights money accounting for Pounds 33m of the improvement. The group is setting aside Pounds 49.4m for profit sharing among 74,000 of the staff. Before property items costing Pounds 4.2m, pre-tax profits were 25 per cent higher at Pounds 632.2m. Fully diluted earnings per share, before the property items, rose 17 per cent to 25.43p and a final dividend of 6.35p gives a total of 8.75p, an increase of 20.4 per cent.

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: Culture of the absurd - Cinema GRUMPY OLD MEN (12) Donald Petrie THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN (PG) Stephen Sommers HOSTILE HOSTAGES (15) Ted Demme A BUSINESS AFFAIR (15) Charlotte Brandstrom What are the constituents of North American popular culture? Let me start with my postbag. I returned from Cannes to find two outraged letters from trans-oceanic readers, one calling me anti-Canadian, the other anti-American. In the first case I had quoted Leslie Nielsen as saying he was brought up near the Arctic, although his birthplace is, says the correspondent, 'further from the Arctic Circle than is London.' I and fellow journalists are accused of conspiring to paint Canada as 'one boring, amorphous lump somewhere in the frozen north.' In the second case, a Washington DC reader resents my claim that many US citizens 'have not heard of Arthur Miller, Einstein or the Pope.' I am, as you know, a registered acolyte of western Atlantic culture high and low. But part of that culture's appeal is the thin line between inert honesty and productive hyperbole. Nielsen was the one who played fast and loose with the Arctic's location. And while I have not personally polled America about Arthur Miller and Co, recently large numbers of America's youth did fail to answer the question 'Who was Adolf Hitler?' Let us come to Grumpy Old Men and The Adventures Of Huck Finn. The first is a Walter Matthau/Jack Lemmon comedy shot in what looks like the Arctic Circle - huts on frozen rivers, fishing through ice - but is actually no further north than Minnesota. And Huck Finn is about an American boy's dream of living a life of eternal truancy. Truancy from home, parents, education: in short, from what we shall hereinafter call EEBF (Everyone Else's Boring Facts). If Finn lived today, he would be a movie addict, where respectable truth is ritually sacrificed to radiant embroidery. The same spirit fills Grumpy Old Men as fills LN's assertion that he grew up cheek-by-jowl with the Eskimoes. We are asked to believe that Matthau and Lemmon both fall for new neighbour Ann-Margret and that she, an auburn-haired knockout even at 50, would be ardently torn between the two codgers. Grumpy Old Men does not so much 'stretch' plausibility as strain, split and finally lacerate it. But I found the film fun in direct ratio to its increases in absurdity. Matthau as a Don Juan? He looks more like a basset-hound trapped in a fridge. Lemmon as a sweet monastic widower? He looks more like Mr Executive Stress sent for a rest-cure to the icy north. But this is what movies are about. Hire that star; push him up that mountain towards Peak Preposterous; then have him tell his interviewers he was born in Katmandu, Spitsbergen or El Dorado. Grumpy Old Men is no masterpiece but it coaxed a cool Dollars 70m from Americans who know a class comic double act when they see one. The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is a masterpiece, on page, but has an odd habit of defeating people on screen. Twain's Mississippi was of the mind, just like Nielsen's remembered Regina, and his hymn to childhood fantasy, otherwise definable as the flight from EEBF, resists photographic re-enactment. Elijah Wood is a tousled, puckish Huck with eyes like UFOs. And Jason Robards as the King of Bilgewater, Twain's master fraudster, won gusts of laughter from the press show audience with his DIY cockney accent and A-Z knowledge of English landmarks. 'Where's Buckingham Palace?' Robards: 'Buckingham.' But the book's real magic is the river, and that is skimped: even though cameraman Janusz Kaminski, Schindler's List Oscar-winner, might have worked wonders if allowed out for long enough. Hostile Hostages is unhappier proof of our assertion that many Americans cannot have heard of the playwright, physicist and papal eminence cited above. If they had, this 'comedy' might have a less casual attitude towards dramatic structure, space-time improbabilities and marital break-up. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey play the bickering couple whose car and, later, home are hi-jacked by a fleeing burglar. As the footpad who referees their rows - the film's US title was The Ref - stand-up comic Dennis Leary looks as if he wished he had never sat down in his Disney actor's chair. Feeble dialogue destabilises an already strained plot conceit, and only dear Glynis Johns as Mum-in-law - how they wheel out the English actors for villain roles] - floats above the hi-concept banality. A Business Affair is set in London, but might be set in the Arctic for all resemblances to life in this city. The film is funny, but how much is it meant to be? Jonathan Pryce is the egomaniacal English writer married to model and would-be novelist Carole Bouquet (French). And Christopher Walken is the snaky, Italian-extracted American publisher who steals La Bouquet plus her works-in-progress. Director Charlotte Brandstrom approaches William Stadiem's script, drawn from two novels by Barbara Skelton, like a headmistress approaching a difficult but talented pupil. Her no-nonsense style irons the irony out of lines that we assume to be satirical but cannot be sure: 'I can't negotiate with Amis in a condition of frustration. I'm Sicilian' (Walken to sex-bored Bouquet). I hoped Martin Amis would walk in, pick up his dropped name and hurl it among the cameras, causing the film to jump about and get some style. With Walken and Pryce both in mint form - the first a flaky-voiced dandy with dancing eyes and teeth, the second tall, slim and deadly like an explosive pencil - the histrionic components are here. But the movie's own rhythms are relentlessly four/four, and Bouquet has yet to acquire enough convincing English phrasing to wrap around even simple lines. 'Why not call eet a naaht?' the actress asks at one point, causing us critics to nod in agreement. But no rest for culture monitors: it is half-term and the world is full of children's films. Besides Twain we have Rookie Of The Year and Josh And SAM Rookie (PG) is about a small boy (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who develops a miraculous pitching arm after an accident and plays baseball for the Chicago cubs. This made much money in America and we see why. Played for frantic charm, it has a frantic charm. Actor Daniel Stern debuts as director. Josh And SAM (12, director Billy Weber) is the lesser tale of a boy who persuades his brother Sam that he (Sam) is a Strategically Altered Mutant; hence name. As a result they travel all over America escaping from parents, schools and EEBF. In short, they are just like Huck Finn, Les Nielsen and the rest of us who love that wonderful world called Imagination and who will not be put off by Cantankerous of Canada or Apoplectic of America.</p>

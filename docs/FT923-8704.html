			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Citicorp seeks Dollars 650m via sale of Percs CITICORP, the largest US commercial bank, is planning to raise Dollars 650m of new capital via the sale of preferred equity redemption cumulative stock (Percs). Percs are a form of quasi-equity devised by Morgan Stanley, and offer a higher yield to investors than ordinary shares. They gained popularity last year, with previous issuers including the likes of K mart, Sears, Roebuck and General Motors. Under the terms of the Citicorp stock sale, which will take the form of a public offering of 32.5m depositary shares, buyers of the Percs will receive a dividend on their stock for up to three years. At this point, each share of preferred stock would convert into one Citicorp common share. Citicorp would have the option of converting the preferred stock to common shares at an earlier date, and the terms of the conversion could vary depending on the price of the bank's common shares.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Simitis Concerned About Minority Views </H5>   An article in the 3 April Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS  reports on Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis's concern over  behind-the-scenes activities occurring within the Panhellenic  Socialist Movement (PASOK) in light of the party's 14-17 April  congress. The article cites a number of sources as saying that  Simitis has often observed to aides that "a certain apparatus"  exists at the core of the party that attempts to exclude those  party officials who disagree with the views of the majority.  The article also cites Simitis' belief that the disappearance  of internal party minority views entails "tremendous political  dangers" and that, if this is not resolved at the congress,  PASOK will become "ideologically poorer" and face the June  European Parliament elections "with its wings clipped." Simitis'  concern is that the party not become a "mere manager for  government decisions."  <H5>  Yiorgos Papandreou on Succession </H5>   The Athens daily TA NEA published on 5 April an interview by  Notis Papadhopoulos with Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs  Yiorgos Papandreou. In the course of the interview,  Papadhopoulos asked the deputy minister whether his rumored  close relationship with Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis  would influence him after Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's  tenure. The deputy minister replied that while Arsenis is a  long-time personal friend, it is too soon to speak of a future  PASOK leadership, especially in view of the name he bears.  Papandreou added that he sees his role in PASOK as substantial  and that he will devote himself to party unity.  <H5>  PASOK Membership Profile </H5>   In the days leading up to the PASOK congress, an article in  the 4 April TA NEA provided a profile of the party membership.  Of 194,755 party members, 11.83 percent are between the ages of  18 and 24, 15.22 percent between 25 and 34, 26 percent between  35 and 44, 23 percent between 45 and 54, 15.3 percent between 55  and 64, 7 percent between 65 and 74, and 1.58 percent are over  75.

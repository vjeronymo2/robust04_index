			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [AP/YONHAP report from Nicosia] </F>   [Text] A 29-man North Korean military delegation led by  Cho Myong-nok, commander of the North Korean Air Force, returned  home last week from its long visit to Iran for the promotion of  Iranian-North Korean military and nuclear cooperation, agreeing  on the promotion of mutual military, nuclear cooperation, an  Arab weekly published in Paris reported.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reported that the North Korean delegation  consisting of experts in military technology returned home after  signing an agreement for the promotion of new military, nuclear  cooperation with Iran, but did not provide details. The North  Korean Government news agency KCNA reported on 12 January that  the North Korean delegation led by Commander Cho Myong-nok was  visiting Tehran but neglected to mention the purpose of the  delegation's visit. The Iranian Government press made no  mention of the North Korean delegation's visit.    Western and Arab sources reported that during the North  Korean delegation's visit to Iran, the two sides probably  conducted intense discussion on the issue of test launches in  Iran of the Nodong-1 medium-range missiles that have been  developed by North Korea with Iran's financial assistance.  Diplomatic sources speculated that the North Korean delegation  may have visited Iranian military and nuclear facilities,  including the (Shad) missile test base located 320 kms east of  Tehran.</p>

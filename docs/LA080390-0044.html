			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM  </P> <P> I have a sense of personal loss but also a feeling that that is dwarfed by a  community loss. Art's was a voice of sanity and enlightenment and above all  judiciousness and compassion in an era of rampant ignorance and inane  prejudices. Overall, a Renaissance man in a time when they're very scarce.  </P> <P> GLADWIN HILL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Talk of the Bundesbank THE BUNDESBANK remains determined to tease Europe's currency speculators. By cutting the repo rate by 20 basis point yesterday, the bank sent a strong signal that a discount rate cut is imminent. It then announced that no press conference is planned after today's council meeting. The absence of a press conference need not imply that the bank does not intend to deliver the interest rate cut which both Germany and Europe need. But the bank should not be too clever: whatever it does will need careful explanation. Yesterday's repo rate cut comes at the end of a fortnight or more in which the parities in the exchange rate mechanism have been severely tested. It also came the day after German headline inflation rose to 4.3 per cent, twice its 1993 target, and a week after broad money growth rose to 7.1 per cent, outside the bank's target range of 4.5-6.5 per cent. If the Bundesbank fails to cut the discount rate, it will inevitably be accused of trying to sabotage the ERM. If it does cut today, then, judged by its own lights, the Bundesbank can also be accused of putting European politics above German price stability The Bundesbank can avoid both charges. First, the bank should reaffirm that maintaining medium-term price stability in Germany remains its prime objective and will not be compromised by efforts to preserve current ERM parities. Second, it must show that a rate cut - of   3/4 of a point or more  -is consistent with this medium-term objective. The explanation might run like this: The current rate of broad money growth and consumer price inflation will not determine the medium-term inflation rate, although they will set the price level at which inflation can be stabilised. Monetary growth is currently above target because of public borrowing to finance the government's budget deficit. Consumer price inflation is temporarily high, in large part, because of the government's efforts to close this deficit by raising indirect taxes and other charges. The Bundesbank has tried, with much success, to offset this public demand for credit by squeezing private sector credit demand in west Germany. Real interest rates remain painfully high, private industry has suffered a severe recession and producer prices are falling. But there is a limit to the amount of damage that it is prudent to inflict to keep the overall price level down. What matters is that the bank prevent this short-term rise in inflation from feeding into medium-term inflationary expectations. The evidence suggests that inflationary expectations are currently depressed. Pay settlements in the 1993 west German pay round averaged between 3 and 4 per cent. Long-term interest rates have fallen by over 2 percentage points since their 1990 peak and, at 6.6 per cent, are both below their long-run average and probably consistent with the bank's medium-term inflation target. The Bundesbank should, of course, raise short-term interest rates immediately if long-term interest rates start to rise, wage inflation accelerates or the government's fiscal targets are missed. But, for the moment, Germany's inverted yield curve suggests a further cut in interest rates is prudent. Such a rate cut may prove enough to save the French franc's parity. But whether it does so is, ultimately, a matter for Paris, not Frankfurt.</p>

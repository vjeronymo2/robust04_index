			<p>BFN     [Text] Our foreign minister, Dr. Velayati, who had gone to  Egypt to attend the 11th session of the Nonaligned Movement  foreign ministers and to Syria for talks with Syrian officials,  returned to Tehran last night.    In an exclusive interview with our correspondent, he  explained the outcome of these visits. Regarding the status of  the Nonaligned Movement, Dr. Velayati said: The Nonaligned  Movement has found its true identity. The consensus that  currently exists among most of the members on important  international issues can steer the movement toward true  political independence. This could make the Nonaligned Movement  a fulcrum for strengthening the position of Third World  countries in combating the influential powers of the world.    [Begin Velayati recording] Of course, these are relative  matters. When we say that the movement is nonaligned, the  concept is that influential powers will not be able to  infiltrate. However in general, the movement should be  maintained as a tribune [preceding word in English] for the  countries of the Third World or countries of the South. This  was the unanimous view of all the members of the movement. In  fact, with countries such as South Africa joining the movement  and the acceptance of new members with observer and guest  status, we are witnessing a new peak for the Nonaligned Movement  in the aftermath of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.  When the Soviet Union disintegrated, there was a sort of  aimlessness and ambivalence in the movement. After two or three  years, I can say that the movement has once again found its  niche. [end recording]    Referring to the other matters which were discussed at the  Nonaligned Movement foreign ministers' session in Cairo in  addition to important international matters and the future of  the movement, Dr. Velayati said that discussions were also held  on the structure of the United Nations and on human rights. He  said: During this session, most of the members stressed that  Colombia should host the Nonaligned Movement's next summit.    Commenting on the most important decision on regional issues  made at the session, Dr. Velayati said:    [Begin recording] [Velayati] Regarding regional issues,  extremely appropriate decisions were made in favor of Lebanon  and against Israeli attacks. By consensus, Israel was denounced  by 109 countries for its savage attacks on Lebanon. Some  valuable decisions were approved in favor of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and against the Serbs. This marks a development in the  Nonaligned Movement. Approximately two and a half years ago,  when we raised the issue in Indonesia, it was difficult to get  even a tepid decision adopted against Belgrade.    [Unidentified correspondent] Were there any discussions  about the expulsion of Serbia from the movement?    [Velayati] The Belgrade delegate was not even accepted at  this session. In view of the fact that former Yugoslavia was  one of the founding members of the Nonaligned Movement, it was a  given that the Serbia-Montenegro delegate would not be  considered a representative of the former Yugoslavia. [end  recording]    It may be recalled that on his way back to Tehran, Dr.  Velayati met the Syrian President, Hafiz al-Asad and other  high-level Syrian officials and conveyed a message from  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to President Hafiz al-Asad. During  this visit which took place in the aftermath of the Zionist  regime's attack on southern Lebanon, Dr. Velayati met Sayyid  Hasan Nasrallah, the secretary general of the Lebanese Hizballah  and conveyed the sympathies and renewed support of the Islamic  Republic of Iran for the oppressed people of Lebanon.</p>

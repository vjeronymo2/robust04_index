			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Increased losses at Bank of Ireland's US offshoots THE US subsidiaries of Bank of Ireland incurred an increased pre-tax loss of Dollars 123.4m (Pounds 70m) last year, up from Dollars 99.8m in 1990. The result is a blow to any hopes of an early return to profits by Bank of Ireland in north America. The bank said yesterday that the loss reflected the continuing recession in New Hampshire where its subsidiaries operated and the very severe decline in real estate values during 1991. There is also a Dollars 4m extraordinary item arising from additional wind-down costs for Vendor Funding. Total assets of Bank of Ireland First Holdings, which controls the US subsidiaries, rose by 52 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn, and total deposits were up by 63 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn. Loans increased by 31 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. The increase in asset size reflected the purchases last autumn of Amoskeag Bank and BankEast Corporation. Mr Pat Molly, the chief executive, said that the core banking operations of the group's US banks had been hit by continuing losses on bad loans, but there were some signs now that problems with asset quality were slowing down. He said that rationalisation of the two new banks was proceeding at an encouraging speed and they should help provide a material improvement in Bank of Ireland's trading performance in the US during the current year.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: The intellectual organisation - What will companies be like in the next century? In the first of a three-part series this week, Charles Handy argues that the main challenge for employers will be keeping and motivating staff It is ironic, but just when capitalism has so clearly triumphed over communism, we are seeing Karl Marx's great dream come true in a way which he could never have envisaged. In ten years' time, in most successful businesses, the workers will truly 'own the means of production' because those means will be in their own heads and at their fingertips. It is now widely accepted that by that date 70 per cent or more of the work that we do will require brain skills not manual skills, and when that happens, the cliche that our people are our greatest asset will acquire a hard financial reality. That is when we will take notice. Already, many a business has a market value three or four times the worth of its fixed assets. To call the gap 'goodwill' is to trivialise it. That gap is the market's estimate of the worth of the intellectual property in the business - not just its patent rights, brands and research in progress, but the skills, knowledge and experience of its people. When Microsoft briefly topped the charts earlier this year, the New York Times commented that all there was to put your money on was 'the imagination of the workers'. No one can truly own that imagination except the workers themselves, and they can walk out of the door at any time. The emerging importance of intellectual property, broadly defined, is going to change many things beyond recognition. When every business that pursues higher added value thinks in the ways that financial service organisations, advertising agencies and consultancies already do, and seeks to turn its intellect into profit, what was of marginal importance will become commonplace. Shareholders, for instance, can no longer be owners, in any real sense, of other people's brains, but only investors or, more accurately, backers. The short term will then, I imagine, feature even more, for who would take a long-term bet on an organisation built on the imagination of its workers? The short term will also dominate the minds of individuals. Once they realise that they are the key assets of a business, they will be more determined than ever to build those personal assets and to take them wherever they will be most productive. Loyalty will be first to one's own career, then to one's profession and only thirdly to the employer. More and more people will pursue 'actors' careers', seeing life as a sequence of roles in projects, sometimes within one large organisation or hopping among several, or behaving as independents with a 'portfolio' of roles. Some will do this out of choice, seeing themselves as potential stars in their bit of the world; others will do it of necessity, as organisations pick and choose talents for projects and discard the ones they don't need. Large parts of organisations could ultimately become a collection of project teams, harnessing the intellectual assets around a task or an assignment, rather as a consultancy company or an advertising agency does now. To the individual, the organisation will offer, not the promise of a planned career, but a series of opportunities which one's skill profile may or may not fit. All the world will then, in a sense, be a stage: a sequence of teams with a changing cast of performers, backed by a small continuing production team. That will not be an easy or a comfortable world, or even a very desirable one, but the tide of technology and competition cannot be halted, oven if you don't like the stuff it brings in with it. We must ride the tide, not fight it. The challenge for business will be to find ways to bind to themselves the players on whom they can depend for the future. Good conditions of work and employment will not be enough, for there will often be comparable ones around the corner. To be a 'preferred employer' it will be necessary to make the vital staff into quasi-partners, with more share ownership and bonus schemes, so that they share the future of the organisation, good and bad, and to invest at the same time in the constant regeneration of their intellectual assets, despite the possibility that the regenerated assets will leave. It would not be unreasonable, for instance, to expect to invest the traditional 10 per cent depreciation (or regeneration) allowance of both time and salary in the education and development of each individual. Keeping staff is one thing, working them efficiently is another. Project leadership will become the key to corporate performance. To build a cohesive team out of the requisite mix of different roles and talents is never easy, as any theatre director will confirm. Hierarchy cuts little ice with stars, for as their leader you have only as much power and influence as they allow you. Leadership in the world of people assets draws its power from the people over whom it is exercised. It is a world where loyalty has to be earned from the individual, not demanded. Do all this, and there is more. A collection of project teams, no matter how well led and how well starred, is not in itself an organisation. These teams have to be welded together to give them the clout they need in the market. The 'intellectual organisation' needs to be both small and big, local and global, tight and loose. It needs, in short, to be federal. Federalism is too little understood this side of the Channel and the Atlantic. It is always unfashionable in monarchical or oligarchical regimes because it is built on shared power, compromise and negotiation. Unfamiliar, unpopular and hard to make work, it is nevertheless the way all organisations are heading, because centrally-directed systems are too expensive, too often wrong, too restrictive and too imprisoning for the human soul. When that human soul is your key asset, you have to give it heed. To do that, and remain efficient, is the leading challenge facing our organisations. The author has written many books on organisations and their futures. His new book, The Empty Raincoat, will be published by Hutchinson in February. Tomorrow: John Neill of Unipart.

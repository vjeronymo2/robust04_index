			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Singapore, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong left here today for Beijing on a two-day  working visit to China.    During his stay in Beijing, the prime minister and the  Chinese Premier Li Peng are to attend and witness the signing of  the Suzhou software transfer agreement.    The agreement will be signed by Singapore Senior Minister  Lee  Kuan Yew, who arrived in Beijing on Friday [25 February], and  Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing.    The Suzhou project is believed to be the largest cooperation  project so far between the two governments.    According to the agreement between the two countries,  Singapore will invest a total of 20 billion U.S. dollars in the  next 10-15 years to develop an industrial town covering 70  square kilometers in Suzhou, and transfer Singapore's economic  development and management experiences to Suzhou, a medium-sized  city near Shanghai.    Lee Kuan Yew said here on Tuesday to XINHUA that the reason  why Singapore chose Suzhou to be the venue of the joint  government project is because Suzhou is located in the Chang  Jiang delta and close to Shanghai, the dragon's head of the  Chang Jiang valley, one of the fastest developing areas in China.    Lee said the prospects of the Suzhou project are "good,"  adding that though a well planned township in Suzhou would  proceed at a slower pace than Shenzhen, "the long-term results  will be better."    According to a press statement from the Prime Minister's  Office, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew will meet Chinese leaders  during their stay in Beijing.    During the prime minister's absence, Deputy Prime Minister  Lee Hsieng Loong will be the acting prime minister, the  statement said.</p>

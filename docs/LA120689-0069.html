			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S BEEN A SWEET RIDE THROUGH THE DECADE;  </P> <P> BOXING: NOBODY KNOWS IF THIS IS SUGAR RAY LEONARD'S LAST FIGHT, BUT EVERYONE  AGREES THE SPORT HAS BEEN HIS IN THE 1980S.  </P> <P> The question has been asked all week: Will Sugar Ray Leonard, who with Roberto  Duran kick-started this decade with its first megafight, Leonard-Duran I,  finish the 1980s by winning Leonard-Duran III, then retire?  </P> <P> "If I do, I won't call a press conference to announce it," he said, teasing  reporters Tuesday. "I'll probably just fade away into the sunset."  </P> <P> "But how will we know if you've retired?" someone asked.  </P> <P> "If 10 years go by and you haven't seen me fight, I've probably retired," he  said. "Besides, if I announced it, you wouldn't believe me anyway, right?"  </P> <P> He's right. Boxing folks tend to smirk during Leonard's retirement speeches.  There have been a few.  </P> <P> If he does retire, or even if he doesn't, no one can argue the point that in  this decade, boxing has been his. He has made more money and been involved in  more memorable engagements than any fighter of the '80s.  </P> <P> The three Leonard-Duran fights alone will have rewarded the participants with  about $60 million. Then there were two rich battles with Tommy Hearns and, in  1987, the keystone achievement of his career, the upset victory over Marvelous  Marvin Hagler.  </P> <P> Leonard, according to his lawyer, Mike Trainer, will top $100 million in career  earnings with this fight, by way of suggesting that it's a nice number on which  to bow out. But Leonard seems to bristle a bit at what he calls "people trying  to psychoanalyze me."  </P> <P> He said: "Don't try to figure out what makes me tick. That's a mistake. You  don't need to figure out what motivates me at this stage of my career. I'll  tell you: Competition motivates me. Roberto Duran thinks he can beat me. That  motivates me.  </P> <P> "I've been doing this (boxing) for a long time and it gets to be too much. . .  . People trying to figure me out and me having to defend boxing and my  opponents."  </P> <P> If Leonard wins Thursday night and decides to quit, much will be made of the  decision, made several months ago by Leonard and Trainer, to cut down the Sugar  Ray Leonard entourage.  </P> <P> The Leonard traveling squad for this fight, Trainer said, was reduced from 20  to seven, leaving some unhappy campers behind in Washington. Among those  failing to make the cut were two of Leonard's brothers and a trainer, Dave  Jacobs.  </P> <P> The sole trainer now and the only one who will talk to Leonard in his corner  Thursday night is Pepe Correa, who has been with Leonard for years but was  never the No. 1 trainer.  </P> <P> "The toughest part was telling my two older brothers, Roger and Kenny, that  this is so important to me that I didn't want anyone around," Leonard said. "So  when the rest of the staff questioned my decision, I said, 'If I dismiss my  brothers, what do you mean to me?' "  </P> <P> Traveling light, to Leonard, meant fewer distractions, and silence instead of  showtime commotion. Leonard has trained in the past in casino hotel ballrooms  and arenas, and always seemed to enjoy working out before hundreds of  spectators who cheered his world-class jump-rope drills.  </P> <P> Before his draw with Hearns last June, Leonard filled Caesars Pavilion, with  2,500 seats, for one workout. Only Muhammad Ali, Arum said at the time, had  filled an arena for a Las Vegas workout.  </P> <P> This time, there have been no crowds, no cheers. Not even music. One of  Correa's first orders: No boom boxes during workouts.  </P> <P> Leonard, until he agreed to work out publicly in a Mirage Hotel ballroom in the  final days before the fight, has worked out at Arum's new gym in a Las Vegas  industrial park. Media people were admitted, but no one else.  </P> <P> The squad cut left some soreheads back home, among them Harold Bell, a  Washington radio sports commentator who often rips Leonard on the air.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who helped Ray when he was just starting out have been treated  very badly by him," he said. "What happened to Janks (Morton) and Dave  (Jacobs), that's just recent stuff. Ray has been doing that to people for  years. I was once close to Ray, but when I saw how he treated people, I  walked."  </P> <P> Trainer said: "Harold Bell is a guy who got turned down when he once asked Ray  for a job, and he's been unhappy about it ever since," Trainer said. "He also  knocks Ray because Ray doesn't happen to contribute to Harold's favorite  charities."  </P> <P> Trainer said the cutback was agreed upon after Leonard reviewed the video of  his disappointing draw with Hearns last June, a fight in which Leonard was down  twice and seemed at times to have balance problems.  </P> <P> "The major change was having one trainer, not two, and Ray settling on Pepe,"  he said. "The second major change was no public training in Las Vegas. Ray felt  that at 33, maybe he needed a little more concentration in his preparation. He  loves signing autographs and giving away T-shirts at workouts, but this time he  decided he didn't want to do that."  </P> <P> In his news conference, Sugar Ray talked about the scaled-down Team Leonard.  </P> <P> "I just decided three guys can't carry a duffel bag," he said. "For the Hearns  fight, I found myself worrying if people had enough assignments."  </P> <P> Asked about his performance, Leonard just shrugged.  </P> <P> "Tommy proved he's a better fighter than everyone thought," he said. "And I had  a bad night, and maybe there are a lot of reasons for that. But one bad night  doesn't necessarily mean my career's over. Remember, Tommy's a very tough guy  to fight."  </P> <P> Duran's people whisper that they believe Leonard has been favored by Nevada  judges in past fights here, and they cite the draw with Hearns and the decision  over Hagler. Some still believe Leonard lost both fights.  </P> <P> Leonard said he is growing weary of defending himself, his opponents and  judges.  </P> <P> "I've been in no-win situations since the Hagler fight," he said. "They said  Donny LaLonde was a built-up white fighter with a manufactured title. They said  Tommy was washed up. Hagler was too old. It seems like I always have to defend  something. In the second Duran fight, people wanted to almost perform medical  research on Duran, to find out why he quit, instead of saying, hey, maybe Ray  had something to do with making him quit."  </P> <P> The soft-spoken Correa said Leonard will come into the ring exceptionally fit.  </P> <P> "I have never been as pleased with a fighter's preparation as I am with Ray for  this fight," he said. "There is no man on earth who can outbox this man when  he's right, and this man is right.  </P> <P> "Before we went into training, we broke down everything in boxing that made Ray  great, and we put it all back together."  </P> <P> Early Tuesday morning, Leonard weighed himself. He was 160 pounds. Both he and  Duran are contracted to weigh 162 or less.  </P> <P> "I called Pepe and told him I was 160, and he told me not to run. I liked that.  It was nice to go back to bed. It was cold outside this morning."  </P></p>

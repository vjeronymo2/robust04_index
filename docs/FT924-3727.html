			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): The right to a pension I WAS TOLD recently that there have been new rulings about employee pensions. As I understand it, employees who left their work before retirement age for another job or other reasons, and consequently lost their pension entitlement and contributions because they had not reached pensionable age, are now able to claim a pension proportionate to the length of time and amount paid in (if the pension fund is still in existence). Is this correct? If so, where can I get further information in order to make a claim? Preservation of pension rights for employees who leave a scheme has been in force since 1975. This has been modified by a series of social security acts (notably 1985, 1986 and 1990) which, effectively, confer preservation and transfer rights after two years' membership, and limited indexation. If, therefore, you were a member of an occupational scheme and left your employment before the scheme retirement age, you would have been covered automatically by this legislation and would in the normal course be notified of your paid-up rights by your company pension department soon after your date of leaving. Your pension scheme booklet should set out your entitlement on leaving service. If you think that you were a member of the scheme long enough to qualify for preservation rights, but can find no record of your entitlement, then you should write to the pension department of your former employer giving as much information as possible about your period of service and scheme membership, with any other information that you may have from old pay slips (eg, payroll number, scheme membership number, etc). Your rights on redundancy will depend on a number of factors such as length of service, terms of employment, etc. We suggest that you summarise this information on a piece of paper and seek advice either from the local office of your Citizens Advice Bureau or the Department of Social Security. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

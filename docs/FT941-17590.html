			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Clarke due to arrive in Djakarta Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is scheduled to arrive in Djakarta, Indonesia, this weekend on the second leg of a three-stage trade mission to east Asia. He is leading a group of financial services chiefs to promote UK financial services in Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. The Treasury gave few details of Mr Clarke's itinerary and who was accompanying him. It said that he would return to the UK early in the week beginning January 10. Mr Clarke is the first chancellor to head a trade mission for at least 10 years, the Treasury said. The Department of Trade and Industry, whose ministers normally head such trips, said that the financial nature of the business concerned meant it was 'logical' that the chancellor should lead the trip.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAROLD ROBINSON WINS TRIATHLON  </P> <P> Harold Robinson should have been distracted enough not to win Sunday's  triathlon at San Clemente.  </P> <P> After all, Robinson had to fight uneven, strong surf on the first leg of the  triathlon, and then head winds on the bicycling leg.  </P> <P> He didn't even have his own hotel room the night before the event.  </P> <P> But Robinson, 27, of Santa Rosa, overcame the obstacles to win the triathlon in  1 hour 57 minutes 47 seconds to win his first U.S. Triathlon Series event of  the year. Brett Rose of Tempe, Ariz., was second in 1:58.58. He was followed by  Andrew Carlson of Laguna Niguel in 1:59.23.  </P> <P> In the women's event, Joy Hansen of Newtown Square, Pa., passed defending  champion Paula Newby-Fraser of Encinitas to increase her lead. Entering the  triathlon, Hansen held a 9.5-point lead over Colleen Cannon of Nederland, Co.,  who finished third. KIM KUTCHER  </P></p>

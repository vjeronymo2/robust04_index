The minister spoke about His Highness Crown Prince Hasan's  visit and his meeting with Jordanian troops taking part in the  UN peace-keeping forces stationed in Croatia and Bosnia. He  said that the objective of this visit was to hold a series of  meetings with Croatian and Bosnian leaders and to meet with the  Jordanian officers, NCOs, and troops taking part in the  peacekeeping forces in Croatia and Bosnia. The visit was also  aimed at meeting with the commanders of the UN forces in the  former Yugoslavia.    He said that this visit comes within the framework of  supporting ongoing international peace efforts and the recent  agreement reached between the Croatians and Bosnians in Vienna  aimed at ending the conflict, achieving peace, and closing a  chapter of history full of tribulations and sufferings.    Al-Hasan noted that the visit added a new dimension to the  credibility of Jordan and its leader His Majesty King Husayn.  The visit also highlighted the respect the leadership and  people of these countries have for Jordan and its leader His  Majesty King Husayn and his effective contribution in support of  international efforts and the United Nations' role through the  participation of Jordanian troops. Jordan has the second  largest contingent, after France, of peace-keeping forces in the  region. [passage omitted]</p>

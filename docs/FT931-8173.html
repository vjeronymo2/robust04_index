			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: Legislation needed to meet current needs of farmers Sir, David Richardson's observations in Farmer's Viewpoint (February 16) highlight how much more has to be done by the farming community. That 100 UK farmers are going out of business each week is merely the continued effect of battle against rising overhead and declining income during the last 10 years. Considerable effort is being made now in the home counties, if not the shires, to respond to the current conditions by 'extensifying' and entering into new forms of farming agreement. It is in this context that progressive farmers and landowners are hampered by the antiquated legislation enshrined in the agricultural holdings acts. The government should therefore be encouraged to bring forward the legislation that it is now considering based upon 'freedom to contract'. This would enable joint ventures and other trading agreements to be introduced to meet modern conditions without either the fear of creating agricultural tenancies with security of tenure, or the need to use rather incongruous Gladstone v Bower tenancies. In parallel with this, the government must be prepared to rationalise both the capital and income tax framework to remove the anomalies that occur as a result of new enterprises and agreements. As it looks as if the government will have to be parsimonious for some time, its best alternative would be to give parliamentary time as soon as possible to improve the legal framework and stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit.

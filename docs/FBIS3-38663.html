			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nationalrat Decides on Longer </F> Alternative National Service"]    [Text] Vienna -- By adopting the new law on alternative  national service on Thursday [3 February], the Nationalrat drew  a line under the months of debate about the duration of  alternative national service. Retroactively as of 1 January,  alternative national service will be extended from 10 to 11  months; one month of that can be served through exercises. If  more than 3,000 conscripts apply for alternative national  service from May to October, this service will last 12 months as  of next year. In the future, the young men doing alternative  national service will no longer get cash for food and clothes,  so that their income will go down from so far up to 8,000  schillings per month to 3,000 schillings. In return, the  monthly salary for men doing military service will be raised  from 2,000 to 3,000 schillings. In addition, they are permitted  to use public transport free of charge [when they are in  uniform].</p>

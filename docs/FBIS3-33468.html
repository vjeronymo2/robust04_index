			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with UNAG leader Daniel Nunez by Fabian Medina; </F> place and date not given; first paragraph is EL SEMANARIO  introduction]    [Text] Daniel Nunez could not stand to complete the rest  period his doctor prescribed, and he is back in his UNAG  [National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen] office. His hair is  barely starting to grow back after chemotherapy for cancer left  him bald. Despite his haste to get back to work, Nunez, who  recently turned 55, thinks that no organization can depend on  one person, on one boss, and he is ready to leave UNAG at the  time of the 1996 elections. In his frank and down-to-earth  language, he speaks of his fight against cancer, of his plans,  and says what he thinks in this interview with EL SEMANARIO.    [Medina] Have you had a hard time with your disease?    [Nunez] My mother taught me a maxim that is a sort of credo  for me. It goes like this: "If there is a cure for your problem,  why complain? And if not, why cry?" This disease has not been  easy. Cancer is like a curse in a person's life. Often, though,  your recovery depends on the support you get from friends. I  have had a great deal of support from really surprising sources,  from political opponents. They have given me really incredible  surprises. Local church groups to which I have belonged, in  Waslala, San Juan del Rio Coco, la Guinea...many people have  been praying for me.    I was quite surprised when in a very poor area in Matagalpa,  a really impoverished place, the people there unexpectedly paid  to have a mass said for my health. Those things are really  priceless.    [Medina] Have you recovered now?    [Nunez] I really should not be working. They recommended  that  I continue to rest, but the truth is that in Nicaragua's  situation, with all our difficulties, we cannot just sit back. I  have things to do, I have to have another operation, because I  now have a hernia. After my surgery, I had chemotherapy. I have  to go for treatment every three months to keep the disease from  spreading.    [Medina] What was the diagnosis?    [Nunez] Cancer. They removed one organ. I also had another  tumor, or rather I still have it, between the aorta and the  lung. They did not remove that because it was too dangerous.  Still, in my last checkup the diagnosis was negative. That gives  me fairly good chances of being cured. But you know that this  disease is tricky, you do not know where it will emerge, when it  will pop back up again.    In any event, it makes a person more aware that he is  living,  like a plant with a blight, with a disease that it is possible  to fight and overcome, but it is also possible...that it will  not be overcome. It makes a person live with more realism.    [Medina] How did you spend those three months away from your  job?    [Nunez] First of all, I had to deal with the problem. I  could  not sit on the fence. I trusted my comrades on the board of  directors to handle this work responsibly, and now I have the  satisfaction of knowing that they did what should have been done.    We are facing some problems in the ECODEPA [Let Us Save  Democracy program], the nation's economic situation affects us  all, and we believe that great experience has been gained  through this. For an organization that depends on one leader is  not an organization. Then you are creating a personalized power  base, and that is not good. UNAG has the force of the forest,  meaning that for every tree that falls, another is planted. It  has the strength to move forward no matter whether one or two or  three of its leaders have to leave for this or that reason. I  myself am prepared to leave the organization in 1996, with the  new election we are going to have in the Third Congress. UNAG  must move forward because it is not the work of one person, but  of thousands of campesinos, hundreds of leaders.    [Medina] UNAG did very well in the last poll. To what do you  attribute those results?    [Nunez] We have defined a broad sector-oriented strategy. We  bring together members of cooperatives, small, medium, and large  producers. And we have depoliticized UNAG.    We are also an organization that works to serve producers.  We  have projects in many places in Nicaragua, in poor areas.... We  have a program called "From Campesino to Campesino" that  involves technology transfer. In this program we teach  campesinos to improve their production, how to best use their  fertilizer, to produce their own seeds, and that has  strengthened the campesino leadership of each region.    We have the privilege or the pride of having representatives  all over the country. UNAG is in Siuna, in Rio San Juan, in San  Juan del Rio Coco, in Jalapa, it is in the most remote places in  the interior. We have developed grass-roots leaders in these  communities. For example, the chairman in each department is  from that department; they are not imported, but really are  people from the local communities. The board of directors is  well balanced, because we have comrades who have come right from  the proletariat, and we also have good representation in men  like Juan Tijerino (livestock), Alvaro Fiallos (cotton), Juan  Ramon Aragon (livestock), and others. That balance gives our  organization a lot of credibility.    We are an institution that works to serve producers. We are  often concerned because there are producers who think we are a  ministry and not a trade association that needs the work of  these producers to sustain itself, to gain more strength in the  national awareness of the campesino.    [Medina] Perhaps that may be related to the state's  withdrawal from many of its institutions in rural areas--bank  branches, ENABAS [National Enterprise for Staple Foods], etc.    [Nunez] Yes, that is true. We feel the peasants have been  orphaned by state policies. I am referring to training,  technical assistance, financing, developing new forms of  production. For example, there is a big onion-exporting project  that AID [Agency for International Development] is financing,  and it has become a closed and favored group in the Sebaco  Valley, where four or five producers are running it. The  renovation of coffee production is often in the hands of favored  groups. The economy in those sectors has not been democratized.  Rural credit has practically been closed off. The eight private  banks here say they finance 1 or 2 percent of the agricultural  production in Nicaragua. That really makes no sense.    The government says, "Let us get back to the fields," and we  say: "Great, excellent, let us go to the fields." But we are not  going back to the fields; the opposite is true. Today in rural  areas you have kidnapping, violence, crime, and often the print  media, radio, and television do not report its true magnitude.  We believe that this year, 1994, we have to apply a lot of  pressure, we have to persuade the government that if no strong  move is made toward rural areas there may be serious problems  here.    [Medina] UNAG is a force in civil society. You have 120,000  members.... Have you used that power--maybe to apply pressure?    [Nunez] We did not want to use it. We have used it to  organize, to develop national awareness, to tell our members to  support reconciliation and pacification, that they should  support the coalition, that they need to support stability in  rural areas and this transition from war to peace.    If we went the other way and encouraged the campesinos to  challenge IMF policies, there really would have been a serious  crisis here. The government might not have been able to  implement any policies. We know the strength we have. We can  mobilize 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 campesinos. We are using this  strength to create awareness on a national and international  level, to support this great productive sector with over 60,000  small producers, including cooperative members. If some  ministries continue to turn a deaf ear to appeals from this  sector, we might be forced...not to abandon the peasants, but to  take the lead in presenting their most heart-felt demands.    [Medina] What ministries do you mean?    [Nunez] We have tried to create some common ground with  IRENA  [Institute of Natural Resources] but it has been difficult, as  they have a mindset that the state is the boss, and as the boss,  the state is the one to implement reforestation policies, and we  have opposed some of their projects. With the Ministry of  Agriculture we have had some major differences. They have been  reported in the newspapers, and we hope that in 1994 things may  be better. For example, INTA [National Institute of Technology  Transfer] is being announced with a lot of publicity hype. They  will have 360 officials. We will see what these 360 bureaucrats  will do to promote technology transfer for small growers of  corn, beans, rice, etc.    The Ministry of the Economy...well, they have practically  barred their doors to us. We went to them to protest the problem  of cattle on the hoof leaving the country. Often when these  cattle are bought in Costa Rica the livestock's value is not  declared. The state fails to collect those taxes. Along with  cattle rustling, there is also an abuse of power.    [Medina] But UNAG is both a union group and a business  group.  Isn't that contradictory? For example, when you criticize the  export of cattle on the hoof, are you not acting more to protect  the interests of CARNIC [Nicaraguan Meat Enterprise]  slaughterhouses than the interests of livestock producers who  get their best prices by selling outside the country?    [Nunez] Not so. We have criticized this ever since the  revolution. Furthermore, CARNIC is in itself not a UNAG member,  but it is composed of a number of producers, cooperative  members, small and midsized producers. We are never going to put  economic interests ahead of our sector interests. Let me tell  you something that is not well known in Nicaragua. In 1993 we  financed over 10,000 producers of sesame, rice, coffee, and  basic grains. We have loans to recover, perhaps more than the  National Bank. We are really interested in getting these  problems resolved.    I do not think this is contradictory, for a group like ours  has to have an alternative to offer producers. When we buy  coffee, meat, or sesame, and at the same time we provide some  products that are needed like agrichemicals and fertilizers, we  are not acting like a private firm for our own personal profit,  but rather as a complete enterprise that works with that  producer to finance his harvest. Here is another example: last  year we financed all the sesame grown on Ometepe Island. We left  the island, and in Ometepe no one planted sesame because there  was nobody to finance it. In Chinandega, 60,000 quintals of rice  have just been harvested, the result of financing we gave those  growers.    In Matagalpa and Jinotega, large producers owe UNAG about  $500,000 in financing that we lent them two years ago, which  they have not yet been able to repay. We acted like a bank, in  an act of solidarity, in order to alleviate the financing  situation.    [Medina] Where does that money come from?    [Nunez] It comes from loans we get from private banks, from  the National Bank, from projects to supply peasant stores. We  are creating "rural savings and loan banks." We cannot sit back  and do nothing. The campesinos are not organizing just for the  fun of it, but for the options that you mention so that they can  overcome their economic limitations.    [Medina] People say Daniel Nunez could run as a candidate in  the 1996 elections...because of your leadership and popularity.    [Nunez] Many people want to be president of Nicaragua. I,  Daniel Nunez, think that what we need to do is seek consensus  and unity so we can change the methods and ways with which  presidencies in this country have been conducted. We need to  create a consensus among all the progressive, business, trade  union, political, and even religious sectors in order to develop  a new strategy that will allow us to work for Nicaragua, not for  a specific political party, and also not for a specific person.    Through all the conflicts we have experienced, there are men  here who have emerged as leaders, who have set aside egotistical  personal interests and are thinking about the nation. Others  have clung to revanchism. As we have said since 1990, UNAG is  going to support the most progressive sectors that pledge to the  people that they will keep us from creating more financial  monopolies, but instead will seek ways to develop small and  midsized production.    We are going to support whoever pledges to improve economic  activity in rural areas, who fights to lower the unfair interest  rates we pay to state banks. We do not want to continue a  neoliberal policy that will do to us what is happening in  Chiapas. The Chiapas situation is the product of imposing a  policy that works only for the privileged sectors, while  ignoring the people who are left outside. I personally am  concerned that if this plan continues on its present course, we  may have an eruption here that we will not be able to control.    No, no, what I really want and my actions have demonstrated  this when I have twice been a deputy to the National Assembly,  and neither in 1984, nor now.... Why? Because I think the work  Daniel Nunez does with the peasants, in direct contact with the  grass roots, is more important than what I could do in the  National Assembly. We do give guidelines to our UNAG comrades in  the assembly.    We want to make this clear, in 1996 we are going to play a  major role in getting out the peasants' votes. We are going to  use all the influence we have in this sector so that the  peasants will not be left unprotected as they have been by this  government.    We Sandinists will have to make a great effort because we  owe  a debt to the people. The national leadership owes a debt to the  people. The Nicaraguan people defended the revolution with their  lives because they believed in it. I think that if the Sandinist  Front, as our party, wants to repay this historic commitment we  will have to be consistent and broadly based, and not continue  fighting about presidential candidacies. We have to reach  agreement to see what alliance we can form with progressive  sectors.    [Medina] So there is no possibility that the name of Daniel  Nunez will appear on election ballots in 1996.    [Nunez] Well, I have no such aspirations. To be president of  a country a person needs resources.    If Sandinism and we Sandinists cannot join together and  unite  our forces with the most progressive trade union and business  groups, social and economic sectors, we will lose the  opportunity to move Nicaragua forward. I do not think the old  historic parallels of liberals and conservatives, which are worn  out and practically meaningless to the people, can offer a  solution for this change.    I am a soldier, and I will always be wherever the party  leaders want, so long as it is for my country.    [Medina] When you say that UNAG will support the most  progressive sector or party, do you mean that UNAG might not  support the Sandinist Front in the next elections?    [Nunez] If the Sandinist Front were to have the misfortune  of  becoming a divided party, how could we support a divided party?  That is definitely not our aim. If UNAG has worked for anything,  it is for the unity of the peasants. That unity we established  with the national resistance was not easy for us, but we have  demonstrated our unity.    The first thing we Sandinists have to work for is the unity  of Sandinism. If there is no unity in Sandinism, there will be  no Sandinist victory in 1996, even though we are the most  powerful force in the country. There are workers, campesinos,  businessmen.... There are opportunists who have renounced  Sandinism, who bad-mouth it now, after the people supported them.    I say, if the Sandinist Front is divided, I will stay home.  I  will not support an election with a divided Sandinist Front, for  that would be the worst tragedy that could happen to the  Nicaraguan people.</p>

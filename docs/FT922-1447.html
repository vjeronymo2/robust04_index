			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Trade News: IBM, Toshiba in new-generation chip link-up IBM, the US computer maker, and Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group, are planning to join forces in the development of a new generation of microchips. According to electronics industry executives in Japan, the two companies are discussing a partnership in flash memory devices, a type of chip which could eventually replace hard disk memories inside computers. Such a development could greatly reduce the cost and weight of computers. Unlike existing memory chips, flash memory devices retain information even after the power to a machine has been switched off. The two companies declined to comment on the discussions. IBM said it was talking to various potential partners about the possible joint development of various products, including flash memories. Toshiba said it was discussing a possible partnership in flash memories with another company and an announcement would be made 'soon'. The partnership, if it goes ahead, would be an example of a growing trend among electronics groups to pool resources for the development, manufacture and even marketing of new products. Even for companies as large as IBM and Toshiba, the investments needed for new products have become so daunting that they are increasingly seeking to share risk. Toshiba was among the first companies to develop flash memories but Intel, the US microchip maker, was more successful in producing and marketing the devices and has a world market share estimated at 80 per cent. Intel earlier this year signed an agreement with Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, for Sharp to make chips for Intel. For both Toshiba and IBM, an alliance would create a large enough base to challenge Intel. IBM was once reluctant to strike technology-sharing partnerships with outside companies, but competitive pressures have forced it to seek such alliances to stay abreast of the latest developments in technology. IBM and Toshiba already co-operate in the production of colour liquid crystal display screens. Meanwhile, Toshiba is today expected to announce a separate partnership with Apple, the US computer maker, in the field of multi-media, a business where computer, audio and television technologies are combined to create entertainment and business-use products.</p>

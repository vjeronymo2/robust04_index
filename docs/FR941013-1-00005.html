The Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number of repetitions of certain short-interval inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would require replacing the mounting bracket with a new mounting bracket of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspections that are currently required by AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1. The actions specified in the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent rudder movement caused by a cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which could result in loss of rudder control. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before December 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;14&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to JAL HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1) the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom; (2) JAL; (3) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (4) several U.S. and foreign operators of the affected airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From this review, the FAA has identified AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;4150, as one that should be superseded with a new AD that would require a modification that could eliminate the need for short-interval and critical repetitive inspections. AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1 currently requires repetitively inspecting the rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes, and replacing any cracked bracket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JAL has developed Modification No. 5162, which introduces a new rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket with increased sectional dimension, part number (P/N) 1379111E 1. Included with this modification are Instructions to Modification No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, dated June 1981.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

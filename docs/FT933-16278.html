			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Phone service aims to follow the customer BUSINESS CARDS listing what sometimes looks like a whole directory of telephone and fax numbers could soon be a thing of the past. A new telecommunications company plans a nationwide launch next year of a 'personal numbering' service. Subscribers will be given a single number. A special exchange programmed with their daily movements, alterable by a single phone call, will then automatically route their calls as directed - whether to their office, home, or to a secretary. Numbering Viewed Worldwide, the private company intending to market the service, gained a telecommunications licence last year and says it plans to invest about Pounds 30m in the operation over the next five years, including at least Pounds 4m before next summer's launch. The technology required for personal numbering is not new. In the US American Telephone and Telegraph, the largest operator, already operates an 'easy reach' scheme. The cost of upgrading Britain's 7,500 exchanges had been thought to make a UK personal numbering service unlikely for some time. But Numbering Viewed Worldwide believes it can make personal numbering viable by routing calls through a small number of 'intelligent island sites' fitted with the necessary equipment, rather than by upgrading existing exchanges. It plans to have one open by the launch, with up to eight built over five years. Subscribers will be charged about Pounds 10 to join, and about Pounds 5 a month thereafter. Calls to personal numbers will be charged at premium rates  -higher than standard tariffs but 'well below' those of cellular operators. The company said: 'We anticipate a potential subscriber market for personal numbering and related 'intelligent network' services of more than 2m by year five.' Personal numbering has strong support from Oftel, the industry regulator. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel's director, said it was 'an important new development in the telephone market'. In its proposals for allocating the 9bn new numbers set to become available with the national code change in April 1995, Oftel plans to dedicate a block for personal numbering operators. BT said it had 'no plans' to launch a personal numbering service of its own.</p>

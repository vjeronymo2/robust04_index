In an address to the International Affairs Institute, which  represented an overview of his tenure as Italy's diplomatic  chief, Andreatta warned against those "who want to confine  foreign policy inside a geo-political reality, like the Italian  Right would appear to, which in some way abandons its  (traditional) openness."    Andreatta went on to voice his opposition to those who call  for the re-organization of the Foreign Ministry. "I know very  well what needs to be reformed, but I am skeptical towards those  positions which claim to be novel. It is my opinion that  Italian society needs a more adequate foreign policy, but based  on traditional lines."    The foreign minister, a trained economist, then argued how,  at least based on the pre-election statements, radical shifts in  either direction would offer no "useful solutions for the  nation's economic problems."    The foreign policy platforms of the various forces running  for the March 27-28 elections were also reviewed by Andreatta in  an article published by the magazine IL REGNO, with the foreign  minister observing "What is essential is the interest a nation  shows towards playing a leading role on an international level.  Very often, our country, even those people who are culturally  sophisticated, when faced with an international dilemma waiver  between a crude vision of the balance of power or a disarmed  vision which does not appear to understand the plurality of  views, the interests on which the community of nations is based."</p>

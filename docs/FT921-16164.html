			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Liffe lifts trading to new high FUTURES and options trading on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) reached a new high of 39m contracts in 1991, slightly ahead of the Matif, its French rival. In its ninth successive record year, Liffe recorded average daily volume of more than 150,000 contracts, up 13 per cent on 1990. Volume in the most actively traded contract, the German government bond (Bund) future, exceeded 10m, in spite of an aggressive counter-attack by the DTB, the German futures exchange. Liffe's Italian government bond (BTP) future was the most successful of the six new contracts launched last year, trading nearly 500,000 contracts since its launch in September, and beating off a rival contract from the Matif. However, Liffe failed to make up crucial ground on the Matif's Ecu bond future contract launched the previous year. Volume in Liffe's Ecu bond contract, which began trading in March, dwindled to five contracts in December. The rival contract on the Matif, while less than a raging success with average daily volume of just over 2,000 contracts, has at least gained a crucial foothold in a market which could soon be Europe's largest. Once its merger with the London Traded Options Market is completed in a few months, Liffe will have to concentrate its efforts on reviving London's moribund stock option market. So far, the exchange has been unable to attract enough potential market makers in equity options to create a viable market-making system, and may be forced to consider a move to screen-based trading of stock options.

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: A LIGHTER SIDE TO SEASONAL FARE FOR TAILGATE PICNICS  </P> <P> Shortened daylight hours and the return of cooler evenings might seem like two  good reasons to give up summer out-of-doors activities. But for some, the  beloved picnic is an outing too relaxing to abandon. That's how fall tailgate  parties came into favor.  </P> <P> The activity has typically accompanied a seasonal sporting event such as  football or an early evening at the races. But whether the trek leads to a  favorite scenic spot or the stadium parking lot, now is the time for a tailgate  picnic.  </P> <P> Although standard picnic fare such as cold fried chicken and mayonnaise-laden  salads can be fairly high in fat and calories, it is possible to picnic and  have all the fun and good taste of a celebration even when reducing the fat  content of your menu.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Healthful Options  </P> <P> These tips, from the Human Nutrition Information Service, an agency of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, will help picnic-packers assemble more healthful  baskets -- ones that are in line with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and emphasize  foods that are low in sodium, sugars, fat and calories.  </P> <P>  -- Grill chicken, hamburgers and lean steaks so the fat runs off during  cooking. Remove the skin from poultry, particularly if the fried variety will  be served, and trim visible fat from steaks.  </P> <P>  -- Use salt, butter and margarine sparingly, if at all, on corn-on-the-cob.  </P> <P>  -- Load up on mixed green salad or vegetable relishes, featuring cherry  tomatoes, radishes, cucumbers, carrots, celery, green peppers, broccoli and  cauliflower. Have smaller helpings of coleslaw, potato and macaroni salad.  </P> <P>  -- Liven up the flavor of burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, onions or other  vegetables instead of barbecue sauce, catsup, mustard, relish and pickles.  </P> <P>  -- Enjoy bananas, grapes, pears, apples, figs and other fall season fruits.  </P> <P>  -- Pack small cans or cartons of fruit juice or unsweetened ice tea rather  than soft drinks.  </P> <P>  -- Take along small boxes or bags of raisins or dried fruit mix, or prepare a  snack mix with plain popcorn, unsweetened cereals, bite-size pretzels and  seasonings such as paprika, hot pepper sauce and onion or garlic powder. These  items can replace cakes, cookies, potato chips and other snacks.  </P> <P> The following recipes for homemade breads, soups, and sandwiches will give the  excursion a healthful and tasty flair.  </P> <P> CHEESE-STUFFED CHICKEN GRILL  </P> <P> 10 ounces low-fat Jack cheese  </P> <P> 6 chicken thighs or half breasts, boned and skinned  </P> <P> Chopped rosemary leaves  </P> <P> Chopped tarragon leaves  </P> <P> Chopped thyme leaves  </P> <P> 3 green onions, sliced  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup white wine  </P> <P> 1/4 cup melted reduced-calorie margarine  </P> <P> Cut cheese into 8 equal sticks.

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Lending surge boosts confidence HOPES THAT the economic outlook is improving were boosted by an above-expected increase in bank and building society lending last month, shown in Bank of England figures published yesterday. Sterling lending on a seasonally adjusted basis increased by Pounds 3.3bn, compared with Pounds 3bn in July, for the largest monthly increase since May. It compared with a figure of Pounds 2.5bn expected by City economists. The Bank also said the M4 measure of the money supply - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society deposits - rose 3.7 per cent in the year to last month after 3.6 per cent in the 12 months to July. The figures fit in with evidence that demand is steadily growing although they dampen any suggestions that the economic take-off from recession will be rapid. Separately, the Gallup market research company said consumer confidence had stayed about constant in August compared with July, with 32 per cent of a sample of nearly 2,000 people expecting an economic improvement over the next year and 29 per cent thinking the economy will worsen. Gallup said consumer confidence was 'hardening' albeit at a low level. A continuing depressing factor was that many people are worried they will lose their jobs, which stops them rushing into big purchases. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the lending data underlined how economic activity was gradually picking up from the low point which occured around the end of last year. This message also emerged from the British Bankers' Association, which said the UK's nine biggest banks lent a net Pounds 2.8bn in August, double the July increase of Pounds 1.4bn and the largest monthly increase since March 1990. Much of the increase was due to high levels of borrowing by securities dealers, however, apparently related to the need to gain large amounts of sterling for trading in foreign exchange and financial instruments. Mortgage lending by the banks was also high, although the association said overall demand for consumer credit in August was 'surprisingly weak'. Demand for credit is normally fairly high in August as a result of people borrowing to buy new cars and for holiday spending. The association added: 'August's large underlying increase confirms the upward trend in lending, but only takes it back to last year's level of activity, which itself was not indicative of any great economic upturn.'</p>

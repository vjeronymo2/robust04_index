			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH OF HOMES YIELDS NO DRUGS IN SCHOOL STEROID CASE  </P> <P> Carlsbad police Tuesday searched a house owned by the father of the suspect in  an alleged high school steroid-peddling operation, but apparently found no  evidence of the drug.  </P> <P> Four narcotics detectives kicked down the doors of the main house and of two  cottages behind the house, said the father of Gregory Thomas Tirona, who asked  that his first name not be used. No one was home at the time, but the father,  visibly outraged, said police didn't have to kick down doors.  </P> <P> Tirona, a teacher's aide and volunteer basketball coach at Carlsbad High  School, has been the subject of an investigation by the school district and  police since May 3, Lt. Don Lewis said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Students Came Forward  </P> <P> Police are investigating allegations that Tirona, 31, sold anabolic steroids to  four athletes at the high school, Lewis said. The students came forward about  two weeks ago and claimed they had purchased the illegal substance from Tirona.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed against Tirona, who remains on paid administrative  leave from his position as a teacher's aide, a job he has held since 1985. He  also was a volunteer girls' basketball coach this year.  </P> <P> Tirona's father said his son did not live at the house, in the 3400 block of  Valley Street, but used it as a place to have his mail delivered.  </P> <P> Detectives at the house during the search said Tirona's whereabouts were  unknown Tuesday.  </P> <P> The father said he came home from work at 4:30 p.m. and was shocked to find  four plainclothes detectives scouring the main house and dwellings in the back  after kicking down the front door, which was secured by a dead-bolt lock.  Detectives also searched the car of the father's younger son, who lives in one  of the cottages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lamest Excuse I've Heard'  </P> <P> "They said they didn't know if they would encounter a gang or someone else,"  the father said. "That excuse that they didn't know what they were going to  face is the lamest excuse I've ever heard."  </P> <P> According to the search warrant, detectives seized five items: a tape from the  father's telephone answering machine, a bottle of codeine, a marijuana  cigarette from the car of Tirona's younger brother and two bottles of unknown  medication prescribed to Gregory Tirona.  </P> <P> The father said the medication may have been antibiotics.  </P> <P> "Why would a doctor prescribe steroids for him?" he said, adding that he had  spoken with his son Tuesday morning and was convinced of his innocence after  discussing the allegations.  </P> <P> "We had a talk, and he said that he didn't do it, whatever they suspected him  of doing."  </P> <P> Police, meanwhile, are releasing little information on the investigation,  except to say that they have interviewed people involved. Detectives also  seized documents Tuesday, apparently related to Tirona, from the offices of the  Carlsbad Unified School District, Lewis said.  </P> <P> As many as four athletes had bought anabolic steroids off campus grounds, said  Wayne Rice, Carlsbad High's athletic director. Rice said only one of the  athletes was a starter in one of the 20 sports at the school.  </P></p>

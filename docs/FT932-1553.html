			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Observer: Out but not down Twenty odd years in New York is a long time for a German banker. Obviously something of the American entrepreneurial spirit has rubbed off on Barthold von Ribbentrop who is quitting Deutsche Bank, after a 22-year stint, the bulk of it in North America, to set up his own investment fund. 'I think at my age it's still not too late to have another go at doing something entrepreneurial' the 52-year-old son of the Third Reich foreign minister said cheerfully yesterday as he enunciated plans for his new investment vehicle that is to concentrate on medium-sized German companies. Returning from the Big Apple in 1986, he discloses one of his most valuable roles, in building the bank's securities operation, was sitting firmly upon endeavours to buy up (unnamed) stockbrokers in London and elsewhere. 'This would have been a total disaster' he says with refreshing honesty. Just one step away from a board position, one of the most prestigious possible trophies in corporate Germany, he was in no mood to admit to any tinge of regret yesterday. 'The money may be better but the job is awful'.</p>

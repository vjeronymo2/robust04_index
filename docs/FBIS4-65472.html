			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dhimitrios Filios] </F>   [Text] The negotiating procedure in New York for the  resumption of talks on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia, FYROM] has entered a new phase with both sides  accepting a package for negotiation that includes the name  issue. Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry  secretary general, had a 90-minute meeting this morning with UN  mediator Cyrus Vance. Afterward, Zakharakis simply said that  views are being exchanged to find a way to promote the  negotiating procedure.    Answering a question, Zakharakis said there is no progress  in  the talks but added that there are hopes. Asked whether U.S.  Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz will participate in the talks  and if there is a UN proposal that includes the term New  Macedonia, North Macedonia, or Nova Majedonia, the Foreign  Ministry secretary general said Nimetz submitted no proposals;  he is merely participating in a procedure to exchange views.    Joe Sills, the UN secretary general's spokesman, today said  there is no timetable for the talks on Macedonia. Vance will  hold a new meeting with Skopjean Foreign Minister Stevo  Crvenkovski late tonight, and tomorrow he is expected to meet  Zakharakis.</p>

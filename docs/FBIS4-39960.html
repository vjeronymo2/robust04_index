			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 12 TASS -- "It is vitally important  today to have a united political force, capable of rallying and  putting into effect the democratic and reforming potential of  society. This is what the Russia's Democratic Choice Party is  being created for," says the preamble to the programme of the  new party, which was adopted as a basis today by its founding  congress. The programme is an extensive document, which sets  forth the stand of the new political organisation with regard to  problems of the economic and social policy, the state setup, the  anti-crime struggle, culture, arts, science, education and  ecology.    The economic section of the programme describes as vitally  important the reduction of the share of state expenditures in  the budget and the gross national product. The new party  favours the adoption of a long-term programme of the military  reform, which will provide for the reduction of the army along  with the reduction of its budget to the level of 3-3.5 per cent.    The new party finds it necessary to reform the tax system,  to  bring down the overall level of the income tax and lay emphasis  on the taxation of land and immovables.    In the opinion of Russia's Democratic Choice, privatization  is the main condition for achieving economic growth. The money  received as a result of the selling of shares should be  channelled not to the state treasury, but to enterprises  themselves for their rebuilding, and investors should be given a  possibility to buy the controlling block of shares.    The new party believes that the agrarian policy should  ensure  by all means the support for private and cooperative enterprises  in the sphere of the marketing and processing of farm produce,  for a further liberalisation of agricultural markets, the  creation of the agricultural crediting system and the formation  of mechanisms of regulating the land market.    In the opinion of Russia's Democratic Choice, the social  policy should be based on principles of stopping excessive state  protectionism, on the state's responsibility for the  unconditional granting of minimal social guarantees in the  sphere of labour remuneration, pensions, public health,  education and culture.    As for the national security and foreign policy, the party  believes that partner relations with industrially developed  countries do not at all mean that Russia's interests will be  "dissolved" in the interests of the West. "Even the closest  allied relations provide for the active upholding of one's own  interests. Under no condition will Russia agree to the role of a  junior partner," the document says.    The party believes that the restoration of a common economic  space on the territory of the former USSR is one of the key  tasks of Russia's policy with regard to the former USSR  republics. It is pointed out, however, that this should not be  done hastily and with too much fuss.</p>

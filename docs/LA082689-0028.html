			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRANGE BEHAVIOR? FAN GOT WHAT HE DESERVED  </P> <P> Allen Brogan (Viewpoint, Aug. 19) obviously has no idea of the pressure  involved in playing the last nine holes of a major golf championship.  </P> <P> The spectator in the Curtis Strange incident deserved what he got. Before  Strange approached his shot, he was distracted, and he asked the spectators to  please be quiet and to show a little courtesy.  </P> <P> This obviously didn't have any bearing and Strange reacted as any normal human  being in that situation would. These incidents happen day in and day out on the  PGA Tour, and I'm glad the public was able to witness it on national TV.  </P> <P> Furthermore, there shouldn't be talk about rest-of-the-year suspensions and  Ryder Cup banishments. Brogan must follow baseball and football, where  suspensions are a normality. Trust me, the commissioner of golf would not allow  our sport to be lowered to that level.  </P> <P> JOHN P.

Randy Oaks.  </P> <P> The woman's car was found in the channel at Harmon Avenue and Valley View  Boulevard. She was wearing only panty hose when she was found and authorities  believed the force of the water tore her clothing off, Oaks said.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said up to two inches of rain fell in some parts  of the Las Vegas Valley early this morning.  </P></p>

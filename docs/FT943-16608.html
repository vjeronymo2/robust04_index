			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Politics obstructs line to peace in signals dispute: Robert Taylor finds RMT and Railtrack share a good deal of common ground The railway signalling dispute reaches a delicate stage today. This afternoon the executive of the RMT transport union meets to decide what to do next in an industrial conflict that still seems outwardly a long way from a settlement. Tomorrow Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, and Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, will be questioned by the Commons employment committee on the intricacies of the dispute. For the past three Wednesdays most of the railway network has been at a standstill. A further 24-hour strike is scheduled for this Wednesday and further days of action are likely to be announced by the union executive as by law seven days' notice is required for strikes. But Mr Knapp and his executive have some difficult calculations to make. Until now the signalmen have enjoyed much public sympathy. This is due partly to Railtrack's inept negotiating, but above all to the late intervention by the Department of Transport and the Treasury to veto any pay deal that would be regarded by them to undermine the government's public sector paybill freeze. The public's mood also suggests that the signalmen  - described by Mr Horton as 'sensible and dedicated people'  - are believed to have a fair and reasonable case. Mr Knapp knows from past experience, however, that this mood could soon change if the current stoppages persisted through the summer. This is why the RMT executive may resist any serious escalation of the conflict. A possible option might be to shift the 24-hour stoppages from Wednesday to another day in the week, perhaps Monday or Friday. The union executive may also decide to continue with the stoppages but to go straight back to the conciliation service Acas. Much depends on how the 21 RMT executive members  - only two are from the signalling grades  - read the current mood of the signalmen. At the weekend Railtrack's 'hearts and minds' campaign has been aimed at convincing the signalmen to accept its three-part productivity deal and to put pressure on the RMT to go back to the negotiating table. But some RMT officials think this could backfire and antagonise the signalmen. The union's negotiators, including Mr Knapp, are reluctant, however, to see a hardening of attitudes if this can be avoided. They want further talks with Railtrack over the 3 per cent unconsolidated rise in pre-tax earnings that is now on the negotiating table as part of the company's offer. RMT officials point out that four weeks ago Railtrack's board agreed to an immediate 5.7 per cent pay increase. One official said: 'We were on the verge of a settlement then.' It was the government that put a stop to that deal. Railtrack still accepts tacitly that there must be an 'up-front' payment to bring the signalmen into negotiations on a long-term settlement. Indeed, the company's management is keen to resume talks with the RMT as soon as possible. Railtrack said yesterday: 'Our door is open for further negotiations.' Both sides share a surprising amount of common ground. They agree that the signalmen have genuine grievances and these must and can be met through a self-financing deal. Railtrack and the RMT also accept that some form of first-stage payment is necessary before bargaining can start on a final restructuring package. The union has proposed a joint working party with Railtrack to hammer out the final deal. It accepts the various stages of any settlement must be interlinked. An RMT official said last night: 'If the company have the will and the wit we can settle this.' Yet even if both sides can find a formula to end the strikes it remains unclear whether that will be enough to end the signalling staff dispute, which seems increasingly to be a political and not an industrial relations problem.</p>

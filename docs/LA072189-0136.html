			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM POLICE ARREST 105 IN 6-DAY NARCOTICS SWEEP  </P> <P> Anaheim police arrested more than 100 small-time cocaine and marijuana dealers  in three low-income neighborhoods near Disneyland after a three-month  undercover investigation triggered by complaints from residents.  </P> <P> Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy on Thursday described the sweep that netted 105  suspected drug dealers in six days as a "show of force" in the Lynne-Jeffrey,  Ponderosa Park and Citron-Vermont neighborhoods, where drug sales had been on  the increase.  </P> <P> The three areas are in the southern portion of the city near Disneyland.  </P> <P> Small quantities of cocaine, heroin and marijuana with a total street value of  about $50,000, as well as rifles and money, were seized during the arrests,  Molloy said.  </P> <P> The police searched 10 residences where officers had purchased drugs during the  investigation. Owners were informed that if drug activity continued on their  premises, the properties could be seized, Molloy said.  </P> <P> Police also charged the managers of five motels with maintaining a disorderly  house and have issued warrants for their arrest. Molloy said the motels were  "catering" to prostitutes in the drug areas. The motels are: the Crown Motel at  1136 N. Anaheim Blvd., the Americana Motel at 130 S. Beach Blvd., the Top's  Motel at 909 S. Harbor Blvd., Stage Stop Motel at 2912 W. Lincoln Ave., and the  Palm Motor Lodge at 1101 N. Harbor Blvd.  </P> <P> The drug investigation began after neighbors protested that the dealers were  becoming increasingly brazen in their street sales and in dealing from several  houses, Molloy said.  </P> <P> Patrol officers assigned to the area also noticed that the dealers were able to  easily conceal their goods and signal each other when police cars were in the  area.  </P> <P> In May, about 25 police officers went under cover and made more than 125  purchases of heroin and cocaine, only two of which were crack-cocaine sales,  said Capt. John Flanagan, who headed the operation, which was called Narcomania  I. With the purchases in hand, police were able to obtain 75 arrest warrants  that led to the capture of the 105 suspects.  </P> <P> Of those arrested, there were 95 men, three women, and seven teen-agers ranging  in age from 15 to 18. The adults were being held at Orange County Jail in Santa  Ana, where they were booked on suspicion of selling narcotics. The youths were  taken to Juvenile Hall in Orange. Sixty-three arrests were made in the  Ponderosa area, 32 in Lynne-Jeffrey and 10 in Citron-Vermont.  </P> <P> "We like to think it's like closing a retail outlet store. There's no market  anymore, at least not for a while. There's no one to buy from," Flanagan said.  </P> <P> Flanagan said there was no guarantee that drug sales were over in the three  neighborhoods, but he said he hoped that the sweep creates "paranoia" for  dealers in the area.  </P> <P> "From now on, they don't know when they are dealing with the man," Flanagan  said.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Serbs turn back UN chief General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, was yesterday blocked by Bosnian Serbs from visiting 1,200 Bangladeshi UN troops trapped in Bihac, a UN safe area. This slap in the face comes after Krajina Serbs on Saturday stopped the British commander from crossing Serb-held territory in Croatia. Also at the weekend, Bosnian Serb forces hijacked a UN fuel convoy and banned peacekeepers from escorting humanitarian relief. The UN yesterday said it would have to curtail sniper patrols round Sarajevo because it had received no fuel deliveries for three weeks. The newest restrictions make it impossible to carry out part of the UN mission, which is to secure the passage of humanitarian aid by providing an armed escort of convoys throughout Bosnia. But Bosnian Serbs also freed at the weekend nearly 200 UN troops held hostage since Nato launched air strikes on Serbs targets and allowed a food convoy into Sarajevo. Fighting has intensified in western Bosnia-Hercegovina, where Bosnian Croats are backed by regular troops from Croatia. Croatian officials at the weekend admitted that their army had entered Bosnia to help their Moslem allies by easing the pressure on the northwestern Moslem enclave of Bihac.</p>

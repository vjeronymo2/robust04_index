			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Russian roulette It is a measure of the UK equity market's resilience that the threat of civil strife in Russia - a good excuse for taking profits if ever there was one - failed to drive share prices lower. The FT-SE 100 index finished the week more or less where it started, a shade above 3,000. Still, the aggregate performance hides a multitude of sins. Food retailers took another battering, with disappointing figures from Tesco and William Morrison the proximate cause. The sector has fallen 14 per cent this month, threatening to take the mantle of least popular sector from pharmaceuticals. Whether the market can find inspiration for another march upwards is doubtful. The interim results season has been at best mixed, and certainly not good enough to validate the high expectations on earnings built into many share prices. Strength in gilts would again set a positive mood, but with a Pounds 3.25bn auction scheduled for Wednesday there seems little immediate hope of a lead from that direction. The best that can be said is that gilts are showing few signs of nerves in the run-up to the auction, on the expectation that foreign buyers will step in. The dependence of gilts and equities on overseas investors is perhaps the best reason for caution. The Pounds 13bn which flowed into UK stocks and bonds in the second quarter is unsustainably high. The level of sterling, the relative value of gilts against continental European markets and - ahead of the Conservative party conference - the political climate will determine exactly when the tap is turned off.</p>

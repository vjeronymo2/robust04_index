			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PURSE SNATCHER MAY FACE MURDER CHARGE AFTER VICTIM, 84, DIES  </P> <P> An 84-year-old Granada Hills woman has died in a convalescent home about a year  after she was seriously injured in a supermarket parking lot robbery attempt,  authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Janice L. Maurizi said the Los Angeles County coroner's  office is investigating whether the Sunday death of Freda Crawford is connected  to injuries she suffered in the March 27, 1988, incident. It will be several  weeks before coroner's investigators complete their report, she said.  </P> <P> Michael P. Kellet and Richard Phillips, both 20, were convicted late last year  in San Fernando Superior Court of robbing Crawford and another elderly woman  and are serving prison terms. Phillips was found guilty of personal infliction  of great bodily injury and two charges of robbery and was sentenced to seven  years. Kellet was convicted of two charges of robbery and was sentenced to six  years.  </P> <P> "I think it would be hard for murder charges not to be filed," Maurizi said.  "The woman was never on her own after this all happened and needed  round-the-clock medical care."  </P> <P> Crawford was putting groceries in her car in the parking lot of a Huges market  at Devonshire Street and Balboa Boulevard when one of two men in a passing car  reached out and grabbed her purse, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dragged 40 Feet  </P> <P> Crawford, who held on to the purse, was dragged 40 feet before the car swerved  and ran over her, police said. She was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in  Mission Hills in critical condition.  </P> <P> Kellet and Phillips were arrested a day later. Evidence in their car linked  them to the other robbery in which an elderly woman's purse was snatched,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Close friend Ted Horton, 62, described Crawford as a lively woman who was  mostly bedridden after the accident. "She was never the same," he said. "They  took the remainder of her life."  </P> <P> Services for Crawford, who died at Beverly Manor Convalescent Home, are  scheduled Monday at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth.  </P></p>

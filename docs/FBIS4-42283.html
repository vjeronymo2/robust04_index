			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Parliament President Egon Klepsch </F> by Elmar Oberhauser in Vienna -- live]    [Text] [Oberhauser] President Klepsch, I do not want to  hurt you as a guest, but many people -- not only opponents of  the European Union [EU] -- say that the European Parliament is a  body without any power, a mere alibi institution. Are you the  head of a toothless tiger?    [Klepsch] I think that this is an old prejudice that is  about 10 or 12 years old. The people in question have not  realized what has meanwhile changed in the European Union. They  have not taken note of the Maastricht Treaty and its  implementation. The European Parliament has received essential  concessions to its political power. In the future, the EU  Commission will be dependent on it. The European Parliament must  appoint the Commission and it may dissolve it. It may check on  it, and it will do so. The European Parliament is involved in  legislation, and all treaties with third parties that have  political, economic, and financial importance must be ratified  by the European Parliament.    [Oberhauser] Nevertheless, I would like to stick to my  previous question. Of course, you must defend the Parliament,  but is it not true that, in reality, decisions are made in the  Commission and in the Council -- that is, far away from  Parliament?    [Klepsch] No, this is really not the case. Ever since I  have held this office, we have had the so-called prelogue, this  is, the Council president, the Commission president, and I  myself meet at least once a month to discuss the pending  decisions, and the Parliament is quite involved within the  framework of the treaty. This is also assured by the Court of  Justice, which we can turn to if the treaty is not observed.    [Oberhauser] In the period coming up to the referendum on 12  June, Austrian television is airing the so-called Europa-Forum.  Yesterday's Europa-Forum was watched by almost 2 million people  in Austria. This broadcast gave rise to 370 telephone calls --  people, callers, who wanted to know details. Here one of the  major issues was the question of participating in  decisionmaking, that is, the great uncertainty whether a small  country like Austria actually has any way to have its say in  this Parliament and in the European Union.    [Klepsch] The EU member states all have the same rights, and  the same goes for the deputies. Of course, in the Parliament it  will be of decisive importance which groups the Austrian  deputies join and how these groups exert their influence.    I can only tell you that the two large groups, the socialist  group and the group of the European People's Party, which have  had contact with observers from Austria for quite some time, are  very interested in seeing a contribution by the Austrian  deputies, because the tradition of Austria's democratic  structures is an advantage for us.    [Oberhauser] Let us assume that this referendum will have a  positive result and Austria will join the European Union. Then  Austria will have about 20 or 25 deputies in this 600-person  Parliament.    [Klepsch] Correct.    [Oberhauser] How are they supposed to participate in  decisionmaking? Are you not throwing a bit of sand into the  Austrians' eyes?    [Klepsch] In this Parliament, decisions are made with the  absolute majority of the legal number of members. No country  has a majority there. All of them are far from a majority.    [Oberhauser] But there are big and small countries, are  there not?    [Klepsch] There are big and small countries, but there are  also big and small groups, and it depends on the material  contributions of the individual deputies, because in the  European Parliament the most important persons are the  rapporteurs, who know specific issues very well and whom their  groups follow. It is a question of the reputation that these  people enjoy, and I am firmly convinced that Austria will send  qualified deputies, who will have an important say in their  respective groups.    [Oberhauser] This is the catch-word, and I do not want to  link my next question with any specific names or persons and  certainly not with any specific Austrians. On 12 June, new  elections for the European Parliament will also be held. As  president of this Parliament, do you not have -- at least to a  certain extent -- the problem that the European Parliament is  increasingly becoming the side-track for parliamentarians who  are not successful in their homelands anymore?    [Klepsch] Precisely the opposite is true. It may have been  true at the beginning, when the deputies were sent to the  European Parliament by the national parliaments, depending on  their services and their reputation. Nowadays, however, the  deputies are elected directly, and they must face an election  and, above all, they must campaign for votes. This is possible  only if they make it clear that they have the competence to  fulfill their tasks. I am not worried at all. We will have a  great renewal of the Parliament. More than 50 percent of the  deputies will be new in Parliament. This is a great  restructuring, but I think it is necessary, because the change  in generations that is taking place in the member countries  everywhere will also gain shape here.    [Oberhauser] As I said before, the referendum in Austria  will be held in less than 14 days. The result will be narrow,  as many people have been assuming over the past few days. What  would happen, President Klepsch, if the referendum in Austria  resulted in a no? Would this lead to a reaction by the European  Union along the line of: Well, then let them stay where they  are, or would this have other consequences?    [Klepsch] I think the former will be the consequence,  because it is clear that the question about a long period of  negotiations, during which 12 countries were persuaded to agree  to the conditions that the Austrians posed -- and the  negotiations were very tough.... [sentence incomplete as heard]  If one now rejects these -- well, there are enough other  would-be members. I think that, at the moment, we have another  six applications for membership on our table, who would get  priority if the Austrians say no. However, I do not believe  that this will happen. I trust the Austrians.    [Oberhauser] Are you an opinion researcher?    [Klepsch] No, I am not an opinion researcher, but I have a  number of friends and acquaintances here in Austria, and I get  the impression that they are clear-headed enough to think of our  future, of our common future, which we can only cope with  together.    [Oberhauser] Mr. President, is this attitude of: Well, then  let them stay where they are, not an enormously arrogant  position? Since you spoke of democracy and responsibility  before, should it not also be in the interest of the European  Union to create a really united Europe -- and this would include  all, the Austrians, the Swiss, and, at some time in the future,  also the former Eastern Bloc?    [Klepsch] Of course, the Swiss have already applied for  membership. They just do not want to negotiate about it at the  moment, because the Swiss Government, the Swiss parties, do not  know how to push through the results of the negotiations because  of the Swiss Constitution. However, they have not withdrawn  their application. They know that they have to work together  with us. They are all welcome, but the precondition for them all  is that they are a liberal rule-of-law state, that they have a  pluralist democratic system, a market economy system with a  social basis, and that they are willing to share equal rights  and duties with the others. These are the preconditions for  entering the European Union, and Austria is a country that would  be welcome.    [Oberhauser] You elegantly evaded my question just now.  Even if the referendum were to end negatively, should it not  also be in the interest of the European Union to have -- let us  stay with Austria -- Austria in it, even if, at the moment, the  people are of a different view?    [Klepsch] Well, fine, but one has to see that there is a  certain sequence to the events. We have to take another step in  the European Union. In 1996 we will discuss the further  progress of the European Union, and there is the question of  whether Austria will be with us and discuss the matters together  with us, or whether it wants to negotiate membership afterwards,  under the new conditions. The second thing that one has to see  is that there are many other countries that want to join and  that will discuss their application for membership before  Austria.    [Oberhauser] One question in conclusion: If the referendum  results in a yes on 12 June, as you expect, will you then be  able to stick to the schedule of joining the European Union on 1  January 1995? I am thinking of the ratification in the 12  member countries, which is necessary.    [Klepsch] Well, as regards Austria, I think that this is  very likely and possible. I have inquired about the  preparations in Germany, for instance. They have a complicated  Constitution, as some other member states, but the schedule of  the Bundestag and the Bundesrat is sufficient to achieve the  goal in December.    [Oberhauser] Thank you very much for visiting us.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Pole nominated to take over as EBRD president: Balcerowicz is only east European to emerge MR Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, was yesterday nominated to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the only east European candidate to emerge for the post. Mr Balcerowicz, who was responsible for leading the 'shock therapy' transition to a market economy under the Mazowiecki government, was nominated by the Polish government in spite of strong signs that the post will go to a western candidate. Nominations for the vacancy, created by Mr Attali's resignation last week, close today. Mr Henning Christopherson, the EC economics commissioner, is thought to be the other of two candidates whose written nomination was received at the bank's London headquarters yesterday. The French government, however, has notified Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's board of governors, of the candidacy of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France. Mr de Larosiere is regarded as the leading contender. The French government claims wide international support for Mr de Larosiere's candidacy, although the prime target of its lobbying has been fellow EC countries. France has claimed a moral right to field the successor to Mr Attali, following its 1990 arrangement with Britain that London would get the bank's site in return for France providing the EBRD's president. Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the Polish central bank chairman, submitted Mr Balcerowicz's nomination yesterday afternoon, pointing out in her letter that no candidate from eastern or central Europe had yet been considered. Since he left the finance ministry in 1991 Mr Balcerowicz has stuck to academia, although he has advised the Ukrainian and Lithuanian governments on economic reform. He is a supporter of strict monetarist discipline. Although he was praised by western governments for steering Poland through the most difficult part of its economic reforms after 1989, his candidacy faces difficulty in gaining widespread support from western governments. But political sources in Warsaw yesterday pointed out Ms Gronkiewicz-Waltz would not have gone ahead if the west had been united on a single candidate. They also claimed there had been encouragement from the US and 'World Bank circles'. Mr Christophersen's candidacy enjoys broad support among the Scandinavian and Mediterranean countries, but he has yet to receive clear support from Germany, according to EC officials in Brussels.

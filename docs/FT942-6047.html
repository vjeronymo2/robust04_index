			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Twenty years of oil for Cote d'Ivoire - Two offshore fields could bring self-sufficiency United Meridien Corporation, a US-based company, is developing two offshore oil and gas fields which by early next year would make Cote d'Ivoire self-sufficient in oil and supply natural gas to its expanding energy and power sectors. UMC, in partnership with the Ivoirian state oil company Petroci, has tested 14,000 barrels of oil a day, with enough reserves to supply the whole country for the next 20 years, at the Lion One field, over a well drilled by Philips Petroleum in the 1980s. The well also has a large volume of associated natural gas. UMC has also tested 30m cubic feet a day of natural gas and 732 barrels a day of condensate at its Panther One field. UMC expects to complete negotiations with the Ivoirian government for a gas supply contract end-user by June, although the end-user is not yet known. Associated gas cannot be separated from the oil, so if there is no gas contract by January, the gas from the Lion field would have to be flared, which is environmentally damaging and a waste of resources. Compagnie des Energies Nouvelles de Cote d'Ivoire (Cenci), a French-led consortium, also plans to supply gas but has so far failed to find finance to develop its offshore gas field, Foxtrot. Partners in Cenci include SAUR, the local subsidiary of Electricite de France and the French construction firm Bouygues; Petroci; and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). A spokesman for UMC says that that there is enough domestic gas demand for both its own and Cenci's projects. Cote d'Ivoire's electricity is very expensive and the power generation sector is trying to reduce both its costs and eliminate its imports. A large part of its electricity is imported from Ghana's big hydro-electric plant and it relies on energy imported from Nigeria for its local generation. The proposed nickel mine near the north-western border with Liberia, which a Canadian group plans to develop, would need 100 MW of power. Gas is also needed for the state's 50,000 barrels a day oil refinery at Vridi near Abidjan. UMC signed production sharing agreements for its two fields with the government in late 1992, after amendments to Cote d'Ivoire's antiquated mineral laws, under terms which it says are favourable for both sides and will encourage further oil exploration and production. 'We believe there are several other exciting prospects along the coast of Cote d'Ivoire and are negotiating for more blocks,' said a company spokesman in Abidjan. UMC is also carrying out seismic testing for oil in Equatorial Guinea and will start drilling later this year.</p>

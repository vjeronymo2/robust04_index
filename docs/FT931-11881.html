			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Gould raps Labour on economic policy LABOUR was urged yesterday by Mr Bryan Gould to adopt a more radical economic policy and to stop echoing the government's analysis. The former shadow cabinet member said in a scathing attack on the Labour leadership that while its paper setting out Budget measures was excellent, it was 'sinking without trace - as virtually all Labour's economic policies sink without trace'. That was because no one believed they could be implemented. Speaking on BBC Television's On the Record, Mr Gould, who stood against Mr John Smith for the party leadership and later resigned from the shadow cabinet over European policy, also criticised the party for being too cautious. 'It is time the Labour party showed the way and led the way by breaking free from that last hangover of an imperial economy,' he said. Mr Gould's words will fuel the argument in the party about its future direction. His belief that Labour should have full employment as a core aim of economic policy strikes a chord with some Labour spokesmen. He also called for an increase in public spending, especially for infrastructure investment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Secretary provides a paper IPS form to the institution for completion and return to the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The institution may also meet this reporting requirement by submitting the IPS and Payment Voucher information to the Department on a floppy disk, on a magnetic tape, or by an electronic transmission through a modem from a personal computer, minicomputer, or mainframe computer. These submissions are referred to, respectively, as the Federal Pell Grant Program Floppy Disk Data Exchange, the Federal Pell Grant Program Recipient Data Exchange (RDE), and Electronic Payments service under EDE. An institution that wishes to use one of these automated reporting methods must enter into a written agreement with the Department and must agree to (1) comply with the Department's prescribed manner of formatting and presenting the submitted information, (2) restrict access to the records from which the IPS and Payment Voucher information is derived, and (3) ensure that only authorized officials or agents of the institution may enter the data sent in the IPS submission to the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department credits an institution's Federal Pell Grant account on the basis of acceptable Federal Pell Grant payment data submitted through the system described in this notice. Such information must be submitted to the Department in a timely, certified, and acceptable form. A submission is timely if received by the Department by the deadlines prescribed in Tables II and III in part IV.C. of this notice; certified if its accuracy is attested to by the institution in the manner described in part IV.D. of this notice; and acceptable if submitted in accordance with the directions provided by the Department for the particular medium of submission used by the institution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to meet these reporting requirements may result in administrative action by the Department under Subpart G of 34 CFR Part 668 under which the Department may fine the institution or limit or terminate its participation in the Federal Pell Grant Program. In addition, failure to report accurately a student's award amount by the reporting deadline may render the student ineligible for all or part of his or her Federal Pell Grant payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Data and Records To Be Submitted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In each IPS submission, the institution must submit: (1) On the IPS form, or in the IPS record format, information described in section II of the IPS, including the number and amount of each Federal Pell Grant award adjustment that the institution made, and the institution's total payments to all Federal Pell Grant recipients for the award year up to the date of the submission; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An SAR Payment Voucher (part 3 of the SAR), or its equivalent as defined by the Secretary, that discloses_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Any new Federal Pell Grant recipients identified by the institution during the reporting period for which the IPS is submitted; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Any change in enrollment status, cost of attendance, or other event that occurred during either the reporting period for which the IPS is submitted or the reporting period immediately preceding that reporting period, if that event causes a change in the amount of the Federal Pell Grant that a student has received or qualifies to receive for the award year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The institution may submit the IPS without SAR Payment Vouchers (or the equivalent) if (1) The institution had no Federal Pell Grant recipients in attendance or identified no new Federal Pell Grant recipients during the reporting period for which the IPS is submitted and (2) did not identify any changes to the awards of previously reported recipients during the reporting period immediately preceding the period for which the IPS is submitted. If an institution that submits IPS information under RDE exercises this option, it must use the paper IPS document. If an institution that submits IPS information via a floppy disk or electronic transmission exercises this option, it may use its usual submission medium or the paper IPS document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=4 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control Numbers 1840&hyph;0132 (SAR) and 1840&hyph;0540 (IPS)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

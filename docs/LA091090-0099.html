			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CRASH KILLS WOMAN; YOUTH, 17, ARRESTED  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Anaheim youth was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of vehicular  manslaughter after his car slammed into another in a Garden Grove intersection,  injuring the driver and killing her passenger, authorities said.  </P> <P> The impact ejected passenger Toni Marie Fatone, 38, of Anaheim, whose body was  found in bushes about 20 feet from the intersection of Orangewood Avenue and  Brookhurst Street, Garden Grove police said. She died of massive head injuries  in the 2 a.m. crash, a spokesman for the coroner's office said.  </P> <P> The driver of the car in which Fatone rode was treated for cuts and bruises at  Humana Hospital-Westminster and later released, authorities said. She was  identified as Linda Wendt, 32, of Norwalk, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Bump Willis  said.  </P> <P> In a related crash that occurred minutes earlier about a quarter of a mile  away, the Anaheim youth allegedly rammed a motorcyclist with his car and fled,  police said. The cyclist, Dennis Villalon, 20, of Anaheim was in stable  condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old suspect apparently was not injured in either collision, Willis  said. The unidentified teen-ager was being held Sunday at Juvenile Hall in  Orange.  </P> <P> The chain of events began shortly before 2 a.m., when the suspect got into an  argument with Villalon at a party in the Garden Grove area, police said. Both  left the party. The teen-ager then allegedly rammed Villalon's motorcycle at  Palmwood Drive and Orangewood Avenue.  </P> <P> The youth fled the crash scene and sped westbound on Orangewood, crashing into  Wendt's car, which was southbound on Brookhurst, police said. The impact spun  Wendt's car around, ejecting Fatone.  </P> <P> Dazed and with blood streaming down her forehead, Wendt was found sitting  beside the road wondering what had happened to her passenger, said a nearby  resident who went outside after she was awakened by the noise. Passersby then  began searching for Fatone and found her body in the bushes, said the resident,  who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> The suspect was arrested at the scene.

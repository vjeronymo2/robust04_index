			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / People: Bodies politic The Confederation of British Industry's determination to take tourism seriously received a further boost this week when four new members joined its tourism action group. This brings the membership of the group, which aims to boost tourism's standing in the UK, to 22. The most prominent of the four new members is Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, which frequently receives better reviews from foreign visitors than it does from the capital's regular users. The other members are Rowland Hardwick, managing director of English Country Cottages, whose ravishing brochures boast some of the best UK self-catering accommodation; Neil Chalmers, director of the Natural History Museum; and Henry Head, md of Norfolk Lavender, which grows lavender and whose farms are a tourist attraction in their own right. The action group is chaired by Sir John Egan, chief executive of airports group BAA.</p>

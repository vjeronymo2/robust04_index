This condition does not preclude the payment of investment advisory fees or similar fees by the Funds to the Bank under the terms of an investment advisory agreement adopted in accordance with section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other agreement between the Bank and the Funds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) In the event of an increase in the rate of any fees paid by the Funds to the Bank regarding any investment management services, investment advisory services, or fees for similar services that the Bank provides to the Funds over an existing rate for such services that had been authorized by a Second Fiduciary, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section II, the Bank will, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such increase, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans invested in a Fund which is increasing such fees. Such notice shall be accompanied by the Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III below;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) In the event of an addition of a Secondary Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, provided by the Bank to the Fund for which a fee is charged or an increase in the rate of any fee paid by the Funds to the Bank for any Secondary Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, that results either from an increase in the rate of such fee or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over an existing rate for such Secondary Service which had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section II, the Bank will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service for which a fee is charged or fee increase, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the additional service for which a fee is charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans invested in a Fund which is adding a service or increasing fees.

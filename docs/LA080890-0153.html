			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WOMAN ALLEGES AFFAIR WITH GEORGIA NUN  </P> <P> The woman who said she had affairs with a Roman Catholic archbishop and two  priests also claimed a sexual relationship with a nun in the mid-1980s, it was  reported today.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Constitution said its sources were two people familiar with the  account Vicki R. Long gave to church officials.  </P> <P> The newspaper said Long, 27, a single mother, claimed she worked with the nun  at St. Francis Hospital in Columbus, Ga., and was seduced at age 19 during a  weekend visit they made to Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh is the home convent of the Franciscan Sisters of Millvale, which  furnishes nuns to St. Francis Hospital. The newspaper said repeated telephone  calls to hospital spokesman R. Craig DuPriest and the administrator, Sister  Patricia Garrigan, were not returned.  </P> <P> The nun, who was transferred from Columbus, was not identified.  </P> <P> Long is seeking financial compensation from the Roman Catholic Church, claiming  she was seduced by former Atlanta Archbishop Eugene A. Marino when she went to  him for counseling. Marino, who was the highest-ranking black in the church,  resigned last month citing health reasons and revealed last week that he had  been involved in a two-year romantic relationship with Long.  </P></p>

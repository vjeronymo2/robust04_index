			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Yeltsin faces pressure to step down as premier POLITICAL pressure is mounting in Moscow to remove Mr Boris Yeltsin as prime minister and install an administration less committed to radical economic reform. Mr Yeltsin, who is both president and prime minister, remains the most popular Russian politician in the polls, but has been identified with his government's severe economic reforms and made vulnerable to parliamentary attack. The first strong signs of the political offensive against Mr Yeltsin emerged this week. A meeting on Tuesday of the Constitutional Commission, which is working on the draft constitution, cut the parliamentary votes needed to remove a prime minister from two-thirds to a bare majority and deleted Mr Yeltsin's right to appoint regional governors. While Mr Yeltsin may be able to restore the clauses he has lost, the victory of the anti-government forces shows the rising tide of discontent. The opposition is concentrated among disaffected deputies who are unhappy with Mr Yeltsin's concentration of powers. Earlier this month, Mr Yeltsin added the post of defence minister to his portfolios. Under his presidency, Russia has assumed most of the powers of the former Soviet Union. In October last year he also won the right in parliament to legislate by decree - a right deputies now regret. Mr Yeltsin admitted yesterday that the government would fall if he were replaced as prime minister, because it is sustained by his own popularity. No one will challenge him as president, but many Russian deputies feel he should go as premier. Many observers believe he will have to sacrifice Mr Genady Burbulis, the unpopular first deputy prime minister - who received a 0.8 per cent approval rating in a public opinion poll yesterday - but he may be able to defend Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform. A senior western diplomat said yesterday: 'Gaidar is very important for the IMF right now, and Yeltsin knows how important the IMF is to him.' That said, Mr Gaidar was accused by former presidential advisers on Tuesday of being a tool in the hands of the Fund. The opposition, focused on the figures of Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, and more particularly Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman, pits the powers of parliament against those of the government when the constitution does not clearly define either. For example, Mr Khasbulatov has 'settled' the threatened airline pilots' strike by promising to pay them everything they want, though there seems to have been no liaison between him and the government, which will have to pay the costs of the settlement. Mr Gaidar is defending himself strongly, and has banned all talk of resignation among his team. G7 aid to Russia, Page 2</p>

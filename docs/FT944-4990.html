			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / A dangerous battleground You may not believe the passage I am about to cite unless you heard it with your own ears, but here it is: 'The United Kingdom - the greatest cradle of culture and academic and scientific and artistic and political achievement in modern times - that's not some trifle to be lightly set at risk.' This anachronistic fantasy was purveyed by Mr John Major, in a speech written for delivery at last Friday's conference of Conservative women. An ancient mirage of national glory was his product, the flag his packaging. 'It is,' said the prime minister, referring to the country he runs with such effortless brilliance, 'the highest cause this party knows - and we will defend it with every fibre of our being.' There you have it. England beats Graeco-Roman civilisation into a cocked hat. The Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Germans, the Egyptians, the Italians, the Indians, the Persians - oh, why bother to list them, they are all foreign, and they have nothing to teach the British. Music, painting, philosophy, science, the very act of learning were all invented here. There is a certain sadness in the vainglorious, grandiloquent rodomontade with which some of our politicians express their nostalgia for a faded past. Thank heavens there are fewer than six years to endure before 2000. Then it should be clear to everyone, even Mr Major, that the 19th century is over. Sorry about that moment of passion. I was looking through the prime minister's address to the Tory ladies when the above-quoted nonsense leapt out. The business of the day is cool analysis of Mr Major's attack on Labour's proposals for constitutional reform, and the opposition's response. The matter can be disposed of quite succinctly. Labour is right on the merits of the case. The prime minister may be right on where the political advantage lies. Mr Major believes that his warning that devolution of power to a Scottish parliament would lead to the break-up of the UK was an important element in his election victory of 1992; the opposition parties have nevertheless persisted with their modest proposals for constitutional change. These include regional assemblies, the exclusion of hereditary peers from the House of Lords, a referendum on electoral reform, a bill of rights, a freedom of information act, and the curtailment of the crown prerogative, the unwritten law that permits ministers to legislate in the name of the monarch. Most of these have been propounded in this space, as elsewhere. Whether or not you agree with any of them or indeed the package as a whole depends on whether you regard the British executive as sufficiently checked and balanced by other branches of government - and whether you think our system is producing good governance. The argument has been rehearsed many times, principally among the chattering classes, but also through pressure groups such as Charter 88. This week the audience may have been further enlarged because Mr Jack Straw appeared on a TV programme in which he repeated his well-known view that the monarchy ought to be retrenched, limited to its symbolic functions. That would protect it from misuse as camouflage for the elective dictatorship. The Conservatives grasped the opportunity. 'Labour attacks Queen' touches the nationalist nerve Mr Major hoped to reach when he spoke last Friday. You can see the Tory train of thought. Never mind the details of the proposals by the opposition's spokesman on home affairs. They are merely common sense. Forget the personal life of the Prince of Wales, or the difficulties into which the minor members of the house of Windsor have stumbled. They are merely show business. Concentrate on the Queen herself, the institution, the flag, the nation. Mr Peter Lilley has done so. 'Labour voters are usually in my experience very conservative, very pro-monarchy, very pro-Britain,' the secretary for social security observed at the weekend. There has been plenty of time to get this kind of thinking into people's heads. It was in 1838 that Peel delineated as Conservative principles 'the maintenance of the Peerage and the Monarchy - the continuance of the just powers and attributes of King, Lords, and Commons . . .' I, and perhaps you, may think that a century and a half later some rational modifications would improve our polity, but our elevated opinion may carry little weight when set against bar-room salutes to 'Queen and Country'. Yet Labour has no choice but to do battle on this dangerous ground. In nearly every other area it is the 'me too' party. Privatisation? Labour will leave untouched whatever it finds in the private sector. Tax increases? Not us, guv. Schools? We'll do what the Conservatives do, but rename it. Health? Ditto. Increase public spending? Perish the thought. Changing the nature of the state is another matter. Labour will undertake what its leader, lovingly quoted by Mr Major, has called 'the most extensive package of constitutional reform ever proposed by a British government'. That, said the prime minister, was a 'sort of teenage madness'. You could throw in one other small item - the European Union. Broadly speaking, Labour is for it, the Conservatives increasingly against it. It was Lady Thatcher who dramatised the connection between Europe, the monarchy and nationhood when, as prime minister, she spoke of the single currency as a threat to the Queen's head on the coinage. Conservative Eurosceptics tend to be Peelites; they view the institutions of England, and the character of the English, as strengths that 'enabled this country, in her contests and the fearful rivalry of war, to extort the admiration of the world'. That may have been stirring stuff in 1838. Today, with the nation in reduced circumstances, the British constitution clearly needs modernising. To say that what Parliament ordains is all the law you need is no longer tenable. If Ulster can have an assembly, why not Scotland? The Crown must adapt to survive. The Commons should sit for a fixed term. The people should be given a choice on electoral reform. Labour must counter emotional declarations of greatness with suchlike reasoned propositions. Alas, bombast usually wins. Reform sounds sensible to me. But does it stand a chance against 'the Queen, God bless her'?</p>

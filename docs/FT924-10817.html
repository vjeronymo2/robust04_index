			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Ford's Dollars 159m loss worse than expected FORD MOTOR of the US yesterday reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 159m (Pounds 97.5m). It blamed weak markets in North America and overseas, compounded by turmoil in European currency markets. The losses were worse than Wall Street expected - in spite of being partly offset by a surprisingly strong performance at Ford's financial services business - and the shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 38 1/8 . The results compare with a Dollars 202m profit earlier this month by Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers, and a loss of up to Dollars 850m expected to be announced today by General Motors. Ford's figures, equivalent to losses of 43 cents a share, compared with losses of Dollars 574m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, in last year's third quarter when the US recession was particularly severe. Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 21.1bn to Dollars 23.3bn. Mr Harold Poling, chairman, said the remainder of 1992 and 1993 would be 'challenging'. The US economy, although improving, continued to grow slowly while Europe was weakening. He warned that losses could extend into the fourth quarter, if recovery in the US failed to accelerate. Ford's motor operations lost Dollars 464m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 751m a year ago. The US accounted for Dollars 153m of red ink, down from Dollars 197m, while overseas operations lost Dollars 311m, down from Dollars 554m. However, the financial services subsidiary made Dollars 305m in the quarter, a Dollars 128m improvement on last year, thanks to reduced credit losses and improved interest margins. In spite of the quarter's losses, Ford is considered the healthiest US motor group, with the most efficient North American plants and a product range gaining market share over the past year. This trend could be helped by the turmoil at GM, whose chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, resigned on Monday. Mr Poling said the company's combined car and truck market share in the US had risen to 24.5 per cent this year, compared with 23 per cent in 1991. He attributed the third-quarter loss to slow sales, and seasonal inventory adjustments. Currency uncertainty had led to lower sales in most of Ford's European markets, he added.

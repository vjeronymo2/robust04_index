			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Decline of 24% at British Dredging In reporting interim pre-tax profits 24 per cent lower, after exceptional charges, British Dredging said all companies except BDC Concrete Products were trading profitably. From turnover of Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 16.1m) in the six months to June 30, profit fell from Pounds 759,000 to Pounds 578,000 after redundancy costs of Pounds 85,000. The number of employees from existing operations had been reduced by 11.5 per cent between January and July. There were higher profits from Avonmouth Ship Repairers and from the 50 per cent associate British Dredging Aggregates. The two companies involved in the distribution of building materials suffered from reduced demand but achieved slightly higher margins. Net interest income fell to Pounds 306,000 (Pounds 491,000), about half of which stemmed from the expenditure on two new investments. Earnings per share worked through at 2.2p (2.88p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.6p.</p>

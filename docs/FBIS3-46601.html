			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Malaysia Monday became  the first country to have a fully fledged Islamic financial  system with the launch of an interbank money-market that  operates on an Islam-sanctioned profit-sharing concept.    "The launch of an Islamic interbank money market and  cheque-clearing system completes the setting up of the world's  first full-fledged Islamic financial system in Malaysia," said  Nor Mohamed Yakcop, adviser to the central bank, Bank Negara.    Predominantly Moslem Malaysia, he said, was also the only  country to have a Moslem financial system that ran parallel to  the conventional banking system practised by the West.    Many bankers, however, see the Moslem system as a sham to  hide interest payments or "wiba" which are forbidden under  Islamic law.    Nor said the launch capped a year of planning by the central  bank to work out the financial instruments.    "The Islamic interbank money market operates on the basis of  Al- Mudharabah or profit-sharing, which simply means that the  provider of funds will earn a profit from his investments  instead of being paid interest," he said.    Bankers also began Monday to trade in short-term bankers'  acceptances on a profit-sharing basis.    The profit earned from the money lent would be shared  between  the provider and borrower on a ratio that could range from  70:30, 80:20 or 90:10 depending on the loan-period, he said.    "The profit-sharing ratios will be liberalised by the  central  bank in due course when everybody is comfortable with the new  system to allow the ratios to be negotiated between the  investing and receiving institutions," he said.    The other countries which have an Islamic banking system are  Pakistan, Iran and Sudan, but they do not have the conventional  banking system and an Islamic interbank money market facility.    Indonesia, which has an Islamic banking system running  alongside the conventional banking practices, also does not have  an interbank money market facility, Nor said.    Bankers say the Malaysian development is a significant move  that should be emulated by other Moslem countries to stem the  large outflow of funds from Islamic countries to non-Islamic  banks in the West.    "It is an irony that some Islamic countries are borrowing  substantially from non-Islamic institutions in the West, while  other Islamic countries are depositing funds with them," said  central bank governor Jaffar Hussein.    "The western non-Islamic banks are just recyling funds  belonging to the Moslems to other Moslems and making a big and  hefty profit in the process," Jaffar said recently.    Islamic banking in Malaysia was pioneered by the country's  sole Islamic bank, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, which was set up in  1983.    Since then 20 other financial institutions in the country  have adopted the Islam-sanctioned banking facilities alongside  conventional banking.    Bankers see the difference between the Moslem banking  practice and the conventional banking system as "pure cosmetic."    "Under Islamic banking, the bank lends you money, but in a  slightly different way," said Bank Islam's managing director  Halim Ismail.    "Take the common housing loan. The bank will buy the house  on  your behalf and then sells the house to you at a price which  includes the cost and a margin of profit, but still allows you  to make deferred payments."    "That extra amount that you pay will be more or less equal  to  the extra amount that you will pay when borrowing from  commercial banks," Halim said.</p>

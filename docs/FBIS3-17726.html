			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Somewhat more than 25 percent of the electorate came  to the polls in Sunday's second round of voting in the  parliamentary election in the Russian republic of Chuvashia,  said a spokesman for the republic's Central Electoral Commission.    He told INTERFAX on Monday that, as a result, 21 more seats  were filled of the future legislature's total of 47, in addition  to seven obtained during the first round. This still fails to  reach the minimum of 32 necessary to make the new parliament's  decisions valid.    With its former parliament dissolved, Chuvashia will for an  indefinite time have no legislature, the spokesman said.  Legislative authority will temporarily be vested in the  presidium of the previous parliament, headed by the latter's  speaker, Eduard Kuborev.</p>

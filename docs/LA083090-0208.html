			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-MAI EMPLOYEES SETTLE INSIDER CHARGES;  </P> <P> SECURITIES: THE THREE WERE ACCUSED BY THE SEC WITH TRADING ON UNPUBLISHED  INFORMATION IN ATTEMPTED TAKEOVER OF PRIME COMPUTER.  </P> <P> Three former employees of MAI Basic Four Inc., including two top financial  executives, settled civil charges Wednesday that they traded on inside  information about MAI's planned takeover bid for Prime Computer Inc. in 1988.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission said that Dale T. Jabour of Santa Ana,  Ronald Lee Thurman of Orange and Winston M. Cheong of Costa Mesa have agreed to  settle the charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The SEC alleged that Jabour, a former director of accounting at MAI, purchased  Prime call options after overhearing two MAI executives discuss the Tustin  computer company's planned takeover of Prime in October, 1988.  </P> <P> MAI launched a surprise hostile tender offer for Prime on Nov. 15. Prime, a  Natick, Mass., computer maker, rebuffed the MAI bid and after a protracted  takeover fight, Prime agreed to be acquired by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New  York investment firm, in August, 1989.  </P> <P> Jabour, 36, is accused of passing the non-public information to Thurman, 37,  then director of financial planning at MAI, and Cheong, 31, a staff business  analyst. The three executives bought a total of 375 options to purchase Prime  common stock at prices between $15 and $17.50 per share, the SEC alleged.  </P> <P> A call option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy 100 shares of a company  stock at a predetermined price at a future date. For investors who think a  stock may rise dramatically, such options permit a profit from a smaller  investment than it would take to buy the stock.  </P> <P> The SEC alleged that Jabour and Cheong sold their Prime options three days  after MAI publicly announced its bid for Prime. Jabour realized $21,800 in  profits and Cheong made $3,830. Thurman sold his Prime options within two weeks  and, because of a decline in the stock's price, profited only $1,875, the SEC  alleged.  </P> <P> Federal securities laws prohibit company employees from trading on sensitive  information before it has been made public.  </P> <P> Before the SEC action, Jabour returned his $21,800 in alleged illegal profits  to the party that sold him the Prime options, said James W. Mercer, Jabour's  Los Angeles attorney.  </P> <P> "Dale has suffered a lot and is glad this is over," Mercer said. He said Jabour  is now employed as a corporate controller for another Southern California  company.  </P> <P> Bertrand Weidberg, MAI's general counsel, said Jabour told MAI management in  February, 1989, that he had purchased Prime options based on non-public  information, and then resigned weeks later. The company was unaware of Thurman  and Cheong's involvement "until literally hours before their resignation"  within the past month, he said.  </P> <P> Thurman, who has been ordered to pay $3,750 in restitution and fines, would not  comment on the case.  </P> <P> Cheong, who will have to pay $7,660 in restitution and fines, could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Although the profits involved were relatively small, James L. Sanders, the SEC  regional administrator in Los Angeles, said this will send a message to others.  </P> <P> He said that the three executives could face criminal charges if they violate  the SEC injunction prohibiting them from engaging in securities violations in  the future.  </P></p>

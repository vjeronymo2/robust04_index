			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Buying Spanish minority for Pounds 23m BARCLAYS intends to spend Pounds 23m in acquiring the remaining 8.8 per cent of the shares in its Spanish subsidiary. It is making an offer of Pta825 per share which values them at 25 per cent over the price quoted on April 16. The bank, which wholly owns most of its subsidiaries in Europe, said it expected to gain regulatory approval for the deal from the Spanish Securities Commission within 10 days. It subsequently expected to end the local listing. Barclays said the largest minority holder of Barclays Bank SA, in which it first acquired an 80 per cent stake in 1981, had already indicated he would accept for his holding of 4.06 per cent of total shares. The bank listed its subsidiary on the Spanish exchange in 1988 in order to establish a market in the shares for minority holders. However, it said liquidity and turnover since then had been inadequate to achieve the original aim. Barclays Bank SA has assets of Pounds 220m, and contributed a profit of Pounds 18m to the parent, which last year recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m. The parent bank said the acquisition was in line with its preference for whole ownership of its subsidiaries.</p>

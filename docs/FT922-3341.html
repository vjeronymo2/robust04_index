			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Fall in April consumer demand weakens Dow Wall Street TRADING on US markets retained its negative bias yesterday as share prices fell sharply for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.70 at 3,343.22. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.82 at 407.24, while the Nasdaq composite fell 4.09 to 569.71. Turnover on the NYSE was 208m shares. Although no new economic figures were out, the announcement late on Tuesday of a 6.3 per cent drop in April consumer borrowing unsettled sentiment. The unexpected decline was the largest monthly drop since 1980. Any weakness in consumer demand could threaten the economic recovery, so the borrowing data added to investors' worries about the outlook for an economy that is already performing below expectations. Among individual stocks, Northern Telecom fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 in active trading after the company warned that its second quarter earnings would be below market expectations, and that its revenues may even be lower than a year ago. International Paper, which fell on Tuesday after a Salomon sector downgrade, recovered with a gain of Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 66 3/8 after another broking house, Oppenheimer, added the stock to its short-term buy list, and predicted that the shares would trade in a range of Dollars 72 to Dollars 75 over the next three to six months. Stocks of securities companies fell amid concern that interest rates may have bottomed and that equity prices may be heading for a sizeable correction. Both factors would hurt the sector's earnings, which have been running at record levels for the past 12 months. Among the losers were Salomon, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 31 3/4 , Merrill Lynch, down Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 44 3/4 , Morgan Stanley, Dollars 1 7/8 lower at Dollars 48 7/8, and PaineWebber, Dollars  3/4 weaker at Dollars 19 1/4 . General Instrument returned to the market. The company's initial public offering of 22m shares was made at a price of Dollars 15 a share. At the close the stock was at Dollars 15 on turnover of 2m shares. Universal Foods eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 28 7/8 after warning that 'very difficult times' in the French fry business would probably result in revenues for the current fiscal year coming in below Dollars 900m. On the Nasdaq market, comments from Technology Solutions that a write-off for receivables and contracts this year would not affect net income failed to impress the market, which sold the stock down Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 14 1/2 . Canada TORONTO prices closed lower in moderate trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE composite index fell 17.46 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 3,368.63. Declines led advances by 318 to 236, volume fell to 24.9m shares from 35.9m shares previously, and trading value was CDollars 359.7m against CDollars 397.3m.</p>

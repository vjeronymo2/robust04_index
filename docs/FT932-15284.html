			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais to lift BFH stake CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, is to increase its holding in Banque Franco-Hellenique de Commerce International et Maritime (BFH), an Athens-based bank, to 75 per cent by acquiring a 25 per cent stake. The French bank has agreed to buy the 25 per cent of BFH from the state-owned National Investment Bank for Industrial Development (Eteva) for an undisclosed sum. Eteva will retain the remaining 25 per cent. Under the terms of the agreement, BFH, with a net worth of about Dr7bn (Dollars 32m), will be expected to seek a listing on the Athens stock exchange within the next three years. Credit Lyonnais has managed BFH since it was set up 12 years ago when Greece joined the European Community. In addition to trade financing, BFH has built up a shipping portfolio and is expanding into private banking. Eteva, an investment bank controlled by National Bank of Greece, the country's largest state-owned bank, has been trying to dispose of its holding in BHF for some time. Eteva plans to move into commercial banking, building a network of branches around Greece, as its development role has been curtailed by the government's privatisation policy.</p>

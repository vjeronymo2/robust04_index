			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BECKMAN POSTS LOWER PROFITS AND FLAT SALES  </P> <P> Beckman Instruments on Tuesday reported flat sales and slightly lower profits  for its fourth quarter and year.  </P> <P> For the year ended Dec. 31, the Fullerton-based manufacturer of scientific and  diagnostic medical instruments said its sales were $785.9 million, a 2%  increase from 1988.  </P> <P> Earnings were $41.9 million, compared to $42.5 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> For the quarter, Beckman reported earnings of $10.4 million and sales of $199.7  million, compared to earnings of $11.2 million and sales of $199.1 million  during the corresponding period in 1988.  </P> <P> The company attributed its sluggish performance to declining sales to publicly  funded laboratories and private firms. Beckman Chairman Louis Rosso said many  corporations were spending more on research and development and less on new  equipment during the year. He also said publicly funded research labs have  slowed spending because of cutbacks in their funding.  </P> <P> Rosso said he expected declining sales in the public sector to continue at  least through the first half of this year.  </P> <P> "The instrumentation market in the medical and scientific fields has become  somewhat soft," said Steven Gerber, medical technology analyst with the Los  Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIM  </P> <P> When he retired after 22 years as chancellor of UC Irvine in 1984, Daniel G.  Aldrich Jr. left a bustling university that boasted many respected programs,  from an innovative School of Criticism and Theory to a medical school. Among  its notable scholars were F. Sherwood Rowland, Frederick Reines and James  McGaugh, pioneering researchers into the ozone layer, the existence of  neutrinos and human memory, respectively.  </P> <P> A one-time soils chemist, Aldrich, who died Monday of cancer at 71, was the  academic architect of the Irvine campus, taking the helm in the early 1960s  when the campus was nothing more than an expanse of hills.  </P> <P> His tenure lasted far longer than any other chancellor's in the UC system, and  twice he was called back after retirement -- once to be acting chancellor at UC  Riverside and later to the same post at UC Santa Barbara after its chancellor  became embroiled in a financial scandal. No wonder Aldrich was affectionately  described by UC President David P. Gardner as the university's "utility  chancellor."  </P> <P> Known as "Chancellor Dan" on campus, he successfully steered the fledgling  institution through its early days and the turbulent '60s. He believed in  hiring good people and then letting them do the job. He was at heart a New  England farm boy who, despite his important educational positions, retained a  sense of humor and always sought to maintain that down-to-earth touch.  </P> <P> In many ways, Orange County and UC Irvine grew up together. Without Aldrich,  there still would have been a new university established in one of the  fastest-growing areas of the state. But Aldrich was the right choice for the  time and task, and because of his work all of Southern California is better  equipped to study, understand and solve the urban problems of its future.  </P></p>

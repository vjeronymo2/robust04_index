			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LOST FORMICANS' MIRRORS THE ANGST OF THE '80S  </P> <P> One way for the playwright to deal with the confusions of his time is to trace  them back to a single cause. For Clifford Odets in the '30s, the problem was  simple: greed. Life mustn't be "printed on dollar bills."  </P> <P> For Constance Congdon, author of "Tales of the Lost Formicans" at the Matrix,  the problem isn't simple. She is not sure what has gone wrong in the '80s. All  she knows is that everything is coming apart, starting with the family. How to  convey this? Go with the flow.  </P> <P> Realizing that a play needs a form, Congdon does connect her tales. But very  loosely. We are supposedly watching a sort of 3-D video of life on Earth in the  late 20th Century, prepared by scientists on another planet several eons down  the line.  </P> <P> They know us as the Formicans, a lost tribe who spent Saturday afternoons  worshipping at the mall. (The play ends with the mall in flames.) It may be  that they had agents among us. It may even be that they helped to drive us  crazy.  </P> <P> Congdon has some fun with this Planet X business, linking it to the conspiracy  theories that help the credulous keep the faith these days. (Don Schlossman  plays an earnest young Formican who points out that J.F.K. was assassinated in  a Lincoln convertible. "Think about it." Hmm.)  </P> <P> But Congdon doesn't pursue her little green scientists too far. (They don't  have to be played that way for us to see them that way.) Her real concern is  for the creatures on their screen. As with "The Skin of Our Teeth," once you  strip away the sideshow, you find a family play.  </P> <P> "Home" is a leitmotif, but the home under observation is on the rocks. Dad is  off on some private mental journey of his own, occasioned by Alzheimer's  disease. (Actor Hal Bokar shows how absorbing Dad finds this.) Mother (K  Callan, pale as the grave) wishes she had as good an excuse to tune out the  real world.  </P> <P> Their two daughters (the conscientious one, Joan McMurtrey, and the rowdy one,  Lois Foraker) are suffering Post-Divorce Stress Syndrome, as evidenced by an  insane urge to torch Foraker's ex-husband's Corvette.  </P> <P> And the teen-age grandson is your typical monster of the malls. Is it his fault  that it costs $100 to talk to a buddy in New York for an hour? "I didn't ask to  be born, you know." (Insufferable boy, and actor Joshua Goddard shows that he  could do some real damage, like Cain in "The Skin of Our Teeth.")  </P> <P> "Tales of the Lost Formicans" inspires the laughter of recognition. Yes, that's  how it is in the late '80s, everybody bemoaning the absence of old-fashioned  values as they leave the house to torch a Corvette or to meet somebody in a  motel. Values are for other people. We have needs.  </P> <P> Yet Congdon doesn't see her characters as vicious. They're simply going for the  gold of self-realization, as recommended by the '60s and '70s. But actress  McMurtrey, at the center of the play, sees that it doesn't help to blame Abbie  Hoffman or Ronald Reagan or Dr. Ruth for getting us into this mess. As her  mother says, nobody's minding the store any more. We have to make our own moral  selections.  </P> <P> McMurtrey doesn't put this realization into words. It's not that kind of play.  But she does make a journey, with the help of co-directors Lee Shallat and  Kristoffer Siegel-Tabori, and this helps to unify a play that is too honest to  propose any univocal explanation for the confusions of the day, or any instant  remedy for them.  </P> <P> Maybe "instant" is part of the problem. By constructing the play in bits and  pieces, Congdon gives us a slight case of information anxiety, surely one of  the symptoms of the age. By going with the flow, she has created a play that  stays on track. We have beheld her aliens and, lo, they are us.  </P> <P>  Plays in repertory with "Better Living" at 7657 Melrose Ave., through Dec. 3.

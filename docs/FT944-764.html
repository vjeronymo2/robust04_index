			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglesey mine hopes revived Hopes have been raised again that Britain's first big base metals mine for decades will be developed at Parys Mountain, Anglesey. This follows a change in the majority shareholder at Anglesey Mining, the London-quoted company that has been dormant for two years after running out of cash for the mine, which was to have produced zinc, lead and copper plus a few troy ounces of gold. However, Mr John Kearney, well-known in the mining industry as chairman of Northgate Exploration, a Canadian company, and who has taken over as chairman of Anglesey, is cautious about prospects. He says that, although his objective is to see the UK company as an active mining company, at present there are no plans to re-start the Parys Mountain project. First Anglesey's outstanding debts have to be dealt with. Then Mr Kearney promises 'we will take another look at the Parys Mountain project. It has titillated mining companies for decades'. Anglesey spent about Pounds 8.5m in four years on the project and Mr Kearney says that all the work will be reviewed. 'It is a marginal property. We will see if mining can be done more cheaply, more efficiently.' The Parys Mountain area of North Wales has a long mining history, dating back to Roman times. During the late 18th century it had one of the world's largest copper mines, supplying much of the metal required for Britain's industrial revolution. About 3.5m tonnes of rock was moved by hand, pulled up from a growing pit by ropes and eventually the mountain contained the biggest man-made hole in the world - a position it retained until the late 1890s. Mining eventually ended in 1911 after 143 years of almost continuous activity during which an estimated 130,000 tonnes of copper was produced. Backing the attempted revival of the Anglesey company is Mid Ocean Investments, a private, Bermuda-based corporation which Mr Kearney says 'represents private money which believes in the mining business'. He is a director of Mid Ocean. Mid Ocean acquired a 29.3 per cent stake in Anglesey from Imperial Metals, another Canadian company which previously backed Anglesey and is left with 11.9 per cent. Mid Ocean also bought all of Imperial's loans to Anglesey totalling Pounds 1.8m. Mid Ocean has agreed not to call these in, says Mr Kearney. However, there is another Pounds 800,000 owed to about 12 third-party creditors so the debt must be restructured.</p>

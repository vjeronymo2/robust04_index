			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About 300 small nurseries and 330 producers of Christmas trees and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forest products operate in the 18 newly quarantined counties. All could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably be classified as small entities by Small Business Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less). While most of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small nurseries in these counties specialize in production of deciduous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landscape products, some also produce rooted pine Christmas trees and pine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursery stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action will affect only the sale of restricted pine products from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarantined areas to non-quarantined areas. If inspected and found to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infested with the pine shoot beetle, restricted pine products can be either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverted for sale within local markets or treated in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;301.50&hyph;10 prior to shipment to a non-quarantined area. Based on information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquired from extension agents and trade association representatives, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate that in the newly quarantined counties, the sale of restricted pine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products to buyers in non-quarantined areas will represent less than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of total sales by small nurseries and less than five percent of total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales by Christmas tree and forest product producers. We anticipate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, that this action will not have a significant economic impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small nurseries, Christmas tree farmers, or other forest product producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a few logging operations in the newly quarantined counties in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pennsylvania. However, these operations harvest hardwoods primarily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the little pine that is cut is sold locally and thus would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0579&hyph;0088.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been prepared for this rule. The assessment provides a basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that the treatment of restricted pine products, under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions specified in this rule, will not present a risk of introducing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disseminating plant pests and will not have a significant impact on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has determined that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), (2) Regulations of the Council on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact are available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

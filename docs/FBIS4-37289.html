			<p>BFN     [Text] Having received the blessing of senior government  elements, Knesset House Committee Chairman Yehoshu'a Matza has  submitted a bill prohibiting the existence of Palestinian  institutions and societies in East Jerusalem in violation of the  relevant basic law. The new bill says that Palestinian  institutions inherently reject the existence of the State of  Israel.    Knesset Member Matza told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that  the officials with whom he coordinated his bill were frustrated  by the fact that a similar bill initiated by the prime minister  had fallen through.</p>

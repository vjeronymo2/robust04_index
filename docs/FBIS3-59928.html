The Yalta Town Council takes upon itself an  obligation not to allow the installation, deployment,  maintenance, or storage of nuclear weapons or other radioactive  materials on its territory. The transit or transportation of  nuclear components, including the arrival of ships with nuclear  weapons on board to the port, is forbidden. It was decided to  establish efficient control over adherence to the nuclear-free  status. The statement was sent to Ukraine's Supreme Council, to  the Crimean Supreme Council, and to the committee of the  International Secretariat "The Movement of Local Authorities in  Nuclear-Free Zones" (Manchester, Great Britain). The deputies  turned to local organs of power of the Black Sea Region with a  proposal to support their statement.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE JUGGERNAUT ROLLS ON AT GRAND AVE. BAR  </P> <P> The Capp-Pierce Juggernaut, launching a series of Monday night big band at the  Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, drew a heavy and happy crowd, defying  competition from the televised NCAA men's basketball finals.  </P> <P> From the moment pianist Nat Pierce eased into a medium tempo blues in a Basie  groove, with the mood accentuated by the rhythm guitar pulse of John Pisano,  the Juggernaut took off like the inexorable force for which it is named.  </P> <P> Almost every number was a judicious mixture of tightly-meshed ensembles, biting  brass passages and occasional section interludes, such as the five-sax soli  passage on "In A Mellotone," a tune that revealed every horn player in the band  as a soloist of the first rank.  </P> <P> The two tenor saxes, doing battle on Neal Hefti's "Whirly Bird," offered a  study in contrast: Bob Shepard a little more hollow in sound than Rickey  Woodard, but both in full improvisatory command. There were suitable solo  openings for all three trombonists -- Slide Hyde, in an elegant examination of  "A Time for Love," Buster Cooper in his bumble bee impression, and Thurman  Green.  </P> <P> Other bright moments were offered by Bill Berry's muted cornet on "Open All  Night" and, of course, the potently supportive drumming of Frank Capp  throughout the evening.  </P> <P> A maverick chart was Bob Florence's "Slime House," a bristling work that was  entirely ensemble, sans solos -- proof, as if it were needed, that  extemporization is not necessarily the lifeblood of jazz.  </P> <P> Although it would be wishful thinking to claim that big bands are back, it is  true that occasional local one-nighters such as this are capable of attracting  loyalists to the swinging sounds of a 16-member powerhouse. Next Monday: the  Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

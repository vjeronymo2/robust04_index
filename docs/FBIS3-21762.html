The concern was expressed by Mr. Robert  Ayalingo and Mr. F.K. Amuzu of CEPS [Customs, Excise and  Preventive Service] at a seminar organized by the International  Council on Alcohol and Addictions on drug smuggling by  Ghanaians. George Lawson's report is read to you. [read by  announcer]    There is increasing anxiety by the international community  over the drug menace which is causing human destruction,  threatening the security and future of many nations. Mr. Robert  Ayalingo pointed out that the greater percentage of violent  crimes such as murder and armed robbery are committed by people  under the influence of drugs.    Mr. Ayalingo noted with regret that Ghana has been  identified  as one of the transit points for cocaine and heroin arriving in  Europe and North America. Mr. Ayalingo said from 1990 to 1992  the police seized 13.76 kg of cocaine and 24.87 kg of heroin.  According to him, figures of 1993 are not available because the  exhibits are yet to be submitted to the Ghana Standards Board.    Mr. Ayalingo disclosed that another drug called crack has  recently surfaced. He said it is an addictive form of cocaine  prepared by combining cocaine with sodium bicarbonate, which is  commonly called baking powder. He pointed out that it is cheap  but very dangerous.    The assistant training officer of CEPS, Mr. F.K. Amusu, said  because Ghana is being used as a transit point in the  international narcotic trade, local consumption of heroin and  cocaine is rising sharply. He said CEPS with its limited  resources has been able to make a number of arrests and will  continue to fight against illicit drug trade.    Miss Jessica Vapneg, a U.S. lawyer attached to the Faculty  of  Law, University of Ghana, Legon, said the couriers from Africa  account for 20 to 30 percent of heroin and cocaine smuggled into  the United States. Miss Vapneg said from 1989 to 1992, 164  Ghanaians were arrested in the United States.    The vice chairman of the International Council on Alcohol  and  Addiction in Ghana, Mr. Noah Akolatse, appealed to NGO's  [nongovernmental organizations], communities, and individuals to  assist the group in their fight against drug abuse.</p>

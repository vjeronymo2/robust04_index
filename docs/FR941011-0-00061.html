			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 's of less than 0.040 represent periods of zero or abnormally low production. These low-operating levels occurred more frequently than normal during the period in which the data in Table 2 were generated because of the depressed operating level of the industry at that time. Operation at R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 's below 0.040 results in widely varying VOC emissions in terms of kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Under these low-operating conditions, emissions expressed in units of the standard range from 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids to over 19 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Since operation with R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 's below 0.040 result in widely varying emissions even when EDP prime coat systems are operated and maintained properly, it is infeasible to establish a standard for these low-operating levels that distinguishes between proper and improper operation regarding emissions of VOC. In addition, since the number of vehicles produced during 4-week periods with R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 's less than 0.040 is small, the total VOC emissions from the EDP tank during such periods of operation are only a fraction of the emissions emitted when the EDP tank is operating properly at full production. Consequently, the revised standard includes no emission limit for operation at R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 's of 0.040 or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The emission limits discussed above, therefore, were selected for the final revised standard. If there is little or no production, almost no solids would be added to the EDP system, the R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would always be below 0.040, and the owner would not have to comply with an emission limit. Prime coat systems other than EDP would be required to comply with a single numerical emission limit of 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the revised prime coat emission limit be based on the performance of the single EDP system with the best observed performance. As mentioned earlier, however, the statistical analysis performed on 37 EDP prime coating systems showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the observed performance of any of the EDP systems. Consequently, all of the data on all of the EDP systems were used to develop the final revised emission limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the units of the prime coat standard be changed from kilograms of VOC per liter of applied coating solids to kilograms of VOC per liter of coating minus water. The commenter indicated that this change would make the prime coat standard units consistent with most State emission limits for existing facilities. Such a change would have the effect of deleting the requirement that a transfer efficiency be used in determining compliance with the emission limit. For an EDP system, the system upon which the standard is based, the transfer efficiency that is allowed to be used for determining compliance is 100 percent. Therefore, for an EDP system, such a change would have little effect on the allowable or actual emissions. However, if prime coat application systems other than EDP which have transfer efficiencies of less than 100 percent are used, then the suggested changes in the units of the standard could result in allowing increased actual VOC emissions while still apparently meeting the emission limit. Since there is a possibility that systems other than EDP will be used in the future and a format of kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids is most consistent with the use of the solids turnover ratio, the units of the standard were not changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator certifies that a regulatory flexibility analysis under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), is not required for this rulemaking because the rulemaking would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rulemaking would not impose any new requirements; therefore, no additional costs would be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal mandates, the president's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

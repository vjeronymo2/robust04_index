			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILDCATS ROLL OVER TROJANS  </P> <P> USC held Sean Elliott to only 11 points, so Anthony Cook took over for  second-ranked Arizona.  </P> <P> Cook, a 6-foot-9 senior from Van Nuys, scored a career-high 31 points as the  Wildcats routed the Trojans, 93-70, in a Pacific 10 Conference game, sending  USC to its 13th consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> "I knew one of these years I would break the 30-point mark," Cook said.  "Breaking 30, that's big. It's so hard to get there."  </P> <P> Arizona, 19-3 overall and 13-1 in the Pacific-10 Conference, holds a two-game  lead over Stanford.  </P> <P> "At halftime we talked about spreading our offense around to get the ball to  Cook, especially with Elliott having such a hard time," Arizona Coach Lute  Olson said.  </P> <P> "In Sean's case, he was forcing some things. He made some judgment errors.  Sometimes he needed to give it up, cut and move. I am sure he'll come out  Saturday (against UCLA) ready to play.  </P> <P> "They were double- and triple-teaming (Elliott), and the only way to beat that  is to move the ball around."  </P> <P> His strategy worked, as Cook, who scored 15 points in the first half, added  another 10 in the first 7:54 of the second half as the Wildcats took command,  58-40.  </P> <P> Cook, who had three dunks during the run, hit 12 of 14 shots and also had 12  rebounds. He could have had more but was only 7 for 12 on free throws.  </P> <P> "We did a horrible job of defending Cook, but we probably helped him a lot in  the (NBA) draft," USC Coach George Raveling said.  </P> <P> Raveling said the Trojans (7-17, 0-12) wanted to make Elliott work for his  shots and wear him down.  </P> <P> "I guess we did a decent job on him, but it was academic," he said.  </P> <P> The Wildcats led by 22 points with 9:05 left, and the closest USC came the rest  of the way was 75-60 with 5:23 left on two foul shots by Chris Moore, who  scored 21 points. Ronnie Coleman added 19 for the Trojans.  </P> <P> Ken Lofton had 10 points for Arizona.  </P></p>

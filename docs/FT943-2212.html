			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional items check MAI increase to 9.5% MAI, the financial services and television group, reported a 9.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 80.2m to Pounds 87.9m for the year to June 30. This year's figure reflects an exceptional gain of Pounds 8m on the disposal of fixed assets and a Pounds 16.8m loss on disposal of a discontinued operation. Earnings per share rose to 16.6p (15.8p). The results were boosted by MAI's newest business - television - with Meridian Broadcasting making a Pounds 5m operational profit ahead of schedule and Anglia Television contributing Pounds 5m since its acquisition in March. The company says broadcasting will now become 'a major contributor' to group profits and a strong base for future growth. The exceptional items that helped depress MAI's share price yesterday involved a loss of Pounds 16.8m from the closure of Safeguard Insurance Services, which had ' performed poorly in difficult markets over the past two years'. The net loss included goodwill of Pounds 16.2m written off to reserves in prior years. There was also an Pounds 8m profit from the sale of an investment in Havas SA. Before the deduction of the net exceptional loss profit before tax was Pounds 96.7m and earnings per share were 18.4p. The share price fell 23p yesterday to close at 255.5p. MAI's turnover increased 34 per cent to Pounds 709.7m (Pounds 527.7m). The final dividend is 5.8p (4.9p), making a total of 7.8p (6.9p). Sir James McKinnon, chairman, said the combination of consistent investment, constant product improvement and innovation, close control of costs and favourable markets helped the businesses achieve good profit growth. MAI's money and securities businesses achieved an overall profit of Pounds 61.2m, an increase of 9 per cent. MAI said that volumes in the securities broking markets closed after the interest rate increase in the US in February although money broking volumes rose as the year progressed. The company has recently got a new licence in Tokyo for brokering Japanese government bonds. ' A lot of new markets are emerging,' Lord Hollick, the MAI chief executive said yesterday. Growth in car sales and a fall in bad debt lifted the profits of Wagon Finance, the motor credit company to Pounds 11.4m a rise of 24 per cent. MAI's information division, which provides marketing and financial information, performed strongly and profits rose 35 per cent to Pounds 10.8m. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of between Pounds 115m and Pounds 116m for the current year.</p>

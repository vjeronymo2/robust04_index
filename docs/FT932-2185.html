			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Cookery: The cucumber's cousin SWEET PEPPERS and aubergines still seem a mite too foreign to figure much on the average British menu. Yet courgettes, which became available here at about the same time, enjoy ready acceptance in kitchens up and down the land. I suppose this is partly because courgettes are cousins of the vegetable marrow, that whopping favourite of the village fete. Courgettes are small and slender - or should be. Commercial growers sometimes let them swell to torpedo size. The bigger the yield the bigger the profit perhaps, but if courgettes are allowed to grow on, much of their charm is lost: texture coarsens and flavour is dissipated. On the other hand there is such a thing as courgettes which are too small. Imported dwarf varieties - and even home-grown picked when tiny - strike me as tasteless. The optimum size is about three to four inches. Here are three quick, simple ways to cook such paragons. COURGETTE SPLITS The idea of plunging courgettes into boiling water is anathema to me but steaming is excellent as it avoids waterlogging and shows off the delicacy of the vegetable particularly well. Few recipes are simpler than this, which is, so to speak, the vegetable equivalent of Devonshire splits - courgettes, butter and herbs being substituted for finger-shaped buns, cream and jam. Allow two or three courgettes per person. Wipe them clean and leave them whole. Lay them in a roomy steamer basket and cook over fast-boiling water for 4-5 minutes or until done to your liking. Then cut the courgettes lengthways in half but not quite through. Pat them with a clean cloth inside and out to blot up any moisture. Lay them in a warmed dish, sprinkle with sea salt and insert into the splits slivers of butter and a scattering of torn basil leaves. Although good enough to eat as a dish in its own right with warm bread to mop up the fragrant juices, courgettes cooked this way go especially well with poached and grilled poultry and fish. PANCAKED ZUCCHINI Pancakes baked in the oven are infinitely easier on the cook than those that are tossed, and I recommend these with wine as a pre-theatre bonne bouche or with a salad, cheese and fruit as a late-night supper. Enough for two to four, depending on greed. Make a smooth batter, by hand or in a food processor, using 2 oz flour,  1/2 to  3/4 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 2 lightly beaten eggs and 4 fl oz semi-skimmed milk. Season with coarsely ground black pepper and a sliver of garlic crushed with salt. Put 2 x 7 inch flan tins in the oven and heat to 450'F (230'C) gas mark 8. When the oven and the tins are very hot, drizzle the tins with a little olive oil and return them to the oven for a minute or so. Quickly slice  1/2 lb small courgettes and stir them into the batter. Divide the mixture between the sizzling hot tins, tilting the tins to cover the bases evenly. Drizzle a little more oil over the top of each pancake and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 425'F (220'C) gas mark 7, and bake for 10 minutes more, by which time the pancakes will have risen in frazzled waves round the edges of the tins and be blotched with gold. Loosen carefully and cut into wedges for serving hot or warm. Note: put the tins to soak in the sink as soon as possible after cooking. Stuck-on batter is a beast to wash up. CHICKEN WITH COURGETTE, TOMATO AND TARRAGON Chicken, courgette, tomato and tarragon are a lovely light summery combination and this makes a pretty dish piled into a ring of basmati rice. To serve 3-4 people you will need 1 lb each of courgettes and tomatoes and 3/4 lb skinned and boned chicken breast meat. Cut the courgettes into thick matchsticks. Peel, core and seed the tomatoes and cut the flesh into strips. (Save the tomato pulp and seed to whizz and sieve for salad dressings.) Cut the chicken meat into quills. Pour a tablespoon or so of olive oil over the chicken, add a good grinding of black pepper and mix well to season and to anoint every piece. To cook, first fry the courgettes briefly in a smidgeon of olive oil in a large saute pan or wok. Remove and keep warm. Then stir-fry the chicken and let it rest with the courgettes. Finally add a little more oil to the pan and fry the tomatoes quickly till hot. Turn off the heat but leave the pan where it is. Scatter the tomatoes with a few blades of chopped fresh tarragon. Return the chicken and courgettes to the pan. Toss to mix, adding extra tarragon and sea salt to taste. Pile the aromatic mixture into a ring of rice and serve straight away.</p>

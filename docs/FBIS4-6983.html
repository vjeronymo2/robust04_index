			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Prosecutors announced  Monday [25 April] the end of 13 months of investigations into a  series of bribery scandals involving politicians and major  construction firms.    "We see no other cases to investigate except those in which  we have indicted suspects so far," said Tatsuhiro Ishikawa,  deputy chief prosecutor of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors  Office which has probed the scandals.    Following the investigations, the prosecutors indicted 32  people, including a Diet legislator, two governors, two mayors  and officials of eight major construction companies, and a large  paper manufacturer.    There was speculation that several Diet members were likely  to be charged, but former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura  was the only Diet member to be indicted.    Nakamura, 45, a House of Representatives member, was charged  April 1 with accepting a 10 million yen bribe in January 1992  from leading contractor Kajima Corp. He left the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) shortly before he was arrested.    Nakamura is still under detention at the Tokyo detention  house.    The prosecutors have decided not to charge a 63-year-old  former executive of Mitsui Construction Co. who allegedly  embezzled 10 million yen disbursed from the company's coffers to  be donated to former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama, 68,  a lower house member, Ishikawa said.    Ishikawa told a press conference that investigators dropped  the case because the executive has paid back the money to Mitsui  Construction and because the company does not demand any  punishment.    Some newspapers have reported that Mitsui Construction, in  the spring of 1991, gave 10 million yen to the Kajiyama camp to  win a public works contract.    Prosecutors probed whether Kajiyama violated the law, but  the  executive told investigators about the alleged embezzlement,  which means the LDP lawmaker did not receive the money.    Former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hideo Watanabe,  59, a former LDP lower house member, allegedly received a total  of 40 million yen in secret donations from Kajima Corp. from  1988 through 1991 as a reward for helping the company get a 43  billion yen contract.    Prosecutors suspected Watanabe violated the Political Funds  Control Law in receiving 10 million yen out of the 40 million  yen, but it was found legal because Kajima donated the money  through a fund-raising organization.    Prosecutors now only plan supplementary investigations into  the Nakamura case, including questioning of his secretaries and  former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, Ishikawa said.    Kanemaru, 79, is currently on trial for income tax evasion.  Evidence seized during investigations into the Kanemaru case in  March last year led to probes into the series of bribery  scandals.    Aside from Nakamura, politicians charged during the probes  are former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, 76, former Miyagi Gov.  Shuntaro Honma, 54, former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii, 68, and  Masahiro Oyama, 49, former mayor of the town of Sanwa, Ibaraki  Prefecture.    Prosecutors also indicted officials and executives of eight  major construction companies -- Hazama Corp., Kajima Corp.,  Mitsui Construction Co., Nishimatsu Construction Co., Obayashi  Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Corp. and Tobishima Corp. -- and  Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co., a major paper manufacturer.    Of the 32 people indicted, the guilt of former town Mayor  Oyama and three other people -- one of his aides and two  construction firm officials -- has already been established.    In a Feb. 15 decision, the Tokyo District Court gave Oyama a  two and a half year suspended prison sentence. He was also  ordered to pay 14 million yen to the state coffers -- the amount  he received in bribe money.</p>

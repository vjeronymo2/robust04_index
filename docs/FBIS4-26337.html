			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chen Yaobang, Chinese  vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, revealed here  Sunday [19 June] that development of the five provinces in  central China would be accelerated.    Addressing the closing session of a symposium on the  strategy  for the development of the provinces and cities in central  China, Chen pointed out that the five provinces in central  China, namely Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Henan, occupy a  decisive position in the country's national economic development.    He said that the area produces 27.2 percent of the country's  grain, 46 percent of the country's cotton and 35 percent of the  country's oil-bearing crops. It is also the country's important  base of power and raw materials. The area is a hub of  communications in the country and is inhabited by one fourth of  the country's population.    In 1992, Chen stressed, the area's gross product accounted  for merely 18.4 percent of the gross national product, and its  foreign trade volume and overseas funds used were all less than  five percent of the national total. Therefore, he said, it is  urgent to speed up the development of the area.    He disclosed that the central government had started to draw  up a program on the economic development in the five provinces  so as to accelerate the economic development of the whole  central and western parts of the country.</p>

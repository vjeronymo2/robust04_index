The reform and opening drive has made Guangdong an economic  giant in the country. But its cultural development has long  lagged behind, with pop music and vulgar video shows flooding  this southern province.    To establish a better image, Guangdong has decided to  elevate  the fine arts, as stated by Xie Fei, governor of Guangdong  Province.    Since 1991, the provincial government has stipulated that  three percent of revenues from ballrooms, karaoke clubs and pop  music concerts be collected as special funds for the creating  and performing of serious and folk arts.    Subsidies are provided to performing troupes of serious  music, folk song and dance, theater and local opera.    Recently, Guangdong has earmarked huge sums to host varied  art festivals, build performing and exhibition halls and improve  all kinds of arts facilities.    Frequent large-scale art festivals, such as the  international  dance festival, the international Guangdong opera festival, and  the Guangdong art festival, have effectively promoted the fine  arts and enlarged cultural exchanges with foreign counterparts.    The foundation of the Guangzhou music hall has been laid,  with an estimated investment of 50 million yuan. Construction  of the Guangdong museum, art gallery, and international  Guangdong opera center is also speeding up.    A symphony fund and provincial ballet ensemble will be set  up  soon.    The common prosperity of both pop and serious, foreign, and  folk artistic forms has greatly enriched the life of people in  Guangdong and further cultivated and improved their tastes in  serious arts.</p>

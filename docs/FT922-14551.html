			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Fears about sterling lead to ERM deal on escudo FEARS of a run on sterling ahead of Thursday's UK general election were behind an agreement reached this weekend and linked to today's entry by the Portuguese escudo into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). At a meeting in Brussels, Britain argued successfully that the central rate for the escudo should be higher than originally proposed. This was on the basis that a high rate would limit the possibilities of a rapid rise in value of the Portuguese unit that could put pressure on the pound. The escudo's ERM entry comes at the start of tense week for the sterling as the foreign exchange markets contemplate a change in the UK government. There have been fears that investors will switch large volumes of money out of sterling because of nervousness about a Labour administration or a hung parliament. Officials from the 12 European Community nations took eight hours on Saturday to agree a central rate for the escudo of 178.735 to the European currency unit, and 86.94 against the D-Mark. Lisbon had wanted a lower rate, of 180 escudos to the Ecu and 87.6 to the D-Mark. The agreement was designed to meet the concerns of Britain and other EC nations that a lower rate could mean the escudo rises rapidly to to the top of its alloted ERM band. Even though the escudo is relatively lightly traded, such a development could put pressure on other currencies in the system - particularly the pound, which is the weakest ERM member. Entry into the ERM will mean all 12 EC nations except Greece have their currencies pegged to each other around set limits tied to the D-Mark. The system is designed to damp inflation by restricting currency depreciation. 'A strong escudo certainly helps in the fight against inflation and interest rates should fall less hesitantly than they have until now,' Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portuguese finance minister, said. Participants in Saturday's meeting said Portugal's suggested rate had been altered for the overall stability of the ERM grid.</p>

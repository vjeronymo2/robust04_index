			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA ENDS CONTRA TRUCE  </P> <P> According to The Times' editorial, Ortega has blown it again by announcing that  his government will not renew a cease-fire with the Contras. The Times  acknowledges that the Contras have violated the accord and killed many people  (736 during the "cease-fire" according to the Nicaraguan government), but The  Times asserts that the timing of Ortega's announcement at the Costa Rican  summit puts the onus for the renewed fighting on him.  </P> <P> If 763 American citizens were killed during a truce period, few Americans would  challenge the moral legitimacy, indeed the necessity, of driving the killers  out, but the dead (and the more numerous wounded) are merely Nicaraguans and  their deaths should not be allowed to mar a public relations junket.  </P> <P> WILLIAM H.

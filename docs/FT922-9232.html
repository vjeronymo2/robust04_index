			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Wellington offers railways for sale THE New Zealand government, struggling with high external debt, yesterday signalled that four state-owned enterprises, including the railways and the former ministry of works, will be sold by the middle of next year. They have a collective value of around USDollars 600m (Pounds 339m). State owned enterprises minister Mr Maurice McTigue said the government was looking into New Zealand Rail, the Works Corporation, Landcorp and the Government Computer Service to see whether privatisation was the best option. Mr McTigue stopped short of saying the sales were inevitable. But he said it was clearly the intention of the government to sell, providing there were no impediments. There are difficulties with a big Maori land claim under the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, and privacy issues surrounding the computer company which manages the national register of all police, court and traffic offences. Parliament may need to pass urgent privacy legislation to permit a sale. Mr McTigue refused to give a breakdown of how much each of the businesses were expected to fetch. He said the sales would be used to retire external debt. Decisions to sell would be based on the likelihood of greater efficiency and financial gain for the businesses and a reduction of financial risk to the government and the taxpayer. He said that New Zealand Rail, which owns the ferries which link the North and South Islands, and the national network of tracks, trains and bridges, but not the land over which the trains run, is committed to a Dollars NZ350m (Pounds 106m) modernisation programme over the next three years. Mr McTigue said the government did not wish to pay for this. The other companies earmarked for sale include Workscorp, which operates large engineering, roading and construction companies, and Landcorp which owns 180 farms. The sale of the farms would be handled in such a way as not to depress the value of other farm properties, the minister said.</p>

Hideo Den, a  former journalist who was expelled from the United Social  Democratic Party (USDP), joined with Masao Kunihiro, formerly of  the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] to establish  it, they said.    The group, in the House of Councillors, is called Goken  Liberal No Kai (Liberal Group for the Protection of the  Constitution).    Both Den and Kunihiro had defied orders by their former  parties -- members of the ruling coalition -- and voted against  a package of political reform legislation that cleared the Diet  on January 29.    The two, who now sit in the upper house as independents,  said  the reforms for the House of Representatives, featuring an  electoral system of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200  proportional representation seats, will deny voters the chance  to support those with minority views.    Besides the new group, the lineup in the upper house  includes  95 members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, 71 from  the SDPJ, 37 from ruling coalition Shin-Ryokufu-Kai, formed in  early February, 24 from Komeito, 11 from the opposition Japanese  Communist Party (JCP), five from Niin Club and seven  independents.</p>

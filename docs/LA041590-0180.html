			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DENIAL OF EXEMPTION FOR CHEERLEADER WHO GOT 'F'  </P> <P> Re "One 'F' Leaves Girl Nothing to Cheer About" (April 4):  </P> <P> I have been the pepster adviser and a teacher at Valencia High School for six  years. At Valencia, the 2.0 GPA is a minimum standard, and any adviser or coach  may elect to impose additional conditions as long as this fact is communicated  to parents and students.  </P> <P> In our pepster program, the students must maintain a semester GPA of 2.5 and no  "F"s or "U"s to remain eligible or to try out for the squad. These higher  standards are set because the pepster girls are in a position of leadership and  responsibility. In addition, they may have to occasionally miss an academic  class for their pepster activities and need to be above-average students to  compensate for these absences. Melissa Fontes and her family are losing sight  of two important points: 1) She must accept responsibility for her actions. She  received the "F," not the pepster program. 2) The first priority of any student  should be his or her academic grade. As a parent, I would be more concerned  about my daughter's "F"than the fact that she was not eligible for the  cheerleading squad.  </P> <P> JONNA HAYDEN ROBINSON  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Foreign exchange tax reform to proceed Radical plans for reforming the taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses will go ahead, the government has announced. Laws designed to allow UK businesses to operate on a similar basis to international competitors will come into force on March 23. The government, which first published draft proposals in 1989, considers that the new rules will help preserve London's status as a financial centre. Pressure for reform has existed for nearly 20 years. The taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses has long been a complex area because of the ending of fixed exchange rates. The new system will tax foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, such as cash and bank deposits, and liabilities when they accrue  - in line with commercial accounting rules. The changes will mainly affect companies that take out finance in foreign currencies and those with assets held in currencies subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations. The rules will permit companies to offset losses on exchange fluctuations against tax. Previously companies have been taxed on exchange gains without being allowed to take any corresponding allowances for losses. Mr Jim Marshall, head of international taxation at accountants KPMG, said there was broad support for the plans. While 'fundamental problems' did exist, he hoped the dialogue with the Inland Revenue would continue.</p>

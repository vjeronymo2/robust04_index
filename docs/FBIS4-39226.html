			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich described the  refusal of the National Bank to grant a credit for the  government to buy animal food as treason.    He told a rally of agriculture workers in the Nesvizh  District, Minsk Region, that the bank was politically rather  than economically motivated. Still, he said that the government  would manage to help the country's agriculture. IF Note:  Stanislav Bogdankevich, National Bank of Belarus chairman,  disagreed with the recent agreement on the merger of the Russian  and Belarusian monetary system, which, he said, curbed the  bank's rights and threatened its independent existence. Nor  does Bogdankevich support the Kebich government policy of  granting large credits to the agriculture.    In Kebich's words, the government used three quarters of all  centralized credits to support the agriculture in 1994. The  budget allocation to the agriculture amounted to 3380 billion  rubles, or over a quarter of all the expenditure. Over one  trillion rubles were invested in the sowing campaign which was  therefore a success.    Kebich also said that the government intended to compensate  the deposits in saving banks. If he is elected president, the  deposits which had been made worthless by inflation will be  fully restored to the working people, he said. He added that  his government had made a decision to compensate 60 percent of  the deposits' worth.    Kebich believed that the village had to run the reform  itself  by combining various kinds of ownership. As president he would  keep productive farms alive and enable the peasants to dispose  of their products as best as they could, once the taxes were  paid and the state contracts honored.    In his view, only the land and the property had to be taxed  in agriculture.    Experts believe that these promises and proposals are part  of  his electoral campaign.    In an exclusive INTERFAX interview he had earlier called for  having two state languages in his country, Belarussian and  Russian. He thought that this issue had to be decided in a  referendum. IF Note: Under the Belarussian Constitution  Belarussian is the state language, Russian being a tool of  inter-ethnic communication.    Kebich wanted the term "ethnic minorities" out of the  official language. He said that the Belarussian people did not  have to be divided into minorities and majorities.    He said that the country had been stable because its leader  had been nipping all manifestations of nationalism in the bud.    Observers believe that equality of the Russian and  Belarussian languages is as important in Kebich's program as  monetary union with Russia and eventual integration of Belarus,  Russia, and Ukraine.</p>

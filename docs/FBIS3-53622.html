			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, Jan. 14, IRNA -- The new memorandum of  understanding, signed in Dublin this week, offers wide-ranging  possibilities in numerous areas of expanding and diversifying  economic cooperation between Ireland and the Islamic Republic of  Iran.    According to the memorandum, mutual benefits have been  identified in such fields as heavy and light industry, mining,  agriculture, rural and urban planning, petroleum and oil  products, pharmaceuticals, medicine, telecommunications and  education.    Proposed are a whole set of possible initiatives through  mutual investments, joint ventures, development projects,  utilizing the capabilities of expertise, management skills,  professional training and courses, holding seminars, conferences  and exhibitions.    During the holding of the second joint commission Wednesday  and Thursday, Iranian and Irish officials expressed their  satisfation with the ever-growing and deepending trend of  relations that was attributed to the atmosphere of understanding  developed between the two countries.    To take advantage of the opportunities, both sides agreed to  increase the exchange of information and contacts to acquaint  themselves with each other's markets and expert industries and  to maximize the potential offered.    Proposals went as far as encouraging economic and trade  enterprises to embark on joint activities for exports to third  markets, such as to the newly-independent republics of Europe  and Central Asia.    Ireland itself has a population of only 3.5 million, but it  has a projected GDP growth of 3 percent this year, higher than  most countries in the European Union, of which it is a member.    The major development in economic relations last year was in  the reopening of Iran's beef market to Irish exporters, which  has the potential of being the second largest after Britain.    The move has the potential of creating a trade imbalance in  Dublin's favor, but both sides recognized the need to correct  this to expand the volume of business between the two countries.    To this end, Irish officials welcomed the desire for Iranian  enterprises to have an active presence in the Irish market and  committed to help arrange `Iran weeks' and exclusive trade fairs  to promote exports to Ireland.    Dublin further agreed to consider favorably oil imports from  Iran to meet its considerable needs, while the Iranian side  expressed its readiness for cooperation in refining and jont  investment for the construction of refineries.</p>

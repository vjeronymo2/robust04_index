			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 6, IRNA -- Russian authorities have  banned Moscow-based weekly AL-QUDS for alleged violation of  Russian laws and printing of anti-Zionist articles. Officials  cite anti-Jewish propaganda and anti-government stance of the  weekly as reasons for its ban.    The weekly was viewed by political parties and people as a  prestigious publication which criticized the government,  revealed plots of Zionism and imperialism and published  documents relating to the last year's government troop attack on  parliament.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report from the battlefield"] </F>   [Text] The last military operation of the puppets and the  two-headed government at Anlung Veng area has been completely  defeated.    1. On 31 January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK] and the local people routed the military operation of the  communist Vietnam's puppets and the two-headed government at  Anlung Veng area.    2. During five days of fighting from 27 to 31 January,  puppet military top commanders Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long  Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo Pisit mobilized all their remaining  forces on the front with 10 tanks, five military trucks, and 600  troops in their last all-out attempt on Anlung Veng. Their  forces were facing a big dilemma as they could neither withdraw  back to Samraong or move forward. They knew that if they tried  to advance, they would be annihilated. Therefore, they decided  to open their life line from Prey Phdau, (Pradev), (Thvoeuk),  Rumchek, and Siem Reap even though it meant crossing mine fileds.    3. However, the NADK and local people were able to intercept  them and cut them into several separate units. Particularly on  31 January, we destroyed five tanks; the other five tried to  escape but we were able to destroy two of them and capture  three. Of the 600 troops, [words indistinct] have been  paralyzed by malaria and other diseases, 115 have deserted and  rejoined Siem Reap where they have made a lot of noise about  their defeat. In addition, we have been able to capture 60 of  their remaining 250 puppet soldiers.    4. Prum Samen himself was wounded for the second time (?east  of) Prey Phdau when our NADK launched a special attack against  his mobile headquarters located near the site of their multiple  rocket launchers and heavy artilleries. Once wounded, Prum  Samen [words indistinct].    5. The communist Vietnamese, the entente, and the two-headed  government have met with severe defeat [words indistinct].  However, the (?50) percent of their total forces and 90 percent  of their commanders in Cambodia have been seriously affected by  the fighting during the whole month of January.    If they persist in continuing the war in opposing the  five-point national reconciliation plan of his majesty the king,  the entire Cambodian nation and people, both in the countryside  and in Phnom Penh, will inflict more enormous defeats on them  and will certainly achieve the five-point national  reconciliation.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER OBJECTS TO DEFAULT STORY  </P> <P> While we in the City of Compton usually appreciate the coverage we receive from  the Los Angeles Times, I must take strong exception to last Thursday's story  ("Compton Transit Center Builder Declared in Default," March 30) on our new  Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center.  </P> <P> Most importantly the tone of the story made it seem as if city officials have  been at the least naive and at the worst negligent in our dealings with Dalton  Construction Co., the developer of the transit center. For your information,  Dalton is a local minority developer with more than a 30-year history of  developing projects. He has recently completed two major projects for the city,  namely, the combined state-of-the-art Fire Station No. 3 and James H. Shern  Training Academy, and the Dollarhide Senior Center. He has also completed two  housing projects within the city.  </P> <P> In other words, Dalton has a proven track record. That, following careful  consideration, we chose to issue a notice of default to Dalton only means that  he is tardy in completion of the transit center and should take all possible  measures to get back on track. We took this measure to protect ourselves, a  normal procedure in this business. Part of the transit center is already open,  having been rented by the U.S. Census Bureau which, incidentally, will soon be  providing more than 700 jobs for local residents.  </P> <P> Your story also reported that I would not respond to questions about whether  the CRA had "properly monitored Dalton's progress." In fact, I said that we had  an on-site construction manager as well as a project architect from the firm of  Edward C. Barker &amp; Associates who, from the beginning of construction,  monitored project activity on a daily and twice-weekly basis respectively.  </P> <P> In addition, you should be aware that it is our practice to keep City Council  members fully apprised of development activity on an ongoing basis.  </P> <P> Although Compton is not without problems, there are a number of positive  activities going on here. Out of 16 major projects under way in Compton, we  have successfully completed 12 of them.  </P> <P> Moreover, your newspaper did not devote any space to the several hundred  employees, community residents and young people who volunteered their time on  March 11 to paint out almost all of the graffiti in Compton. We believe that  such inspirational activities are the rule here, rather than the exception, and  certainly worthy of your coverage.  </P> <P> JAMES C. GOINS  </P> <P> Compton city manager  </P></p>

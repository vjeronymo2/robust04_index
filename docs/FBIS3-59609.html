Interturbine purchased  this new procedure from Ukraine.    The project could yield some 35 jobs in the short term. Over  the next few years, 20 million guilders will be invested in the  plant in an attempt to commercialize the ceramic-coating  process. Interturbine already has three plants in Lomm which  repair turbines and produce engine parts.    The former Soviet Union Armed Forces had been applying the  ceramic coating on the engines of MiG fighter aircraft for 15  years already. The coating protects engine parts against heat  and corrosion. The United States has for years been trying to  learn this secret formula to which the MiG's, among other  things, owe their good reputation. Until now, the West has been  using a metal coating for turbines.    Airplane parts can be used for 4,000 hours longer after they  have been treated. Turbines for use on the ground can be used  for 15,000 hours longer, according to Interturbine.</p>

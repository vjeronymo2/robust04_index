			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: Interest cuts overlooked Sir, The soundings you take from the Treasury's advisory panel on the wisdom of further interest rate cuts (January 22) and the wider discussion of the issue, perhaps overlook one significant point. Many mortgage holders have policies on which interest payments are adjusted annually. Only now are the 1992 interest rate cuts working through. The resulting substantial changes in monthly outgoings can be expected to give a big boost to consumer confidence and spending. Combined with the need to eschew additional inflationary pressure from sterling depreciation, this would seem to justify a cautious approach to further rate cuts.

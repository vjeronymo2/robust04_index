			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Health Service waiting list grows The number of people waiting for National Health Service treatment has risen by more than 53,000 since the first quarter of last year, figures released yesterday show. Provisional figures for the quarter to the end of June also showed 64,178 were waiting between one and two years, up 0.1 per cent from the previous three-month period. Those waiting two years and more - many for fertility treatment - rose 7.2 per cent to 447 in the same period. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, hailed the figures as a success and said the total of 64,625 people waiting for treatment for more than a year was more than 1,000 fewer than in the first quarter of last year. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, condemned the rise and said the true total on the waiting list - including those waiting for a first appointment with a consultant - was more than 2.3m.</p>

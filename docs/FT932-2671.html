			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses replace Buba hopes with higher dollar BOURSES turned their attention yesterday to the higher dollar, and its beneficiaries in corporate Europe, writes Our Markets Staff. Interest rate hopes moved away from today's Bundesbank meeting, brokers Hoare Govett arguing that there is scope for core ERM countries to reduce their rates to as much as two percentage points below German rates, and for non-core countries to narrow their interest rate premiums significantly. FRANKFURT saw flat repo rates as a poor augury for today's Bundesbank meeting. It was also treated to forecasts that west Germany's economy will not begin a lasting recovery until next spring, and to a further weakening in the D-Mark/dollar rate. The DAX index pushed up again to close 5.46 higher at 1,689.56. D-Mark weakness was keeping foreign investors out of the market at the moment, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, but German investors were attracted by the prospect of higher export margins. Turnover eased from DM6.5bn to DM6.2bn. Automotive stocks, particularly suppliers like the tyremaker, Continental, and the battery manufacturer, Varta, were traded higher again with rises of DM4.20 to DM206.20 and DM4.30 to DM294.30 respectively, although Varta said again late in the day that it might have to cut its 1993 dividend. The big three chemicals produced modest rises on the export margin argument, and Commerzbank extended Tuesday's strength with a rise of DM2.20 to DM305.70, this time on rumours of foreign stakebuilding, with the rest of the banking sector flat. PARIS regained its uptrend on hopes for a further cut in domestic rates by the end of the month, irrespective of whether the Bundesbank eases today. Supported also by strength in the Matif, the dollar and French franc, the CAC-40 index put on 20.95 or 1.1 per cent to 1,918.81 in turnover up to FFr3.3bn from Tuesday's FFr1.9bn. Financials were active on the interest rate theme, with Bancaire gaining 5 per cent, up FFr25 to FFr515. Both Suez and UAP rallied after the former said that it could take a stake in UAP when it is privatised, to solve the dispute between the two over Groupe Victoire. Suez gained FFr4.40 to FFr299.80 while UAP was FFr14 firmer at FFr591. There was considerable activity in the retail sector after Docks de France, a major retail distribution group, announced the acquisition of Alsacienne de Supermarche. The shares of Docks de France closed down FFr2.50 to FFr481.00, but off the day's low of FFr451. Interest was also noted in a number of stocks which have been underperforming the market recently: Remy Cointreau, for instance, put on FFr8.00 to FFr166.50. MILAN was supported by short covering on the last day of the June account but a fall of some 20 per cent in Ferruzzi, down L118.50 to L475, weighed on sentiment, leaving the Comit index down 5.36 at 508.01. The group of creditor banks was meeting yesterday to discuss the restructuring of the group's debt. Montedison was given some encouragement by indications that it would be able to dispose of its polymer subsidiaries which, said some analysts, would help cut its debt burden by L2,000bn. The shares fixed up 4 per cent at L810 before slipping on the kerb to L750. Among the banks, BCI and Credito Italiano gained on short covering with respective gains of L249 and L165 to L4,899 and L2,530. Stet, which, together with Generali, has helped prop up the market over recent weeks, lost some ground, down L145 at L3,265. Generali was L695 higher at L35,705. AMSTERDAM was another market to be lifted by the stronger US currency. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 109.5. Philips reached a new 12 month high after the EC agreed a subsidy plan to promote high definition television. The shares put on Fl 1.20 to Fl 29.20. ZURICH returned to the upgrade on the higher dollar, interest rate hopes and good liquidity, the SMI index closing 20.0 higher at 2,294.0. MADRID seemed subdued by the prospect of tomorrow's expiry of the Ibex-35 contract, the general index closing just 0.75 higher at 260.64 with banks mixed, and gentle gains in construction and most utilities. OSLO climbed 1.4 per cent on the dollar, and lower money market rates, the all-share index rising 6.69 to 481.40 in turnover of NKr600m. COPENHAGEN put on nearly a percentage point, the KFX index closing 0.82 higher at 86.72 in turnover of DKr552m with banks in focus after a late rally. Danske Bank, boosted by falling interest rates, rose DKr5 to DKr323.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 16                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open      10.30     11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1176.43    1177.42   1177.55    1178.20 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1235.30    1235.10   1234.44    1234.37  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00      14.00     15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1178.18    1180.56   1181.58    1181.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1233.90    1236.46   1237.55    1236.97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 15    Jun 14   June 11   June 10    June 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1173.17   1181.59   1181.85   1181.45   1181.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1229.86   1234.83   1232.37   1230.25   1230.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1182.27; 200 - 1238.51 Low/day: 100 - 1176.36  200 - 1232.41.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW FORMAT ON EDITORIAL PAGES  </P> <P> It's difficult to tell one's wife that her new outfit doesn't quite suit her,  or one's mother that her home-cooked meals are too salty, or indeed to tell the  editors of The Times that their new editorial page format (introduced April 23)  sucks.  </P> <P> But I've done it, and I'm doing it.  </P> <P> There is no newspaper west of the Hudson River that has had two pages of  opinion more readable, informative and deserving of respect than yours; why  change its dress? The varying type styles heading the editorials are  confounding and demeaning, making them appear as news stories of differing  import; the movement of the editorials from the dignified and traditional left  column to a scattering across the top half of the page shocked me as much as  the publishers of "new" Bibles did when they abandoned the double columns of  the old St. James version; the maze of horizontal and vertical lines between  pieces are as unseemly as they are unnecessary.  </P> <P> You may think the changed format will gain some new readers; please consider  its offense to the old.  </P> <P> RAYMOND E. PONATH  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEA CHAIRMAN'S TALK TO COVER TOPIC OF OBSCENE ART  </P> <P> The chairman of the beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts will speak at  an open forum Saturday at the Lyceum Theatre.  </P> <P> John Frohnmayer, appointed by President Bush last year, will talk about the  controversy over reauthorizing the National Endowment for the Arts, said  Victoria Hamilton, executive director of the San Diego Commission for Arts and  Culture. The forum, which will include public questions and comment, will be  held at 3:30 p.m. in the theater at 79 Horton Plaza.  </P> <P> Hamilton said the federal arts agency provides grants to San Diego arts  organizations, the city arts commission and individual artists. Last year, San  Diego received 28 NEA grants totaling $1.1 million, said Romalyn Tilghman,  regional representative for the NEA in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The NEA has been mired in controversy since last year when it awarded grants  totaling $45,000 to two touring art exhibits: a show of photographs that  included homoerotic and sexually explicit images by the late photographer  Robert Mapplethorpe, and a show of works by award-winning artists that included  an Andres Serrano photograph of a crucifix dipped in urine.  </P> <P> The endowment's $171-million budget for 1990 was amended by conservatives in  Congress to outlaw funding of artworks the NEA determines to be obscene, and  requires grantees to take an anti-obscenity oath. In the uproar after the  restrictions, the University of Iowa Press and New York theater producer Joseph  Papp turned down $62,000 in NEA money. The New School for Social Research in  New York City has sued the endowment to try to gain a court order to strike  down on constitutional grounds the anti-obscenity oath. The provision requires  grantees to certify in writing that they will not produce obscene work.  </P> <P> This year, the NEA is faced with seeking congressional reauthorization and  approval of its 1991 budget. The agency is usually reauthorized for five years,  but, faced with a growing move among conservatives in Congress to clamp down on  what some view as government funding of obscene art, the White House is seeking  a cooling-off period. Instead of a five-year renewal, the White House asked  Congress last Wednesday to reauthorize the NEA, without any restrictions, for  one to three years while a commission reviews the agency's grant-making  procedures.  </P> <P> The endowment's authorization is set to expire Sept. 30, the end of the 1990  fiscal year. However, it is unclear whether Congress will have time to consider  the White House request and the proposed $175-million budget for 1991 before  recessing for week beginning July 2.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer, the NEA's fifth chairman, is also in San Diego to give a keynote  speech at a convention of the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies. The  service organization is a coalition of municipal and nonprofit arts  organizations, arts leaders and corporate representatives, Hamilton said. The  convention, June 15-19, is expected to draw more than 500 arts leaders from the  United States, Mexico and Canada.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer is former chairman of the Oregon Arts Commission and was most  recently a partner in a Portland law firm. He also served as chairman of the  screening committee to select art for the Oregon Capitol. His performing  background as a singer includes appearances in musical productions in New York,  Chicago, California and Oregon.  </P></p>

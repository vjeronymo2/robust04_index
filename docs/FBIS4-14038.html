			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Simon Abu-Fadil in the "AL-DIYAR's Horizons" </F> column: "Amid Optimism Over the Success of Negotiations,  Hizballah Prepares Itself by Reconsidering Its Political Line"]    [Text] Political circles close to American channels in  Lebanon are optimistic that the negotiations, which stumble once  in awhile, will eventually end the state of war between Israel  and the Arab states. What enhances these circles' optimism is  well known: That is the presence of a single world camp whose  plans will not be blocked, not even by the closest allies,  particularly Israel. The positions assumed recently by some  Israeli officials, who accept withdrawal from Golan and the  suspension of settlement building, support the beliefs of these  circles, who understand the American policy to a certain extent.    If the course of negotiations leads to such results, how  will  Hizballah deal with this reality? Will it give up its  resistance role or will it be the difficult figure in the  equation?    Political sources close to Hizballah say that the party's  leadership is well aware of what is happening in the region and  that it reads events and developments carefully and thoroughly.  Hence, the sources say, it will not let the party pay the price  or be the victim of the settlement.    Therefore, the inner political line of Hizballah leadership  has started to focus on how to cope with peace with Israel  through political and social methods, particularly since the  party believes that coping with normalization is its  responsibility. The party is thus turning its battle with  Israel from military resistance to fierce political resistance,  for which all its energies and institutions have been mobilized.  The party believes that peace with Israel is more dangerous  than war, the sources add.    The same sources affirm that Hizballah leadership is totally  aware that the regional settlement will not be halted by Iran,  which is up to its ears in foreign debts exceeding $50 billions  and which is in a political position similar to that of other  Third World states as a result of domestic and surrounding  political conditions.    Other sources note in this context that the Hizballah  leadership has launched contacts with state officials with a  view to expanding the ways to cope with the Israeli peace and  its impact on Lebanese society. The features of the approaching  stage in the region have become clear to the party's leadership.  Thus, it has started to reconsider its military structure and  to organize it and monitor it carefully to avoid any individual  fault or emotional outburst leading to a clash with the Lebanese  Army, which will not let any incident or violation occur in the  future. The Hizballah leadership understands that the  government's acknowledgement of the resistance's reality at  present can never be allowed in the next stage, when the  Lebanese Army takes charge of security for the south, both its  land and people.    These sources add that the measures the Lebanese Army  adopted  recently have put all the parties involved, particularly  Hizballah, face to face with the reality that once the army  "takes action," it will not "leave" the land it set foot on.  Moreover, the Army will not tolerate any disruption so long as  its organs are capable of "reaching" all the parties to correct  them. In this, the Army will pursue methods that safeguard the  state's interests and will avoid claiming victims among the  party that fails to understand that it does not bargain for the  land it deploys on or share it with others. Any leniency in this  is tantamount to going back to the stage in which the state  collapsed.    This reading of reality might turn the party with all its  energies toward coping with peace, the sources say. They affirm  that the party leadership is aware of fears from clashes within  the party or between it and other parties in al-Biqa' in the  same way it is aware of the impact peace will have on the region.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUCTIONING OFF SILVER SCREEN'S GOLDEN PAST  </P> <P> Christie's New York, one of the world's largest auction houses, is searching  for Hollywood movie memorabilia for a June auction.  </P> <P> Collectible's expert Eric Alberta arrived in town Wednesday to give free  appraisals of movie props, autographs, photographs, costume designs, costumes  and other personal artifacts of the stars.  </P> <P> Every 15 minutes for more than eight hours, scores of memorabilia holders filed  into Alberta's temporary office in Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive, each owner  bearing some unique piece of Hollywood history lifted from the silver screen to  be placed on the auction block.  </P> <P> "It's insane, isn't it?" said 58-year-old John Hunt, a retired Whittier museum  curator who arrived early in the morning loaded down with several Marilyn  Monroe photos and negatives, a signed Greta Garbo photo, Clark Gable's brass  dressing room tag from MGM and a personal letter from Norma Shearer explaining  why she turned down the role of Scarlett O'Hara.  </P> <P> Alberta's day today is booked solid with more appointments, and on Friday he is  expected to make house calls to appraise larger items and entire collections  that cannot be carried in by hand.  </P> <P> "This is the 50th anniversary of 1939, which was a historic year for classic  film," Alberta said. ("Gone With the Wind," "The Wizard of Oz," "Gunga Din,"  "Goodby Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Wuthering Heights" were  among those released in 1939.)  </P> <P> "It's been a long time since then," Alberta continued, "and it's finally  hitting home that this is part of our American heritage. Movies represent one  of the greatest technological advances, as well as one of the greatest art  forms, of the 20th Century. Whereas painters painted with a brush, (Cecil B.)  DeMille, David O. Selznick and D. W. Griffith were painting their canvases on  the screen."  </P> <P> Hollywood memorabilia has suddenly become big business for auction houses and  an undeniable investment for collectors. Appraisers such as Alberta have found  it difficult to affix value to artifacts because there are no established  buying patterns, so quickly has the popularity of Hollywood collectibles risen.  </P> <P> In an auction held by Christie's two years ago, Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat,  cane and floppy shoes were expected to bring in about $30,000. They sold for  $150,000. A Gothic Revival oak desk used by DeMille, expected to sell in the  neighborhood of $10,000, went for $121,000 in October.  </P> <P> In December, Sotheby's sold one of two pianos used in "Casablanca" (1941) for  $154,000; a 1938 radio type-script from "War of the Worlds" for $143,000, and a  black-and-white Walt Disney animation cel from "The Orphan's Benefit" for  $135,000.  </P> <P> "The items that go for those prices are one-of-a-kind items," said Dana Hawkes,  head of Sotheby's collectible department in New York. "But there are no  precedents for prices; the market determines the price."  </P> <P> It used to be that there was no market at all for Hollywood memorabilia. In the  early years of film, costumes and props were mostly regarded as studio  castoffs.  </P> <P> "Nobody gave these things any value -- the studios never gave the property any  value," said Gary Milan, a Beverly Hills dentist whose personal memorabilia  collection includes one of several Maltese falcons used in the film of that  name and the "Casablanca" piano that appeared in Rick's Cafe (he owned both  pianos, but sold the upright piano used in the Parisian cafe flashback scene at  the Sotheby's auction).  </P> <P> "After the film was made, the property was given to actors, thrown out or even  destroyed," Milan said. "Because after the picture was made, the piece had  absolutely no worth to them."  </P> <P> Beginning in the early 1980s, lost or forgotten Hollywood memorabilia items --  for a long time sold and traded privately -- began to surface in public  auctions one by one, culled largely by collectors who salvaged them from the  studios. The potential for financial windfall in Hollywood collectibles was  realized in 1982 when Steven Spielberg paid $61,000 at a Sotheby's auction for  one of the "Rosebud" sleds from "Citizen Kane."  </P> <P> But the floodgates really opened wide last June, when a pair of ruby slippers  from "The Wizard of Oz" -- one of seven believed to be in existence -- was  auctioned off by Christie's for $165,000.  </P> <P> And experts believe that may be just the beginning.  </P> <P> Michael Shaw, an MGM childhood actor who is working now as a tour guide for  Universal Studios, also has a pair of ruby slippers among his extensive private  collection.  </P> <P> "Both Christie's and Sotheby's have told me if I wait and auction them off, my  shoes will probably bring a million dollars," he said. Although he would not  confirm it, one source reported that Shaw originally bought the slippers for  about $2,500 in 1970.  </P> <P> Christie's cattle call for Hollywood memorabilia has herded together a new  batch of artifacts, with owners eager to capitalize on the rising auction  fever.  </P> <P> "The more provenance someone can show us the more likely they will get a good  price," Alberta said. "For example, if you get a piece brought in by someone  close to the Hollywood figure or studio and that can be verified, the price  jumps. If the piece actually appeared in a movie, the price jumps. If it was  used by someone famous, the price jumps again. And if it's a one-of-a-kind  piece, the price jumps even higher.  </P> <P> "One major mistake is people think that every piece is a ruby slipper."  </P></p>

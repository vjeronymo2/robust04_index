			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Calmly observing a share price slide - Telefonica's feelings on investor nervousness For a company that saw some 12 per cent of its stock market value vaporise in heavy selling in Madrid and New York during three days last week, Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled telecommunications monopoly, is a model of corporate serenity. Investors had reacted badly to the announcement that the transfer of Telefonica's in-house pension scheme to the national social security system was going to cost the group Pta19.4bn (Dollars 194m) this year. But, says an official, 'that was natural. We can easily make up that amount, but any market learning that a company is going to incur extra costs of Dollars 190m is going to react badly'. The news knocked Pta140 off Telefonica's shares in Madrid, although by yesterday the share price had begun to recover slowly. With cash-flow running at around Pta450bn a year, a one-off addition to Telefonica's costs of Pta19.4bn is clearly not the end of the world. Nevertheless, the company may have got itself into an uncomfortable position, particularly among foreign investors. The pension fund move was the latest in a series of irritations which began last summer when Mr Candido Velazquez, Telefonica's chairman, sparked a sharp increase in the company's share price by announcing it had decided to begin linking dividends to profits. This brought to an end the tradition by which the company paid a dividend of 11 per cent over the stock's nominal value. The stock market took this to imply an almost certain 1991 dividend increase. But while the company did, indeed, report a 6.7 per cent rise in net profits to Pta80bn for the year, the dividend did not move. Investors in Madrid and New York were plainly disappointed. The added impact of the pension fund move - which has been hanging over the company for some time - has not helped. Basically, Telefonica is having to transfer its underfunded pensions scheme to the social security system and borrow Pta55bn from the system to pay back the difference. The Pta55bn, however, applies only to retirees already drawing pensions. An estimated Pta135bn will be owed to active workers over the next 25 years, which could cost the company about 1 per cent a year in interest to the social security. And because Telefonica's own scheme promises workers a premium over the social security, the company may have to create an additional external scheme worth an estimated Pta75bn and finance it through borrowings. Nevertheless, the timing of Telefonica's pensions announcement may be political. The Spanish state's 32 per cent shareholding in the company ensures Telefonica a sympathetic ear as it begins negotiations with the government on 1992 tariff increases. Last year it won an average 6.7 per cent. Even a 5 per cent rise this year could generate an extra Pta40bn in income. Telefonica will also install 500,000 new lines this year, and is still negotiating the disposal, forced upon it by the European Commission following the merger last year of Alcatel and Telettra, of stakes in Alcatel and Telettra's Spanish operations. These represent Telefonica's biggest industrial shareholdings. Along with management determination to find new savings and extra productivity this year to compensate for the pension transfer costs, income from these asset sales should comfortably see Telefonica over the difficulties that emerged last week.</p>

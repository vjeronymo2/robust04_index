			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Activity in bond market to continue, OECD report says THE pace of activity in the international bond markets is not expected to ease in the second half of the year after a record first six months, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest Financial Market Trends report, published yesterday. 'The issue calendar remains hefty . . . benefiting from borrowers' needs to proceed with the refinancing of maturing debt, which is likely to exceed Dollars 190bn for the year as a whole,' the report states. The OECD expects modest economic recovery combined with further decreasing inflation to allow for 'some downward adjustment of long-term interest rates,' which will help underpin business activity in the international markets. In the wake of turbulent market conditions caused by the Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, the OECD points to 'some re-orientation of flows across market compartments' rather than any contraction in the overall availability of investible funds. However, while the OECD believes that an overall advance in borrowing volumes of 5 to 7 per cent, in line with the underlying trend since the late 1980s, is 'attainable,' the decline in syndicated lending is unlikely to be reversed. 'Underlying demand/supply conditions support a further, though perhaps not spectacular, growth in securities business while banks' heavy emphasis on risk containment should limit severely the scope for recovery of syndicated lending,' the report says. The OECD report also points to a further expansion of the Euro-note market, where outstandings now exceed Dollars 160bn. '(Its) strong growth has been accompanied by a remarkable broadening of the investor base and a significant strengthening of infrastructure.' The market no longer compares unfavourably with the corresponding market in the US, according to the report.</p>

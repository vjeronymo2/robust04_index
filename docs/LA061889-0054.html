			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVEN NEW HOME BUYERS FEEL MARKET PRESSURE TO SELL  </P> <P> A week before escrow closed on our house in January, a man and a woman walked  up to ask if it was for sale.  </P> <P> I was shocked since the for sale sign had been taken down. I was standing  outside with Milbre Burch, my wife, and Maria DiMassa, our real estate agent,  both of whom had scoured the Pasadena and Altadena landscape to find this  house. But DiMassa nodded and smiled, with an "I-told-you-this-was-a-desirable-  street" look.  </P> <P> Later, after we had moved, a woman interrupted our yard work and asked if we  knew of any houses for sale. We said no. She was helping her son and  daughter-in-law, she said, scout around. Then she asked if we wanted to sell.  Again, we said no.  </P> <P> Even with this level of interest in real estate, I still am amazed by the  constant flow each week of letters, postcards and even potholders advertising  the services of real estate agents. And we get knocks at the door, too. Fellow  homeowners tell me I might expect pumpkins left by agents at Halloween and  watermelons for July 4. This gives a new meaning to the concept of real estate  farming, the practice of an agent pinpointing a neighborhood and consistently  maintaining contact with the residents.  </P> <P> Regardless, this fevered approach can become infectious. And it represents  quite a shift for Milbre and me, who still can freshly recall our days of  wondering how nice a house we actually would be able afford. Now, presto!, even  with an earthquake on Monday and the latest news that a seller's market was  becoming more of a buyer's one, we are experiencing that feeling that the real  estate ads refer to as "pride of ownership."  </P> <P> This letter arrived last month from a Pasadena agent: "Your home may be well  worth a lot more than you think . . . Just a few weeks ago, a house in your  neighborhood sold for 25% more than the owners thought they could get."  </P> <P> Neighbors who have lived on Eldora Road a long time speak of feeling the  pressure to sell.  </P> <P> A letter we received reflects the atmosphere.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago -- the last time the market was this strong -- many homeowners  were caught off guard. And they missed an ideal opportunity to sell because  they didn't know how much their home was worth."  </P> <P> Neighbor Mary Rico said she and her husband made their decision to sell based  on the strength of the market on Eldora Road, where they've lived for 13 years,  and market pressures in Sonora, near Yosemite, where they want to move.  </P> <P> For the last several years she has frequently gotten knocks on the door from  agents as well as house hunters. And she, too, gets solicitations from agents.  </P> <P> "I wanted to wait two more years, but the real estate agents in Sonora said we  must buy now because the prices are going up so fast there." And she said she  and her husband can get four times what they paid for the house.  </P> <P> "It's time to move on," she said the other day. She put aside the garden hose  she was using to water the grass outside her two-story, Mediterranean-style  stucco house. A carpet of St. Augustine anchored a for sale sign. She explained  that she and her husband, after bringing up four children in the house, are  buying a retirement home in Sonora.  </P> <P> Down the street, another neighbor, who bought her house in the 1960s for  $23,000, told me she accepted an offer for a free market analysis of her home's  value. She was told she could ask $200,000. But she decided not to sell upon  realizing she couldn't find a comparable house in Pasadena.  </P> <P> "It drives me nuts," another neighbor told me about the inundating  solicitations. Yet she has also confessed she has thought about selling and  trading up.  </P> <P> But a neighbor, who came to the neighborhood 30 years ago and has long since  retired, told me: "I don't know where I would go, if I did sell."  </P> <P> Not long ago, I spoke with another neighbor. From the vantage point of her  front porch and from the perspective of being a resident for two decades, she  provided a survey of the changing residential landscape. Newcomers there, she  said, pointing to the sweet Spanish-style house with an arched loggia entrance  and French windows. Newcomers over there, too, and of course you're new, she  told me. Then, she said, there's the house down the street that sold last  summer.  </P> <P> Soon after that conversation I got another letter which said: "Remember top  dollar is being paid, regardless of condition, and of course, a lovely home  like yours may receive multiple offers." The letter came with a potholder  emblazoned with the agent's name and phone number.  </P> <P> All this frenzy of buying, selling and moving feels disconcerting. I grew up in  the Mississippi hometown of my great-grandparents, my grandparents and parents.  Until three years ago, my mother had lived in the same house for 50 years. My  wife grew up in the Atlanta house where her parents have lived for 30 years.  </P> <P> Yet, in the 15 years since I left graduate school, I have lived at 17 addresses  and, like my wife, have lived in four states during that time.  </P> <P> This appears to be appropriate training for what Milbre calls the mobility  giddiness of Southern California where some people seem to buy a house as often  as they trade in a car.  </P> <P> Right now, though, we want to stay put. But occasionally the giddiness sweeps  in the prospect of a better house, a better neighborhood. Or even the notion  that, as one real estate agent's letter said: "You, too, may be missing out on  the hidden value of your home if you don't at least find out its current worth.  . . . "  </P> <P> One day, but not any time too soon, we will find out.  </P></p>

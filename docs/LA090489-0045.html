			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: THE WRIGHT STUFF;  </P> <P> IN MALIBU, A NEW HOUSE BY THE MASTER DESIGNER WILL BE BUILT FROM PLANS THAT  WERE NEVER USED  </P> <P> New Mexico developer Charles Klotsche fell in love with the architecture of  Frank Lloyd Wright by chance. Looking for a way to set his life on a new course  after a divorce in the early 1980s, Klotsche came across Wright's work while  idly leafing through a published copy of one of the Master's sketchbooks.  </P> <P> "I was overwhelmed by Wright's talent," he said. "At the same, time my  developer's nostrils twitched with a fresh scent when I discovered that a  number of Wright's house designs had never been built."  </P> <P> As a resident of Santa Fe, Klotsche was particularly struck by Wright's  drawings for a unique adobe dwelling known as the "Pottery House." He wangled  an introduction to the architect's widow, his third wife, Olgivanna, and, after  much persuasion, cut a deal to buy the Pottery House plans for $125,000 from  the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, which she controlled at the time. Klotsche  built the adobe dwelling near Santa Fe, and sold it to fashion designer Calvin  Klein for a handsome profit in 1985.  </P> <P> Now Klotsche is planning to build a second Wright residence, known as the  "Boulder House," on a spectacular site in Point Dume, Malibu, which he hopes to  sell for around $7 million when completed next year. Working with Taliesen  Associated Architects of Scottsdale, Arizona -- the practicing inheritors of  Wright's old studio in Taliesen West -- Klotsche is as faithful to the original  design in Malibu as he was in Santa Fe.  </P> <P> Both the Santa Fe and Malibu houses were planned for different cities than the  ones that finally gave them a home. The Pottery House was designed for a couple  in Santa Fe in 1939, but the husband's death in World War II canceled the  project. The Boulder House, designed in the early 1950s a few years before  Wright's death, was intended as a winter retreat for Pittsburg, Pa., department  store magnate Edgar Kaufmann in Palm Springs. Because of a family divorce, the  house was never built, and the plans remained buried in the Wright Foundation  archives at Taliesen West until Klotsche unearthed them.  </P> <P> "Fallingwater," the house Wright designed for Kaufmann in Bear Run, Pa., in  1935 is one of the most famous modern residences in the United States. Poised  spectacularly over a waterfall in a forest, Fallingwater's cantilevered  terraces seem to strain at anchor like a high-spirited yacht eager to set sail.  "Inhabit the place that you love," Wright told Kaufmann, to persuade his client  that his favorite spot beside a wooded stream was a suitable site for an  expensive house.  </P> <P> The Boulder House, as it was designed and as it will be built, is also  surrounded by water, but in static pools, as befits a desert design. Transposed  to a Malibu canyon above Pacific Coast Highway, the house is a series of  sweeping arcs embracing long views. The boulders that give the design its name  are featured in a dramatic chimney tower. Three copper roofs, resembling  upturned boat bottoms, give the 6,200-square-foot residence the air of a  beached ship upended to shelter shipwreck survivors.  </P> <P> The biggest of the house's three boat-shaped sections encloses the curved  living room and the master bedroom suite. The ovoid west wing has two more  bedrooms, and the east wing houses the dining room with its arc of french doors  overlooking the moat that runs the length of the main frontage. A second floor  study over the master bedroom has a huge balcony that cantilevers over the  pool. An extension beside the rear motor court entry completes the spectacular  layout.  </P> <P> "All Frank Lloyd Wright's dwellings had kitchens and bathrooms that are too  small for today's requirements," said Charles Montooth, the Taliesen Associated  Architects designer who has worked with Klotsche on adapting both the Pottery  and Boulder houses. "Expanding these facilities without damaging Wright's  original concept is one of the challenges we face. Plus the fact that Frank  Lloyd Wright left no details (detail drawings for cabinetry and other finishes)  for the Boulder House, so we must draw upon the design vocabulary evidenced in  the archives."  </P> <P> Montooth commends Klotsche as a "truly sympathetic client." He remembers that  Mrs. Wright, who died in 1985, was suspicious of the developer at first.  "Olgivanna had the last word in these matters," Montooth said, "and it took all  of Charles' charm to convince her he was the man to carry out the holy task of  completing the Master's conception."  </P> <P> In discovering that around 140 of Wright's 700-plus designs had never been  built, Klotsche feels he has struck gold. "I found at least a dozen house plans  that made my mouth water," he recalled. "If I manage to continue, it could  become a lifetime's mission to realize most of these superb residences."  </P> <P> And a profitable one. Advised by local real estate agents, Klotsche decided on  Malibu as the most potentially lucrative location for the Boulder House. The  raw three-acre Point Dume site, located close to Barbra Streisand's estate, ran  a cool $1.2 million, and Klotsche estimates the house will cost a similar  amount to construct. He expects to clear around $3 million on the Boulder House  project.  </P> <P> Klotsche, 47, moved to Los Angeles six months ago to take advantage of the  burgeoning local high-end real estate market. "The Santa Fe property scene is  more or less played out," he said, "but L.A. is a bonanza for people who do  things right. People will pay the limit for the right location with the right  estate and a Wright house."  </P> <P> The fashion for Wright's "organic" architecture, which fell out of favor among  architects for several decades after World War II, has revived strongly in  recent years. Wright's furniture is now being reproduced with great success,  and his career as a great American original has begun to be appreciated by a  new generation of designers in this Post- and Late-Modern period.  </P> <P> "Organic means, in a philosophic sense, entity," Wright explained in a 1953  NBC-TV interview, "where the whole is to the part as the part is to the whole,  and where the nature of materials, the nature of the purpose, the nature of the  entire performance becomes a necessity . . . (so that) it graces its  environment rather than disgraces it."  </P> <P> Put more simply, an organic house design is all of a piece from its concept to  its details, and should seem as if it grew out of the landscape as naturally as  a tree or shrub. In this way, Kaufmann's dramatic Fallingwater was inspired by  the stream it bridges. "I think you can hear the waterfall when you look at the  design," Wright said.  </P> <P> Given the profound marriage of house and site that distinguishes Wright's  architecture, how does a developer justify transferring a design from the  dun-colored Palm Springs desert to the seaside slopes of Malibu?  </P> <P> "I feel you can transfer the design and update it to a more contemporary  setting if you are faithful to the original idea," Klotsche claimed. "You just  have to take great care not to compromise the authenticity of the concept. If I  hadn't been able to convince Mrs. Wright that I would honor her husband's  architecture all the way, no matter what the cost, she would never have let me  loose on either the Pottery or the Boulder house."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- France and Cuba have  discussed the possibility of France extending Cuba's line of  credit to $150 million. French Ambassador Jean-Raphael Dufour  confirmed the report for PRENSA LATINA today, saying that this  credit stands at $120 million and that he is satisfied with the  positive evolution of relations between the two countries.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the ambassador said  the first part of the 30-million-franc donation (in excess of $6  million) to Cuba for use in basic industries is practically  complete.    Dufour mentioned a French corporation's drilling for oil in  Cuban offshore waters, particularly the first well drilled in  Cardenas Bay, as one interesting aspect in the field of  bilateral cooperation.    He said that French businessmen constantly travel to Cuba,  and some of them are interested in the banking and sugar sectors.    A new working session of French businessmen and Cuban  authorities will be held in the next few months as a  continuation of the general negotiations held at the beginning  of the year, when a large group of French businessmen came to  Havana.    The ambassador described as very important a July meeting in  Cuba of more than 600 French language professors from Latin  America, Europe, and Africa to discuss the teaching of this  language in Spanish-speaking countries.    He added that this event is endorsed by Cuban authorities  and  the University of Havana and that several Latin American  countries will be well represented. Brazil and Argentina will  send some 90 delegates.    We make realistic progress in developing ties with Cuba. We  think it is the best way to develop those ties, Ambassador  Dufour concluded.</p>

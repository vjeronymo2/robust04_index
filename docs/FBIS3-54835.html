The Danish and Latvian defense  ministers signed an agreement on cooperation in the military  field. The agreement provides for mutual consultations on  issues of defense planning and strategy, as well as security.    The agreement also provides for exchange of experience and  information and visits by officials and officers. Educational  and practical training programs will be worked out together;  other issues will be also tackled together. Denmark is the  first NATO member state with which such an agreement has been  signed.    Pavlovskis [Latvian Defense Minister] values the agreement  as  one more step forward in the formation of good relations between  both states.    The Danish defense minister said that Denmark attaches great  significance to this visit and to cooperation with Latvia.    When meeting Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, the Danish  defense minister expressed unambiguous support for Latvia in the  issue of the withdrawal of the Russian Army. He expressed hope  that it would be possible to also agree on the future of the  Skrunda radar.    Haekkerup welcomed the possible participation of the Baltic  states, including Latvia, in the UN peacekeeping forces. He  said that this would be a good beginning in cooperation with the  European security structures. The Danish defense minister  promised that the issue of the Baltic states' involvement in the  peacekeeping forces will be discussed at the next meeting of the  Nordic states' defense ministers. He did not exclude the  possibility that Denmark and other Nordic states could grant  material assistance in the formation of the peace battalion of  the Baltic states.</p>

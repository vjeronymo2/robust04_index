			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fall in Japanese M&amp;A MERGERS and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by Japanese companies fell sharply last year, reflecting the squeeze on liquidity due to the sluggish stock market and declines in profits, as well as deteriorating business conditions of companies in the US and Europe. According to Daiwa Securities, a leading Japanese brokerage, last year's M&amp;A deals fell 63.5 per cent by value from 1990 to Y1,297.1bn (Dollars 10.3bn). This was because of the decline in acquisitions of foreign companies by Japanese companies, which plunged 78.6 per cent to Y684.3bn. Although the figure includes the Y133bn limited partnership between Toshiba, C. Itoh and Time Warner of the US, the absence of large-value transactions of the previous years, such as the Sony-Columbia and Matsushita Electric Industrial-MCA deals caused the fall. Acquisitions of US companies by Japanese corporations fell 81.3 per cent by value to Y382.2bn, while in Europe the figure fell by 70 per cent to Y217.2bn. In the UK, M&amp;A transactions by Japanese companies fell 81.2 per cent to Y88.2bn. On the other hand, Daiwa said domestic M&amp;A transactions increased by 28.4 per cent to Y434.9bn, while foreign acquisitions of Japanese companies were eight times higher by value at Y177.9bn.</p>

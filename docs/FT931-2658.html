			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Legal &amp; General lifts dividendafter advance to Pounds 116m LEGAL &amp; General, the life and general insurer, yesterday reported a recovery in pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 116.1m in 1992 and increased its dividend from 18.8p to 19.1p, prompting a positive response from investors who marked the shares up 16p to close at 481p. The dividend increase was seen as a sign of confidence by analysts. 'It is an attractive yield with a good asset backing,' said Mr Alan Richards of James Capel. A turnround in the group's general insurance business underpinned the improved trading performance, with milder weather, increased premium rates and reduced expenses cutting losses to Pounds 61m compared with Pounds 157.3m in 1991. Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity (DMI) business fell to Pounds 75m from Pounds 106.1m, in spite of further strengthening in reserves against future claims. L&amp;G now has Pounds 294m set aside in reserves (before reinsurance) to meet potential future claims, compared with Pounds 220m six months ago. It now believes it has enough reserves to meet all claims likely to emerge on its existing book of business. Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said there was a 'reasonable possibility of insurance break-even'. L&amp;G, which even before the change was reserving on a more conservative basis than any of its rivals, has a share of between 8 and 9 per cent of the UK DMI market. Worldwide life and pensions business contributed Pounds 150.9m (up from Pounds 126.4m) to pre-tax profits, of which Pounds 109.1m was generated in the UK, up from Pounds 103.2m. New premium income from life and pensions fell sharply, however. Worldwide annual premiums dropped to Pounds 196.3m, from Pounds 223.2m, while single premiums amounted to Pounds 874.6m (against Pounds 1bn). In the UK annual premiums were down to Pounds 143.2m (from Pounds 170.1m). Single premiums fell to Pounds 735.7m (from Pounds 903.9m). Fund management new business increased to Pounds 2.32bn from Pounds 905.4m, largely reflecting a rise in the UK to Pounds 2.23bn from Pounds 854.6m. Total funds under management increased to Pounds 24.69bn (from Pounds 19.26bn). Earnings per share rose to 18.5p from 8.96p. Lex, Page 16</p>

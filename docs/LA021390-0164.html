			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SINGLE GERMAN OLYMPIC TEAM POSSIBLE IN 1992  </P> <P> A top East German sports official has acknowledged for the first time that the  two Germanys may be in a position to combine their powerful sporting talents  into one team before the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.  </P> <P> "It is possible that things will happen so fast that a joint team could come  about by 1992, perhaps even earlier," East German National Olympic Committee  Vice President Georg Zorowka said at a World Cup swimming meet in Bonn.  </P> <P> Zorowka is a top figure in East German swimming, a sport that would be  revolutionized by a joint German team.  </P> <P> He added today that the decision will depend on the outcome of elections in  East Germany next month.  </P> <P> "This is something we sports people can only decide as voters in political  elections. I believe we have to go carefully with such developments," Zorowka  said.  </P> <P> The elections are to decide a future government for the former communist state,  whose power crumbled after a peaceful people's uprising late last year.  </P> <P> Plans for political unification of the two countries are picking up pace by the  day.  </P> <P> West German Olympic chief Willi Daume said a few days earlier that  International Olympic Committee officials will not stand in the way of a  combined German team and that it may happen in time for the Barcelona Games.  </P></p>

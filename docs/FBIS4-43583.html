			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Enzo Roggi: "Return of the Long Wave"] </F>   [Text] The center-right voters who in March decided to  place their trust in the Berlusconi coalition have decided not  to turn back, while another faction has heard and heeded the  call of a victorious novelty rich in resources and with a  rampant image. In other words, this is a confirmation of the  tendency to entrust the heritage of the First Republic to forces  which are at the same time new in appearance and but the same in  social and political substance.    Within the context of this tendency there was to be  expected,  and there has been, a gain on the part of the leading group --  Forza Italia -- which not only promoted the new alignment but  granted it substance, visibility, and propaganda (promoted with  disproportionate means on a scale never before seen in an  election campaign). This advance occurred to the detriment of  its government allies -- of the National Alliance, the far-right  wing, despite its efforts to impart to the Berlusconi initiative  the impetus and the spirit of an electorate that considers  itself the breakthrough vanguard. And the League, too, has lost  ground -- that is, the coalition's most autonomous and critical  movement which, as such, seemed out of tune with the  consolidation of the newly established government framework.    Overall, Berlusconi has received the confirmation he wanted  -- achieved under the best psychological conditions and thanks  to a deployment of resources that scandalized impartial  observers but that must have attracted many vacillating voters.    Accepting the fact that no thinking person could have  expected a reversal of the tendencies expressed in March, and  that such a radical reversal of the political balances could  only, and can only, entail lengthy time periods and experiments,  it must be noted that the progressive alignment basically  withstood the test, with different kinds of variations within it  that bear witness to the reality of a variety of forces that  must be exploited. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  suffered a setback, but quite clearly remains the most  substantial group in the democratic opposition; and this  position requires that it emerge more clearly and more quickly  from the internal reflections that the voters may have  interpreted as uncertainty and invisibility.    As for the center opposition, which also lost some ground,  it  should be noted that it was not overwhelmed, as some predicted,  by the irresistible siren's call of Berlusconi: It is still a  force to be reckoned with, though it must quickly answer the  question of which side it stands on.    The Italian vote (whose result will have to be combined with  that in the local elections) lies within the context of an  overall European tendency in which there are conflicting results  from country to country. Against the background of a moderate  and right-wing offensive, we see various kinds of response (from  the Labor victory to Kohl's recovery) that nevertheless grant  the socialist forces a leading role that will influence the  prospects for European integration. Italy is sending to the  European Parliament a delegation that will curb, if it is  actually not hostile to, the cause of political union, and it is  on this front too that the future political and social struggle  in our country will take place.</p>

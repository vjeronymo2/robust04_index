			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / High noon for R-R's high flyer: Sir Ralph Robins explains his company's strategy SIR Ralph Robins, the urbane chief executive of Rolls-Royce, yesterday echoed the classic western line when he said that 'one has to do what one has to do'. It is high noon at Rolls-Royce. Hit like the rest of the defence and aerospace industry by the decline in military spending and the recession in air travel, the aero-engine maker this week announced plans to double its job cuts this year to 6,000. It also warned it could be forced to make compulsory redundancies for the first time since its bankruptcy 20 years ago. 'I read that General Dynamics is laying off 30,000 people, and they are one of the recent winners of the big US advan-ced tactical fighter contract,' Sir Ralph said. 'If the winners are having to do that, what are the losers going to do?' Barely 18 months ago, Sir Ralph was brimming with confidence on the future prospects of his company. Airlines were still ordering new aircraft and engines in record numbers. The defence business was flat, but at least it was not declining. After the bankruptcy of 1971, Rolls-Royce had successfully expanded its family of aero-engines, increased its market share in the civil-engine market to 20 per cent and built up a strong balance sheet and healthy profits. An engineer turned super-salesman, who has spent all his working life with Rolls-Royce, Sir Ralph still appeared his old, confident self yesterday. 'We can push ourselves in a very strong competitive position into the civil business. We've started a five-year plan to improve efficiency. The latest job cuts are an acceleration of that process,' he explained. Job cuts are not new at Rolls-Royce, although enforced redundancies would be. In the past 10 years the company has shed 26,000 jobs, or about one third of its workforce. The newly-announced reductions not only reflect the current difficulties of the market but are also part of a long consolidation of the UK aero-engine and aerospace industry. 'We have sites all over the country,' Sir Ralph said. 'We must reduce the number of sites. The same thing is happening at British Aerospace. We are simply in too many places.' The company plans to close its Leavesden, Hertfordshire, helicopter engine factory by the end of next year and to concentrate Leavesden's activities at its Bristol military engine plant. The Parkside industrial and marine engine plant in Coventry will also be closed, with these activities regrouped at the nearby Ansty factory. 'It's difficult to justify two sites in Coventry,' Sir Ralph explained. He insisted that the dramatic changes in both the defence and civil aircraft markets had not altered the company's fundamental strategy. 'It is very straightforward,' he explained. 'It is to become the leading supplier of high-integrity power systems. That is our mission. It's a long term strategy which simply doesn't happen overnight.' But he conceded that this strategy made sense only as long as the company was competitive. 'We are reacting to changed market forces,' Sir Ralph said. 'We are being more rigorous in the analysis and restructuring of all our business processes. Our aim is to take out all non-value-added activities in what we do. We started with our manufacturing processes three years ago. We are now extending this approach to our business and management processes.' As the smallest of the 'big three' aero-engine makers, Rolls-Royce has always been regarded as more vulnerable to a downturn than its two larger US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Indeed, both US companies have often said there is not room for three big manufacturers in the fiercely competitive market. 'They would say that,' said Sir Ralph. 'Over the next 15 years we are looking at a commercial jet market of some Pounds 120bn and even the depressed military market is expected to provide about Pounds 100bn of business. There's plenty of room for three companies.' Sir Ralph acknowledged that, on the basis of output per man, the Americans 'are better than us'. But he emphasised it was very difficult to measure productivity. 'How do you put the exchange rate in the formula? We were very concerned when the pound was at Dollars 2 since 22 per cent of our turnover is dollar-exposed.' One way of reducing this exposure was to source more business in dollars. 'More capacity is currently available in the US because of the downturn. If we find good suppliers , we will tend to use them. But we are not making a drive to neutralise the dollar effect by sourcing in the US. What we are seeking is the lowest net cost of supplies.' Sir Ralph believed Rolls-Royce was closing the gap with GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney. 'We took 20 per cent of the civil market last year. Pratt took 27 per cent and GE 25 per cent. This says we must be competitive.' But the US companies are moving all the time, aggressively cutting costs. 'We can't afford to be left behind,' Sir Ralph stressed. Rolls-Royce is not worried by its relatively smaller size compared with the two US companies. But Sir Ralph said he was still worried by the heavy dependence of the group on the aero-engine business. To expand its business base, Rolls-Royce acquired two years ago NEI, the power engineering company. However, aero-engines still account for 60 per cent of turnover. 'I would be more comfortable with a 50-50 split. A personal ambition is to get our industrial group the same size as the aero-engine group.' Sir Ralph also said Rolls-Royce planned to build up its new relationship with BMW of Germany and this would include building a greenfield engine plant in east Germany, probably in Berlin. Rolls-Royce will continue to look for partnerships and joint-ventures with other companies, but Sir Ralph could not see any chance of a broad alliance with one of the two big US manufacturers, except on specific projects. He had no regrets over the decision to break off seven years ago the short-lived alliance with GE: 'If we had gone with GE, we would have been squeezed out of the civil business.'</p>

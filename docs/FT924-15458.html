			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / EC states urged to pool foreign reserves EUROPEAN Community member states should consider pooling their foreign exchange reserves as part of an urgent package of measures to save the European Monetary System, Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister, said yesterday. Mr Solchaga said: 'The system is almost absolutely broken. Interest rates are so high that they cannot last for long without creating real problems for economic recovery.' The search for agreement needed to begin before the EC summit in Birmingham on October 16, he said, despite the problems created by increasing political and personal rancour between EC governments. He outlined three steps to restore market confidence in the exchange rate mechanism: A review of the credibility of the existing currency grid. He said he was not formally calling for another realignment of ERM parities but informal discussions should take place in the next few days about the wisdom of such a move. The creation of a 'multilateral European fund of reserves', a pooling of central bank reserves, to be administered jointly to defend currency parities within the ERM. This, he said, could ease pressure on the Bundesbank, whose recent interventions in support of other currencies has inflated the German money supply. Spain has the second highest currency reserves in Europe after the Bundesbank. A general agreement to reduce interest rates across the EC. Mr Solchaga's suggestions will not be welcomed by all his EC colleagues, many of whom are struggling to keep the structure and management of the EMS off the summit agenda. But they reflect Spain's deep anxiety to restore confidence in its own economic management after the 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta two weeks ago and its decision to reintroduce capital controls temporarily. Spain is worried that without at least an informal agreement to consider changes in the ERM within days, the currency market turbulence will intensify in the run-up to the Birmingham meeting, with the weaker currencies coming under further speculative attack. 'In the absence of a global solution, everyone will look for individual solutions,' he said. 'But there are no individual solutions if there is not global credibility.' While recognising that German rates could not be cut in current circumstances, he said this would be possible in the event of a general realignment. 'We have done a lot of damage to the European Monetary System in the last few weeks and without it it will be impossible to proceed to the second phase (in January 1994) of monetary union,' he said. Mr Solchaga expressed surprise and irritation at recent reported comments by the German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, suggesting that a group of 'hard core' EC currencies could move quickly towards fixing their parities.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: South Carolina offers glimpse of Clinton way - Investment attracted by a trained workforce THE modern office buildings and factories that dot the green landscape of western South Carolina, once an agricultural backwater, are all the more remarkable once the names of the companies come into view: Michelin, Robert Bosch, Bayer, Rhone-Poulenc, Siemens, Unilever. The latest foreign entrant to this unlikely international neighbourhood in America's South is BMW, the German car maker, which recently began construction of a Dollars 300m assembly plant in the Greenville-Spartanburg area. Greenville and Spartanburg, two small but plucky cities, have lured hundreds of millions of dollars in investment from foreign companies over the last five years. Together they have attracted more foreign investment per capita than any equivalent area in the US. Spartanburg alone has more than 80 foreign companies, half of them German. In South Carolina overall, Germany has a 30 per cent share of the state's cumulative foreign investment total of Dollars 9.3bn. Japan accounts for 16.9 per cent, Britain and France about 14 per cent each and Switzerland 11.4 per cent. A survey of foreign companies in the state by the financial consultants KPMG Peat Marwick says: 'Over the last five years, South Carolina has consistently been a leader in attracting foreign investment, with the annual growth in the number of foreign-owned companies establishing headquarters in South Carolina ranging from 9 to 12 per cent.' With keen competition among US states for foreign investment - in particular for plants that create new jobs - South Carolina has composed a seductive package of attractions, say executives of foreign manufacturing groups. While low corporate income tax, excellent transportation and competitive business costs are part of the package, the state's biggest enticement is its labour. Not only is it plentiful, largely ununionised and relatively cheap, as is the case throughout the south-east, but South Carolina offers an innovative scheme to custom-train an investor's workforce. Through a network of 16 technical colleges, the state will recruit and train employees at little or no cost to meet the specific needs of incoming or expanding companies. Although the state's overall educational achievements rank poorly within the US, its technical training programme is considered one of America's more far-sighted. The scheme is also in tune with the incoming Clinton administration's thinking, underlined by the choice of former South Carolina governor Mr Dick Riley as education secretary. Germany's Robert Bosch, which has two automotive parts manufacturing plants and a total of Dollars 348m worth of investment in South Carolina, says a key reason it chose the state was the government's worker training programme. It has even set up a German-style apprenticeship programme in conjunction with some of the local technical colleges. Lucas Industries of the UK, another automotive parts manufacturer, settled on South Carolina largely for the same reason. At first, it invested for just an engineering test facility, but has expanded to a manufacturing plant employing more than 300. It already supplies fuel injectors for BMW in Germany and hopes to earn business from the car maker's new plant nearby. The state's success in attracting foreign business is getting attention in economic development circles, especially since BMW's announcement. And while South Carolina was relatively hard hit by the US recession during the last two years, economists say it is poised to recover well, not least because of BMW and the supplier network it is expected to spawn. The level of job creation by foreign companies has helped steady the local economy and has kept the state's unemployment rate running well behind the national average. At the end of 1991, 73,000 people were employed by foreign companies, responsible for more than 20 per cent of all new jobs in South Carolina from 1987. Moreover, the average annual wage for these new jobs was nearly Dollars 4,000 higher than the average state wage of Dollars 19,600.</p>

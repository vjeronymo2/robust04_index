			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Risk in a warm climate - Geographical specialists / Investment trusts offer the only practicable way to invest in underdeveloped markets on the periphery of areas which currently have strong economies NOBODY IS suggesting that you should put all your life savings into the Foreign &amp; Colonial Latin American Investment Trust. Even the fund's own managers are quite happy to admit that that would be too risky. But if you had put some 'risk' money (ie, funds you were prepared to lose) into it at end of last January, it would have done very nicely - the trust rose 120 per cent over the next 12 months, according to Micropal, to make it the most successful of all investment trusts over the time period. It would be unwise to be seduced by investment performance over such a short period, and the fund has not yet been going long enough to provide a definitive record. But numbers like that command attention. Latin America has been the star performer of late. But other areas ripe for the specialist treatment include the Pacific Basin, and southern and eastern Europe. All have underdeveloped markets, but stand on the periphery of areas with currently strong economies. If you want to cash in, investment trusts offer virtually the only practicable vehicle. Illiquidity makes 'open-ended' funds such as unit trusts inappropriate, because the size of the fund is allowed to fluctuate in accordance with payments and withdrawals by investors. Heavy redemptions could make life impossible for the fund manager, if it is difficult to find buyers for large blocks of funds. The strictures of regulators mean that many of these funds stay 'offshore', rather than tempt too many novice investors into risky investment waters. Managers that specialise in exotic narrowly based funds include: Tyndall, whose stable includes First Philippine and Korea Liberalisation; Lloyds Bank, which offers the First Spanish and the German investment trusts; and John Govett, which offers a whole array, mostly based offshore, such as Mexican Horizons, Malaysian Emerging, Singapore SESDAQ and the Hungarian Investment Company. The companies take differing attitudes to the marketing of the products. John Govett regards its funds, which tend to invest in highly illiquid markets, as being for institutional use. Richard Royds, managing director, points out that the minimum investment in its ground-breaking Hungarian trust at launch was Pounds 25,000, while the average size of deals since has been Pounds 20,000 - not within reach of the 'small' investor. Govett's aim is to allow pension funds and other institutional investors the chance of exposure to markets with particular growth opportunities. However, it hopes in time to offer the funds to the mass market. Tyndall takes a similar line. F&amp;C, unlike Govett, offers a regular savings scheme for investors in both its Latin American and German investment trusts. Audley Twiston Davies, who manages the Latin American fund, remains bullish about future prospects for the region, and sees the area as offering a broad investment spread. For example, the trust has recently taken on its first exposure to Peru, and plans to move into Ecuador. He points out that growth for the next 10 years is forecast at an annual 5 per cent, by the International Monetary Fund, and he sees other moderately defensive qualities. 'In Latin America, you have a nice mix of economies which have substantially gone through a restructuring process. You can start to value them more like a mainstream stock market. And they don't look too expensive.' It should be obvious to any reasonably sensible investor that the investment story for these markets in itself makes the potential risks and opportunities greater than they might otherwise be. But the extra risks bequeathed by the technical factors which determine investment trust pricing might be more awkward to detect. Most investment trusts trade at a discount to their net asset value, which is largely fuelled by market sentiment. Sudden events which rocked confidence in a specific geographical area could be disastrous for the value of shares in a geographically specialist investment trust. More awkward still, some of these trusts even stand at a premium. This tends to amplify further the risks and opportunities associated with the trusts. Robin Angus, investment trust analyst at County Nat West, puts it this way: 'Of course, there's much more volatility with a geographically specialist trust. Naturally the trust is more likely to move to a discount or a premium, because you have not got checks and balances within your portfolio.' He points out that exceptions can be made for trusts specialising in the UK, as this tends to be the home for UK money; and also for trusts such as Fleming Overseas, which specialise in overseas investment but give themselves a broader spread. But Bruce Ackerman, a director of several Lloyds Bank investment trusts, points out that, while markets are difficult to enter, institutional interest will remain high: 'There is a high correlation between small discounts and the closedness of the market to outside investment.' Once the markets open up more, institutions might even lose interest because they can invest direct. He is therefore less nervous than Mr Angus about the volatility of share prices compared with net asset value. Also, discount volatility can always work in the investor's favour, if shares move to a premium from a discount. But Mr Angus' view is still clear: 'I would never advise any individual to put more than a small punt on a specialist trust. If you want to back a hunch, that's fine, provided you've got maybe 10 times that much in one of the big broadly spread trusts.'</p>

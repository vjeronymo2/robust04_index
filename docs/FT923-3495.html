			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities brush off CBI retail survey CALMER foreign exchange markets, firmer government bonds and a batch of satisfactory trading results from leading British companies helped UK stocks yesterday to brush off the effects of a highly gloomy survey of retailing from the Confederation of British Industry. After some initial uncertainty, share prices staged a rally from the losses of the two preceding sessions. The FT-SE Index closed 13.1 up at 2,340.6, near the day's best level. Nervousness over the dramas seen this week in European currencies continued to overhang equities. Although a shade easier against the D-Mark when equity trading closed, the pound had turned in a firmer performance for most of the day, and this set the stage for a better showing in the stock market. Share prices opened firmer but lost heart as traders absorbed the details of the CBI's report on retailing, which said that shop sales fell in August for the third consecutive month. More worrying for the market was the opinion of the CBI members that no improvement is in sight this year, which suggested that any prospects of a consumer-led recovery from the UK recession are even further away than feared. However, sterling's rally after touching its D-Mark low on Wednesday night proved a stronger factor in the stock market and shares resumed their advance to show a 14.8 rise at 2,342.3 on the Footsie at midsession. But support faded away in the second half of the session and it was not until Wall Street opened 11 Dow points higher that London regained its impetus. Satisfactory trading results from Glaxo, the pharmaceutical stock which features strongly in almost every fund manager's portfolio, also helped sentiment, and there were no unpleasant surprises from the rest of the day's corporate reporting list. Safety first is still the investors' watchword, and fund managers will have no truck with any stock where the dividend is thought to be in danger. Most of the share gains came among those stocks hit hard by company news disclosed earlier in the week. Seaq trading volume increased to 485.6m shares and traders believed that the proportion of retail, or customer, business was higher. Wednesday's Seaq total of 400.9m shares represented retail business worth only Pounds 761.7m, still unimpressive in terms of market profitability. Even the battered retail and consumer share sectors managed to shrug off the implications of the CBI survey to record a few scattered gains as the steadier trend in the pound soothed some of the worries regarding the outlook for UK interest rates and high street spending prospects. Some London-based securities houses are now daring to ask themselves what would happen if the French vote 'no' in the Maastricht referendum on September 20. Some hardy spirits suggest that this might make life easier for the UK equity market by making a sterling devaluation more possible - although Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull warned that such hopes could prove a 'Fools' Paradise'.</p>

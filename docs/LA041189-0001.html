The Academy of Country  Music's 2,000 voting members cast ballots to choose the winners of the cowboy  hat-shaped awards in 11 categories.  </P> <P>  -- If the name Antonio Meucci doesn't ring a bell, you haven't come across  John N. LaCorte and his mission to draw attention to Meucci's accomplishments.  LaCorte believes that Meucci -- not Alexander Graham Bell -- deserves  recognition for inventing the telephone. He has already convinced some people  and gathered about 250 friends and supporters in Brooklyn to pay tribute to  Meucci, an Italian-American inventor who, in 1871, filed notice of intent to  seek a patent for a device that would transmit speech sounds via electricity.  But Meucci did not have enough money to develop the project and his document  with the U.S. Patent Office lapsed, LaCorte said. It was five years later that  Bell applied for his own patent. This is not the first time that LaCorte, 79,  has worked to gain recognition for an Italian. As president of the Italian  Historical Society of America more than two decades ago, he sought  acknowledgment of Giovanni da Verrazano for his exploration of New York harbor,  and officials subsequently named the bridge spanning the harbor's entrance the  Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

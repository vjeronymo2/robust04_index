			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON SUPPORTS PARTY TICKETS ON BALLOTS IN STATE  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, said Monday he  would support changing the California Constitution to require that the governor  and lieutenant governor be elected as a ticket from the same party.  </P> <P> But Wilson conveyed that his month-old candidacy is not far enough along for  him to be precise about terms of such a change in election law -- or for him to  speak authoritatively on other matters that are likely to be contested in the  1990 campaign, issues as commonplace as gun control or as complex as today's  growth of governance by ballot initiative.  </P> <P> The senator was reelected in November to a second six-year term, and then in  February declared he would run for governor next year. An hourlong breakfast  session Monday was his first long question-and-answer session with journalists  since entering the gubernatorial race.  </P> <P> Relaxed and seeming in good humor, Wilson chose to stay out of the line of  fire, even if doing so meant raising questions about his rationale for seeking  to govern the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Split Tickets  </P> <P> He came closest to specifics on the matter of a governor-lieutenant governor  ticket. In the last three gubernatorial election years -- 1978, '82 and '86 --  voters chose a governor and lieutenant governor from different parties. Wilson  said some voters enjoy this ticket-splitting as fun and as a grass-roots check  on the power of politicians.  </P> <P> But, he added, "we have created . . . quite enough in the way of checks and  balances" in government already.  </P> <P> "You hear a great deal about leadership, about wanting effective leadership. .  . . I think the state would do well to emulate the federal system, certainly in  having the governor and lieutenant governor run as a team, as a ticket," Wilson  said.  </P> <P> The federal system, of course, allows a presidential nominee to select a  running mate with approval of the party's political nominating convention.  Wilson said he would be happy with that opportunity, or, in the alternative, to  run as a ticket with the winner of his party's primary election for lieutenant  governor.  </P> <P> A proposed constitutional amendment calling for a new ticket system of electing  the governor and lieutenant governor is pending in the Legislature but faces an  uphill battle. In one statewide public opinion poll, Californians said they  favor leaving the current system intact.  </P> <P> So does incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, a Democrat who has announced he  will run for reelection in 1990. Supporters of change hope to break through the  opposition and put the question on the June, 1990, ballot so that it could  affect the November general election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Ready for Battle  </P> <P> On other subjects, in question after question, the senator indicated he was not  ready for battle.  </P> <P> He said he probably would sign a ban on sales of assault rifles as proposed in  the state Assembly, a ban that would specify by make and model each unlawful  weapon. But then again, he added, maybe there is validity to arguments that  rural Californians, far from police, need AK-47s or Uzis for personal  protection.  </P> <P> Wilson said he shares the concern of rank-and-file voters that too much law is  the result of ballot initiatives. But the senator indicated at the same time  that he is interested in two or perhaps more initiative campaigns now being  discussed in GOP circles.  </P> <P> One being considered in various forms would strip from the Legislature the  power to redraw legislative and congressional district boundaries to adjust for  population change. Another is an idea to restructure government and eliminate  the many layers of spending priorities now on the books in order to allow the  next governor and Legislature more leeway in budgeting.  </P> <P> "I'm very interested -- but what role I take will, using the words of Jerry  Brown, will evolve," Wilson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Names Priorities  </P> <P> His announcement speech Feb. 18 was implicitly critical of the Deukmejian  Administration -- at least as far as Wilson's willingness to increase GOP  priorities for environmental protection, methods of alternative transportation,  health care for the elderly, and research into cures for AIDS, Alzheimer's  disease and breast cancer.  </P> <P> But Monday, Wilson chose instead to emphasize points of similarity. He said  Californians could look forward to continuity between Wilson and Deukmejian on  "fiscal stewardship" and in handling "the problems of crime and drug abuse."  </P> <P> Asked how his governorship might make a difference in Sacramento, Wilson  attacked the partisan nature of today's Capitol politics. "I think the public  is sick to death of it," he said.  </P> <P> What would he do?  </P> <P> "Well in a nonpartisan way I'd try to bring in a Republican majority," he  cracked, but offered nothing else.  </P></p>

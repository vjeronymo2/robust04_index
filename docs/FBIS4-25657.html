			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Hui-chen and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, June 13 (CNA) -- All three men charged  with robbing and murdering 32 people, including 24 Taiwan  tourists, aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake March 31 were  sentenced to death by the Hangzhou intermediate people's court  Sunday [12 June].    The verdict, delivered during a 30-minute ceremony,  completed  the trial, referred to by victims' relatives in Taiwan as a  "sham" and "nothing but a skit."    Announcing the verdict, prosecutors said the suspects robbed  the tourists, killed them and blew up the boat. They called the  crime serious and handed down two death sentences for each of  the three men.    The evidence in the case, the prosecutors said, included  reports prepared by public security police, written testimonies  by witnesses and a videotape owned by a murdered Taiwan tourist  discovered at the home of Wu Lihong, one of the three suspects.    According to Mainland China's criminal codes, the three  defendants -- Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun -- have three  days to appeal their sentences.    The fourth suspect, Wu Liming, who was prosecuted on charges  of harboring goods stolen in the attack, was sentenced to three  years in jail Monday. Wu Liming is a military police officer  and the elder brother of Wu Lihong.    Huang Chin-kun, one of the victims' Taiwan relatives, called  the death sentences predictable. However, he said, many  questions raised by the relatives and Taipei's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF), a conduit for communications between the two  sides of the Taiwan Strait, remained unanswered.    None of the Taiwan relatives appeared at the court to  protest  Beijing's decision to limit access to the trial and they did not  want to give the impression that they were endorsing the  verdicts, which they said they "will never accept."    Chuang Shu-fang, another relative, said judging from the  videotapes of the trial, she doesn't believe the three suspects  are the real murders.    The tapes showed that Hu Zhihan consulted his notes when  answering questions and Wu Lihong even smiled during the trial.  "How can a murderer forget what he has done and smile at a crime  as heinous as this one," Chuang asked.    After the trial, SEF's Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-you  expressed his indignation at the mainland's continuing refusal  to talk with SEF about compensation for victims' relatives and  signing an agreement securing Taiwan travelers' security in the  mainland.    The Qiandao Lake incident occurred on March 31 when 32  people  were murdered and robbed aboard a pleasure boat ferrying them  across the Zhejiang Province lake. Beijing did not publicize  the incident until two days later and did not admit the deaths  involved foul play until Taiwan threatened to review the fragile  cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / CBI welcome for 'changed' Labour Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the CBI, yesterday underlined Labour's growing appeal to traditional Tory voters by calling on business leaders to pay serious attention to the party's economic policies. In a speech to business leaders in London, Mr Davies said that Labour had 'changed in important ways' and was now willing to talk to business leaders constructively. His comments came as Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour leadership, underlined once again his commitment to turn Labour into the party of 'law and order'. Delivering the Police Foundation lecture at London's Guildhall, Mr Blair said that his party's strategy to combat crime would be based on restoring the sense of responsibility and respect among, in particular, young people. In government, Labour would seek to provide the opportunity for individual self-advancement but with that chance would come the 'duties of citizenship' Disparaging the government's police reforms, Mr Blair said effective policing depended on the re-establishment of strong and effective links between police, local authorities, business and other organisations rooted in local communities. Other agencies should share responsibility with the police to create a 'proper partnership against crime'. Mr Davies said that the party still had a number of policies with which the CBI disagreed, such as its commitment to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and a statutory minimum wage. In one of the strongest indications yet of the rapprochement between Labour and industry, Mr Davies said: 'It seems likely we shall be facing a Labour leadership without any baggage from previous episodes in power, and with a set of economic policies rather different from those which held sway in the people's party for most of the 1980s.' He added: 'It would be churlish not to recognise that the Labour party has changed in important ways, and is offering a set of policies which, at the very least deserve our attention. We shall give it.' High street spending, Page 11</p>

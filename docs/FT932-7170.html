			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Citicorp plea for O&amp;Y denied A US bankruptcy court yesterday denied a motion by Citicorp, the US bank, to appoint a 'responsible officer' to run the US unit of Olympia and York, the troubled property developer, but said it would appoint an examiner to call up a 'protocol' agreement to consider creditor consent, Reuter reports. Citicorp and other unsecured creditors wanted Mr John Zucotti, president of O&amp;Y in the US, to be named either a responsible officer or trustee.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: NEW BEVERLY WILSHIRE  </P> <P> I ordered the chicken in a pot. The waiter stood rigid, shaking his head. "I'm  not telling you not to order it . . . " he said, although clearly he was.  "That's left over from the old menu -- we just put it there for people who  remember the old restaurant."  </P> <P> For people who don't, he seemed to be saying, there were better things. And  there were: the food at the new Dining Room in the Regent Beverly Wilshire  Hotel, 9500 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, (213) 275-5200 is surprisingly  modern for such a stuffy setting. The room has been redone so that it is all  dark woods and painted walls, but the menu is pure California-French. You can  eat ravioli of ricotta and artichokes, lobster salad made with apples and sweet  corn, grilled Norwegian salmon with Chinese mustard. Order roasted chicken and  it comes with a wonderful puree of parsnips, a little spinach cake and a sprig  of rosemary.  </P> <P> And, of course, if you don't want to eat that sort of stuff, there's always  chicken in a pot.RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

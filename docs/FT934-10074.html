			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Athens to strengthen ties in Balkans THE Greek foreign minister, Mr Carolos Papoulias, yesterday started a tour of Balkan capitals aimed at underlining Greece's commitment to stability in the region. Greece's new Socialist government is anxious to repair relations with its Balkan neighbours, which were damaged by the emergence of a strongly nationalist faction in the previous administration. Mr Papoulias will be sounding out his counterparts on how their links with the European Community could be improved when Greece takes over the EC presidency in January. Greece is particularly keen to restore ties with Albania, where the government has stepped up discrimination against the ethnic Greek minority. In Belgrade today, Mr Papoulias will come under pressure from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to try to get UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia eased. However, Greece's stated aim of becoming a force for regional stability is viewed with suspicion by western partners, given the new government's decision to maintain its predecessor's close relationship with Serbia. Moreover, Mr Papoulias has not included Skopje, the Macedonian capital, in his visits.</p>

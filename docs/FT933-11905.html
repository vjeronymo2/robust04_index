			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: The curtain may fall on Wagner's piano maker LEGENDARY German piano maker C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik, whose instruments are used in many of the world's top concert halls, has filed for bankruptcy, according to its manager, Mr Karl Schulze, Reuter reports from Berlin. He confirmed reports that the 140-year-old Berlin company, whose early customers included composers Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Claude Debussy, faced liquidation because of heavy losses, falling sales and the refusal of banks to provide new loans. However, Mr Schulze said he hoped the company, which employs 68 people, could still be saved by the state government of Berlin. The Berlin economics ministry said it was considering whether it could help by providing loan guarantees, taking a stake in Bechstein, or buying property from it. Mr Schulze, the main shareholder, would not say how much Bechstein was losing. However, he told a German newspaper sales had fallen by DM3m to DM20.8m (Dollars 12m) in 1992 and were expected to reach only DM15m this year. Bechstein, which competes with Steinway of the US and Austria's Boesendorfer at the top end of the piano market, made 350 grand pianos and 600 upright pianos last year. Mr Schulze said that, with total worldwide sales of pianos plummeting to around 600,000 a year from 1m in 1990, Bechstein had abandoned plans to increase production this year. The company was established in 1853 by Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Bechstein. It quickly established a worldwide reputation and, by 1910, made nearly 5,000 instruments a year and employed 1,100 people. The company remained in the hands of the Bechstein family until the 1960s, when it sold shares to the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company of the US. Baldwin became owner in 1973 but sold the company in a management buy-out in 1986.</p>

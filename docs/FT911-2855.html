			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar firmer ahead of G7 THE DOLLAR finished towards the top of the day's range in Europe yesterday, boosted by hopes of a US economic revival and by a higher than expected inflationary indicator. This could deter the Federal Reserve from easing its monetary stance. Trading was subdued ahead of this weekend's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Washington. Dealers believe that the G7 will have difficulty agreeing on interest rate policy, at a time when the US is pushing for lower rates, to stimulate world growth, while Germany is struggling to solve economic problems caused by unification and to support a weak D-Mark. Nevertheless the market was cautious in case the meeting arrives at new measures to stem any further advance by the dollar. Hopes of an economic revival in the US improved after Mr Michael Darby, US commerce undersecretary, said the recession is expected to reach a trough and give way to a recovery during the present quarter. It was announced yesterday that first quarter gross national product fell by 2.8 per cent, compared with 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. This was a slightly sharper fall than expected, but more importance was placed on news that the implicit price deflator, an indication of US inflation, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent in the first quarter, against 2.8 per cent in last year's fourth quarter. This may keep the Fed cautious about cutting interest rates, according to dealers, but the figure was largely caused by higher oil prices ahead of the Gulf war, and this situation has now been reversed. Consumer prices fell in March for the first time in five years. At the London close the dollar had advanced to DM1.7545 from DM1.7470; to Y138.15 from Y138.00; to SFr1.4785 from SFr1.4655; and to FFr5.9200 from FFr5.8900. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index rose to 66.8 from 66.7. Sterling maintained a soft tone, easing from third to fourth strongest in the European exchange rate mechanism, but dealers said Thursday's talk of a crisis was misplaced. They indicated that the pound will remain vulnerable to selling in the run-up to Thursday's local government elections in England and Wales. This is regarded an an important test of the ruling Conservative Party's popularity, and a possible guide to the timing of a general election. Sterling fell 80 points to Dollars 1.6860. It also declined to DM2.9575 from DM2.9600 and to Y233.00 from Y233.75, but rose to FFr9.9800 from FFr9.9775 and to SFr2.4925 from SFr2.4825. The pound's index was unchanged at 90.8.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Soft targets Remember the promise to balance the budget over the cycle? Or the vehement assertion of no devaluation? Well, now the chancellor has presented us with a formal inflation target. As of August, the UK did not meet it. Today's figures for September may conceivably fall within the range, but only just, despite the severity of the recession. The rest of yesterday's statement contained little new to fill the policy vacuum. The government has left itself free to look at everything and pay attention to nothing in deciding policy, though, as the markets had already come to suspect, there is clearly no chance now of a dash for growth. That is not encouraging for equities, though it should be positive both for sterling and for the long end of the gilt market which duly responded by rallying a point. While the chancellor's fumbling presentation leaves a great deal unanswered about the longer term policy mix, the inflation threat from devaluation will remain muted while economic activity remains so depressed. Any immediate blip in prices can be excused, as the Treasury statement implies, on the grounds of changing terms of trade. There is time to sort out the budget, especially from behind the shelter of relatively high interest rates. The real credibility test for the inflation target will come only after recovery has begun. The government would need a better articulated and more predictable policy. Then again, there is perhaps no hurry. Devaluation may have made UK exports more competitive, but overseas markets are weak. Mr Lamont has not done much yet to secure growth.</p>

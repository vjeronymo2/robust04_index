			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology: Driving through the border lines - Europe's cellular phone network is poised to cross national frontiers Good news is on the way for car telephone users in Europe who find their phones stop working as soon as they drive over a national border into an incompatible network. From the beginning of next month, the first commercial examples of a new generation of cellular telephones, able to receive and make calls anywhere in Europe, come on sale in France and Germany. They are based on a common European standard, called GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), to be phased into full operation over the next five years in the 17 countries that have agreed to use the GSM norm. The current patchwork of six conflicting regional systems will, for the time being, continue alongside the new network. It is no surprise that France and Germany are the first to introduce GSM. They badly need to catch up. A large number of businessmen and women cross their long frontiers regularly and yet both countries have among the lowest use of cellular phones in Europe, well behind Britain, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries. GSM, a digital transmission system, is radically different from the current analogue generation in that it delivers ultra-clear sound and a range of clever functions. In addition, a GSM phone can be plugged into a fax machine, a computer or even a teletext terminal like France's Minitel system without a modem. Each subscriber has a smart card which stores personal information. This is slotted into the phone to make it work. The card, rather than the terminal, contains the subscribers' telephone number and tells the operator where to send bills. If necessary, a subscriber can leave his phone at home and rent or borrow a portable one, whether in a taxi or someone else's office. The card can also be programmed so that calls can be forwarded. Incoming calls can be held while the phone is engaged, and outgoing or incoming calls can be barred. Baptised 'Itineris' in France, the system is being launched by France Telecom in Paris and Lyon from July 1, with the German system to follow a week later. France Telecom plans to cover three more cities by the end of the year and 90 per cent of France by 1995. SFR, the French private sector cellular phone operator, plans to unveil its own GSM system shortly. Itineris phones, initially supplied by Orbitel, Nokia and Motorola, sell for between FFr10,000 (Pounds 1,000) and FFr15,000, slightly cheaper than existing cellular phones. Prices could even halve in the next five years as European sales grow and allow the producers of terminals to achieve economies of scale, predicts Marcel Roulet, president of France Telecom. Clearly, it is too early to say how Itineris will go down with the French public. The coming year will be for 'technical evaluation', with commercial take-off likely in 1993, believes Roulet. Already, technical experts point to two possible improvements. Some users, they fear, might be baffled by the big choice of functions, so some form of automatic guidance would be desirable, like the help function on a computer program. Second, because equivalent chips on GSM smart cards and existing French telephone charge cards are positioned differently, it will be impossible in the future to use the same bit of plastic for both. However, GSM should avoid the capacity limits imposed by the shortage of radio frequencies, which affects the two analogue networks, France Telecom's Radio 2000 and SFR. Instead, digital technology will increase capacity in the European countries that have applied the standard to 20m, compared with just 3.4m subscribers now. On the strength of this, France Telecom believes that around a fifth of its income from telephone charges will come from cellular services by the end of the decade.</p>

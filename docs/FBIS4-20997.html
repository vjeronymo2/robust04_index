The former councilor arrested in the Philippine National  Police Narcotics Command "buy-bust" operation is Carlo Tinsuan,  who was caught redhanded with 10 grams of shabu (methamphetanine  hydrochloride); and the PNP official who was also arrested is  Chief Inspector Renato Panafiel, Jr., 42, of the PNP-SAF,  residing at Block 51, Lot 14, Soldiers Hill Subdivision,  Muntinglupa.    The PNP official arrested by the men of the Intelligence and  Investigation Unit of the Makati Police was caught in the act of  repacking the prohibited drug, shabu, in a cubicle at Topaz  hydro massage on Yakal Street, Makati, at about 7:30 yesterday  morning.    The raiding team confiscated 16 grams of the prohibited  shabu, 100 pieces of plastic pouches, and shabu paraphernalia.    Inspector Bernardo confirmed receiving information to the  effect that Penafiel often went to the said hydro massage parlor  in order to distribute the said shabu to the lady attendants.    Likewise, according to NARCOM director Senior Superintendent  Ramsey Ocampo, after the suspect Carlo Tinsuan was arrested, the  Narcotics Authorities seized the owner-type jeep he was driving,  and, in addition, 10 more grams of shabu were found.    It was learned during the course of the investigation that  the 34-year-old Tinsuan was surrounded by NARCOM men after he  delivered prohibited drugs to one of the agents in front of the  Smokey Restaurant in Muntinglupa.    Ocampo stated that the South Metro District Unit of the  NARCOM laid the trap last Tuesday in a hotdog house in  Muntinglupa.    Currently Tinsuan is being held in the National Bilibid  Prison Reservation Area in Muntinglupa at the NARCOM  headquarters in Camp Crane.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Radio Ukraine World Service has received the text of  a statement by Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. It says:    An act of terrorism was committed at the Markale market in  central Sarajevo on Saturday, 5 February, leaving dozens of  innocent people dead and hundreds injured. The Foreign Affairs  Ministry of Ukraine resolutely condemns this act of terrorism  that has considerably aggravated tension in the Balkans, at a  moment when parties interested in the settlement of the  Yugoslavian problem are involved in an intensive search for ways  toward a peaceful solution to the crisis in the region.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry appeals to the United Nations  for a detailed investigation into the tragedy in Sarajevo and  urges the warring sides to call an immediate cease-fire, get  down to the negotiating table, exercise political will, and do  their best to prevent the Sarajevo events of 5 February causing  an escalation of military confrontation in the Balkans and  provoking a geographical expansion of the conflict.    This act of terrorism once again raises the issue of the  need  for an all-around examination of the Balkan crisis and a  comprehensive approach to its settlement.</p>

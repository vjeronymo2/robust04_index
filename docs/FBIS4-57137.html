			<p>BFN     [Text] Following orders given about a month ago by Oscar  Alberto Ramirez Durand, now known by his followers as "President  Feliciano," members of the self-styled "Red Path" dissident  Shining Path faction have implemented a plan that seeks to  recover their strategic balance.    As is well known, this strategic balance was lost with  Abimael Guzman's fall and with the disruption of the leaderships  of the central, permanent, and political committees that were in  charge of leading the subversive war.    This is the conclusion of a report drafted by intelligence  analysts and strategists after talking with Shining Path members  at the grassroots and leadership levels, who availed themselves  of the Repentance Law and who are now important collaborators in  the struggle against narcoterrorism.    Opposed to Gonzalo's [Abimael Guzman's] leadership, "Red  Path" is made up of groups that have been acting independently  for several years with the support of narcotraffickers located  in the coca-growing corridor established in the jungle area  going from Amazonas to La Convencion (Cusco), and more recently  part of Madre de Dios (Manu).    Based on confessions made by repentant Shining Path members,  it has been established that the "Red Path" is striving to  reactivate seven areas in the outskirts of Lima that before  Guzman's fall were controlled by Shining Path and were  considered red areas. Area residents were constantly harassed  and did not dare to erase the so-called "people's bulletin  boards" (subversive graffiti). And even less to report them,  despite knowing who they were.    These areas were El Carmen, Collique, and Ano Nuevo (Comas);  the former Bocanegra ranch (Callao); the San Cosme, El Pino, El  Agustino (La Victoria), and Canto Grande (San Juan de  Lurigancho) hills; Sectors 1 and 4 (Villa El Salvador);  Huachipa, Ate-Vitarte (Central Highway); and Villa Maria del  Triunfo and San Juan de Miraflores, which form a single bloc.  This is where the Red Path faction members want to return.    Repentant Shining Path leaders, who have presented  themselves  at the 303d Battalion at the Huallaga Front and at other  barracks throughout the country, have reported that Ramirez  Durand, taking partial advantage of the campaign against the  Army in view of alleged human rights violations, is trying to  prevent a vast sector of Lima shantytown residents and some  peasant communities from identifying themselves with the  democratic system of government and the democratic state.    To do that, an effort would be made in those sectors --  called the masses by Ramirez Durand -- to create a generalized  environment of insecurity and fear of the Armed Forces.  Therefore, distorted cases of human rights violations have been  reported, such as the report that the Army was bombing towns  which were in reality a few shacks used by coca growers and drug  traffickers as refuge.    He also ordered -- we saw that in the last few weeks, the  repentant subversives said -- the intimidation and murder of  popular leaders in the settlements to gradually take over the  positions of leadership so as to be able to take control over  the population. He also wants to get a number of rural  settlements in the Lima area to passively accept the now-called  "Red Path," as happened in the past with the Shining Path.    The repentant subversives said Ramirez Durand's  recommendations include the reactivation of popular theaters and  folk music groups, and the infiltration of work centers,  especially in the factories located on the central highway where  a few years ago, on orders from Abimael Guzman, anti-Shining  Path union leaders and executives were murdered.    In this regard, intelligence sources indicated that the  Shining Path members who had infiltrated some factories, and who  after Abimael Guzman was captured, have been keeping a low  profile, would again become active in planning to take over the  unions and create chaos.    According to political analysts, what Ramirez Durand does  not  seem to understand is that it is only possible to reach a  strategic equilibrium before the turning point of the war, and  never after. In other words, when the struggle is on its way to  victory, and never, as it is happening with the Shining Path,  when it is obviously on its way to defeat.    The experts say that no matter how many attacks are carried  out by terrorism, they will not frighten the population and will  under no circumstances win their support, as, according to the  latest surveys made by intelligence circles, the people who  migrated from the subversive areas reject the subversive  ideology. For example, the recent murder of boxer Carlos  Lavalle Gonzales and other leaders has only created greater  repudiation of the Shining Path.    In view of a new offensive, intelligence strategists  recommend the reinforcement of the self-defense committees in  the outskirts of Lima, with the support of the Armed Forces.    The analysts believe that the reinforcement of the urban  defense patrols and night watches, and a better rapprochement  with political and military authorities, will help reject any  maneuver aimed against the democratic system. Now, in contrast  with the past, the state and society have shown they are capable  of defeating subversion.</p>

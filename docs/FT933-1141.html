			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / ANC bid for deal with white extremists THE African National Congress said yesterday it would intensify efforts to strike a deal with right-wing whites to ensure that they participate in next year's multi-racial elections and reduce the threat of right-wing violence. The ANC and the white right-wing Afrikaner Volksfront have held a series of meetings in recent weeks to discuss right-wing demands for an Afrikaner homeland, but have made only limited progress. 'The desire by the Afrikaner Volksfront to have an area demarcated as a Volkstaat for Afrikaner people, where Afrikaners will be able to survive as a nation, was tabled for frank and forthright discussions,' the two sides said yesterday in an unusual joint statement. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, has often said that the ANC is prepared to accommodate the demand for Afrikaner self-determination, by devolving many central government powers to a region where Afrikaners would have a significant presence. ANC officials said privately they would be willing to draw up regional boundaries to maximise Afrikaner support in one region, probably in the Eastern Transvaal. But Afrikaners would not be in the majority and would not control the government; there was no question of an independent ethnic state for Afrikaners. But they hoped that such a region could allay Afrikaner fears of a black-dominated South Africa, by providing an area where white political power would not be completely diluted. However, major differences remain between the two sides, with the Afrikaner Volksfront insisting that non-Afrikaners would hold an inferior form of citizenship in their proposed state, a demand which the ANC vehemently rejects. Talks are at an early stage and have not yet focused on detailed maps of where the proposed state would be situated, or what powers it would exercise. The two sides also disagree on a definition of self-determination. The gap between the two sides is likely to prove difficult to bridge, but officials from both the ANC and government see the effort to do so as crucial to avoiding civil war in South Africa. The ANC is particularly keen to accommodate the Afrikaner Volksfront, the relatively moderate wing of the white right, in an attempt to split Volksfront members away from the ultra-radical Conservative party. The ANC is also trying to prevent a threatened alliance between the radical right and Inkatha.</p>

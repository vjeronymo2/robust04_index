			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut] </F>   [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- AL-NAHAR has learned that an  internal dialogue among Palestinian factions that support and  oppose the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is currently taking  place inside and outside the occupied territories. The aim of  this dialogue is to reach a draft joint agreement on unity in  view of the conditions that will prevail in the occupied  territories during the coming stage.    Fatah has invited all Palestinian political and militant  forces to a comprehensive national dialogue. The invitation,  extended by Ahmad Ghunaym, head of Fatah's office in Jerusalem,  during a commemorative ceremony for martyr Khalil al-Wazir,  said: We invite our brothers in Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], the Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, the People's Party, FIDA [Palestinian  Democratic Union], and all our national movements to a  comprehensive dialogue in order to affirm that this homeland  does not belong to one organization but to the entire people.

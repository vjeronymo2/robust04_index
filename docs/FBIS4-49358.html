			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 4 (XINHUA) -- A group of Chinese  students and scholars in the United States and worldwide wrote  recently to U.S. President Bill Clinton, appealing to him to  extend the Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status to China.    722 Chinese students and scholars put their signatures to  the  letter released here today.    They said in the letter that "cancelling China's MFN status  would hurt American business interests and opportunities in  Chinese markets as well as American general interests in Asia."    They expressed their strong support for the unconditional  renewal of MFN status to China and pointed out that the MFN  should not be linked to human rights.    They said they have been very pleased to realize that the  U.S. and China have been improving their cooperation and mutual  understanding on many issues.    "We have been very proud to witness that China has been  working with the U.S. on many of these issues and providing  significant contributions to human civilization on this earth,"  they also said.    They noted that "we continue to believe a view, shared by  many outstanding Americans, that a good relationship between the  U.S. and China will continue to serve the best national  interests of these two great countries."</p>

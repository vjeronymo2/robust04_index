Article 2 According to the state industrial policy and plans  for the development of various trades, the state will enforce  the quota system in line with international customs for certain  commodities imported to meet domestic needs and to adjust market  supply; but the import of those commodities in excess quantity  may seriously obstruct the development of related industries in  our country, which may directly influence the adjustment of  import and production structures, and which may endanger the  state's foreign exchange stabilization.    Article 3 The general commodities mentioned in these  procedures are all commodities which need to be controlled by  import quotas with the exception of mechano-electrical products.    Article 4 The State Planning Commission will be in charge of  macrocontrol and coordination of import quotas for general  commodities according to the national economic development plan  and the state industrial policy. The State Planning Commission  may forward opinions in coordination with other concerned  departments on adjustment of categories of general commodities  to be controlled by import quotas and the change will be  announced and implemented after State Council approval.    Article 5 The total annual import quota for a general  commodity will be suggested by the State Planning Commission in  coordination with concerned departments according to the state's  foreign exchange situation, the need for industrial and  agricultural production at home, market demand, and the need for  state security and environmental protection. After State  Council approval, the total amount will be included in the  annual national economic and social development plan. The State  Planning Commission will allocate the amount to various units  according to the actual economic development situation and  production and construction needs in various localities and  departments.    Article 6 Under State Planning Commission guidance, various  provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and cities with  independent economic decision-making authority, and  administrative organizations designated by concerned departments  of the State Council ("regional and departmental organizations  for the administration of import quotas for general commodities"  will be used in following articles for short) will be in charge  of the management and coordination of import quotas for general  commodities in their respective localities and departments, will  make a consolidated study on the need for import quotas for  general commodities in their respective localities and  departments, and will submit a balanced report to the State  Planning Commission. Within the amount of quota allocated by  the State Planning Commission, they will examine the  applications for import quotas from various enterprises under  the jurisdiction of those localities and departments.    Article 7 Enterprises which need import quotas of general  commodities (productive and other enterprises which have been  approved by the state for registration with industrial and  commercial departments and have legal person status) should make  applications to regional and departmental organizations for the  administration of import quotas for general commodities.    Article 8 When applying for an import quota for general  commodities, an enterprise shall report to the relevant  department for the administration of import quotas for general  commodities relevant data such as the use of the quota, payment  ability, and actual quota fulfillment in the previous year.    Article 9 Upon receiving an application from an enterprise,  a department administrating import quotas for general  commodities shall, in line with the number of quotas issued by  the State Planning Commission, examine and verify the  enterprise's use of an import quota and its import payment  ability, and issue a certificate of import quota to the  enterprise in accordance with its actual production and  operational ability and by referring to the amount of quota  issued to it the previous year. In case an import quota is not  to be issued, the organ for administrating import quotas for  general commodities of a region or a department shall, within 20  days, notify the enterprise applying for an import quota.    Article 10 Effective seals used on certificates of import  quotas for general commodities shall be the "special seals for  import quotas for general commodities" issued by the State  Planning Commission.    Article 11 After receiving an import quota certificate from  a quota administrative organ, authorized import enterprises may  operate independently; those not authorized to engage in  importing may conduct their dealings with foreign countries by  entrusting authorized foreign trade enterprises. On the basis  of import quota certificates, enterprises shall apply for an  import permit with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation [MOFTEC] or its designated permit-issuing organs.  Customs shall conduct its inspections on the basis of import  permits.    Article 12 General commodities imported for processing and  re- exporting enterprises and transshipment enterprises shall be  subject to quota control; customs shall supervise the  importation of these commodities in accordance with relevant  provisions.    Article 13 General commodities which are imported by foreign  investment enterprises as their investment but which are subject  to quota control shall be handled in accordance with existing  state investment laws and regulations. General commodities  which are imported for the manufacture of products to be  marketed domestically but which are subject to quota control  shall be included in the national plan for the total amount of  commodities to be subject to import quota control and  administered by the MOFTEC according to existing state laws and  regulations.    Article 14. For general commodities which are to be imported  as gifts but which are subject to import quota control, their  import formalities shall be handled in accordance with relevant  state provisions, in accordance with the subordinate  relationship of the receiving units, and on the basis of these  procedures, following approval by a competent department.    Article 15 For general commodities which are to be imported  with loans from foreign governments or international monetary  organizations but which are subject to import quota control,  their import formalities shall be handled in accordance with the  subordinate relationship of the project contracting units and on  the basis of these procedures.    Article 16 Should any of the following situations occur,  importing units shall be regarded as violating these procedures:  1) signing contracts with foreign firms for the delivery of  goods without applying for an import quota certificate in  accordance with these procedures; 2) arbitrarily altering or  forging import quota certificates; 3) arbitrarily transferring  or selling import quota certificates for profit; or 4) violating  the "Interim PRC Regulations Governing the Permit System for  Imported Goods."    Article 17 Violators of these procedures shall be handled by  customs in accordance with the "PRC Customs Law" and the "PRC  Rules for the Implementation of the Customs Law Concerning  Administrative Punishment." If the circumstances are  particularly serious, violators of the law shall be made  accountable for their criminal responsibility according to the  law.    Article 18 Import administrative personnel who have  neglected their duty, practiced favoritism or fraud, or abused  their power shall, depending on the seriousness of their  offense, be meted out administrative punishment by supervisory  departments, and shall be made accountable for their criminal  responsibility if they have violated the law.    Article 19 The State Planning Commission shall be  responsible for interpreting these procedures and for organizing  their implementation.    Article 20 The provisions of these procedures shall apply if  past relevant provisions are in conflict with their provisions.  These procedures shall go into effect on 1 January 1994.</p>

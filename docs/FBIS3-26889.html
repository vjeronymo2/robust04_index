This is another positive step in the  Palestinian-Israeli peace process following the agreement on  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, which was signed between the two  sides in Washington last year.    The "Cairo Document" was hard-won. As everybody knows, since  the Palestinian-Israeli Principled Declaration went into effect,  the two sides have set up four committees responsible for  holding talks to implement the autonomy accord. Owing to the  three major obstacles -- control of passage, the Jericho area,  and security in the settlement sites -- the Palestinian-Israeli  talks, especially those on troop withdrawal and security  arrangements, were on and off and almost came to a standstill,  so that Israel was unable to begin withdrawing its troops as  scheduled. Over the past few months, Palestinian and Israeli  leaders took various opportunities to meet in Cairo, Oslo,  Paris, Grenada, and Davos in a bid to break the stalemate and  stop dragging on without a solution. Although some progress has  been made in these meetings, no agreement could be reached  because of the relatively wide differences between the two sides  on the above issues. The current Cairo talks also experienced  hardships and difficulties. It has been learned that President  Mubarak positively acted as a mediator to help them out of the  predicament five times in succession, in order to diminish their  differences and enable the talks to go on. After nine rounds of  marathon talks, an agreement on a number of crucial issues has  finally been reached. The initialing of the "Cairo Document" is  conducive to signing a final agreement between Palestine and  Israel and will also have a positive impact on pushing forward  the peace process in the Middle East and making progress in  other areas. Hence, it has been widely welcomed and seriously  heeded by public opinion throughout the world.    The "Cairo Document," which is more detailed and specific,  is  the first document toward the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli principled declaration. It is composed of  two agreements, which primarily involve the control of border  passage and security arrangements for the future Palestinian  autonomous regions. It covers several issues, including the  general principle on the passage control in Gaza and Jericho,  the external security during the transition period, the  supervision of passage control, entry and exit procedures for  the territory, the examination of passengers, and the  establishment of a liaison office. Although the "Cairo  Document" did not resolve all the security problems concerning  the future autonomous region and the Jewish settlement sites, it  has removed the major obstacles to the implementation of the  principled declaration. The signing of the document reflected  the spirit of trust, cooperation, flexibility, and accommodation  shown by the two sides. The PLO maintains: "Although the  "Cairo Document" failed to satisfy all the demands of the  Palestinian side, generally speaking, it is a good agreement."  The Israeli side has said that the "Cairo Document" takes its  security requirements into consideration and does not infringe  upon the dignity of the Palestinians."    Of course, the "Cairo Document" has also met with some  opposition. For example, Shamir, former leader of the  ultra-right-wing Likud and prime minister of Israel, called the  "Cairo Document" an "investment agreement," which, he said, has  ruined all the "fruits of victory" gained by Israel in the past  27 years and runs counter to Israel's future, security, and  interests.    The initialing of the "Cairo Document" does not mean that  the  Palestinian-Israeli peace train is now on the easy path, given  the great number of outstanding problems that are awaiting a  solution between the initialing of the document and the  conclusion of a final agreement. An example is the actual area  covered by the Jericho region and the Jewish settlement sites in  Gaza, which have not been determined up to now. Although  'Arafat has signed the map that indicates the scope of the  future Jericho autonomy, he still has some reservations on the  issue. The Israeli side promised to make its final decision  during the meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin. Also, the size and  power of the future Palestinian police and the role of the  electoral organs of the Palestinian autonomy have not been  defined, and the detailed rules regarding the transfer of  administrative power and the economic relations between  Palestine and Israel still require further negotiations. Even  though such problems and difficulties exist on the road of  implementing the Palestinian-Israeli principled declaration,  they will possibly discover relatively satisfactory ways of  settlement and achieve the anticipated goals, as long as both  sides continue to work assiduously for these aims.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described  as positive the statement by Stephen Oxman, U.S. assistant  secretary of state for European affairs, that human rights in  Albania are somewhat violated lately. Venizelos justified his  description of Oxman's statement by saying that the latest  statement improves on the one by State Department Spokesman  Michael McCurry. McCurry had said the United States has no  evidence regarding the violation of human rights in Albania.  Replying to a question, Venizelos said the Greek Government  believes there is a climate of tension and insecurity which  insults the human rights of the Greeks of Albania.</p>

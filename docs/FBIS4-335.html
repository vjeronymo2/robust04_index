			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] This morning Radio Pretoria's commentary will carry  the full text of a statement by the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front] on citizen protection. The statement  reads as follows:    The Boer Afrikaner community is three weeks away from an  event which has the potential of becoming a powder keg. This  event is the 27 April election. It is a deadly game. All  responsible observers both here and overseas have warned against  it. Members of the community and their leaders have a  tremendous responsibility, and time is very limited.    Get hold of existing citizen protection literatude for hints  as soon as possible. Become a close community. Mark the  information in these documents according to the changing  requirements in your community. The whole community must be  involved: the weak, such as children, the infirm, the aged; and  the strong and those who can defend their people. Remember the  key points, the places which need to be protected. These  include the schools, hospitals, nursery schools, and old-age  homes.    Check on your supplies -- not just food and fuel, but also  make sure you have sufficient medical supplies. Arrange for  proper emergency communication facilities such as walkie-talkies  and citizen band radios. Try to involve the total Boer  Afrikaner community in this citizen protection exercise -- the  worker, ambulanceman, doctor, nurse, chemist, priest, soldier,  policeman, bus driver, train driver, bank manager, farmer, and  miner. Get the whole community involved in exercises more than  once, if possible. The whole citizen network must become  involved. Be positive about the matter. Those who would like  you to believe this is not a serious matter do not have your and  your community's interests at heart. Do what you have to do  thoroughly and earnestly. Do it religiously and help to achieve  our own free homeland.</p>

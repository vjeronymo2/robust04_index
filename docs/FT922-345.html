			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Management: Keeping up to the mark 'BENCHMARKING' a company against its competitors is becoming a popular way of identifying management weaknesses, setting realistic targets and improving performance. However, one of the biggest obstacles to a benchmarking exercise is the difficulty of obtaining accurate information about competitors, particularly foreign ones. Ernst &amp; Young, the international management consultancy group, has launched a new service which aims to overcome this problem. The service has been built around the results of the International Quality Study which was commissioned by the American Quality Foundation last year. The study was based on a questionnaire sent to 550 companies in Canada, Germany, Japan and the US, in the motor, computers, banking and healthcare sectors. It generated a database containing 1.5m pieces of information. The questionnaire addressed more than 100 areas of management practices in business organisation, product and service development, delivery process and customer satisfaction, quality and strategic positioning, and corporate culture. As a result, Ernst &amp; Young claims it can now offer a benchmarking service, including a detailed report, which will allow companies to compare themselves with some of the best managed organisations in the world. The service is just one example of a recent proliferation of reports, books and conferences about benchmarking. Among the most practical reports are two* by Mohamed Zairi from the University of Bradford Management Centre in the UK. Competitive Benchmarking explains the concept, provides implementation guidelines and highlights the benefits while TQM-Based Performance Measurement discusses the shortcomings of existing measurement systems and gives examples of quality based measurements. *Competitive Benchmarking, Pounds 26.50, TQM-Based Performance Measurement, Pounds 25.95, from Technical Communications (Publishing).

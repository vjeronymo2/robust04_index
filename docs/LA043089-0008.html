			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Rude Boy (TMC Sunday at 11 p.m.): Jack Hazan's raw, scruffy 1980  semi-documentary film about an actual British working-class rebel who becomes a  roadie with a punk rock band. (2:10)  </P> <P> Show Boat (1936) (TNT Monday at 9 a.m.): This is the classic James Whale  version with Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, Charles  Winninger and Hattie McDaniel. (2:30)  </P> <P> The Conversation (HBO Monday at noon): Francis Coppola's complex, challenging  film about an electronic eavesdropper (Gene Hackman) who becomes the captive of  his own dark skills. (2:00)  </P> <P> Jet Pilot (Channel 13 Tuesday at noon): The legendary, long unreleased Howard  Hughes-Josef von Sternberg film maudit, a kind of Hell's Angels updated to the  Cold War, with John Wayne and Janet Leigh. (2:00)  </P> <P> Show People (Z Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.): King Vidor's wonderful 1928 silent,  offering a behind-the-scenes look at MGM at the height of its glory and  allowing Marion Davies a rare opportunity to display her considerable comic  gifts; William Randolph Hearst preferred to restrict her to tony costume  pictures. (1:30)  </P></p>

Stating this here Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar  Ibrahim said Malaysian companies would now have to renegotiate  with new contracting partners if they wanted to bid for such  projects in future.    The government's move would not, however, affect existing  two-way trade and investments between both countries, he told a  press conference after chairing the National Finance Council  meeting here.    The decision follows the government's concern over adverse  reports in certain British newspapers which suggested that some  Malaysian leaders were corrupt.</p>

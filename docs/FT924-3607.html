			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Economics: Recovery hopes rest on figures A SENSE that brighter news on the economy is lurking in the wings lifted spirits in the UK towards the end of last week, so today's consumer credit numbers will be looked at closely for further evidence of a recovery in retail sales. While the credit business series from the Central Statistical Office measures only about 15 per cent of total private sector debt, the numbers provide a useful snapshot of consumer behaviour. The forecast is for a small change in net consumer borrowing in October  - after September's net repayment of Pounds 60m. The release of the final cost of living figure for November in west Germany is also expected this week. The preliminary number, a year-on-year rise of 3.7 per cent, surprised economists. A modest downwards revision may be announced, but is unlikely to be steep enough to ease Bundesbank worries over inflation. Last week, Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, complained inflation was too high - and M3 growth continues to overshoot its 1992 target. This is also an important week for European politics. The Edinburgh summit starts on Friday. John Major, the prime minister, will want a successful summit at the end of the UK's troublesome 6 months at the presidency of the EC. Following are some of the other economic highlights of the week. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company. Unless stated otherwise, the figures are the month-on-month comparison.

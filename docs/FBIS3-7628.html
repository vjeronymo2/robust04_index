According to data available at the General Bureau of Textile  Industry, it grew 30 percent in the first two months of this  year or more above the same period last year. The output in 20  odd days of March was 2.4 million metres more than that in the  same period last month. That period in March witnessed a 19  percent gain in spinning yarn output.    Korea meets the demand of the population for textiles with  home products from long ago.    With his scientific penetration into the limitation of  cotton  production and favourable condition of chemical fibre production  in the country, the great leader President Kim Il-song put  forward a wise policy of building an independent and modern  textile industry by correctly combining textile industrial  branches using chemical fibre with those using other fibres,  with stress laid on the former. And he set forth a policy of  developing large scale central industry and medium- and  small-sized local industry in parallel and has wisely led the  work for its implementation.    Today the nation's textile industry has developed into a  versatile and mighty industry with chemical fibre, cotton, wool  and silk textile sectors, which are equipped with uptodate  technology and firmly rely on domestic raw materials.    Hundreds of large and minor spinning and textile mills are  operating in Pyongyang, Sinuiju, Sariwon, Hamhung and other  parts of the country. 30 metres of textiles went to each head  of the population already in 1970 in the country where per  capita textile output was 14 centimetres before the liberation  in August 1945. The annual textile output jumped to more than  800 million metres in the Second Seven-Year Plan period  (1978-1984).    In the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan (1987-1993),  modern and high-speed textile equipment was introduced and new  equipment was installed at the Pyongyang textile combine and the  Kusong, Sariwon and Kaesong textile mills, laying a solid  foundation for sharply increasing textile output.</p>

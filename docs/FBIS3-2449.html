Also included in the CPPCC Constitution will be guidelines  resulting from the recognition that China is at present in the  primary stage of socialism as well as China's reform goal of  establishing a socialist market economy, according to Hu Sheng,  a vice-chairman of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and one  of the vice-chairmen of a panel entrusted with revising the  constitution.    New developments in China cry out for a revision of the  CPPCC  Constitution, Hu said. In the wake of Deng Xiaoping's 1992  south China tour and the 14th National Congress of the Chinese  Communist Party, he said, a new tide of reforms has swept the  country and the national economy has been surging at an  unprecedented speed.    Furthermore, to conform better to the Constitution of China,  which was amended last year, a revision of the CPPCC  Constitution has become more urgent, Hu said.    "When all is said, the 1982 CPPCC Constitution is a good  one," he said. "What we'll do is only a partial revision."</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Japan to review profits burden Japan will review the tax burden on corporate profits as manufacturers shift their plants abroad to ride out the impact of the high yen, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister (left), said yesterday. 'It's inevitable the percentage of firms moving abroad will increase. We will review the taxation on corporate profits to this effect,' he told the tax reform committee of the lower house. Corporate taxes levied by Japanese regional governments were higher than in other leading industrial nations, he said.</p>

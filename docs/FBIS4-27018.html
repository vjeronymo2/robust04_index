			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Wen Jihua (2429 4949 5478): "China </F> Reaped Rich Diplomatic Results in First Half of This Year"]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Jun (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, a  military band again played stirring songs to welcome the guests  in the square outside the East Gate of the Great Hall of the  People. Here, President Jiang Zemin presided over a ceremony to  solemnly welcome Casam Uteem, president of Mauritius from Africa.    This marks the sixth time this month that People's  Liberation  Army's Honor Guard was reviewed by a foreign head of state. In  the first half of this year, they were reviewed by 26 foreign  heads of state including a South Korean President, French  Premier, Egytian President, and Russian Premier. The high  frequency of the military honor guard's appearance in front of  the Great Hall of the People is indeed rare in history. Seen  from another perspective, this reflects the bustling scene on  the Beijing diplomatic stage.    At the same time, Chinese leaders make frequent foreign  visits; their footprints can be found in every corner of the  world. Starting from 29 June, Premier Li Peng will make official  visits to Austria, Germany, and Romania, thus marking the sixth  foreign visit of the Chinese high-level leaders this year.    A peaceful international environment is an important  external  condition for China which is now engaged in the modernization  construction. And one of the important programs of China's  opening up to the outside world is to attract foreign funds,  technologies, and advanced management experience via cooperation  with foreign countries. Developing diplomatic, economic,  scientific, technological, and cultural relationship with  countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of  peaceful coexistence is in line with China's intermediate and  long-term interests. For that end, China vigorously explores  room for diplomatic maneuver and develops an omnidirectional  diplomacy.    Obviously, China has always given top priority to its  diplomacy on consolidating and expanding the good-neighborly  relationship with neighboring countries. At present, it has  succeeded in developing a harmonious and peaceful environment  with neiggboring countries. Its relations with peripheral  countries have entered the best period in history. Since the  beginning of this year, Beijing has received Azerbaijani  President Aliyev, who made his first trip to China, and Russian  Premier Chernomyrdin. Premier Li Peng visited four central  Asian countries and Mongolia and signed the Sino-Kazakh border  agreement and the Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperation  treaty which are of historical significance.    Constant exchange of high-level visits has been the salient  feature this year in the development of relations between China  and European countries. Presidents of Romania and Estonia and  premiers of Slovakia, Finland, France, and Portugal visited  China one after another. Qiao Shi, chairman of the National  People's Congress Standing Committee, and Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,  visited eight European nations. An excellent political  relationship creates a favorable condition for both sides in  developing mutually beneficial economic, trading, scientific,  and technological cooperation. China maintains a strong  development momentum with Western Europe in the area of economic  and trade cooperation. After experiencing a certain period of  sluggish growth, the economic and trade relationship with  countries in Eastern Europe has been restored and enhanced.    Also, in the first few months of this year, China achieved  new progress in its relations with Latin American countries. A  CPC Central Committee delegation headed by Hu Jintao, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee,  visited Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Presidents of Ecuador,  Suriname, and Peru visited China. Canadian Governor's visit to  China marked the full normalization of relations between the two  countries. The Canadian prime minister is expected to visit  Beijing this year.    Sino-U.S. relations have lately maintained the momentum of  improvement and development. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen  and Secretary of State Christopher, senior U.S. Government  officials, and congressmen visited China. China's Vice Premier  Zou Jiahua, State Councillor Song Jian, Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi were invited to visit the  United States. The Sino-U.S. Economic Joint Commission, the  Sino-U.S. Commerce and Trade Joint Commission, and the Sino-U.S.  Science and Technology Joint Commission resumed their work. At  end of May, President Clinton announced the extension of the  most-favored-nation [MFN] status to China and said that in the  future the United States would delink the human rights issue  from the MFN status when making annual review of the extension  of the MFN. This decision has created a favorable condition for  further enhancing and expanding economic and trade cooperation  and promoting the improvement and development of relations  between the two countries.    Lately, China's solidarity and cooperation with African  countries has been further consolidated. At the beginning of  this year, China restored diplomatic relations with Lesotho.  The end of the apartheid system in South Africa and the birth  of a new South Africa have created an excellent condition for  China to establish and develop friendly and cooperative  relations with South Africa.    In addition, China also vigororously pursues a multilateral  diplomacy and strives to increase cooperation with other  countries at the United Nations and at other international  organizations. At the United Nations Human Rights Committee's  50th annual session held last March, China, together with  countries which stand for justice and which support China, again  thwarted a small minority of Western countries' attempt to  interfere in China's internal affairs on the pretext of human  rights issue. This showed China's solidarity and cooperation  with a vast number of devleoping countries.    At present, Beijing is busy preparing for the successful  hosting of the Fourth World Women's Congress. Following the  signing of a package agreement of the Uruguay Round, China is  making unremitting efforts to attain the goal of becoming the  founding member country of the World Trade Organization.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / HK share prices boosted by China talks HONG KONG yesterday celebrated the end of the Sino-British political deadlock in traditional fashion, with the Hang Seng Index surging 371.53 points to a record high of 6,789.74. Local politicians displayed rather less optimism, however, that the four-day talks to be held by Britain and China would resolve the dispute over Hong Kong's political development, and Beijing issued further warnings indicating that the stock market reaction could be premature. A UK foreign office spokesman said Hong Kong's three representatives would join the negotiations with China on April 22 as equal members of the team, implying that Britain had won a diplomatic concession from the Chinese. However, Mr Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency - the official mouthpiece for China - yesterday declared that the Hong Kong representatives would merely adopt the role of advisers or experts, in accordance with China's initial demands. Regardless of the semantics, a stumbling block has clearly been overcome in allowing talks to be resumed. But as one Legislative Councillor said yesterday: 'It is possible that the gap between the two sides is still large. China wants the freedom to appoint its own lackeys, while the British want an honourable retreat.' Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said he was not optimistic about a resolution. But he argued that Mr Patten, the Hong Kong governor, appeared to have won an important procedural point, and had proven that Britain could successfully stand up to China. He said: 'Let us hope this is a sobering reminder to the China clique (so-called Foreign Office Sinophiles such as former Beijing Ambassador Sir Percy Craddock) that theirs is not the right way.' Foreign investors took more encouragement from the diplomatic breakthrough. Stock market turnover hit an all-time high of HKDollars 7.7bn (Pounds 652m) compared with the previous record of HKDollars 6.3bn set in May 1992. Brokers expected follow-through buying from London and New York to push the index further today. A resolution to the dispute would stimulate corporate earnings. It would spark an increase in property prices and provide the economic benefits of a go-ahead for several big infrastructure projects, which have become pawns in the political conflict. The most politically marked company in the stock market, Jardine Matheson - which in December was singled out by China as a 'bad element in Hong Kong's business community' - was the best performing blue chip stock of the day, climbing HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 55. Mr William Overholt, managing director of Bankers Trust (Hong Kong) said: 'I don't think that there is a view that things will go smoothly. But the Hong Kong community has now come to the conclusion that China will do nothing to harm Hong Kong. The basic fear of 1997 has evaporated.'</p>

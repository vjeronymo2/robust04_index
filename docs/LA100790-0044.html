			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNDREDS OF WOMEN COVER SPORTS  </P> <P> Fewer than half a dozen women writers covered professional football, baseball,  basketball and hockey in early 1970 and none were allowed in the locker rooms  to interview players. But by the mid-'70s, matters had changed, at least in  hockey and basketball.  </P> <P> Hockey reporter Robin Herman of the New York Times probably was the first  female journalist to interview players in the locker room while covering the  New York Islanders in 1973-74, said Tracy Dodds, vice president of the Assn.  for Women in Sports Media.  </P> <P> Now, the AWSM has almost 400 sportswriter members covering professional and  college sports, Dodds said, adding, "there are another 300 to 400 out there."  </P> <P> There had been few "reported" locker room problems for women until the Sept. 17  incident involving New England Patriot players and Boston Herald football  reporter Lisa Olson. "But I guarantee you, somewhere today, in college or pros,  some woman is being verbally abused and humiliated" in a locker room, said  Dodds, of the Orange County Register.  </P> <P> In 1974, the National Hockey League became the first pro sports organization to  institute an "equal access" policy for male and female sportswriters. NHL  locker rooms are open to accredited writers up to 90 minutes before games.  After games there is a 10-minute "cooling-off period" before the press is  permitted in the locker room, said the NHL's Michael Berger.  </P> <P> The National Basketball League developed "an open-door, equal-access policy"  for reporters in the mid-'70s, said the NBA's Terry Lyons. "We have simple  rules," he said, adding that the media are "allowed in (locker rooms) up until  45 minutes before a game. . . . We also have the 10-minute cooling-off period  after a game and it's worked quite well. We've had no incidents and no fines."  </P> <P> Major league baseball and the National Football League held out as "male only"  locker rooms until 1978 and 1985, respectively.  </P> <P> But in 1977, Melissa Ludtke, then a Sports Illustrated reporter covering the  New York Yankees in the World Series, was refused the clubhouse access given to  male sportswriters. Ludtke, Sports Illustrated and its parent, Time Inc., sued  the Yankees, alleging that Ludtke had suffered sex discrimination.  </P> <P> On Sept. 25, 1978, a federal judge ruled that barring women writers from locker  rooms violated the Constitution. She ordered the Yankees to protect players'  privacy while allowing equal access to male and female reporters. (The judge  suggested towels might help.)  </P> <P> In pro baseball, the league media policy allows all reporters access  "immediately after games," said a spokesman for the commissioner who did not  recall "in recent memory" fines for noncompliance.  </P> <P> Until 1985, NFL clubs developed their own policies on female reporters in  locker rooms. Since then, league policy allows locker room access to all  accredited reporters.  </P> <P> But Cincinnati Bengals coach Sam Wyche, who barred USA Today sports reporter  Denise Tom from his team's locker room after its Oct. 1 loss to the Seahawks in  Seattle, was fined $3,000 by the league last year for barring all reporters  from the locker room after another Seattle loss. Wyche also received a 1988  warning from former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle for limiting locker room  access.  </P> <P> Paul Tagliabue, the current commissioner, has said he will fine Wyche heavily  for the Monday incident. Tagliabue also has appointed a Harvard Law School  professor as special counsel to investigate Olson's sexual harassment  allegations against the Patriots.  </P></p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Judge deplores underwriters' failure to assess full extent of risk - The ruling which found that the three underwriters failed their Names The central issue before the High Court in the Gooda Walker case was whether the underwriters had been negligent in leaving their syndicates so heavily exposed to the series of catastrophes such as the Piper Alpha disaster that occurred in the 1980s. At the start of the case the Names argued that the Gooda Walker underwriters were negligent in leaving the syndicates so exposed. They said that the underwriters had failed to manage their businesses adequately by not properly monitoring their total exposure to risk, had failed to arrange sufficient reinsurance and had exercised insufficient care in dealings with the excess of loss 'spiral'. The Gooda Walker agents responded by arguing that the sequence of catastrophes was unprecedented and unforeseeable. They also argued that underwriting excess of loss cover - known as LMX - was an intrinsically high-risk business, that there was no obligation to reinsure all risks and that Lloyd's regulations did not oblige underwriters to calculate their total exposure, or 'probable maximum losses'. The three Gooda Walker underwriters whose actions were under scrutiny were Mr Derek Walker, Mr Stanley Andrews and Mr Anthony Willard. Mr Justice Phillips ruled that all three had failed to exercise the skill and care to be expected of competent underwriters. 'The growth of the LMX market in the 1980s and, in particular, the growth of the spiral business, raised special problems in relation to the assessment of risk, exposure and rating that called for special consideration. Some gave that consideration. The Gooda Walker underwriters did not.' The judge continued later: 'The exposure in respect of which I have held the underwriters at fault was culpable because it was unintended, unplanned and unjustified by any proper analysis of risk.' Their principle negligence was in failing to buy sufficient reinsurance protection, he ruled. The issues in the case fell into two main areas - the nature of competent underwriting practice in the Lloyd's market generally and how responsible underwriters should have approached excess of loss cover on existing excess of loss cover - the 'spiral'. Competent underwriting Mr Justice Phillips ruled that there are basic principles of insurance underwriting which should be adhered to: An underwriting account should be balanced in that all the risk should not be exposed to the same loss. He also rejected the agents' argument that Names should accept that, having agreed to unlimited liability, their underwriters could then deliberately expose them to such a risk. 'On the contrary, the Name will reasonably expect the underwriter to exercise due skill and care to prevent him suffering losses,' he said. If an underwriter intended to expose Names to periodic losses he must make sure that they were aware of this and the scale of the potential losses, he said. Accounts should be planned so an underwriter knows what he is doing, the judge said. This includes monitoring the total liabilities and probable maximum losses to which accounts are exposed. 'In my judgment, it was a fundamental principle of excess of loss underwriting that the underwriter should formulate and follow a plan as to the amount of exposure that his syndicate would run,' he said. Reinsurance policy. The judge ruled that an underwriter must know the exposure he intends to run and ensure that this is not exceeded. This should be done by having a proper reinsurance policy. Mr Justice Phillips rejected the agents' argument that LMX business was widely known to be high-risk. 'It is quite plain from the evidence before me that this was not the perception of LMX business shared by many of the defendants at the time. 'I have no doubt that there are many plaintiffs who would understandably have felt outraged had they heard the plea being advanced on behalf of their members agents that Names had no cause for complaint because the type of business they had chosen to write was well-known to be dynamite.' The spiral Mr Justice Phillips described the spiral - the complex arrangement under which catastrophe excess of loss risks were insured and reinsured, often many times - as 'rather like a multiple game of pass the parcel'. Those left holding the liability were those who first exhausted their layers of LMX reinsurance. The effect on individual syndicates was to magnify many times the impact of a particular loss, he said. The judge quoted the views on the spiral of Mr Richard Outhwaite, the underwriter who gave expert evidence for the agents, and his reluctance to write spiral business because of the exposure involved. 'In my judgment the Gooda Walker underwriters should have shared the appreciation of the spiral enjoyed . . . by Mr Outhwaite. No reason has been suggested by the defendants why the Gooda Walker underwriters should not have made the same appraisal of spiral business as Mr Outhwaite, and I can think of none.' His dismissed the agents' argument that the Gooda Walker underwriters should be judged according to the standards of competence of other participants in the spiral. 'Suppose a profession collectively adopts extremely lax standards in some aspect of its work. The court does not regard itself as bound by those standards and will not acquit practitioners of negligence simply because they complied with those standards.' Syndicates 290 and 164 Mr Justice Phillips ruled that Mr Derek Walker, the underwriter, deliberately ran exposures to risk without monitoring those exposures properly or informing Names of this. He made no attempt to estimate how often his Names might lose and failed to appreciate the level of catastrophe that risked such losses. His conduct amounted to a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable skill and care, the judge ruled. Syndicate 298 Mr Justice Phillips ruled that the performance of Mr Stanley Andrews, the underwriter for syndicate 298, fell 'far short of reasonable competence'. The judge said he could not believe Mr Andrews' evidence that he monitored his aggregate exposures, and his approach to buying reinsurance was unclear. Mr Andrews had said he believed the loss of Piper Alpha was 'unthinkable'. The judge ruled that his failure to properly assess cover for such a loss was negligent. Syndicate 299 Mr Justice Phillips ruled that Mr Anthony Willard, the underwriter for syndicate 299, did not mean to expose Names to big losses. However, he did not calculate probable maximum losses and so they formed no part of his reinsurance policy which proved unsound. Damages Having ruled in favour of the Names, Mr Justice Phillips finally had to rule ruled on the principles by which they should be awarded compensation. He rejected the Names' claim that they should be compensated for all the losses they suffered through their involvement with the Gooda Walker syndicates. Instead, damages should be based on the losses sustained from the negligent conduct in failing to arrange sufficient reinsurance, he ruled. He said: 'The plaintiffs are entitled to that award of damages which will place them in the same position as if the underwriting carried out on their behalf by each syndicate had been competently performed.'</p>

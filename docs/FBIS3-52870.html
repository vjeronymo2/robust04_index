In conversation, U.S. officials do not hesitate to brandish  the "terrorism list" that they prepared themselves and according  to which they have classified the world. They keep reminding  Syria that it remains on this list and that Hizballah and other  organizations working against the Israeli occupation of south  Lebanon are being directly supported by Damascus with the  blessing and nonobjection of Beirut.    With this two-faced stance the Americans are sitting on the  fence, as the popular saying goes. They are not opening the  door completely to Damascus and Beirut but they are not closing  it completely. In common parlance, this is called "blackmail"  or "bargaining." In politics it is called "gathering paper" and  "negotiating from a strong position."    It might be comprehensible and even logical for the Israelis  to resort to this method of dealing with an Arab party,  including Syria and Lebanon. But it is incomprehensible and  illogical for such behavior to come from the United States,  which presents itself sometimes as an "honest mediator" and at  other times as a "full partner" in the peace process. It is  also incomprehensible and illogical for successive U.S.  Administrations to continue this policy if they really want to  close the file of 50 years of war in the Middle East. Such a  policy leads to further Israeli intransigence and to keeping the  file open.    Assuming that the U.S. logic is correct, "Arab terrorism" is  new to the region. Given the age of the crisis and the wars it  has spawned, terrorism was first introduced by the Zionists.  Hizballah and the various Palestinian and non-Palestinian  organizations before it won't be the last if no "just,  comprehensive, and permanent" settlement is reached.    No one doubts the importance of this summit for settling the  Arab-Israeli conflict and for the future of the region in this  transitional phase in a world with one superpower. But the  world might see the reemergence of two superpowers, even three,  four, or five superpowers.    President al-Asad is the kind of leader who does not view  tomorrow as the next 24 hours, but measures it by decades and  generations in human history. This has always been his problem,  not only with the United States and the West, but also with his  Soviet friends.    The Geneva summit in one week's time might be an opportunity  for President Clinton, the leader of the sole superpower, to get  acquainted with President al-Asad's concept of Syria's "basic  role"--to which U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  referred yesterday--not only in a settlement, but in the  regional landscape after a settlement and under the new world  order.</p>

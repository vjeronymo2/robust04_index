			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'BAGDAD CAFE' FINE WITH WHOOPI  </P> <P> Whoopi Goldberg doesn't see moving from the stage and screen to a situation  comedy as a step down.  </P> <P> "As a girl from the projects, I'm not at all disappointed in the way things are  going.  </P> <P> This is what I've always dreamed about. And I'm still here, which is the  phenomenal thing," the comedian says in the April 9 issue of People magazine.  </P> <P> Goldberg, who went from an acclaimed one-woman Broadway show to the lead in  Steven Spielberg's movie "The Color Purple," stars with Jean Stapleton in  "Bagdad Cafe" on CBS.  </P> <P> "One thing I'm not is a flash in the pan," Goldberg said. "I have not done  anything I'm ashamed of. Things haven't always turned out the way I wanted, but  I did the best job I could. They (the critics) built Whoopi's image. I didn't."  </P></p>

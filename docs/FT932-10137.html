			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC challenge over US fuel economy tax THE EC is expected this week to call for a dispute settlement panel under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to take up a complaint over US environmental laws which tax cars heavy on fuel. According to Friends of the Earth, an international environmental organisation, the EC will initiate complaints against US corporate average fuel economy (Cafe) standards and the so-called 'gas-guzzler' tax. The Europeans are concerned that environmental requirements will affect the export of certain classes of EC cars to the US. In the US the fuel economy levels for corporate cars set an average fleet standard of 27.5 miles per gallon, and vehicles with a worse mileage are taxed. The 'gas-guzzler' tax penalises other passenger cars that achieve less than 22.5mpg. Should the US lose the case, it would be bound to raise as much of an outcry as the so-called 'tuna-dolphin' decision, arising from the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Under the act the US banned Mexican tuna caught with drift nets, which also trap dolphins. The EC is challenging the marine act as the US has imposed a secondary embargo on EC countries which may be trans-shipping 'dolphin-unsafe tuna'. Trade analysts worry that anti-environmental messages sent by Gatt could make it more difficult to get congressional approval of a completed Uruguay Round agreement. EC objections to the fuel economy law, the 'gas-guzzler' tax and a luxury car excise tax are listed in an EC report on US trade and investment barriers. 'Although the Cafe tax applies theoretically to virtually all car makers doing business in the US, in reality the only makers who have paid the penalty are the limited-line premium car makers,' the report says. 'The Cafe regulations are biased toward the full-line manufacturers (in other words, domestic manufacturers) that make both small, fuel-efficient and larger vehicles and limited-line manufacturers that produce mostly small vehicles (Japanese manufacturers). 'Thus, the only Cafe penalties paid thus far have been paid by European limited-line car makers. Full-line car makers, such as General Motors, have been able to meet the Cafe standards by averaging the fuel economy of small, fuel-efficient cars with large cars.' In a letter to Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Friends of the Earth challenged the 'secrecy' surrounding the EC action as 'unnecessary, undemocratic and unwise'. 'The EC cannot claim to be concerned about the development of the trade and environment debate if it persists in attempting to define. . .whether or not the environmental laws of another country are simply disguised trade barriers'.</p>

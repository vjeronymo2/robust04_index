			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Almond prices soar after Californian estimate is cut A SHARP downward revision in the estimate for this year's almond harvest in California has sent prices up by 10 per cent in 48 hours. The US Department of Agriculture in May estimated that the crop in California - by far the world's biggest supplier - would be 520m lb at harvest in September. But the first objective estimate in the Sacramento and San Joaquim valleys produced a figure of 470m lb. The price per tonne, which stood at Dollars 3,600 in January, has surged to Dollars 4,600 a tonne, traders said yesterday. One estimated that a further gain of Dollars 250 was possible. 'The big problem of the past few years has been oversupply,' said a leading London trader. 'That has now disappeared, and the coming crop will be very short.' In the past six years the crop has reached as high as 660m lb. Shipments from California, including those for US consumption, have averaged 530m lb. The sharp reduction in this year's crop is blamed on poor pollination in February because of wet weather. It came as stocks were 'at a bare minimum for the industry', the London trader said. Stocks in California are estimated at 56m lb, while unsold European stocks are around 1,000 tonnes. 'The balance of the old crop is very small,' said Mr Michael Becker, of Eurobroker, the Paris based broker of dried fruit and edible nuts. 'Total world supply is 10 to 15 per cent smaller than it was at this time last year.' He estimated European demand at up to 4,000 tonnes in the high season of August and September, when European manufacturers start to prepare for Christmas. New crop California almonds will not arrive in Europe until the end of September at the earliest.  ------------------------- Californian almonds    (million lb)  ------------------------- 1992         537 1991         486 1990         656 1989         489 1988         590 1987         660  ------------------------- Source: USDA  -------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear friends, in Phnom Penh on the evening of 2  April, the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia solemnly  hosted a banquet in honor of the visiting Vietnamese Government  delegation led by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet.    At the banquet, Samdech Norodom Ranariddh, first prime  minister of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia  delivered a speech. He said:    [Begin Ranariddh recording, in Cambodian fading into  Vietnamese translation] His Excellency the Prime Ministers,  Their Highnesses, Distinguished ladies and gentlemen:    On behalf of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the King of Cambodia,  the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia has the honor to  welcome His Excellency Vo Van Kiet, prime minister of the SRV,  and his entourage. Samdech Hun Sen and I are very pleased to  meet again with His Excellency the Vietnamese prime minister and  other high-ranking officials of the Vietnamese Government in our  land.    His Excellency Vo Van Kiet warmly welcomed our delegation on  a visit to Vietnam in August 1993. During the visit, we  exchanged views on various issues of our respective countries  and those of the region. It was a great honor for our  delegation to be received by His Excellency Le Duc Anh,  president of the SRV, and His Excellency Do Muoi, general  secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Through that visit,  we have gained new ideas about the Cambodia- Vietnam cooperation  relations, especially our determination to continue talks on  various issues which are aimed at expanding cooperation between  our two nations.    We unanimously agreed that we will give priority to  cooperation projects related to the economic, trade,  scientific-technological, tourism, and other essential domains.  We still have many issues that require consistent consultation  and discussion so as to strengthen and develop the relations of  friendship and cooperation between our two peoples.    We have but a common mission; I am convinced that our two  states and governments have the same aspiration of maintaining  long and lasting peace, security, and stability.    We have built a fine, healthy atmosphere with an aim to  consolidate the relations of friendship, cooperation, and good  neighborliness. These are factors that help strengthen  relations between our two peoples. Our struggle for prosperity  and happiness at present not only serves the interest of peace  and stability in the Southeast Asia region, but also in the  Asia-Pacific and the world.    On this occasion, I would like to express the Royal  Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia's gratitude to the SRV  Government for its positive contribution to restoring peace and  stability in Cambodia through the signing of the 23 October 1991  Paris Agreement on Cambodia. We still have many important  issues to be resolved. We are confident, however, that we can  resolve them through the principle of respecting each other's  national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and  noninterference to each other's internal affairs as well as in  the spirit of respecting the Kingdom of Cambodia's neutrality.    His Excellency the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Royal  Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I would like to express  our appreciation on U.S. President Bill Clinton's correct  decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. This  has created new relations between the United States and the SRV  and through which various nations in the region are gaining  potential to quickly develop their economies.    Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you,  together with me, to turn our attention to a great personage who  has brought about peace to the Kingdom of Cambodia: Samdech  Norodom Sihanouk.    I have the honor to invite His Excellency the Prime  Minister,  Their Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen to a toast for the good  health of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the esteemed King of the  Cambodian people.    I would like also to propose a toast for the good health and  happiness of His Excellency Le Duc Anh, president of the SRV,  and of His Excellency Vo Van Kiet, prime minister of the SRV;  for the happiness and prosperity of the Vietnamese and Cambodia  peoples; for the good health and success of Their Highnesses;  and for the good health of Excellencies, Samdech Hun Sen, and  all ladies and gentlemen who are present here.    Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

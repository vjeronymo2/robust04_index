			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: Palindrome fever heightens Sir, Mr Apsion's palindromes (Letters, September 26) result from the illogical way dates are usually written: day/month/year. His American friends, who use an even less sensible method (month/day/year), will encounter the first of their remaining seven 5-figure palindrome dates of the millennium on March 3 1993 and the rest at 13-month intervals, celebrating jointly with him on September 9 1999. The logical format is: year/month/day. Papers so marked may be arranged chronologically by sorting them in numerical order. I look forward to saluting with Mr Apsion the palindrome date 921129 (or 29.11.92). Dr Cyril Sanger, 317 Lydecker Street, Englewood, New Jersey</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The reduction in deliveries of Russian natural gas  to Turkey along the pipeline through Ukraine, Romania, and  Bulgaria was the reason for an unexpected visit to Sofia today  by Veysel Atasoy, Turkish minister of energy and natural  resources.    At a meeting with Nikita Shervashidze, chairman of the  Bulgarian Committee on Power Supplies, they discussed the  situation and adopted a decision that Mr. Shervashidze will now  explain to us:    [Begin Shervashidze recording] Mr. Atasoy told me that  Russia  has declared that it is delivering the contracted amounts of gas  to the Ukrainian border, and I have no reason not to believe  this. He said that the amounts of gas delivered have to be  divided between Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, and --the  fact is that, according to Mr. Atasoy, no gas is arriving at the  border with Turkey, the last consumer in the line. There is no  reason for me not to believe this. [words indistinct]    The simple fact is that if the amount of gas delivered is  reduced and the gas pressure falls to a point that we are able  to monitor, a switching valve automatically comes into operation  that reduces the amount of gas sent on to Bulgaria or to Turkey.  However, owing to the peculiarities of the system, Turkey gets  a larger share of the gas than Bulgaria does. As we assured our  Turkish colleagues--and we also wrote to them to avoid being  accused of not fulfilling our promises--that we will take  measures, including restrictions, I regret to say, to ensure  that we each get a fair share of the gas and that we divide the  available gas like good neighbors. [end recording]    With a view to dividing the quantities of natural gas  arriving more fairly between Bulgaria and Turkey, Bulgaria will  take technical measures. Our country is already restricting the  consumption of natural gas by enterprises in the chemical  industry. Because of force majeure conditions, as Nikita  Shervashidze described them, we will suffer losses that are not  our fault.</p>

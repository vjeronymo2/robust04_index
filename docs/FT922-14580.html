			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: Free market and CDs Sir, You describe the decision of the Office of Fair Trading not to refer compact disc suppliers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as a blow for Consumers' Association ('Inquiry into CD prices ruled out', March 30). This is an exaggeration. When we first raised the problem of inflated CD prices in the January 1990 issue of Which?, we were not able to point to any specific abuses of competition which might warrant an MMC referral. In particular, we made no allegations about collusion, or scale monopolies, or major barriers to entry. Our main concern was to draw attention to the subject and put pressure on manufacturers and retailers to cut prices in the interests of encouraging and expanding an under-developed market. After a further two years of price rises and falling production costs, and in the middle of a deep recession, that message is stronger than ever. Vinyl LPs are disappearing fast, leaving a huge gap in the market for the 70 per cent of households which do not yet own a CD player - in many cases because the discs are simply too expensive. What we seem to have here is straightforward, old-fashioned failure of the free market, and of entrepreneurs to seize what ought to be a profitable opportunity to achieve mass sales of CDs. One interesting parallel is with perfume prices, which after years of tight control by manufacturers are now being cut by a new, aggressive force in the market, Eau-Zone. If the OFT report does no more than draw attention to this issue, it will have served its purpose well.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Indonesia welcomes the decision by the U.S.  Government to lift its trade embargo on Vietnam. A Foreign  Ministry press statement stated that, even though the embargo is  a bilateral problem of the two countries, the United States  Government's lifting of the embargo was heartening because this  would stimulate trade and economic activities among the various  nations. Indonesia attaches great importance to efforts aimed  at further enhancing regional political stability, security, and  cooperation. As a result, any effort made to develop normal  relations with any nation in this region represents a positive  approach which will assist toward achieving such an aim.</p>

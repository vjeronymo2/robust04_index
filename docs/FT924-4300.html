			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Reform of credit-card law urged URGENT REFORM of the law covering credit cards is needed to clear up uncertainties about the protection offered to consumers who use credit cards to buy goods or services that turn out to be defective, the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said yesterday. A cardholder who buys a ticket from an airline that collapses before the ticket has been used can recover the cost of the ticket from the card issuer under the terms of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. For goods or services costing between Pounds 100 and Pounds 30,000 the act gives cardholders the same legal rights for breach of contract or misrepresentation against the issuer of the card as the seller. The society says in many situations it is now uncertain whether the protection exists. The most common is where there is no direct link in the form of a contract between the card issuer and the seller. That occurs because most retailers now have a single payment-handling agreement with one card issuer, which handles all card payments to the retailer for all other card issuers. Where another card issuer's card is used there are four parties to the transaction: the card issuer; the retailer; the issuer handling payments; and the cardholder. The 1974 act was designed to cover only three party transactions - debtor/creditor/supplier agreements. It is not clear whether it applies to transactions involving four parties. Card issuers say it does not. Another area of uncertainty relates to use of credit cards abroad. The society says no one knows whether protection is limited to transactions in the UK. It says consumers can find the protection they thought they had does not exist. That leads to resentment and distress and costly disputes with card issuers. The society says reform is urgently needed to ensure the law provides the protection it was designed to give.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Mandela sees tax breaks for foreign groups MR Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, yesterday held out the prospect of tax breaks for foreign companies investing in South Africa. Mr Mandela, on a four-day visit to Britain, said an ANC-led government would offer fiscal incentives to persuade investors to set up plants and joint-venture companies in deprived areas of South Africa. Addressing business leaders in Birmingham, ahead of a conference on the South African economy in London today, he highlighted the northern Cape and black homelands such as Transkei as areas where international companies should launch subsidiary operations. 'There will be tax incentives for the next five years and other strategies to ensure we spread the benefits of investment to the poorest areas,' he said. Mr Mandela said the incentives, part of an investment code drawn up by the ANC, did not involve an obligation on companies to invest only in areas of high unemployment and social deprivation. They would form the centrepiece of an appeal to foreign investors to help equalise economic disparities between black and white communities. The investment code also guaranteed that overseas companies could repatriate profits and dividends on earnings made in South Africa. Acknowledging that the ANC's commitment to nationalisation could prove a disincentive to overseas investors, Mr Mandela said the emphasis on state ownership had been diluted by the party's policy makers. But he warned large-scale state intervention was unavoidable to overcome structural problems in the South African economy. Areas the ANC plans to address include 'the 98 per cent of industrial property controlled by whites and the 86 per cent of shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange held by just five corporations'. In London today, Mr Mandela is expected to reaffirm his appeal for economic aid during meetings with Mr John Major, UK premier, and the Confederation of British Industry. He will address the CBI along with Mr Derek Keys, South African trade minister, and Mr Richard Needham, Mr Keys' British counterpart.</p>

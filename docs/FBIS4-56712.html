			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcement by Panamanian Electoral Tribunal President </F> Eduardo Valdes Escoffery from the Atlapa Convention Center in  Panama City; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] ...beginning [words indistinct] this afternoon  polling firms are authorized to release the results of the polls  they conducted today, but obeying Decree No. 27 dated 12 April  and Decree No. 40 dated 29 April 1994. Regardless of this, the  Electoral Tribunal [TE] has the duty to caution citizens that  these polls are based on approximations, which in turn are based  on questions answered by citizens who voted and who have varying  degrees of credibility. Even though the polls themselves may  have been conducted with rigid scientific parameters, these are  nevertheless only polls and are not based on true events.    Because of this, all polls have a margin of error, therefore  there is no room for claiming victory. We also wish to caution  that once this information is shared with the people, no person  who may be favored by these polls may violate the TE's provision  that states that all demonstrations, gatherings, and caravans  are totally and absolutely forbidden, according to the law,  until 1200 on Monday, 9 May 1994.    We reiterate it is absolutely essential that no one should  celebrate any sort of triumph, because other groups could do the  same and clashes between these groups could endanger the peace  we have enjoyed all day long. Only the results released by the  TE, which will be based on true election results from the voting  tables and only the National Vote-Counting Board can, according  to the law, release final and definitive official results.    The TE takes this opportunity to reiterate to the citizens  its pledge to issue authentic and unquestionable results  regarding the national elections held today, 8 May 1994. Many  thanks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava January 31 (CTK) -- Slovak Minister of  the Economy Jan Ducky today said miners' claims were justified  and promised leaders of the Miners', Geologists' and Oil  Industry Workers' Union that their social demands would be met  for the first three months after the Slovak Government's  programme of mining reductions began.    After the first quarter, Ducky and Finance Minister Julius  Toth would push for changes in the state budget with regard to  the demands of the miners, Slovak Radio reported today.    Ducky said that the problems of the Slovak mining industry  were caused by changes in the structure of Slovakia's fuel and  energy base, and because market conditions made it possible for  bad quality but competitively-priced products to be imported to  Slovakia.    "We do not want a protection of the coal market which would  give the domestic product an unfair advantage, but we have to  find ways of limiting the import of substrates which destroy the  environment," Ducky said.    Union Chairman Marian Mesiarik expressed satisfaction with  the results of today's meeting with Ducky, especially with the  fact that the minister "did not doubt the social demands of the  miners were justified."    He said a council would be meeting on February 15 to discuss  the problem of the Slovak mining industry. If the proposals of  the unionists are approved, the coal industry will survive  without state subsidies, he said.    He said today's announcement of a sit-in after Ducky failed  to arrive on time had now become insignificant.</p>

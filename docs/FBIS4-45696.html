			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- Czech and  Austrian environmentalists today handed the Czech and Austrian  Presidents, Vaclav Havel and Thomas Klestil, a letter protesting  against nuclear energy.    During the seven Central European presidents' stroll through  Litomysl this afternoon, activists from the Czech movement  Rainbow (Duha) and the Austrian movement Global 2000 unfolded  banners with anti-nuclear inscriptions.    Klestil, who plans to discuss the nuclear energy issue with  Havel, raised his thumb and smiled in support of the  environmentalists' demands.    In the letter the environmentalists propose that the  Litomysl  summit adopt a resolution on the danger of using nuclear energy  in Central Europe.    They call on the presidents to support cooperation in energy  saving and in its effective use, and to press for the  introduction of information exchange on nuclear facilities'  operation.    The environmentalists also recommend that the presidents  discuss opportunities of influencing neighbor countries' nuclear  projects which could be dangerous to their populations. They  are also asked to initiate international conferences on  effective energy uses.    The letter does not directly mention the nuclear power plant  which is now being built at Temelin, south Bohemia. Austrian  environmentalists, supported by political parties, have been  strongly protesting against its completion. The Soviet-type  plant, to be equipped with Westinghouse safety technology, is  located about 100 kilometers from the Austrian border.</p>

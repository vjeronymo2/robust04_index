The deputy is first  and foremost a person with higher education (94.4 percent), male  (87.2 percent), and he is often a Muscovite (62.2 percent of the  federationwide list). The Duma's oldest member is Georgiy  Lukava (born 1925), head of department at the Moscow State  Technical University for Civil Aviation, and the youngest is  Aleksey Zuyev (born 1970), an adviser to the president of the  "GMM" company (both are members of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia [LDPR]). The average age of deputies in the Duma is a  little over 40. It is noteworthy that although almost equal  percentages of deputies have higher education [as published],  the figure is lower in the LDPR where it is 89.9 percent  (according to the federationwide list).    Some 54 of the 444 deputies elected are functionaries of  electoral associations and political organizations which did not  participate in the elections for the federationwide district.  Party leaders account for 5 percent of the Duma's total  membership (22 deputies), and local party functionaries,  advisers, and leaders of party apparatuses account for 7.2  percent (32 deputies). Contrary to expectations, representation  of trade union activists proved to be low -- three deputies or  0.7 percent.    Some 80 of the people's elected representatives are  representatives of the executive or representative branches of  power, including 25 members of the Russian Federation Government  and leaders and workers of the central ministries and  departments (5.6 percent) and 49 administration heads,  representatives of the president, and other leaders of the  executive branch of power in the provinces (11 percent).    Workers in the intellectual sphere (the "educated class")  are  very well represented with 116 deputies, or 26.1 percent.  Frankly, there are few doctors and school teachers and there  are not many more higher education teachers among the deputies;  however, the numbers of leaders and staff of the new kind of  analytical organizations (specialists and the like) is  significant. The new parliament will be scarcely more  professional than the previous one: It contains only 29 lawyers  (6.5 percent), and a significant number of them are concentrated  in potentially government-oriented factions. There are 11  journalists in the State Duma (2.3 percent). The number of  entrepreneurs and managers of commercial and state enterprises  -- 47 (10.6 percent) -- is significant.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spice trade put through the mill - Problems posed by tighter food safety regulations THE INTERNATIONAL spice trade is being ground down at present by a range of non-tariff barriers imposed by some of the major importers. But producers are hopeful that they will see a recovery in 1993. Reports by the International Trade Centre of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Commonwealth Secretariat, say that the increase in the number and type of non-tariff barriers coincided with the lowering of tariffs under several rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations and the introduction of special market access for some of the least developed countries. 'The most important non-tariff measures imposed by developed countries usually relate to health and phytosanitary (plant health) regulations,' says a report from the International Trade Center that was presented to a meeting in Jamaica of the International Spice Group, made up of producers and consumers. 'The public concern in these countries about food safety has led to stricter regulations on food items, including spices.' The report says that in the US specifications on cleanliness established by the American Spice Trade Association 'are considered the most stringent among developed countries'. The regulations, which differ from country to country 'are so diverse and standards vary so much that spice exporters in developing countries frequently experience great difficulty in obtaining up to date, comprehensive information about them.' Mr Hernal Hamilton, chairman of the International Spice Group, says that some spice exporting countries have encountered problems because of the cleanliness requirements, but many have overcome these by implementing more rigid inspection systems. The industry is also worried about the effects on the major markets of the banning of fumigants, particularly by European consumers, and a reluctance to accept irradiation to improve cleanliness and remove bacteria. Successfully meeting the US demands for cleanliness is considered by the industry to be crucial to hopes for expanded trade, as that country is the world's largest market. In 1990, US imports, including spice herbs, mustard and sesame seeds, amounted to 238,949 tonnes, valued at Dollars 355m. Although the volume imported by the US in 1990 was 12,277 tonnes more than in 1989, the value was Dollars 19m less. The volume of spices traded internationally in 1990 reached 400,000 tonnes, valued at USDollars 1.5bn, according to the International Spice Group. But producers are unhappy that prices for key products are low, with pepper fetching about Dollars 1,200 a tonne, a third less than six years ago. 'Sixty per cent of global imports are for the food industry, so any projections for higher volumes and better prices must be based on the performance of this industry,' says Mr Fazli Husain, a senior marketing adviser on spices for of Unctad's International Trade Center. Consequently, producers are laying great store by the performance of the food processing industry in the industrialised countries, mainly the US and Europe. An improved market will ease the concerns of those producers who have suffered from recent developments in Europe. Exporters have been affected by the instability of imports into eastern Europe and the CIS, because of a lack of foreign exchange to maintain imports. This has been particularly painful to Jamaica, the leading producer of pimento (allspice), with exports averaging of 2,500 tonnes a year, accounting for 70 per cent of world output. The industry earns the island about Dollars 7m a year. The Jamaican industry suffered a setback with the loss of an important market for pimento in what was the Soviet Union. 'The purchasers in what was the USSR did not buy any pimento last year because of the political upheaval, but we expect this to be a temporary problem,' says Mr Hamilton, who is also managing director of the Jamaica Export Trading Company, which markets the spice. 'They need the pimento for their fish processing industry and we expect this industry to be in touch with us again soon. We have not lost that market and I am optimistic that shipments will resume when the political situation settles down.' Hopes in the trade for significant increase in the consumption of spices in non-traditional industries are unlikely to materialise, according to the International Spice Group. 'The consumption of spices in the non-food sector, in pharmaceuticals and perfumery, is not in general appreciable, and does not have any significant effect on overall demand,' it says. Despite this, consumers and producers are likely to take comfort from indications that the size of the market could be increased significantly by two developments that promise an expansion of the trade. The creation of a single European market at the end of the year will bring changes in import patterns and could lead to increased demand, the ISG says. The second development expected to affect that trade is the Uruguay Round discussions. These will be of benefit, says the International Trade Centre, 'provided the trade liberalisation objectives for tropical products. . . are attained and maintained'. In the background, however, lurks a threat from modern technology. The ISG says that except for vanilla, spices have not so far been threatened by synthetics and substitutes. It says substitutes for pepper have been developed, but have not yet made an impression on the market. 'However, the availability of spices in forms other than the 100 per cent natural spice needs to be monitored. In recent years, spices in other forms, such as encapsulated spices and spice drops, are entering the market, which could influence not only the usage pattern, but also affect the actual amount of spices used, particularly in the industrial sector in the longer term.'</p>

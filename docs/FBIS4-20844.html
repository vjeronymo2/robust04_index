			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- Shifting of targets of  Russia's nuclear missiles does no damage to security of the  Russian Federation and other states but is a manifestation of  confidence and strengthening of strategic stability, Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS here today.    The defense minister was commenting on Russian President  Boris Yeltsin's recent order assigning the Defense Ministry  before May 30 "to take measures aimed at organizing the everyday  activities of the strategic nuclear forces with non-targeted  missiles".    Pavel Grachev added that the issue on the mutual  non-targeting of strategic weapons of Russia and the United  States was raised for the first time at a meeting of the two  presidents in Vancouver last year. In January this year Boris  Yeltsin and Bill Clinton confirmed in the Moscow Declaration  that they would give the appropriate instructions to their  defense ministries.    According to the Russian defense minister, Britain also  joined this initiative.    Pavel Grachev believes that terms of implementing this  decision will be determined by organizational and technical  possibilities, and are specific for each kind of strategic  weapons.</p>

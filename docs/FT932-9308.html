			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Management: Job title inflation hits the roof - A trend spreading out of control There are probably more admirals than ships in the British navy today. Soon, given the exodus of Anglo Catholics from the Church of England, there might be more bishops than congregations. And in the jargon of politically incorrect speech, most organisations appear to have more chiefs than indians. Monetary inflation may be under control in Britain, but the same cannot be said for job titles. Nearly all Americans over the age of 23 seem to have the title 'executive vice-president' embossed on their business cards - and the trend is spreading. New-fangled job titles have elaborate suffixes, usually manager, director or engineer if British, and president or officer if American. Prefixes such as senior, executive or corporate are also common. One can mix and match any set of these to come up with a grand, but meaningless, title. As a result, employees are often more concerned about their official titles than their responsibilities. Some ask in interviews 'what will I be called?' more often than 'what will I be doing?'. Traditionally 'flat' organisations - those with relatively few levels or grades such as universities - are under pressure to invent new titles to keep their ambitious staff happy. Traditionally 'tall' organisations - the army or the civil service - go on inventing new job titles by rendering generalists into specialists, however minor the task. Why does this happen? At first glance it seems to many managers a relatively cheap way to reward productivity or service. Many people, eager to satisfy their unquenchable self-esteem thirst, are happy to accept an improved job title in lieu of a sizeable salary increase. And, it follows, the more problems people have with self-confidence and respect, the more they like to compensate with fancy titles. The inflationary force of the job title is particularly rife in the service sector where people are driven more by carrot than by stick. A few examples include: An airline that has 54 levels, including four ranks of tea-lady. A bank that has more than 30 tiers with nearly a dozen known as 'manager'. A hotel chain with more than 40 job titles. Some sectors inflate title grandiosity, but do not increase the number of ranks. This happens in the publishing world where to compensate for relatively low pay everyone is a 'director'. But, as with all inflation, there are dangers. There is a limit to the number of grand titles that exist; the more they are used, the more worthless they become. Far from being a cheap ego trip for staff, job title inflation often raises expectations that cannot be fulfilled. Traditionally, job titles prescribed what one did and did not do. Secretaries type for managers, who may have keys to the executive wash-room, an additional telephone or a company car. A title comes with a package of perks, which can be very costly. Some companies, in a spirit of crypto-egalitarianism, have chosen to withdraw in-house signs of rank and privilege - the managerial dining room, car park, executive lavatories - while at the same time doubling the number of people with manager, director or some such term in the organisation. Others are just bizarre. Not long ago a British quango had employees with the title of 'general worker'. Although this term seems more often used in an ant colony it endured for many years until job title inflation required it to be changed into 'chemical facilitator' or 'technical steward'. There are better ways of motivating staff than tripling the number of levels in an organisation. Those business gurus who suggest that the flatter the organisation the fatter the profits probably have a point. The author is head of the business psychology unit at University College London.</p>

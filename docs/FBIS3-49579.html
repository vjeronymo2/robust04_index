			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Romania's Presidency has faxed us President  Iliescu's statement, which reads as follows:    The summit meeting of the NATO countries' heads of states  and  governments has taken a historic decision regarding the  expansion of the Alliance toward the Central and Eastern part of  Europe, through a gradually developing process whose first step  is the Partnership for Peace program.    We hail this decision, which we consider an element that  strengthens the security of our country, and of the other  countries in this part of our continent, in the new  circumstances brought about by the changes that have taken place  after the elimination of totalitarian regimes in Central and  East Europe.    Romania is vitally interested in the establishment of a  viable system of security on our continent based on the  institutions of European dimension that throughout history have  proved their capacity to ensure peace and tranquility in Europe.  We view the NATO as the major organization capable of ensuring  the necessary framework for stability and security in Europe.  Romania's relations and cooperation with the countries that are  members of the NATO is based both on the historic tradition of  Romanian civilization in the European region, as well as on the  community of interests and engagements toward the values of  democracy and the rule-of-law state that our society regained  after the 1989 December revolution.    On this occasion, I also deem it necessary to reassert  Romania's constant interest in becoming a NATO member, a goal  also shared by all important political forces of our country and  I declare that we accept the Partnership for Peace also as a  preliminary stage in the integration process and a form of  many-sided cooperation aimed at the gradual fulfillment of the  requirements imposed by the statute of membership of the  Alliance, reads the Romanian president's declaration.    The basic document established with a view to substantiating  the Partnership for Peace has an outstanding importance and  sanctions fundamental principles for the relations between  partners, among them the engagement to consolidate the  democratic processes, the abstention from the use of force or  the threat of force against the territorial integrity and  political independence of any state, respect for existing  borders, and the need to settle conflicts solely through  peaceful means.    The statements also assess that immediate measures will be  taken for the competent bodies to examine the documents of the  Brussels summit, so that, in the shortest time possible,  discussions can start with a view to signing the basic document  and proceed to negotiations for concluding other documents that  are required by participation in the Partnership for Peace.    In conclusion, the Romanian president's statement reads:    Romania is ready to assume all responsibility incumbent on  it  as a participant in the partnership and, in the future, in the  Alliance, and it is determined to make a contribution to the  joint efforts to ensure stability in the region and in Europe as  a whole.</p>

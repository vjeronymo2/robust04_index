			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bonn: 100 Million DM for Gene </F> Research"]    [Text] Bonn. Within the coming five years the Federal  Ministry of Research will provide about DM100 million for  speeding up utilization of the results of gene research. Paul  Krueger, Federal Minister of Research, announces that the  emphasis in the new research program, "Methods of Decoding and  Utilizing Biological Building Charts," is on development of  therapies against diseases.    This program is designed, above all, to stimulate the use of  exceptionally- high-capacity computers and automated techniques  in analytical procedures for decoding genes as carriers which  carry heredity information and thus the important life's  important building blocks. Genome research should help make it  increasingly possible to put medicine, the pharmaceutic  industry, and agriculture on a new scientific basis. An example  of successful genetically engineered production of drugs is the  "Factor 8" against hemophilia, which until now had to be  isolated from human blood.    According to expert estimates, over 4000 diseases at least  can be traced to defects in biological building charts.  Ernst-Ludwig Winnaker, director of the Genetics Center in  Munich, reports that German researchers had played a substantial  role in identifying the genetic causes of various diseases such  as muscular ones and chorea, also heart and blood circulation  diseases, and intestinal cancer.    Krueger points out that the U.S., Japanese, British, and  French industries are already heavily engaged in this  prospective field. This, in the opinion of specialists, requires  that the licensing procedure be shortened. Looking at the soon  to be amended Genetic Engineering Law, Axel Kleemann of the  Pharmaceutic Works in Dresden has pointed out that it is not  sufficient to correct the law but also the new rules must be  better implemented.</p>

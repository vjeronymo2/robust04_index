			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview published by the Prague </F> paper LIDOVE NOVINY on 27 December with Ferenc Kulin, vice  president of the Hungarian Democratic Forum: "According to  Kulin, the MSZP May Win Next Year"]    [Text] Ference Kulin thinks there is a good chance that it  will be possible to form a conservative-Christian-liberal  government coalition after the parliamentary elections in  Hungary next year, although power relations within the coalition  will be different from the present. The interview with the vice  president of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] appeared in  the Monday issue of the Prague paper LIDOVE NOVINY.    According to Kulin, while it is possible to imagine that the  socialists will win a relative majority in the elections, they  will not be able to find the necessary partners for a governing  coalition. Such an intention would not find uniform support even  in the ranks of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], asserted  the vice president of the Hungarian Democratic Forum. He  excluded any possibility that his party would form a coalition  with either the socialists or with the extreme right party of  Istvan Csurka.    Concerning the foreign policy priorities of the Boross  government, Kulin said that Jozsef Antall had already become  convinced that it is not possible to achieve European  integration at the cost of relations with neighboring countries.  "I cannot imagine that Hungary would want to get some kind of  defense from West Europe against its own neighbors," said Ferenc  Kulin. In his view, Hungary does not want to develop it  relations with its neighbors on the basis of some romantic  outlook from the last century, that is, it does not want to make  its starting point the wrongs it suffered from [the treaty of]  Trianon or the desire to acquire territory. Instead, it is  striving to have the human rights as well as the collective  rights of the Hungarian minorities guaranteed within the  framework of the European Union.</p>

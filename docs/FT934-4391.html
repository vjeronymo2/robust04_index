			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaican bauxite sector feels the pinch - Low prices are threatening expansions plans Jamaica's bauxite mining and refining industry is weighing carefully the depressed state of the international aluminium market, hoping that companies operating in the island will not be dissuaded from continuing a USDollars 500m investment programme over the next seven years. As the world's third largest producer of bauxite (aluminium ore), however, the island is feeling the effects of falling metal prices. Ore production, which slipped last year by 1.5 per cent to 11.3m tonnes, is expected to be unchanged this year, as is alumina (aluminium oxide) production, at 3m tonnes. It is in the earnings from the industry - an important component of the island's narrow economy - that Jamaica is feeling the pressure. Mr Carlton Davis, chairman of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute, says that the soft metal market is depressing Jamaica's earnings from bauxite and alumina, most of which is through production levies and income taxes. While bauxite production fell only marginally last year, the island's earnings from the industry declined by a hefty 13.6 per cent to Dollars 577m. Jamaica will be fortunate if earnings amount to Dollars 500m this year, Dollars 200m less than two years ago, says Mr Davis. This forecast is supported by figures showing bauxite production in the first three quarters of this year down 1.4 per cent from a year ago, with alumina output little changed. Earnings have also been depressed by a steady depreciation of the Jamaican dollar over the past two years, with mining and refining companies spending less to meet local costs. 'The current state of the market might lead some companies to reconsider their capital programmes,' says Mr Davis. 'But conventional wisdom in the industry is that it is in times like these that one prepares to meet an upturn in the market.' The aim of the Jamaican industry is to lift refinery capacity, which is now being fully utilised, to 5m tonnes a year by the year 2000. The Jamalco refinery in central Jamaica, owned jointly by the island's government and the Aluminum Company of America, is being expanded to a rated capacity of 1m tonnes a year, from 700,000, at a cost of about Dollars 60m. Already under consideration is a later expansion that could lift capacity to 2m tonnes a year. Alumina Partners of Jamaica, owned by Kaiser of the US and Hydro Aluminum of Norway, is spending Dollars 200m to increase the output from the island's largest refinery to 1.5m tonnes year, and then to 2m tonnes by the turn of the century. Two refineries operated by Alcan of Canada, with a combined capacity of 1.1m tonnes a year, are being refurbished to lift output to 1.5m tonnes. Mr Davis says that the plants could be further expanded to produce 2m tonnes a year, using a grade of ore that was not yet being processed by the company. While there is optimism that the state of the industry will not adversely affect these expansion plans, there has been reconsideration of two ventures. The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago had been discussing the construction of an aluminium smelter in Trinidad, using a 'modular' system, starting with a small plant and enlarging in stages to meet market demand. Both governments were considering starting with a 'module' with a plant of 55,000 tonnes per year. Mr Davis says this project is not now being given priority because of the state of the market, and uncertainty over the cost of the local natural gas which would fuel the plant. The industry's plans also included the construction of a caustic soda plant to reduce reliance on imports to meet the demand for 300,000 tonnes per year for the refineries. The project for a 50,000 tonnes-a-year plant has been put back, Mr Davis said, because of a significant drop in world prices of caustic soda. In a longer term project, the Jamaican industry is testing ore deposits in the north and north-western districts that could supply one or two new refineries. The island's government is planning an approach to multilateral financial institutions, and to aluminium majors, in an effort to stimulate interest in financing and operating the refineries. If these projects are not feasible, the ores will be used to feed the expanded refineries, Mr Davis says. 'Jamaica is one of several locations which can attract new investment in the industry,' he acknowledges. 'There are many questions being asked about the continued efficiency of plants in North America and Europe. Along with Australia, India, Brazil and Venezuela, Jamaica is a profitable location for added production. The industry is very competitive.'  ---------------------------------------------------               Jamaican Bauxite Output                      (tonnes)  --------------------------------------------------- 1980              12m     1987              7.6m 1981            11.6m     1988              7.4m 1982             8.3m     1989              9.3m 1983             7.6m     1990             10.9m 1984             8.9m     1991             11.6m 1985             5.9m     1992             11.3m 1986             6.9m     1993            11.3m*  --------------------------------------------------- *Projected.

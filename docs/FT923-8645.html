			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Observer: Singapore date Recognition at last. Members of Singapore's state-sponsored dating agency, the Social Development Unit, were allowed to march in the country's national day parade yesterday. The SDU, often ridiculed as a last resort for the Single, Desperate and Ugly, was set up in 1984 when then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew expressed concern over the large number of single women graduates who were not getting married and producing bright children. The unit, which organises cruises and tea dances where graduates can get to know each other, now has 13,000 single graduate members compared with 1,000 when it started. In 1984 only 704 Singapore graduate couples tied the knot. Last year there were 1,643. 'The SDU has become an acceptable organisation while previously there was a stigma attached to it,' says deputy director Susan Chua. It even sports a new nickname Single, Desirable and Unattached . . .</p>

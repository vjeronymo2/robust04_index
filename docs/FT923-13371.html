			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (11): Poised for a smoother ride - New life is being pumped into world tyre industry SLOWLY and laboriously, new life is being pumped into the world tyre industry. The industry has had a bone-shaking ride since 1989, when it first developed the puncture in its profitability caused mainly by the slide of large original equipment and replacement markets into recession. According to estimates in a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, this global industry which turns over close to Dollars 55bn a year has made collective losses of more than Dollars 1bn in the two years up to early 1992. It is an industry which has seen rationalisation on a scale matched by few other industrial sectors. In the mid-1980s, 80 per cent of the market was shared by 13 manufacturers. Now, 85 per cent of world sales are accounted for by just six manufacturers. Had things turned out differently late last year, the number would have been reduced to five. In what was generally seen as likely to be the last of the big tyre industry takeovers, Italy's Pirelli, the world's sixth largest tyres group with annual sales of around Dollars 3.5bn, sought to take over rival Continental of Germany, ranked fourth with sales of just over Dollars 5bn. Had the bitterly contested bid succeeded, Pirelli would have created a group close in size to the 'big three' of the tyres world: Michelin of France, now marginally the world market leader with sales of more than Dollars 12bn, Bridgestone of Japan and Goodyear of the US. Instead, Continental dug in its heels, retained its independence and Pirelli incurred substantial losses directly related to the failed bid. They formed a significant portion of the Dollars 275m deficit reported for 1991 by Pirelli Tyre Holding, the Dutch-listed company which controls Pirelli's world tyre operations. According to its board, however, Pirelli Tyre Holding will return to break-even some time this year, with a full return to profitability in 1993. Indeed, the opening months of this year indicate that the industry is at a turning point. It is still having a very hard time convincing car makers, themselves hit by slumping markets and under massive pressures to reduce costs, that the tyre industry needs price rises if research and development, and investment in automated tyre- making facilities, is to be maintained. But, led mainly by Michelin, it has managed to force through price rises of 7-10 per cent in the replacement tyre sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of total unit sales volumes. With the North American vehicle market, in particular, starting to show signs of recovery, the other leading players are already reporting a return to profitability. According to Mr Philip Wylie, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd who is the author of the EIU report, the combined effect of the price increases and North American market recovery should more than offset expected declines in the European and Japanese car markets this year. As a result, he expects average operating margins to improve by about 1 per cent this year. And with lower redundancy and other restructuring costs - after the loss of tens of thousands of jobs over the past two years - he expects the industry to generate Dollars 1bn profits this year. This is still well short of the industry's peak year of 1988/89, when collectively it chalked up some Dollars 1.5bn. Certainly, 'this year has started better than the last one', according to Dr Hubertus von Grunberg, chairman of Continental's executive board. He expects the company to be 'well in the black' this year. Without doubt, some of the tyre industry's wounds are self-inflicted. Motorists everywhere are undoubtedly grateful to the industry for so virtuously shooting itself in the foot and inventing the radial tyre, capable of covering more than twice the mileage of the now almost obsolete cross-ply. But some analysts believe there is more to the vicious price wars of the past few years, both in North America and Europe, than straightforward competition. Two main theories are put forward: That Michelin in Europe, and Goodyear in North America, led a downward spiral in prices in the - ultimately unsuccessful - hope of persuading aggressively expansionist Japanese tyre makers such as Bridgestone and Sumitomor from seeking to acquire or otherwise set up manufacturing operations. Instead, Bridgestone acquired Firestone - and its operations in both North America and Europe - while Sumitomo is now the producer of Dunlop tyres. The other theory works on 'beggar-thy-neighbour' principles - that if prices were kept low enough for long enough, there would be a further, perhaps final round, of consolidation. Subsequently, as markets began to recover, the industry's profitability would be helped by the reduced competition. The jury is still out on the consolidation issue. Between Pirelli and Continental there remains a wary, hostile stand-off. They are still in negotiations over the possible sale to Continental of some of Pirelli's non-tyre businesses - but face a potential court battle over dividend payments for shares already owned by Pirelli in Continental. Pirelli owns 5 per cent of Continental and has options over a further 34 per cent. Under German law, however, individual shareholders are limited to a 5 per cent voting share, no matter how big their holding. Whether, in future, Pirelli will seek to revive its bid, or itself become a takeover target, remains an open question. There is still a problem of over-capacity. Spurred by eight unbroken years of growth in the world's main car markets during the 1980s, and in spite of lingering memories of the savage job and capacity cuts after the 1979 oil shock, the industry spent several billion dollars on new capacity in the late 1980s, much of it coming on stream as vehicle markets turned down. The reluctance of vehicle makers to concede any but the most grudging price increases will also put a brake on profits expansion during the 1990s. But the entire industry can take comfort in long-term growth projections for the world car industry itself. By 1995, world sales are expected to be up to 25 per cent above 1991 levels. The other plus point for the tyre industry is the prospect of substantial advances in automated manufacturing technology, and the chance to make sharp cuts in costs of what, by other industry yardsticks, remains a labour-intensive process because of the complexity and variety of the materials used, and the sequential processes of building up the tyre carcass.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      PRINCIPAL TYRE INDUSTRY ACQUISITIONS, 1986-1989 (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company          Acquisition      Year   Cost*   Sales**  Cost/sales*** Michelin      Uniroyal-Goodrich   1989   1,500    2,200       68% Bridgestone       Firestone       1988   2,260    3,900       58% Pirelli        Armstrong Rubber   1988     200      469       43% Continental      General Tyre     1987     650    1,100       59% Sumitomo            Dunlop        1986     240      450       53%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Cost is the purchase price; **Sales are of the acquired company in the year before purchase; ***Cost/sales indicates the value placed on each unit of acquired group's sales  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Barclays de Zoete Wedd  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

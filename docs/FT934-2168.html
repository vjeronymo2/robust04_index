			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: European airlines The collapse of the Alcazar alliance has led to a big strategic rethink in the European airline industry. But the need to rationalise operations means that carriers are still seeking alternative groupings. Austrian Airlines said yesterday it was in talks with Swissair and Lufthansa over strategic co-operation. But it may stumble for the same reason Alcazar failed. Lufthansa is firmly wedded to United Airlines as its transatlantic partner. Swissair remains linked to Delta. Swissair's 10 per cent shareholding in Austrian and close operational links suggests that the two carriers will move as one. And Swissair seemingly favours the re-creation of Alcazar with Austrian and SAS but minus KLM. By exploiting Swissair's existing links with Delta and Singapore Airlines, a combined carrier could emerge as a viable global operator. Such bold action will be needed by many European airlines if they are to secure their future. British Airways and KLM are emerging in a league of their own as efficient low-cost carriers boasting attractive hubs and international networks. KLM is committed to further rationalisation and may feel it can go it alone, especially if it could raise fresh equity. Other European airlines will jostle for position in the second division. Lufthansa, Swissair, Austrian, and SAS must cut their cost bases to regain competitiveness. Air France will have to implement its latest rationalisation plan just to remain in the game.</p>

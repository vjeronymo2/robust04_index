			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Patrick Wright, Bay/Delta Program Manager, Water Quality Standards Branch, W&hyph;3, Water Management Division, Environmental Protection Agency, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105, 415/744&hyph;1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 303 of the Clean Water Act, as amended (hereinafter CWA or the Act), requires each state to adopt water quality standards consisting of designated uses and instream water quality criteria to protect such uses for all waters of the United States located within that state. Section 303(c) of the Act provides that states shall review and, if appropriate, revise the water quality standards at least once every three years. Any new or revised standards adopted by the state are to be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency). In the event that EPA disapproves a state's standards, and the state does not make EPA's requested changes within ninety (90) days of the disapproval, or if EPA determines at any time that revised or new standards are necessary to meet the requirements of the Act, section 303(c)(4) of the Act states that the Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations establishing water quality standards for the applicable waterbodies. The Administrator shall promulgate any new or revised standards not later than ninety (90) days after publication of the proposed standards. EPA's regulations for implementing section 303(c) of the Act are codified at 40 CFR part 131. Guidance for implementing these regulations is contained in the Water Quality Standards Handbook (December 1983) and Technical Support Manual: Waterbody Surveys and Assessments for Conducting Use Attainability Analyses (Volumes I, II and III).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposal is part of a coordinated federal interagency response to the water management issues in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. EPA has worked closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented approach to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California. Other components of this interagency initiative are being announced contemporaneously with EPA's proposal. These include USFWS actions on petitions to list the longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail as endangered fish species under the Federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1531 to 1540 (ESA), the USFWS proposal of critical habitat for the Delta smelt under the ESA, and the NMFS reclassification of the winter-run Chinook salmon as endangered under the ESA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta estuary (hereinafter the Bay/Delta) is the West Coast's largest estuary. It encompasses roughly 1600 square miles, and drains over 40 percent of California. The Bay/Delta is the point of convergence of California's two major river systems_the Sacramento River system flowing southward and draining a large part of northern California, and the San Joaquin River system flowing northward and draining a large part of central California. These two rivers, together with a number of smaller rivers flowing directly westward from the mountains, come together in a network of channels and islands, roughly a triangle 90 miles on each side, known as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The rivers converge at the western tip of the Delta, forming an estuary as fresh water mixes with marine water through a series of bays, channels, shoals and marshes and ultimately flowing into San Francisco Bay and then to the Pacific Ocean.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bay/Delta constitutes one of the largest systems for fish production in the country, supplying habitat for over 120 fish species. It also comprises one of the largest areas of waterfowl habitat in the United States, providing a stopover for more than one-half of the waterfowl and shorebirds migrating on the Pacific Flyway. Within the boundaries of the Bay/Delta is the Suisun Marsh, the largest brackish marsh on the West Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bay/Delta is also the hub of California's two major water distribution systems_the Central Valley Project (CVP) built and operated by the USBR and the State of California's State Water Project (SWP). Most of the State's developed water_75 to 85 percent_is used for irrigation purposes by agriculture, irrigating over 4.5 million acres throughout the State. The Bay/Delta watershed also provides part or all of the drinking water supply for over 18 million people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Located solely within the State of California, the Bay/Delta is subject under state law to the water quality control jurisdiction of the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) and two regional boards, the Central Valley and San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Under the California regulatory scheme, the State Board's actions preempt regional board actions to the extent of any conflicts. Cal. Water Code &sect;13170.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1978, the State Board adopted and submitted to EPA a Water Quality Control Plan (hereinafter the 1978 Delta Plan) containing a comprehensive set of water quality standards to protect the designated uses of the Bay/Delta. The 1978 Delta Plan included water quality standards for three categories of designated uses: municipal and industrial, agriculture, and fish and wildlife. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The 1978 Delta Plan relied on a key set of criteria to protect fish and wildlife uses: the striped bass spawning and survival criteria. These criteria were established to provide minimum salinity and flow conditions to protect the fishery at levels that would have existed in the absence of the State and federal water projects (the so-called ``without projects'' level). The striped bass survival criteria were based on a statistical correlation between a Striped Bass Index (SBI) (a measure of the relative abundance of young striped bass in the estuary) and two hydrological variables: (1) Delta outflow (freshwater flowing through the Delta out to the ocean), and (2) Delta diversions (freshwater diverted out of the Delta channels for consumptive uses in agricultural irrigation, municipal and industrial uses). Based on this relationship, flow (measured in cubic feet per second (cfs) of Delta outflow) and salinity requirements at critical points in the Bay/Delta were adopted as criteria. The SBI, although not a formal criteria, was used to measure and predict the substantive environmental results of implementing these flow and salinity criteria. The 1978 Delta Plan emphasized striped bass protection because of the economic importance and availability of scientific information on this species in the Bay/Delta, but the Plan also indicated that it considered the striped bass standards to be a surrogate for protection of other species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The CWA and implementing regulations describe the two components of water quality standards as ``designated uses'' and ``water quality criteria'' (40 CFR 131.3(i)), whereas California uses the terms ``beneficial uses'' and ``objectives''. It has been EPA's and California's longstanding practice to interpret these terms synonymously. To avoid confusion, this proposal will use the federal terms ``designated uses'' and ``criteria''.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

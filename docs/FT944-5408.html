			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Interest aid is axed - Mortgages THE MEASURE: Borrowers taking out new mortgages after October 1 1995 will not be able to claim income support to cover interest payments for the first nine months of unemployment, redundancy and incapacity. Existing borrowers will receive nothing for the first two months and only 50 per cent of mortgage interest for the next four months. From April 1995, income support will not cover amounts borrowed above Pounds 100,000. WHAT IT MEANS: The two largest high street mortgage lenders, the Halifax and Abbey National, both confirmed they did not intend to make mortgage payment insurance a condition of lending. But if smaller lenders move in this direction, the cost of mortgages for new borrowers after October 1995 could rise by more than Pounds 20 a month for a typical Pounds 50,000 endowment mortgage. Jill Mayman, spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders says: 'Borrowers considered a high risk because they are self-employed, on a low income or disabled may be refused cover and could be forced out of the owner-occupier sector.' At present, income support covers 50 per cent of mortgage interest payments for the first 16 weeks of a claim and 100 per cent thereafter, subject to a cap on the mortgage of Pounds 125,000. The number of claims has risen greatly in recent years, from 300,000 in 1988 at a cost of Pounds 286m to 548,000 in 1994 costing Pounds 1.082bn. The government's plans will shift part of this burden to the private insurance market. Derek Roberts, chief executive of the Yorkshire Building Society, which has 150,000 borrowers, says: 'We will consider whether this insurance should be compulsory. One-third of our new borrowers already have cover.' According to the Halifax, the biggest lender with 1.8m mortgage accounts, only 10 per cent of its borrowers have mortgage payment insurance at present and spokesman Mark Hemingway says: 'We have no plans at present to make this type of insurance compulsory. But we are concerned that borrowers who are not covered could see their homes repossessed if they become unemployed and cannot afford the interest payments.' Under the Halifax scheme, the monthly cost is Pounds 6.90 for every Pounds 100 of cover while Abbey National's version costs Pounds 6.95 for every Pounds 100. For a Pounds 50,000 endowment mortgage with monthly repayments of Pounds 297, this would cost Pounds 21 a month. Ian Darby, marketing director with independent mortgage adviser John Charcol, adds: 'To date, most people who have asked for this insurance have had some concern about their job security. As a result, claims have been high, which has led to complex underwriting procedures with lots of exclusions.' Darby urges lenders to take out block re-insurance to cover mortgage liabilities. 'Alternatively, borrowers could pay a single premium to cover the first year of unemployment, after which time they could claim income support.'</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Voters hand great power to president Under the draft constitution which the Russian people appear to have approved yesterday, President Boris Yeltsin is set to become one of the world's most powerful, democratically elected, presidents. It is seen as an authoritarian constitution by much of the opposition. But, even among Mr Yeltsin's supporters, it has been seen as dangerous in as much as it gives power to one individual in a state with authoritarian traditions and a shallow experience of democratic practice. The system proposed would have the president at its undisputed and all but unchallengeable apex. He would be head of state, of the armed forces and of the Security Council - this last a potentially powerful body with no clear boundaries to its remit. His powers to appoint premiers, judges and central bank chairmen would generally be conditional on approval from one or both chambers of parliament but he has the authority to issue decrees wholly independent of parliament, or any other level of power - save that these decrees must not flout the constitution. This might mean that in any unresolvable dispute between the president and the parliament, the president could resort to a decree. The president can be impeached, though only for treachery and serious crimes, and not on grounds of breaching the constitution. Even then, the process would depend on two-thirds of both houses agreeing within three months of the constitutional court's upholding the decision to attempt to impeach. The constitution itself is virtually untouchable as three-quarters of the upper house of the parliament, representing the regions and republics, and two-thirds of the lower house, must favour the change. The parliament has two chambers: the upper, or Federation Council, representing the interests of the regions and the lower, or State Duma, comprised of the fledgling political parties and the members elected on a first-past-the-post system from the constituencies. Both have the right to initiate legislation, and they have a particular responsibility for laws on the budget, federal taxes and financial, monetary and credit policy. However, laws on financial matters must in effect be agreed with the government, as draft laws in this area require a corresponding resolution of the cabinet before they are debated. The effect is to strengthen the government's - and the president's - hands vis-a-vis the parliament; and to ensure that the parliament will be at its most influential when it works with the government and the president, rather than against them. Its influence will also depend on how persuasive it can be in presenting policies, and how flexible the president and government are in tailoring their proposals to the parliamentary majority to avoid gridlock. The balance will be a sensitive one. The judiciary would be granted independence - and the judges life tenure - but again they face a tough battle to increase the standing and prestige of a profession traditionally ill-regarded in Soviet times and only fitfully authoritative since. The constitutional court could, and arguably should, emerge as a powerful arbiter of a constitution with many unclear clauses, taking its place beside the US Supreme Court and the German constitutional court as a check on government and a defender of rights. But any constitution in a civil society as fragile as Russia's will be under test. None could be a guarantor against a revival of its authoritarian, centralist traditions. It will stand or fall not on the letter of its clauses, but on the politicians' and citizens' willingness to exercise restraint.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local cable tv channels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many communities run their own cable channels for local news and activities. This medium may be used to target a local audience, often at no charge. TV spots may be advantageous for delivering pertinent information about a hazardous waste facility directly to people at home. The permitting authorities may also use the stations to broadcast logistics for upcoming meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local community groups. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The facility may enhance the distribution of information by including local community groups on the facility mailing list. Such groups may have a particular interest in hazardous waste issues and can be effective in circulating the information to a wider audience. Local religious establishments, for example, can be particularly useful in distributing information locally. Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), required under Section 301 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), can also be an effective group through which to disseminate notices. LEPCs are composed of representatives from a variety of groups or organizations, for example, local elected officials, law enforcement, fire fighting, health, and transportation personnel, community groups, and broadcast and print media. Facility mailing lists can include other community groups, such as professional and trade associations, planning commissions, civic leaders, and special interest groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Requirements for the pre-application meeting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is proposing that the facility provide public notification of the pre-application meeting between the facility and the public. This provision would apply to all RCRA facilities that submit a Part B Permit application for the first time. The facility will have the dual responsibility of providing appropriate notice and conducting the meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the requirements for the pre-application meeting should apply to all RCRA TSD facilities. EPA emphasizes that the pre-application meeting is meant to be flexible, informal, and informative. Owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities, including owners and operators of small businesses, should be able to meet the proposed requirements for the pre-application meeting without undue burden. EPA estimates that the costs associated with the pre-application will be small. In addition, EPA believes that this approach will benefit the facility, as well as the public, in the long run since the public will gain greater understanding of the facility's plans and responsibilities. As stated above, earlier and more meaningful public involvement could streamline the permitting process, since issues and concerns will be raised at the initial point of the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA solicits public comment on whether or not the Agency should require facilities to hold a pre-application meeting and, if so, whether the requirement should apply to all facilities, or only particular facilities, such as facilities conducting specific waste management practices, managing certain kinds of waste, or accepting off-site waste. In addition, EPA requests comment on the proposed functions of the pre-application meeting as well as comments about the notice requirements for the meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b.1. Providing notice of the pre-application meeting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency is proposing this requirement because EPA is concerned that the existing mechanisms for providing public notice (found in 40 CFR part 124) may not work as effectively at the pre-application stage of the permit process as they do later in the permit process. The main reason for this is that the permitting authority generally does not develop the facility mailing list by the pre-application stage; it usually develops the list after the facility submits its permit application. Consequently, there is no mailing list for the facility to utilize. These initial outreach efforts will ultimately benefit the permit process by engaging interested individuals early in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to require that the applicant provide notice of the pre-application meeting to the public, including EPA and appropriate units of State and local government, in three separate ways. EPA has designed these requirements to ensure effective public notice for the meeting. As proposed under &sect;124.31(c)(1), two of these requirements are new approaches to providing public notice and apply only to the notice for the pre-application meeting. The third is a current requirement under &sect;124.10(c)(2)(ii). EPA believes that since the notice for the pre-application meeting is the first public notice in the RCRA permitting process and occurs so early in the process, i.e., possibly before a mailing list is developed, these additional requirements are necessary to ensure widespread notice so that the public is appropriately informed. All of the public notice requirements for the pre-application meeting must contain the information proposed under &sect;124.31(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first requirement proposes that the facility must place the notice not only in a paper of general circulation within the community where the facility is located, as currently required, but also in newspapers that cover each jurisdiction adjacent to that community. EPA believes this approach is necessary to ensure that the facility appropriately notifies neighboring jurisdictions in the event that a facility is located near a jurisdictional boundary. In these cases, people who live near, but across the county or state line from, a hazardous waste facility that is applying for a RCRA permit may not receive notice of the activity under the present scheme because the newspaper is not in general circulation across that jurisdictional line. As a result, these people may not learn about the facility until much later in the permit process or after the facility is permitted. This initial outreach requirement would avoid such a situation. Interested persons could respond to this initial notice either by attending the pre-application meeting or by signing up for the facility mailing list. In either case, the person would be on the list for subsequent notices that comply with existing requirements in &sect;124.10(c)(2) (including requirements for the facility mailing list). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some states (especially in the western part of the United States), the geographic areas covered by a host county or adjacent counties can be very large. In these cases, the requirement for the facility to give public notice in adjacent counties may not be practical or useful. Therefore, in situations where the geographic area of a host jurisdiction or adjacent jurisdictions is very large (hundreds of square miles), the newspaper notice shall cover a reasonable radius from the facility, such that all potentially affected persons have the opportunity to receive notice. EPA requests comment on how to implement this alternative notice provision in the regulations without prescribing a specific formula or approach that may not be appropriate in all circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required newspaper notices must appear as display advertisements within the newspapers. This provision clarifies the form in which the official public notice must appear in the papers. As defined by this proposed rule, a display ad must be of sufficient size to be seen easily by the reader.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends the display ad requirement to make information about the pre-application meeting more visible within the newspaper. The display ad must be placed in a section of the newspaper that the average reader is likely to see, or in a manner that otherwise gives the general public effective notice. Currently, most public notices related to RCRA permitting appear as legal notices. However, EPA proposes to change this practice for the notice at pre-application in response to public concerns that legal notices are not widely read.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA encourages facilities and permit writers, if it is within their means, to apply this requirement to other notices published in the newspaper. The requirements proposed in today's rule are in no way meant to inhibit additional public involvement activities that the owner or operator or the regulatory agency could carry out voluntarily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

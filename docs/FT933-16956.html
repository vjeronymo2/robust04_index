			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (6): Tuned to the single market / Profile of BHF's banking operations BHF-Bank is often described as a small, Frankfurt-based merchant bank - a description which is in some ways misleading. BHF is not that small: with assets of DM54bn at the end of last year it ranks as Germany's eighth largest private sector bank. And as Mr Wolfgang Strutz, its senior partner, concedes, it is not a merchant bank in the English sense of the term. It is highly active in mergers and acquisitions advice and other fee-earning business, but the lion's share of its earnings comes from commercial lending. Furthermore, BHF may be based in Frankfurt, but with about 60 per cent of lending going to international customers, it claims to have the most international business profile of any German bank. 'In fact,' Mr Strutz says, 'we are one of a kind, very different from other German financial institutions. This begins with our legal structure - six general partners are personally liable for the bank's entire business - and extends to the type of business we pursue. 'Like other large German institutions we are a universal bank, in that we combine a large range of financial services under one roof; but we don't do everything that a universal bank could do. 'We avoid small retail customers and steer clear of low-margin volume business. Our target clients are businesses with turnover of DM100m or more and high net worth individuals.' The bank has had above average growth in profits over the last 10 years, is represented in 12 German cities and had branches or subsidiaries in the world's big financial and industrial centres. Mr Strutz says that the bank's aim is to concentrate on four main business areas: treasury activities, with currency trading operations in New York, London, Tokyo and Frankfurt; commercial lending; asset management, concentrating on the core markets of Germany, Switzerland and France; and corporate finance. BHF has taken two important strategic steps since the beginning of this year, with the aim of bolstering its international corporate finance activities and its domestic lending business. First, together with its French associate Credit Commercial de France, BHF will pay Pounds 235m to buy a 90 per cent stake in Charterhouse, a London-based merchant bank. Second, it forged a domestic co-operation agreement with IKB Deutsche Industriekreditbank, a Dusseldorf-based bank which specialises in providing long-term finance to small and medium-sized businesses. The agreement is underpinned by a share exchange under which BHF took a 10 per cent stake in IKB, while IKB bought 3.5 per cent of BHF's shares. Together the two institutions have total business volume of DM100bn The acquisition of Charterhouse is the more ambitious of the two moves, representing a determined attempt to build up a pan-European corporate finance group. 'We are convinced that as the process of European union gathers pace, cross-border mergers and acquisitions will become more important than ever before,' Mr Strutz says, explaining the rationale behind the move. 'As medium-sized companies gear up to face the realities of a single market they will face a growing need to seek external sources of capital and will be increasingly obliged to seek third-party cross-border financial advice. 'We decided that the best way to tackle the market was not by setting up our own subsidiary or taking a passive financial investment - but to make an outright purchase. 'Either of us (BHF or CCF) could have done the deal on our own,' says Mr Strutz, 'but this would have done no more than bring one institution's home market into the equation. The way we have done it creates something unusual  -a trilogy of corporate finance operations in London, Paris and Frankfurt.' The aim is to make the services of this triple alliance available to BHF's domestic client base - and also to the 8,000 medium-sized companies which are clients of IKB.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STEALTH ATTACK: Heeding fears of increased airport noise, Congress last year  passed a law to assure that commercial carriers couldn't use the El Toro Marine  Corps Air Station. . . . But that hasn't stopped Federal Express from a second  quiet attempt to use the base for its cargo jets. At the behest of Sen. Wendell  H. Ford (D-Ky.), congressional investigators will visit El Toro July 11 to look  once again into the idea of "joint civil/military use" of the base. . . . Rep.  Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), author of the El Toro ban, reacted angrily:  "This is illegal . . . it's certainly a waste of taxpayers' money." Jeffrey A.  Perlman and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SEABEES SENT TO MIDEAST AND TO GUAM;  </P> <P> PORT HUENEME: BATTALION 4 HAS LEFT PUERTO RICO FOR SAUDI ARABIA. BATTALION 40  IS IN ROTATION WITH ANOTHER UNIT.  </P> <P> One Port Hueneme-based Seabee battalion has left its post in Puerto Rico for  Saudi Arabia and another battalion has been sent to Guam, possibly en route to  the Middle East, according to Navy officials and family members of troops.  </P> <P> "The Seabees have left Port Hueneme," said Port Hueneme spokeswoman Linda  Wadley in confirming the departure of the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion  40. Battalion 4, which has been stationed in Puerto Rico, left for Saudi Arabia  on Tuesday, said relatives of unit members.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Curtiss, which has been ordered to join the U.S. forces in the  Arabian Sea, returned to its berth at Port Hueneme's deep-water harbor to  repair a malfunctioning water pump that supplies the ship's boilers.  </P> <P> "It was minor engineering problems with her boiler feed pump," said Marge  Holtz, director of public affairs for the Navy's Military Sealift Command in  Washington. "She is going to get underway on Friday." The Curtiss, designed to  repair Marine Corps jets and helicopters, left without carrying any Seabees,  she said.  </P> <P> Members of the 650-member Seabee Battalion 40 were flown to Guam on Wednesday.  Their departure was part of a scheduled rotation with another Seabee battalion  that just returned from a seven-month tour in Rota, Spain.  </P> <P> "I saw people muster, wearing their gear and being inspected and then, boom,  they were gone," said Richard Flock, a utilities man second class at Port  Hueneme. "It all happened very fast."  </P> <P> Navy leaders have tried to keep secret all troop movements, leading to  considerable confusion and concern on base about whether Battalion 40 will be  leaving Guam for the Middle East.  </P> <P> "They aren't telling us anything," said Lyssa O'Boyle, whose husband is in Guam  with Battalion 40. "We are all shook up," she said of herself and her five  daughters. "Sitting here and not knowing what's going on is not cool."  </P> <P> Dianna Penrose confessed that she worries about her husband, who left more than  a week ago for Guam with Battalion 40's advance party. "We just pray for  peace," she said.  </P> <P> "I haven't been able to sleep since the husbands left," said Margaret Kelly,  another wife of a Battalion 40 Seabee. Kelly, the battalion's ombudswoman,  assists other wives and family members left behind.  </P> <P> Battalion 4, which has been temporarily stationed in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto  Rico, shipped out for Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, said Sol Caceres, the wife of a  Battalion 4 Seabee. "I have some friends who are very upset because their  husbands have left.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, my husband was not able to go to the Middle East," Caceres said.  Navy officials recently called her husband back to Port Hueneme because Caceres  had complications with her pregnancy and she needed help with her three  children. "I'm lucky he is home right now," she said.  </P> <P> Port Hueneme Chaplain Ken Rodes, a Catholic priest, acknowledged that it is a  tense time for families of Seabees deployed overseas. "I would imagine if there  was shooting over there, the tension would be worse," Rodes said.  </P> <P> "But sometimes waiting is worse," he said. "Hopefully, everything will be  resolved peacefully and everyone will be able to come home."  </P> <P> In addition to turning to Port Hueneme's three chaplains, each battalion has  support groups for Seabee wives, Rodes said. "We all pull together and do what  we can."  </P> <P> Marge Hayes said she is delighted that her Seabee husband returned this week  from a seven-month tour in Rota. Until this week, his unit was the closest to  the crisis in the Middle East that began when Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait.  </P> <P> Hayes, whose father was also a Seabee, said she was concerned, but not worried  about her husband's fate. "You can't let it get to you. Otherwise, every time  he puts on a uniform, you'd be a basket case," she said.  </P> <P> John Swank, a spokesman for the federal Maritime Administration in Washington,  said the Curtiss was on a short sea trial and was supposed to return to Port  Hueneme before steaming off for the Middle East.  </P> <P> The Maritime Administration, an agency under the U.S. Department of  Transportation, is in charge of maintaining the ship until it is needed by the  Military Sealift Command. The Curtiss is run by a crew of 41 civilian mariners.  </P> <P> "There were some minor problems and repairs are under way," Swank said. "If the  Military Sealift Command expects it will be ready Friday, that sounds  reasonable to us."  </P></p>

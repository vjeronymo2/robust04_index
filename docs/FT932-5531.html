			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: Self-regulation is best route to curb excessive directors' pay Sir, Mr Broome's letter (May 29) calling for legislation to curb excessive directors' remuneration will find support with many private and some institutional shareholders. However, the Cadbury report has only been published for six months and is already changing the map of corporate governance, helped by the call from Postel/Gartmore for a reduction in three-year rolling contracts that can keep too many marginal performers in their jobs. Judging by the regulatory problems stemming from the Financial Services Act in 1986, I suspect that the self-regulatory route will be more effective and certainly quicker. The Americans are, for instance, having problems legislating for the non-tax allowability of compensation over Dollars 1m for each of the top five corporate officers in public companies when the payment has not received shareholders' approval. Shareholders could pay excessive remuneration and extra tax, thus facing a double whammy. We work for owners, compensation committees and non-executive directors and from our experience would suggest three additional areas for self-regulatory pressure: That the compensation committee advisers should be named in the annual report. That the future pension cost of directors' penultimate salary awards should be certified by the actuaries as already funded by pension surpluses or, if not, what the future corporate cost will be. That a mini-Cadbury, laying out best practice for smaller public and large private companies, should be commissioned in the very near future. For instance, the requirement to have three non-executive directors is quite unrealistic for many such boards, but there seem to be more issues concerning the independence of pension fund trustees in groups of this size.

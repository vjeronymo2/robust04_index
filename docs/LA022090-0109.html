			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER SAYS SILBERMAN SWALLOWED PILLS  </P> <P> Richard T. Silberman lost consciousness in a hotel room here last weekend after  swallowing an unknown number of prescription sleeping pills, his lawyer said  Monday, just hours before the San Diego businessman and defendant in an  upcoming money-laundering trial was released from the hospital.  </P> <P> The attorney, James Brosnahan, identified the pills as Halcion 2, a commonly  prescribed sleeping medication. Asked how many pills Silberman ingested,  Brosnahan said: "I have no comment on that because I don't have all the facts  yet."  </P> <P> Dale Pugh, a spokesman at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada,  where Silberman was rushed on Saturday evening, said that toxicology and blood  tests are incomplete.  </P> <P> According to health officials, Halcion 2 is a sleeping pill that would have to  be taken in a large dosage to result in unconsciousness.  </P> <P> Silberman, who is scheduled to stand trial in April on charges stemming from a  highly publicized and complex money-laundering case, was found by police at the  Las Vegas Hilton early Saturday night. He was found after a two-day search that  began when Silberman, a former top aide to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., told his  family he was leaving San Diego to have dinner and meet with an attorney in  Orange County. Instead, Silberman flew from Lindbergh Field to Los Angeles,  then took a flight to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> He left the the hospital about 4 p.m. Monday, looking pale and uncomfortable,  and walking very slowly. He was joined by his wife, San Diego County Supervisor  Susan Golding. Outside the hospital, he kissed her on the cheek, then they left  for the airport in Brosnahan's blue rental car.  </P> <P> As reporters followed the couple out of the medical center, Brosnahan said:  "You might want to give Mr. Silberman a little room. He's had a tough, tough  time."  </P> <P> Silberman said nothing.  </P> <P> He has been under pressure in recent months, culminating with the release last  week of an FBI report that alleges he confessed to participating in a  money-laundering operation.  </P> <P> Silberman, reputed San Diego mobster Chris Petti and three other men are  charged with laundering $300,000 they thought was illegal drug money from  Colombian traffickers. The cash was actually put up by an undercover FBI agent  as part of an elaborate sting operation that was revealed upon Silberman's  arrest last April 7.  </P> <P> Brosnahan said that a federal judge's comment that the alleged confession was  "self-incriminating" for Silberman prompted his client's disappearance.  </P> <P> The lawyer said the turn of events in the Silberman case could provide even  more reason for a new judge to be assigned to it or for the trial to be heard  outside San Diego County, where there has been very heavy media attention.  </P> <P> Despite the circumstances surrounding Silberman's disappearance and subsequent  rescue, his lawyer insisted that the public should not conclude that the  episode was a ruse or an attempt by Silberman to win sympathy.  </P> <P> "They would be absolutely wrong about that," Brosnahan said. "The police  officer in Las Vegas, the judgment of the doctors here at the hospital who have  treated him, both in the emergency ward on Saturday night and upstairs on the  fifth floor all day Sunday, the judgment of the nurses and all of that, make it  very clear there is no possibility of such a thing."  </P></p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Support for flexible pension age A FLEXIBLE rather than a common fixed pension age for men and women is favoured by 60 per cent of managers, according to a British Institute of Management survey published today. The finding will add to pressure on the government to move from its position of favouring a fixed age. Under a fixed plan, the age women would become eligible for a state pension would rise from 60 to either 63 or 65 - the current pension age for men. Of those managers surveyed who wanted a flexible approach to retirement, three-quarters favoured a scheme which would enable people to claim a larger state pension the later they retired. One in six wanted a split scheme under which part of the state pension would be payable at 60 and the rest at 65. Of 3,000 BIM members surveyed, 330 responded.</p>

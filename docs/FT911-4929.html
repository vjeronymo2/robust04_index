			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: An undiminished appetite for growth - Charles Leadbeater on Morgan Crucible's cash-raising habit RIGHTS ISSUES seem to have become habit-forming at Morgan Crucible, the industrial materials group. In each of the past five years it has had some form of paper money-raising drive to pick up about Pounds 200m for a string of acquisitions which has fuelled its growth. With hardly a pause to burp before digesting acquisitions it made last year, Morgan has moved onto the next course. On Monday it announced a Pounds 96m rights issue to fund a set of deals, which are being thrown up as the recession forces a shake-out among competitors in the US and continental Europe. Morgan's undiminished appetite for acquisitions and its lack of inhibition in seeking more capital from its shareholders raises a central question about the group's strategy and future. What sort of company is Morgan Crucible becoming? There are two sides to its character. It could be a free wheeling, mini-conglomerate driven by an ambition for bids and deals it cannot fund from its own cashflow. Alternatively, it could be a solid materials technology company which is attempting to become a world force in its chosen areas by buying up small and medium sized companies in traditionally fragmented industries. Just as there are these two sides to Morgan's character so there are two quite different accounts of its performance. The sceptics argue that Morgan treads too close to the edge. It has ruled out financing acquisitions by borrowing. Net debt rose from Pounds 110m to Pounds 118m last year. Gearing is 60 per cent. It cannot generate enough cash from its own operations to fund acquisitions. So after much soul searching it is making another cash call upon shareholders. Yet its record for spotting the right acquisitions is mixed. Dr Bruce Farmer, Morgan's chief executive, disclosed that at least two of the deals of the mid-1980s which were meant to have a strategic significance may be unravelled. The car care division of Holt Lloyd, acquired in 1986, may well be sold in 1992 or 1993. Morgan is also planning to leave defence electronics which was meant to be built around its purchase of First Castle Electronics. That deal led to a lengthy legal wrangle over the price and First Castle's profit forecasts at the time of the bid, which was settled only this year. These deals seemed to have been the openings to a four-year journey down blind alleys. The string of deals makes it difficult to pin down Morgan's underlying performance. Although pre-tax profits for the past year were up 10 per cent, in the second half there was a marked downturn in several areas. This was partially offset by the turnover and operating profit bought in by acquisitions and some accounting for currencies and interest which raised eyebrows among some analysts. The believers tell a very different tale. Morgan has been transformed by hard management graft. At the depth of recession in the early 1980s Morgan made a loss. Its pre-tax profit in the final months of 1990 was up on 1989. Since 1982 it has sold 19 businesses and closed 21 sites. The late 1970s had delivered five very flat years for Morgan. The new management installed under Dr Farmer injected growth. Holt Lloyd formed the basis for a thriving speciality chemicals business in the US. Morgan is not alone in seeking to get out of defence electronics and most British car retail and components groups have seen their profits fall in the last year. Morgan has a good record with acquisitions in its specialist fields where it has strong niche positions. One of the deals it is currently considering could make it Europe's leading producer of technical ceramics. A Pounds 24m deal in January brought it Dulmison, an Australian ceramics producer with annual sales of Pounds 58m, profits of Pounds 8m and factories in the US and Thailand. Although it cut investment by 40 per cent last year, since 1982 it has invested more than double its depreciation charge each year. It can generate organic growth: talks with Italian tap makers has created a Pounds 40m a year business in ceramic discs for bathroom equipment. The company has a wide spread of customer industries stretching from automotive and chemicals, to metal bashers and rail equipment makers. Its internationalisation has also been impressive. In 1979 about 44 per cent of sales were in the UK, compared with 18 per cent last year. Its internationalisation is continuing. It has three joint ventures in China, one in production the other two signed up. It is expanding in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, as well as exploring deals in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. For those hoping that Morgan will resolve tensions between the two aspects of its character, Dr Farmer offers little hope. Asked whether the company should model itself on BTR or become a specialist producer of ceramics and carbon, he replies: 'We should be somewhere between the two.'</p>

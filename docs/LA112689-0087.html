			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURE M AND THE NORTH COUNTY  </P> <P> As a North County resident, I can tell you that my "no" vote on M had nothing  to do with tax rebellion or the like (Nov.16). The 10 pieces of mail and the  five phone calls I received several days before the election convinced me that  this was no "citizen initiative" but a multimillion-dollar campaign by land  developers supported by politicians who depend on their contributions and  influence.  </P> <P> The net effect of Measure M was to improve the probability that developers  could continue to build homes in the southern and southeastern fringes of the  county by making commuting from these outlying areas easier. This would further  entice homeowners and others to move from the older, and in some cases  declining, neighborhoods in the north to newer suburbs in the south.  </P> <P> Measure M provided little in the way of mass transit in the increasingly dense  north where it might have had a chance of succeeding, financed by a sales  rather than gas tax.  </P> <P> As a person who normally votes in favor of public works projects and bond  issues and who found some good aspects of M, I nevertheless voted against it  for the reasons given above.  </P> <P> ROBERT C. BELLOLI  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

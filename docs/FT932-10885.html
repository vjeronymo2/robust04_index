			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): S-E Banken rises on hopes for recovery A slight easing in Germany's repo rate had no significant impact on activity yesterday, although there were suggestions that France would soon make a further cut in its interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM took the recovery theme to heart encouraged it seemed by first quarter results from S-E Banken which showed a decline in non-performing loans. The C shares surged to a day's high of SKr28.50 before slipping back to close up SKr6.50 at SKr22.00 in exceptionally strong turnover. The Affarsvarlden index rose 10.70 or 1 per cent to 1,052.10, a new year's high, in turnover of some SKr1.5bn. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel in London noted that a question mark remained over the bank's recovery prospects since it still required a fresh cash injection. Another analyst remarked that while the bank remained a high risk play the market was of the opinion that it had turned the corner. Mr Longmuir added that after a few weeks of drift in the market a new mood of optimism appeared to have taken hold, encouraged also by other corporate news. Ericsson was a case in point, gaining SKr7 in the B shares to SKr291, after winning a contract to supply mobile telecommunications equipment to Germany. Stora, the forestry products group, was another to benefit, adding SKr8 or 2.6 per cent to SKr317 in the B's, on first quarter results. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by first quarter results from Philips which came in above expectations. The group's shares gained Fl 2.00 or 8 per cent to Fl 27.30 for a new year's high. Analysts commented that there had been a positive meeting with the group and, while trading in Europe remained difficult with the consumer electronics division still under pressure, the overall picture was good. The CBS Tendency index improved 1.00 to 108.3. PARIS gained on light buying but overall trading remained subdued on worries over economic prospects. The CAC-40 index rose 2.71 to 1,926.34 in turnover of FFr1.8bn. Peugeot, which lost ground on Tuesday on poor car sales figure for April, rebounded FFr13 to FFr557, while Canal Plus gained FFr27 to FFr1,317 after a rise in first quarter turnover. FRANKFURT, however, eased in light selling, but the index recovered from its day's lows on better than expected corporate earnings results. The DAX lost 4.21 to 1,623.16 in turnover of DM6.2bn. An analyst at Smith New Court said that investors were starting to realise that previous expectations for weak company profits were over-pessimistic. A 33.7 per cent rise in 1992 group net earnings, and reports that Schering's first quarter profit fall was less than expected, lifted sentiment. Kaufhof rose DM15 to DM475, while Schering closed up DM15 at DM759. MILAN turned lower, with investors hesitant ahead of today's confidence debate on the newly-appointed government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Miss Marie-Christine Keith of NatWest Securities in London said that the market was, to an extent, already discounting the vote of confidence. However, in the absence of any surprises, a 'yes' vote was likely to give prices a modest boost. The Comit index shed 4.48 to 541.1, taking its lead from a lower trend by Fiat after it forecast lower net profit for 1992 and declined to give details of dividends. The shares lost L124 to L6,726 before easing to L6,670 after-hours. ZURICH extended early gains and the SMI index rose 6.7 to 2,166.7. The advance was supported by a strong financial sector, benefiting from the firm Swiss franc which was at a year's high against the D-mark. UBS bearers, trading ex the SFr29 dividend, finished SFr18 lower at SFr919. SBC added SFr8 to SFr345. COPENHAGEN advanced as hopes of a positive outcome from the May 18 referendum over the Maastricht treaty spurred active buying. The KFX index gained 0.94 or 1.1 per cent, to 87.73 in turnover of DKr754m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 5                                               THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open     10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1148.53   1148.67     1149.39    1150.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1203.44   1202.90     1203.27    1203.78  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00     14.00       15.00      close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1151.35   1152.79     1152.99    1153.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1204.65   1204.90     1205.81    1206.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         May 4    Apr 30    Apr 29    Apr 28    Apr 27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.16   1144.33   1143.23   1154.98   1149.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1207.82   1206.79   1199.62   1212.69   1213.85  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1154.19; 200 - 1207.53 Low/day: 100 - 1148.03 200 - 1201.58.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

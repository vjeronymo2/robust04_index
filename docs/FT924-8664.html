			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Observer: Tragicomedy? The once invincible Hanson has apparently been trounced on yet another front. Hot on the heels of the RHM defeat comes word that Hanson's Peabody seems to have lost out to a higher bidder in picking up the Australian coal interests of Costain. So it is perhaps appropriate that yesteryear's mighty corporate raider, which in its glory days habitually put the name of its companies to the turf, or motorcycles or snooker, should now be turning to the gentler thespian world when dispensing its sponsorship largesse. With Hanson in advanced negotiations to inject Pounds 1m into the struggling National Youth Theatre - which this autumn staged a show entitled Maps for Lost Lovers - suggestions are invited as to which play the budding actors should consider next that would best capture the current mood at 1 Grosvenor Place.</p>

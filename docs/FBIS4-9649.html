			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Excerpt] [Announcer] President Lech Walesa, who took part  in ceremonies today to mark the 70th anniversary of the National  Bank of Poland, said he would support Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak in bringing the strike situation under control.    [Walesa] "I will try to support the young prime minister. I  have experience with strikes--the polystyrene strikes, for  example. The prime minister has less experience, so we will  have to think about support where it is possible, while trying  to ensure that there are no mistakes in the decisions.    This matter has been going on too long. It really should  have been resolved much earlier."    [Announcer] The president denied that he was pleased that  there were strikes.    [Walesa] "I hear that it's a good thing for me that the  strikes are continuing. I hear it...[Walesa pauses] Well,  Lepper, you can say he's not to be taken seriously, but serious  people--I think it was Bronislaw Geremek who said that it was  good for me that the strikes were continuing. [sentence as  heard] That's getting hold of the wrong end of the stick  completely. I oppose strikes, although I went on strike many  times myself, but that was when there was no other way to settle  matters." [passage omitted]</p>

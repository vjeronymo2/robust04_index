			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GUN MISFIRES; THREATENED TOT UNHURT  </P> <P> A 2-year-old child narrowly escaped death Friday as an armed robber entered her  parents' jewelry store on University Avenue and fired a .22-caliber automatic  pistol at the toddler, but the weapon misfired.  </P> <P> "It was a miracle that the child wasn't killed," San Diego Police Lt. Bruce  Pfefferkorn said.  </P> <P> The pistol was loaded with a round in the chamber when the suspect, Anh Ngoc  Nguyen, fired at the little girl, police said. The firing pin struck the  primer, but the bullet failed to discharge, Pfefferkorn said.  </P> <P> According to police, Nguyen, 39, entered a jewelry store owned by O.V. Lang and  Nay Bac in the 4700 block of University Avenue at 4:26 p.m. Nguyen pulled out a  pistol and attempted to rob the couple, hitting Lang on the head with it.  </P> <P> The parents ran from the store, leaving 2-year-old Sandy Bac inside.  Pfefferkorn said the mother told police that she saw Nguyen point the gun at  the child and pull the trigger.  </P> <P> As the mother watched from outside the store, other witnesses called police.  Officer David Headley arrived moments later and moved toward the store,  Pfefferkorn said. Headley yelled at Nguyen to come out and the suspect left the  store, leaving the gun and child inside, police said.  </P> <P> Nguyen was taken to County Jail downtown. Pfefferkorn said Nguyen was being  held on suspicion of a number of changes, including attempted murder, assault  with a deadly weapon, robbery, felony child endangerment and false arrest.  </P></p>

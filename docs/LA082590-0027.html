			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHOW'S ON WAY OUT BECAUSE OF HIMSELF  </P> <P> The change in colors of the Padre uniforms is long overdue. The ugly mud and  yellow has been an eyesore for many years. The change to blue and orange will  be most welcome by all San Diego Padre fans, and I commend the new owners, one  and all.  </P> <P> BOB FARRAR  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

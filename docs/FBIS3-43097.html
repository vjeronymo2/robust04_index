			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. N. Bubennikov, A. Ye. Kargashin, Moscow </F> Institute of Cybernetic Problems; UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] Numerical physico-technological studies of  complimentary polysilicon transistor structures (TS) with  identical, nearly optimal profiles of impurity distribution and  identical technologies were performed at T=300 K, taking into  account the temperature-concentration relationships of  mobilities of major and minor carriers in these structures. The  complete distribution profiles, identical for n-p-n and p-n-p  transistor structures with arsenite (As) emitter and collector  and boron (B) base for the former, and also with B-emitter and  collector and boron base for the latter are shown in graphs.  Static and quasi- static parameters of complimentary TS with  identical profiles of impurity distribution and topology with  the emitter surface S[.sup]E[/]=1m[.sup]2[/], were  examined applying identical physico-topological (PT) models. The  rate of effective surface recombination at the emitter contacts  n-p-n and p-n-p of the TS was S[.sup]p[/]=  1.2x10[.sup]5[/] cm/sec at annealing temperature T &lt;  900 C. Graphs are also provided showing the results of PT  modeling the current-volt characteristic I[.sup]K[/],  I[.sup]B[/]= f(U[.sub]EB[/]) of complementary TS, the  current transfer ratio as a function of the collector current  B=f(I[.sup]K[/]), and the emitter capacitance as a function  of the collector current C[.sup]TE[/]=f(I[.sub]K[/]).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian sources in Tunis have informed our  correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  has issued instructions to the Palestinian security agencies in  Gaza and Jericho to be in direct contact with him and that no  agency should interfere in the affairs of another.    Our correspondent says that security offices were opened  recently in Jericho in addition to the preventive security  office headed by Colonel Jibril al-Rujub. Among these is a  presidential security office headed by Abu-al-Tayyib, a former  Force-17 commander, and a general security office headed by Amin  al-Hindi. 'Arafat issued his orders in the wake of internal  struggles between these agencies.</p>

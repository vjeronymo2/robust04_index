			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY  </P> <P> William Schneider wrote (Opinion, July 1) that the liberals in Congress are  concerned about the kind of tax increase likely to be in the budget deal. "Last  week, 134 House Democrats signed a letter to Foley . . . warning that they  would not support any agreement with the White House that puts a further burden  on (middle-income) families rather than the very wealthy."  </P> <P> In the same issue, Robert L. Borosage (Commentary page) wrote that most of us  are already paying a tax increase. Nine out of every 10 American families now  pay more in federal taxes than they did before the Republicans took over the  White House in 1980. Only the richest 10% enjoy a significant tax break.  </P> <P> Robert Kuttner, writing in The Times (Nov. 13) pointed out that so much of our  red ink comes from under-taxing the rich. Raising taxes of the nation's richest  1% would raise about $130 billion in the nation's treasury. "Since 1977, before  the supply-side revolution the top 1% of households had just 9.2% of the  national income. Since 1977, the annual tax bill paid by the richest 1% has  declined by about $50 billion a year, while their income, in real terms, has  gone up by 74%."  </P> <P> It isn't necessary for President Bush to raise taxes. He merely must return our  income tax structure to 1970 levels when the wealthiest were paying their fair  share. The trickle-down theory didn't work in the 1920s, and it certainly isn't  working now.  </P> <P> S.M. ROSEN  </P> <P> Newbury Park  </P></p>

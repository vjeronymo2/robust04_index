			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Trade gap rises to Pounds 1.04bn The UK's visible trade deficit widened to Pounds 1.04bn in November as the value of exports fell 5.5 per cent from October. Meanwhile, a net Pounds 700m revision to earlier figures pushed up the deficit for the first 11 months of 1993 to Pounds 11.2bn. The figures, published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, show that imports have been growing in volume terms while exports have been falling over the last few months. However, the impact of this on the deficit has been disguised by falling import prices. In the three months to November, import prices were 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months while export prices were 2 per cent higher. The CSO estimates that the trend in exports is a 0.5 per cent decline per month while imports are increasing at 0.5 per cent a month. The visible trade deficit with European Union countries in November was Pounds 262m. Added to the Pounds 773m deficit with non-EU countries, which had already been reported, the November deficit was just under Pounds 1.04bn  -up from Pounds 703m in October. The CSO said there had been a fall in exports to France but an increase to Germany. EU trade figures are now collected under the Intrastat system, which is based on the collection of value added tax. Since the new system was introduced at the start of last year, there has been a sharp divergence in the trend of EU and non-EU trade. Many City economists believe this has been caused by the under-recording of EU imports. The CSO said it was investigating this possibility. Meanwhile, the CSO gave more details of the so-called 'Rotterdam effect', which it had previously used to explain the divergence. Before the introduction of Intrastat, some exports may have been recorded as coming from Rotterdam, when they had merely passed through the port. Under the new system, such imports are now correctly being recorded as coming from outside the EU. The CSO feels this factor may account for about Pounds 100m of reclassified imports a month. If oil and erratics are excluded, the November deficit was Pounds 1.42bn, up from Pounds 1.21bn in October. In seasonally adjusted volume terms, non-oil and erratic exports were 2 per cent lower in the three months to November than in the previous three months while imports were 3 per cent higher. Mr Robert Barrie, UK economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the rise in imports could have been caused by stockbuilding and investment by companies as the recovery became more broadly based.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TRADE WITH COUNTRIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EU Balance of payments basis (Pounds m seasonally adjusted)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Exports                         Imports          -----------------------------    ----------------------------                    Countries                       Countries          European    outside     Whole    European    outside    Whole             Union     the EU     world       Union     the EU    world  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- '91        58,936     44,477   103,413     59,814     53,883   113,697 '92        60,365     46,682   107,047     64,022     56,431   120,453 '93           n/a     57,232       n/a        n/a     66,771       n/a  Q1        16,388     13,600    29,988     16,605     16,730    33,335  Q2        15,589     14,141    29,730     16,638     16,297    32,935  Q3        16,265     14,526    30,791     16,703     16,953    33,656  Q4           n/a     14,965       n/a        n/a     16,791       n/a Jun         5,283      4,841    10,124      5,690      5,421    11,111 Jly         5,194      4,828    10,022      5,614      5,582    11,196 Aug         5,665      4,884    10,549      5,314      5,620    10,934 Sep         5,406      4,814    10,220      5,775      5,751    11,526 Oct         5,254      5,174    10,428      5,579      5,552    11,131 Nov         5,072      4,781     9,853      5,334      5,554    10,888 Dec           n/a      5,010       n/a        n/a      5,685       n/a  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Visible balance          ------------------------------                    Countries          European    outside      Whole    Invisibles     Current             Union     the EU      world       balance     balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- '91          -878     -9,406    -10,284         2,632      -7,652 '92        -3,657     -9,749    -13,406         4,859      -8,547 '93           n/a     -9,539        n/a           n/a         n/a Q1           -217     -3,130     -3,347           393      -2,954 Q2         -1,049     -2,156     -3,205           708      -2,497 Q3           -438     -2,427     -2,865           777      -2,088 Q4            n/a     -1,826        n/a           n/a         n/a Jun          -407       -580       -987 Jly          -420       -754     -1,174 Aug           351       -736       -385 Sep          -369       -937     -1,306 Oct          -325       -378       -703 Nov          -262       -773     -1,035 Dec           n/a       -675        n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source CSO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

NPR&hyph;9 and NPF&hyph;17, which authorize operation of the McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, respectively. The licenses provide, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facilities consist of two pressurized water reactors, McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, at the licensee's site located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title 10 CFR 50.60, ``Acceptance Criteria for Fracture Prevention Measures for Light-water Nuclear Power Reactors for Normal Operation,'' states that all light-water nuclear power reactors must meet the fracture toughness and material surveillance program requirements for the reactor coolant pressure boundary as set forth in appendices G and H to 10 CFR part 50. Apendix G to 10 CFR part 50 defines pressure/temperature (P/T) limits during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic tests to which the pressure boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime. 10 CFR 50.60(b) specifies that alternatives to the described requirements in appendices G and H to 10 CFR part 50 may be used when an exemption is granted by the Commission under 10 CFR 50.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To prevent low temperature overpressure transients that would produce pressure excursions exceeding the appendix G P/T limits while the reactor is operating at low temperatures, the licensee installed a low temperature overpressure (LTOP) system. The system includes pressure-relieving devices called Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs). The PORVs are set at a pressure low enough so that if an LTOP transient occurred, the mitigation system would prevent the pressure in the reactor vessel from exceeding the appendix G P/T limits. To prevent the PORVs from lifting as a result of normal operating pressure surges (e.g., reactor coolant pump starting, and shifting operating charging pumps) with the reactor coolant system in a water solid condition, the operating pressure must be maintained below the PORV setpoint. In addition, in order to prevent cavitation of a reactor coolant pump, the operator must maintain a differential pressure across the reactor coolant pump seals. Hence, the licensee must operate the plant in a pressure window that is defined as the difference between the minimum required pressure to start a reactor coolant pump and the operating margin to prevent lifting of the PORVs due to normal operating pressure surges. The licensee LTOP analysis indicates that using the appendix G safety margins to determine the PORV setpoint would result in a pressure setpoint within its operating window, but there would be no margin for normal operating pressure surges. Therefore, operating with these limits could result in the lifting of the PORVs and cavitation of the reactor coolant pumps during normal operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee proposed that in determining the design setpoint for LTOP events for McGuire Units 1 and 2, the allowable pressure be determined using the safety margins developed in an alternate methodology in lieu of the safety margins currently required by appendix G, 10 CFR part 50. Designated Code Case N&hyph;514, the proposed alternate methodology is consistent with guidelines developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Working Group on Operating Plant Criteria to define pressure limits during LTOP events that avoid certain unnecessary operational restrictions, provide adequate margins against failure of the reactor pressure vessel, and reduce the potential for unnecessary activation of pressure-relieving devices used for LTOP. Code Case N&hyph;514, ``Low Temperature Overpressure Protection,'' has been approved by the ASME Code Committee. The content of this code case has been incorporated into appendix G of section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda to Section XI. The MRC staff is revising 10 CFR 50.55a, which will endorse the 1993 Addenda and appendix G of Section XI into the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exemption from 10 CFR 50.60 is required to use the alternate methodology for calculating the maximum allowable pressure for the LTOP setpoint. By application dated June 28, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.60 for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated August 18, 1994 (and further clarified by letter dated September 7, 1994), the licensee supplied additional information that described the use of a secondary side heat source to permit the heatup of the reactor coolant system, assuming that the exemption was not granted. Since the secondary side heat source could cause primary side transients, the staff considers the use of a secondary side heat source to be an undesirable method of operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

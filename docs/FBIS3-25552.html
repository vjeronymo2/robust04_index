The measures were decided after violent  demonstrations by pupils and students shook the Malian capital  on 15 February. Four persons, including a gendarme, were  injured, and there was considerable material damage.    These troubles have led the Malian Government to close down  the country's educational institutions "until further notice,"  and to order the arrest of those suspected of instigating the  revolt. The identities and number of persons arrested have not  been given. The government did, however, announce that it had  ordered the closing down of Radio Kaira," a private FM station  that broadcasts in the Bamako area.    The radio is said to have close ties to the National  Committee for Democratic Initiative, an opposition political  party that recently withdrew its three ministers from the  government. On 15 February, it opened its studios to  demonstrators, who seized the opportunity to call for another  gathering the following day. It also denounced the "kidnapping"  by "two unknown persons" of a student leader, who was receiving  treatment in a Bamako hospital. Unauthorized marches and  demonstrations have been going on regularly in Mali since the  advent of democracy in March 1991, and it has cost the state  about 100 million CFA francs to maintain order, according to  some sources.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (4): Expectations far too great - Why tenants become dissatisfied DO COMPANIES get the business parks they deserve, or should developers be responsible for ensuring that their business park tenants remain satisfied? This philosophical issue is raised by research carried out last year by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. The surveyors interviewed 140 companies, occupying 3.6m sq ft or 15 per cent of all space taken up on business parks since 1987. And first impressions are that occupiers have only themselves to blame if they are dissatisfied with their choice. 'Occupier satisfaction is inversely proportional,' the surveyors concluded, 'to the weight attached by would-be occupiers to the various attributes . . . at the time the decision . . . is made. 'When selecting between competing schemes, occupiers place considerable emphasis on location, accessibility, environment and image. As a result these attributes have generally proved satisfactory. In contrast inadequate attention is given to . . . the size of the scheme or . . . the dissatisfaction in later years.' But if it is true that tenants are at fault in regarding real estate matters of secondary importance, the developer - by definition a specialist in property - must be better placed than the incoming general manager of, say, a software business, to spot or avoid the ominous list of problems ranging from leaking windows to poor insulation or prohibitive running costs. Yet, it would be no fairer to place the onus for customer dissatisfaction on the developer. He too, in some respects, can be a victim of the pressures which led to the growth of out-of-town business parks during the 80s. As Debenham notes, it was somewhat naive to extol the virtues of an out-of-town location without providing for or addressing its notable drawbacks. Car parking and a better environment are not everything. Rural locations can mean isolation: poor public transport and back-up facilities, few neighbours and only a few staff nearby. These problems have been under-estimated: from government anxious to alleviate the problems of congestion in the main cities, to local planners eager to promote their own districts. If developers cannot be held solely responsible for creating business parks in poor locations, neither should they bear all the blame for occupiers' dissatisfaction with their buildings and amenities after a few years. Some of this dissatisfaction springs from increased expectations and the changing nature of industry's needs. Demand for air conditioning and suspended ceilings, for instance, has been so swift and widespread that it is not surprising that some developments have been caught out. It will be a sign of the maturity of business parks as an idea when enough of them exist to offer a range of specifications so that occupiers can move from one set of premises or from one park to another as their needs change. Meanwhile, occupiers will continue to complain about the lack of such amenities as their expectations rise and they begin to think they should be offered as standard. That is just a fact of life and all the developer can hope to achieve is to run constantly just behind the demand. The occupier must take responsibility, however, for demanding the level or specification which he can reasonably predict that his business will need. After all, just as the property specialist knows more about insulation and window seals, so the business manager should know what services he needs. Complaints about the lack of amenities in the park itself rather than within individual premises are frequent; and here responsibility should probably be shared. Genus, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary, is well satisfied on the whole with its new headquarters on 87-acre Crewe Business Park in Derbyshire, but Dr John Craven, its managing director, does confess to a feeling of isolation. Genus and Barclays Bank are the only two companies to be actually on site. It is probable that Genus would have been better to wait until the park was in a later phase of its development. For their part the joint local authority developers should probably have addressed the question of on-site facilities at an earlier stage. Only now, for instance, are they talking to Holiday Inn about an hotel which will provide restaurant services to local workers as well as to hotel guests. Another area where responsibility should be shared is traffic planning. Most companies which consider moving to a business park do so, at least in part, because of the traffic congestion in traditional town centres. But it is no use having good car parking and service roads on a business park which then deposits its inhabitants directly on to one of the more arid stretches of the M25 with no choice but to join the traffic jams. Debenham believes that access to public transport is bound to become an important issue. Some would say that that time has arrived, but most developers still regard business parks as a by-product of the age of the car. Even an enlightened business park developer, such as Trafalgar House, still believes that business parks and car parks go hand in hand. That attitude, if it continues, will severely limit the progress of business parks as an alternative to town centre locations, since there will be fewer and fewer sites (particularly in the congested south-east) which do not lead to traffic jams. Traffic planning is an issue on which occupiers and developers must unite; for, combined, they would form a powerful lobby which could force local planners to improve transport communications. At a different level, communications between occupiers and developers could also improve the level of satisfaction in future business parks. Debenham's study quite rightly pinpoints the developer's ignorance of users' needs as one of the causes of dissatisfaction. Are developers right, for instance, to place too much emphasis on providing bespoke premises, a feature in nearly all marketing today? Debenham's research suggests that occupiers are, on the whole, no more but no less happy in off-the-peg properties whether fully fitted or finished just to shell and core standard. Few businesses seem to know this fact about themselves in advance. Detailed talks with the developer at a very early stage could prevent a significant source of future dissatisfaction.</p>

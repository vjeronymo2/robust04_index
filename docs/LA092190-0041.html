			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DON'T TELL HER IT'S ME' COULD USE TALENT BETTER  </P> <P> "Don't Tell Her It's Me (citywide) is so dreadful you have to wonder what such  established players as Steve Guttenberg, Jami Gertz, Shelley Long and Kyle  MacLachlan, in accepting this script, have turned down that could have been any  worse. The same goes for director Malcolm Mowbray, best known for "A Private  Function," one of the funniest British comedies of the past decade.  </P> <P> What was it that attracted these talented people to Sarah Bird's adaptation of  her novel "The Boyfriend School?" In his initial scenes, Guttenberg is  virtually unrecognizable -- thanks to Andy Schoneberg's special makeup effects  -- as a pale, puffy, overweight, completely bald young cartoonist named Gus who  is recovering from Hodgkin's disease.  </P> <P> Neither he nor his romance-novelist sister Lizzie (Long) are shown to be aware  that it is a kind of miracle that he has survived. Instead, Gus is feeling  sorry for himself for his temporarily unattractive appearance. Meaning to cheer  him up, Lizzie introduces him to Gertz's Emily, a journalist who is doing an  article on her. Given Gus' bad toupee and Emily's ignorance of his illness, she  is understandably unimpressed, but it's love at first sight for Gus and Lizzie  sets about whipping him back into shape.  </P> <P> In due time Gus regains his pre-disease appearance, but that's not enough for  the inventive Lizzie. She insists that he must pass himself off as a dashing  New Zealand biker, complete with Kiwi accent and long hair, in order to sweep  Emily off her feet.  </P> <P> Enough already. Surely you get the idea by now that "Don't Tell Her It's Me,"  which wastes its beautiful Charleston, S.C., settings as surely as it does its  actors, is a mite contrived. Worse than that, it's cruel and stupid at  virtually every turn. What do we make of Lizzie, a mother who calls her young  daughter "Piglet"?  </P> <P> No wonder, furthermore, the child (played by Caroline and Sally Lund,  apparently identical twins) is nearly mute when her mother spells out in  clinical detail the potentially fatal consequences of her every act of childish  curiosity. Why is Emily made to seem so dumb as to not see through the  transparent caddishness of her editor (MacLachlan)? Why ever was this  pointless, tasteless film made in the first place?  </P> <P> 'DON'T TELL HER IT'S ME'  </P> <P> A Hemdale Film Corp. presentation. Executive producers John Daly, Derek Gibson.

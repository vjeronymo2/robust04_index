			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLDEN CALLS PROBE OF BROOKINS 'A GIMMICK'  </P> <P> African Methodist Episcopal Church leaders and Councilman Nate Holden on Friday  defended a controversial education and job training program that operates out  of a building owned by Bishop H.H. Brookins.  </P> <P> "This is a gimmick," Holden said of a city investigation that concluded  Brookins had "obscured" from the city his ownership of a Southwest Los Angeles  office complex that housed the program.  </P> <P> The program was stripped of its $87,142-a-year city contract last month. The  Community Development Department said Brookins had a conflict of interest as  owner of the building and head of the program while he received rent from the  city, and that he listed the building's owner as a nonexistent California  church corporation before he acquired the property in his own name.  </P> <P> But Rev. Larry Kirkland, a member of Southern California Conference AME Church,  said the church owned the building until it was sold in 1984.  </P></p>

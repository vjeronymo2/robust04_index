			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Public spending negotiations start THE face-to-face negotiations between ministers in this year's public spending round has opened with renewed warnings that nothing in departmental programmes was sacrosanct. One sign of the toughness is that ministers in the Scottish and Welsh offices are hinting that even the previously automatic formula for spending in their department could be questioned. The formula guarantees they will have a proportion of the public spending in England. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has yet to meet either Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, or Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, for the bilateral talks. Proposals arising from the talks will go before the new committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as part of the new 'top down' system of controlling public spending agreed by the cabinet in July. Although a change to the spending formula had not been proposed by the Treasury earlier in the summer, the floating of the idea that it might be scrapped is seen as an attempt to soften Scottish and Welsh public opinion if the formula is a casualty of the spending discussions.</p>

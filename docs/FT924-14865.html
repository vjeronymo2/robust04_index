			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: F&amp;C launches trust to attract PEP investors FOREIGN &amp; Colonial, manager of the UK's largest investment trust, yesterday launched a trust aimed at attracting personal equity plan investors. The PEP Investment Trust (Pepit) has a simple capital structure consisting only of ordinary shares and will be primarily marketed as a qualifying trust for PEPs. The trust is being launched through an offer for subscription, which means the issue is not underwritten. However, F&amp;C says the minimum of Pounds 17m has already been raised. The offer period closes at noon on October 23. F&amp;C's international general trust, the UK's largest, has total assets of Pounds 1.1bn. However, due to regulations which require trusts to keep more than 50 per cent of their assets in the European Community to qualify for the Pounds 6,000 yearly allowance, the international general trust is limited to Pounds 1,500. The new Pepit will hold about 80 per cent of its stock in the UK, mostly in companies drawn from the FT-SE 100 index and the rest in Europe, allowing investors to take advantage of the full Pounds 6,000 allowance. The offer price per share is 100p and the maximum number of shares in issue following the offer will be 99.8m. The investment is balanced between capital and income growth. The annualised gross dividend yield is estimated at 4.5 per cent. The initial charge is 2.5 per cent, compared to the industry average of between 5 and 6 per cent and the annual management charge is 0.4 per cent. Pepit will have an indefinite life.</p>

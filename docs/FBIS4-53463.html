			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Hino Motors Ltd., a leading  Japanese truck maker, has developed the world's most efficient  large-scale diesel engine, a Japanese industrial daily reported  Thursday [19 May].    The turbocharged, 10000-cc engine is 10 percent more fuel  efficient than similar large-scale diesel engines without  sacrificing power and torque, the NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN said.    The engine, called P11C, uses pistons made of a new material  mixed with heat-blocking graphite to raise thermal efficiency,  in the first application of this new technology, it said.    The use of the new material makes it possible to raise  combustion efficiency to 46 percent from the previous ceiling of  43 percent for similar engines, the daily said.    Hino has used the engine in some of its large-size trucks  and  has no plans to sell the engine by itself, it said.</p>

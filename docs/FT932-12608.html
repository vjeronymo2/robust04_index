			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Private sector investment pledge THE EBRD will take steps to increase private sector investment, Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, promised yesterday, write Anthony Robinson and Robert Peston. He promised also to reinforce budgetary controls and introduce greater transparency. He was warned by Ms Anne Wibble, Swedish finance minister, new chairman of the board, that 'the time for grand designs' was over. 'I would like the bank to focus on the operational aspects of its activity,' she stressed. Mr Attali said he had considered resigning eight months ago because the pressures of building the institution were too great. However, he had been dissuaded by friends. He said that after criticism of the bank, there was now no question of his quitting until his 'baby' could 'go it alone'. Mrs Wibble said the performance of the bank, set up to help the transformation of former communist states into market economies, would be judged on how it helped develop 'new enterprises, more jobs and less poverty for the ordinary citizen'. She welcomed the bank's commitment to prepare an 'action plan' to ensure that 60 per cent of its portfolio should be in the private sector. At present only 50 per cent of signed projects are in the private sector, reflecting in particular the slow pace of privatisation in many countries and the recent addition of many new members. Mr Attali said he was under pressure from shareholders to increase the amount of equity finance provided by the bank. However, he said he was concerned at the additional risks the bank would take on and the likely delay in its move into profitability. Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, had earlier called on the bank to become more involved in equity financing of private sector projects and welcomed the recent board decision to 'interpret more flexibly' the 35 per cent limit on the bank's participation in individual projects.</p>

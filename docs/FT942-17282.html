			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Furniture contract goes to Germany The agriculture ministry's new central science laboratory in Ryedale, North Yorkshire, is to be equipped with German rather than British furniture, which would have produced a Pounds 70,000 saving. Ministers decided not to award the contract, believed to be worth Pounds 2m, to Cygnet Laboratory Furniture, a Sycamore Holdings subsidiary. They said there were doubts about whether the quality of Cygnet's samples could be sustained in a production run.</p>

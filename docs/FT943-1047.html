			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Richter Gedeon response bodes well for Budapest - International offerings Hungary last week kicked off what is set to be a busy fourth quarter in its equity offerings with the privatisation of 33.4 per cent of Richter Gedeon, the country's biggest pharmaceuticals manufacturer and one of its largest exporters. The sale, which is being combined with a capital increase, will net the company Dollars 52.4m. It is expected to be one of this year's biggest privatisations. Investment banks in Budapest said the strong foreign interest in the offering underlined western investors' confidence in Hungary, despite the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party, the former communists, in May's general elections. The international offering, to be followed by a domestic public offer of a further 3.5 per cent of the company next week, involved the sale of 4.41m ordinary shares priced at Dollars 12.30. Schroder, the UK merchant bank which joint lead-managed the private placement with Creditanstalt Securities, Budapest, said it had placed around 75 per cent with UK institutions. Shares changed hands at Dollars 13.25 - Dollars 13.75 on Friday, the first day of trading, the bank said. The successful offering is good news for the Budapest Stock Exchange, on which Richter Gedeon plans to become listed in the coming weeks. The company, which made a gross profit of more than Ft2bn on turnover of Ft11.2bn (Dollars 114m) in the first half of 1994, is also seeking listings in Vienna and on the developing markets sector of Seaq. Local brokers hope Richter Gedeon, which is set to become the BSE's largest stock by market capitalisation, will inject more liquidity into the market. Liquidity remains a problem for the exchange although it is improving. The BSE which also trades government bonds and other securities, averaged 286 deals a day in the first eight months, well up on last year's daily average of 94. Boosted by several new offerings earlier this year, shares accounted for 29 per cent of total turnover by the end of August, up from 10 per cent last year. Exchange officials hope the new issues and those planned for the autumn will help double the BSE's market capitalisation to around Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 1.1bn at the start of the year. Few companies have announced public offerings or capital increases but local analysts say several are under preparation. Janos Bartha, head of CS First Boston's local operation, says that he expects a number of private Hungarian companies to come to the market in the next six months. However, state companies undergoing privatisation are still expected to provide the majority of new offerings. Until now, trade sales have generally been Hungary's preferred privatisation method. Nevertheless, Mr Bartha says there are also state companies which have restructured enough and which do not necessarily need strategic partners which are likely to privatise via flotation. Much will depend on the new government's privatisation policy which is presently under discussion. The government has promised it will speed up privatisation and its privatisation agencies say one way of doing this could be more equity offerings. In the meantime, the government is moving ahead with privatisation of the state gas and electricity monopolies, on which it is being advised respectively by Rothschild and Schroder. In the first phase, AV Rt, the privatisation body, is planning to hold tenders for minority stakes in the five regional household gas distribution companies this autumn. MVM, the electricity company, would follow next year.</p>

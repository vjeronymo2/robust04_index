			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Paris marchers hail school victory: Protest goes ahead although education bill is struck down In France's biggest demonstration for eight years, an estimated 250,000-300,000 people yesterday marched through central Paris to show their support for state lay education. The march had been planned as a protest against the Balladur government's month-old bill allowing local authorities to increase funding to private, mainly Catholic schools. On Thursday, however, the constitutional court struck down the bill, arguing that inequalities in its implementation would breach the parity required under the constitution between public and private education. But yesterday's march still went ahead, though more in the nature of joyful victory parade than an angry protest, and it drew even more people than expected by its organisers, who were lay education bodies, teachers and other trades unions and the Socialist and Communist parties. Marchers waved laurel branches, symbol of France's secular republic, brandishing some anti-clerical placards and shouting some anti-Balladur slogans. After his biggest setback in nine months of power, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has backed down, deciding not to try to get a revamped bill past the constitutional court's objections, while calling for a new dialogue with public education backers. An opinion poll yesterday showed that the school financing defeat had not much affected Mr Balladur's own standing, but it had increased that of President Francois Mitterrand, who openly criticised the government. The defeat also damaged the reputation of Mr Francois Bayrou, the education minister, who comes from the UDF coalition party. He was urged to resign by Mr Patrick Devedjan, a maverick member of Mr Balladur's own RPR Gaullist party.</p>

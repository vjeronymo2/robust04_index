According to the general engineer of the region's bureau of  posts and telecommunications, Mr. Lin Mianyue, these foreign  funds have come from financial organizations in Switzerland,  Germany, Belgium, Finland and Canada as well as from the North  European Investment Bank with the investments covering a big  batch of items including 600,000 programme-controlled  telephones, switchboards with 30,000 long-distance lines, a  long-distance optical-fibre cable measuring 1700 kilometres, 3  switchboard centres for mobile phones, 15 stations for paging  machines, a programme-controlled system for the transmission of  telegrams, ground satellite receiving stations and automatic  letter-sorting systems. One-third of these items have already  gone into hoperation and the rest will be completed within the  coming two years.    Before the 1990s, Guangxi was very backward in the  development of its posts and telecommunications and starting  from 1992, the region has been introducing foreign capital and  pledging investment in this sector in a large-scale way with the  fixed assets investment last year alone put at RMB 1.3 billion,  surpassing the original value of the fixed assets accumulated in  the previous past 40 years. In 1993, the region saw the growth  of its gross business volume and business income from this  sector exceeding the country's average for the first time,  ranking it fourth and second respectively in the country.</p>

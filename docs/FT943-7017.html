			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hoechst upbeat after 39% rise Hoechst, the German chemicals group, yesterday reported a 39 per cent jump in first-half profits and predicted a sharp increase for the full year in spite of continued heavy restructuring costs. Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter soared almost 70 per cent to DM579m (Dollars 362m), bringing the total for the first six months to DM1bn. The group said product prices were still too low although raw material costs were rising. It noted that restructuring costs in the half were unchanged from last year while rising sales volume had lifted turnover by 7.8 per cent to DM24.7bn. The consolidation of the AgrEvo plant protection company, formed in the merger of Schering's operations into those of Hoechst, accounted for 3 per cent of the sales rise, while currency factors contributed a further 1 per cent. The results, published in an interim report, added further weight to claims that the international economic recovery is spreading and taking hold in Germany. While BASF, which last week reported a 41 per cent earnings rise, saw domestic sales fall 2.3 per cent, Hoechst reported a slight increase in German turnover. Sales at Hoechst Celanese, the north American subsidiary, rose 7 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, helped by a recovery in chemicals prices. Latin America turnover climbed 16 per cent, due in part to contracts undertaken by the Uhde chemical plant construction subsidiary. Asian sales increased 25 per cent, with two-thirds of the gain coming from first-time consolidations and currency effects.</p>

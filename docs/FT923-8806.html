			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Building society cuts rate on savings NATIONWIDE, the UK's second-largest building society, has announced cuts to its savings rates after the reduction in National Savings returns announced earlier this week. The society is cutting gross rates by about 0.4 of a percentage point, with effect from August 15. Net rates on its CashBuilder account, for example, range from 3.38 per cent on Pounds 1-Pounds 499 to 6.6 per cent on Pounds 25,000 plus. Building societies have complained about the competition offered by National Savings. They have argued that, if their margins are squeezed on the savings side, they may have to compensate by increasing the mortgage rate, thereby exacerbating troubles in the housing market. The societies have therefore welcomed the recent cuts in National Savings rates. The new rates from Nationwide are generally below the 7.5 per cent net available on two of the main National Savings products. However, Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's corporate strategy director, said: 'We believe that our new savings rates will be both competitive and realistic.' He warned that if competition forced Nationwide to increase its rates again, the society would be forced to raise mortgage rates in tandem. Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said yesterday that he had asked each of the 11 English urban development corporations to sell land for inexpensive housing. 'Many house builders have spurned the opportunity of building in the inner cities,' he said. 'They thought they knew better, paying extravagant prices for 'greenfield' sites beyond the suburbs in the late 1980s . . . Many home builders have gone bust or are now in dire financial straits for trusting to conventional wisdom.' Letters, Page 7</p>

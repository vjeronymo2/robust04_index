			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / 43% in poll would prefer Blair as PM Most voters would prefer Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, as prime minister, an ICM poll in The Guardian suggests today. The poll of 1,400 adults in 103 constituencies last week says 43 per cent believe Mr Blair would do the best job; 17 per cent back Mr John Major and 16 per cent go for Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats. A System Three poll for The Herald in Glasgow suggests that support for the Scottish National party has fallen. The poll of more than 1,000 people at the end of July suggests the nationalists dropped from 30 per cent to 27 per cent over the previous month while Labour rose from 46 per cent to 51 per cent. The Tories are unchanged at 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats down from 11 per cent to 9 per cent.</p>

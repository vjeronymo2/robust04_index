			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 12 (AFP) --  The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, which has opposed the  peace process, is prepared to cooperate with the PLO in the  police force and other public services, a source close to the  group said Tuesday [12 April].    Meanwhile, Israeli troops detained 30 to 40 suspected Hamas  members in the al-Shati' refugee camp and neighbouring Gaza City  on Monday night, Palestinian witnesses said.    The swoop came after the army announced the arrest of a  local  leader of the fundamentalist group in Jabaliya refugee camp.    Hamas has so far bitterly opposed the peace accord with  Israel and criticized the Palestine Liberation Organization for  accepting it.    But, the two groups held talks last week to settle their  disputes.    "Our national and religious duties force us to stand  united,"  said Ahmad Bahr, who has links with Hamas.    Hamas could join in the police force, provided the PLO  agreed.    "In any case, we will consider the Palestinian police as our  brothers, we will be soldiers to them and protect them.    "We do not oppose our brothers in the police force," said  Bahr, who was deported by Israel in 1992 as a Hamas suspect and  returned to Gaza three months ago.    A 9,000-strong Palestinian police force selected by the PLO  is due to be deployed in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of  Jericho to maintain order during autonomy.    "We will unite in all fields with Fatah, except in  negotiations with Israel," Bahr said, explaining that Hamas  would cooperate in education, health and public services.    Rashid Abu-Shbak, a Fatah official in Gaza, said he welcomed  the idea of HAMAS cooperation. He did not comment specifically  on the possibility of Hamas joining the police force.    "We want to start a new page based on respect between the  two  groups," said Abu-Shbak who is in charge of taking over  buildings vacated by Israelis under the autonomy deal.    A Palestinian research centre last month found that 4O  percent of the Gaza Strip would vote in elections for PLO  chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement and nearly 20 percent  for Hamas.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Capping eased for Tory authorities TWO OF the three Tory-controlled councils to have their spending for next year 'capped', or limited by the government, have had the limits relaxed slightly, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced yesterday. The budget limit for Basildon has been raised by Pounds 1.95m, and that for Warwickshire has been increased by Pounds 4m. The third council whose representations proved at least partly effective was Gloucestershire (which no one party controls), and whose spending limit has been increased by Pounds 2.59m. The cuts now represent a poll tax reduction of Pounds 41 off the Pounds 361 per head in Basildon. In Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, where the tax had been at levels of between Pounds 290 and Pounds 350, the cuts are Pounds 18 and Pounds 8 per head respectively. Mr Howard described the caps, or limits, now imposed as 'reasonable, appropriate and achievable in all the circumstances of the authorities concerned'. Five of the other seven councils whose budgets were capped had appeals against the original limits rejected. They will have three weeks to set new budgets. The capping limits will be debated by MPs today. Some MPs will welcome the relaxation of the limits announced yesterday, but the government will still be pressed about the other areas. These include Hillingdon in London, which argues that its work with child refugees at Heathrow is not properly reflected in its grant. The Local Government Commission, which is to advise on council restructuring, will begin work on the Isle of Wight on July 1, Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, told an Association of County Councils conference yesterday. He emphasised the need for attention to be paid to the views of local communities.</p>

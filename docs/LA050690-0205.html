			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOMO MASSMARKETUS'  </P> <P> I couldn't agree more with Mark C. Taylor's Endpapers article, "Love of  Learning and the Celebration of the Learned" (Book Review, April 15).  </P> <P> The norm in our society is to hail and exalt our athletes and movie stars while  totally ignoring or berating our scholars and intellectuals. Whoever makes the  most bucks receives the greatest adulation in our sick society.  </P> <P> I suggest that we make National Library Week a national holiday so everyone  will go to the library at least once a year.  </P> <P> BENNY WASSERMAN  </P> <P> LA PALMA  </P></p>

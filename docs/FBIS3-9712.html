			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kalina Stancheva on a statement by Prime Minister </F> Lyuben Berov on domestic issues for Bulgarian Radio, Television,  and BTA; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has made a statement  for Bulgarian National Radio, Television, and BTA on topical  domestic problems. The "Khorizont" program will transmit the  statement later, but here is a summary by our reporter Kalina  Stancheva:    [Stancheva] The prime minister has the impression that a new  campaign to topple the government has begun. In his statement  he disclosed the composite elements of the campaign and offered  his explanation as to why the action was starting just at this  moment. The first reason, he said, was that the two trade union  confederations had reached a common position regarding their  property. Prime Minister Berov said that the deadline of 1  September can be kept without any ultimatum. A furor is being  raised at this juncture because one of the two trade union  leaders is having difficulties with his membership. According  to Berov, the problem will be resolved before the end of August.  Professor Berov described as a gross falsehood [Podkrepa  leader] Trenchev's allegation that secret talks were being held  with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] on replacing individual  members of the cabinet and striking political bargains.    The second groundless accusation was that the Council of  Ministers is neglecting to provide bread for the people, the  prime minister said. He said that the ban on the export of  grain will remain in force until the new harvest is brought in.  Because of the threatened shortage of vegetable oil, we have  increased the export duty on sunflower seed and their products,  he said.    Prof. Berov that the government was further accused of  supplying water without charge to Turkey, but in fact Turkey is  paying three times the price paid by Bulgarian consumers.    The prime minister further said he could not understand why  the trade unions had come out against the mass privatization.  Furthermore, Dr. Kurtev [chief secretary of National  Coordinating Council of Union of Democratic Forces] has accused  the government of attempts to introduce a state of emergency.  The prime minister said that at 1200 on Friday 1 April he will  give a news conference, to which -- and here I quote Prof.  Berov's words -- I invite Dr. Trenchev, bringing with him the  damning tape recording that he claims to have in his possession.  In addition, I invite Mr. Kurtev, Mrs. Mozer [leader of  Bulgarian National Agrarian Union], and Mr. Spasov to attend,  bringing with them the list of villages in which they claim  recommunization is being carried out in the liquidation councils.    The prime minister offered the following explanation why  political groupings of various colors were mounting their attack  against his cabinet at this moment: It is because the cabinet  is determined to fulfill in a responsible way its program for  mass privatization, as well as agrarian reform, and to wage a  determined campaign against economic crime.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / National Power plan to close 10 coal-fired plants NATIONAL Power, the electricity generator, expects to close about 10 coal-fired power stations by 2000. The news comes as a severe blow to Britain's beleaguered coal industry. The closures may leave National Power with only eight coal-fired stations. It now operates two dozen power plants, including those fired by gas and oil. Most of the remaining coal-fired stations would be running at considerably less than full capacity, the company said. National Power's gloomy prognosis underlines the difficulties the government will have in privatising the coal industry. With the coal market shrinking and its future uncertain, ministers are likely to struggle to find potential buyers. Large companies have shown little interest in bidding. National Power yesterday identified only two of the doomed power stations, Thorpe Marsh in South Yorkshire and Staythorpe in Nottinghamshire, saying both will shut next spring. Mr John Baker, chief executive, said plants at risk were the smaller ones which are less efficient and can be more easily run at partial load. Typically they employ between 100 and 150 people. Plants likely to survive to the next century are thought to include Drax and Eggborough in North Yorkshire, Westburton in Nottinghamshire, Didcot in Oxfordshire, Rugeley in Staffordshire, Aberthaw in South Glamorgan, Tilbury in Essex and Ironbridge in Shropshire. National Power, publishing half-year profits of Pounds 250m, up 24 per cent, disclosed a sharp decline in its share of the electricity generating market, down from 43 per cent last year to 33 per cent. Mr John Baker, chief executive, blamed the fall on increased competition in a stagnant market from nuclear power and new gas-fired stations owned by independent companies. He said the company's market share might fall below 30 per cent. In a further setback for British Coal, Mr Baker said National Power's coal stocks were down just 1m to 18m tonnes in the half year and it was unlikely to buy additional coal this winter. In expectation of limited extra sales to National Power and PowerGen, the other large generator, British Coal has started to close about half of its remaining 30 pits. Mr Colin Webster, managing director of National Power's UK business, said the driving force behind plant closures was environmental controls. Increased controls after 2000 have been proposed by both the European Commission and the UK pollution inspectorate. Mr Baker said one coal-fired plant closure a year was likely between now and the end of the century. Coal-fired capacity would then be about 11,000MW, against 16,000MW.

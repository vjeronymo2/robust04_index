			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / New stock helps lift gilt market profits 22% GILT-EDGED market makers (Gemms) reported an overall operating profit of Pounds 49m in 1991, up 22.5 per cent on the previous year. This is only the second year since Big Bang in 1986 that the group of 18 firms has shown an overall profit. They were helped by the government's return to issuing gilts during 1991, favourable market conditions, the absence of volatile market movements, and benefits of cost-cutting. The figures, in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin*, were released ahead of publication tomorrow. Last year also marked the first time since Big Bang capital dedicated to the gilt market increased, from Pounds 395m for the group at the beginning of the year, to Pounds 432m at year-end. The figures will interest companies considering starting up as Gemms. Deutsche Bank has said it will begin trading gilts soon. Nikko, Yamaichi and Morgan Stanley are expected to follow suit. The Bank's report says only a few of the 18 Gemms incurred losses last year. A main reason given for the performance of the gilt market was the government's need to issue new stock to meet borrowing requirements. After three successive years during which the market shrank, the Bank of England began issuing gilts again in January 1991. New issues totalling Pounds 13.9bn in nominal terms were announced last year. 'There can be little doubt that the growth of the gilt market. . .acted as a stimulus to investor interest' reports the Bank. *The gilt-edged market: developments in 1991</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Rail track charges attacked The high level of charges to be levied on train operators for the use of track could discourage some teams of British Rail managers from making buy-outs bids, it emerged yesterday. Steep increases from the charges now levied by BR will push some profitable parts of the system into loss and make them dependent on considerable levels of subsidy. Although the government has promised to increase subsidies in line with higher track charges the result will damage management morale. One manager said: 'We would become a subsidised route. We are concerned about the impact on staff morale and on the negative message this will send to the outside world. We won't have the bulk of our costs under our own control. We would be happier to earn our revenues from ticket sales than from the government.' Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said when announcing the increased track charges on Tuesday that they were 50 per cent higher than the amounts charged internally by BR. The 24 rail operating companies can expect to pay about Pounds 2.2bn for use of the track. Some rail managers believe the increases for particular lines will be much higher, amounting to a doubling or trebling of charges. Other potential bidders for rail franchises said that until they were able to discuss the charges to be levied by Railtrack, which will take over BR's track and signalling from April 1, they would not be able to assess the impact on their operations. Some were hopeful that they would be able to negotiate lower charges from Railtrack, which has said that it will make refinements to its calculations in the next few months. The government has presented the increased track charges as an accounting exercise which will not have any impact in the real world. But, one industry observer said, the rail operating companies would be required to make profits and pay dividends to their shareholders, which would result in funds being syphoned out of the railway. Gatwick Express, which is likely to be the first of BR's operations to be sold off, took a more positive view of the publication of track charges. The Pounds 8m track charge allocated to the Gatwick service was in line with the amount the company had been expecting. Gatwick Express said it had not yet decided whether to apply for a subsidy. 'Other costings still have to come in but we believe we can break even,' it said. 'If we do require a subsidy we will be bidding for the lowest possible.' Rail managers said they were also concerned that by becoming more dependent on government funds they would be vulnerable to cuts in subsidies that might be decided in future. One said that the government appeared intent on making Railtrack and other parts of the rail industry profitable but keeping the train-operating companies dependent on subsidy.</p>

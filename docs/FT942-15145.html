			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Directors may avoid forced disclosure of options Company directors will almost certainly be able to keep details of their share options secret because plans for greater disclosure have been caught in a legal loophole. A proposed new accounting standard that would have forced publication in annual reports of the number and price of options granted to directors has been jeopardised because of difficulties in developing a satisfactory method of valuation. The standard, which has provoked considerable controversy and debate between companies and shareholders, was due to be circulated as a draft next month by the urgent issues taskforce of the Accounting Standards Board. Members of the taskforce had approved the text of a standard that would have required a table showing in total and by director the number of options and their exercise price. However, legal advice recently obtained by the taskforce suggests that company law requires disclosure of options only if they can be effectively valued. Because they cannot, the lawyers say disclosure of option prices is not necessary for compliance with the law. The legal opinion is a severe blow to the efforts of the taskforce to push for greater disclosure at a time when there is growing pressure for clearer accountability of senior management and for their pay to be linked to performance. The opinion will also make it more difficult to fulfil the recommendations for complete information on directors' remuneration made last year by the Cadbury committee. Similar reforms to boost disclosure of share options in annual reports are in progress in the US, where the Financial Accounting Standards Board is holding a series of public hearings. The UK taskforce initially planned to follow the line of the US by placing a value on the options, but concluded that there was no satisfactory formula to provide a reliable valuation.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Integration top of the agenda - Technology IF ANYONE needed reminding that players in the derivatives markets need to do more work on integrating their front and back office technologies, this summer's Group of Thirty report should have done the trick. The G30 study looked into derivatives technology and systems, and singled out integration as the most important issue facing the commercial and investment banks which run big derivatives books and the large corporations that use the products to manage the risks of their day-to-day businesses. As the group's systems, operations and controls subcommittee said: 'Systems that integrate the various tasks to be performed for derivatives are complex. Because of the rapid development of the business, even the most sophisticated dealers and users often rely on a variety of systems which may be difficult to integrate in a satisfactory manner. While this situation is inevitable in many organisations, it is not ideal and requires careful monitoring . . .' Integration matters most to derivatives dealers because without integrated systems, they may not be able to properly measure, monitor and control the various risks they carry on their books. The G30 is right to be concerned, because by no means do all dealing firms in the business boast fully integrated derivatives technology. 'Most banks have a patchwork quilt of systems,' says Mr Rod Beckstrom, founder of California-based technology group C*ATS Software, who says that only a handful of the biggest and most experienced derivatives players meet the sort of standards outlined in the G30 report. Mr Patrick Brazel, senior vice-president at UK-based derivatives technology vendor SunGuard Capital Markets (previously Devon Systems), agrees: 'I don't think the banks in general have cracked the problem of front to back office integration.' That the dealing community continues to struggle with integration is primarily due to the frantic pace of product development in most front offices. As one software supplier explains: 'New products are introduced to the market when there's a need for a specific structured product, yet the systems to support those products are developed entirely on an ad-hoc basis.' Consequently, back offices find themselves constantly playing a game of technological catch-up with the front offices which keep coming up with a supply of new products (or old products with new twists) tailor-made to satisfy their clients' needs. Building integrated systems, however, is not a simple task. Derivatives technology, like derivatives themselves, has evolved in a random fashion. Dealers have relied upon a variety of software and hardware, not all of it compatible, to create, price and track derivatives instruments. Some of are developed in-house, and some are bought from software vendors which specialise in selling derivatives management systems. Many employ a combination of the two. When it comes to buying in the technology from outside (an option that more and more dealers are taking as the number of derivative systems suppliers rapidly grows), many firms purchase what are known as 'turnkey' systems, which offer a complete off-the-shelf software package that aims to provide a dealer with everything needed in the way of pricing, portfolio analysis and risk management functions. This is what the established derivatives technology suppliers - companies such as SunGuard, C*ATS and Quotient - generally offer. Mr Beckstrom says his firm sells software that 'allows treasurers to define and capture complex derivatives, pull them in electronically and provide the tools to do risk management analysis and reporting'. Other products, known as 'toolkits', are more adaptable to technology which provide the buyer with the flexibility to take their systems wherever they wish in an open environment. They may not be ready to use as fast as the turnkey systems, but they give the buyer more room to tailor the technology to their own needs. Mr Roger Lang, of US systems supplier Infinity International Financial Technology, says that banks and other derivatives dealers need 'leverageable tools and building blocks' to construct their own functions and support their own models. When it comes to integration, 'we have to be able to allow banks to determine their own fate,' he says. A similar theme is sounded by Canadian consulting and software firm Glassco Park, which sells software that can work inside other applications - in this case, Microsoft Windows. Mr Robert Park, of Glassco Park, says that in the past many derivatives dealers' systems 'were built around a database file format appropriate only for accounting, which over the years has been modified and remodified to try to accommodate new financial structures'. In contrast, Glassco Park's approach is to build maths libraries to explain the parts found in derivatives securities, and allow companies to construct their systems around those libraries. The firm claims that is an affordable and quick way to build integrated risk management systems, saving the time and money involved in developing them from scratch. While the buy-side has been investing heavily in derivatives technology, a small but growing band of the corporations and investment institutions on the sell-side have also been upgrading their systems. This summer, Atlantic Portfolio Analytics and Management, a Dollars 3.7bn fixed-income fund manager, bought a Cray supercomputer system to compute complex arbitrages, swap options and hedges in a variety of cash and derivatives markets. Although several securities firms, such as Prudential Securities and Merrill Lynch, use supercomputers, APAM became the first buy-side company to turn to supercomputing. Also this summer, BP Finance, the banking and treasury subsidiary of the UK oil group, began installing a real-time, deal-capture, position-keeping risk management system from Wall Street Systems for its 200 foreign exchange and derivatives traders in the US, UK and Australia.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons seeks advice DRAYTON Consolidated, an investment trust specialising in unquoted companies, yesterday said it had sought professional advice on the future of the trust. The announcement follows reports that institutional shareholders are seeking to remove Invesco MIM as managers. The advisers, County Natwest and Cazenove are to conduct a valuation of the trust's assets with the assistance of auditors and make recommendations which could include plans to wind up the trust completely. However, because the value of many of the smaller unquoted companies has suffered in the current recession, a full wind-up is not considered likely. Drayton Consolidated said other options included liquidating part of the company and passing cash to shareholders. Currently the shares are trading at a 55 per cent discount to net asset value of about 350p. The shares, of which 90 per cent are in the hands of institutions, fell further recently following the trust's announcement that it had written off nearly Pounds 20m it had invested in Alma Holdings. Alma represented Drayton's second largest unquoted investment.</p>

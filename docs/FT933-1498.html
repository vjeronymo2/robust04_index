			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong gives display of regulation - Simon Davies assesses the government's efforts toward tougher stock market controls The Hong Kong government's report into the corporate activities of Mr Lee Ming-tee's Allied group - with its 688 pages and costs of HKDollars 46m (USDollars 5.95m) - is a showcase demonstration of regulatory zeal. The government and the regulatory authorities have taken great pains to move forward from the events of October 1987, when the Hong Kong stock exchange was closed for four days, the futures market collapsed, and corruption allegations emerged against Mr Ronald Li, the stock exchange chairman who was subsequently jailed. Since then, the Davison report on strengthening the regulatory framework has been implemented, and a new watchdog - the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) - has won a tough political battle to gain acceptance in a city notoriously averse to regulation. The government is understandably anxious to show that things really have changed for the good. To some extent they have. A tougher regulatory line has emerged quite a lot in the past two years. Regulatory opposition has blocked a number of moves - notably privatisations and asset injections - deemed to be prejudicial to minority shareholders. More recently, Peregrine Investments, merchant banker to some of Hong Kong's most influential businessmen, was investigated for stock market manipulation. Mr Stephen Clark, director of Anglo-Chinese, a Hong Kong merchant banking group, said: 'There has been a sea change. There are a lot of investigations going on, and the SFC is spending a lot of time asking questions about different transactions. In the end, that will filter through to what people feel they can get away with.' The report on Allied attempts to underscore this new climate, ramming home the message that the government is determined to smoke out wrong-doers. It details mechanisms through which, it claims, Mr Lee syphoned shareholders' funds into activities such as the undisclosed control of listed companies, share price manipulation, and the funding of stock purchases by the controlling shareholders. Accountants argue that had it not been for the timing of Mr Lee's activities  -the investigation focuses on transactions since January 1 1990, a period in which Hong Kong property and share prices have surged  - the entire Allied group could have collapsed. The 10 companies which made up the official and unofficial Allied group had a combined market capitalisation of HKDollars 7.6bn in August 1992, when the investigation was launched. Clearly a collapse would have had an devastating effect on stock market confidence. However, it can be argued that the report lacks substance, a point taken up by Mr Brian O'Connor, Allied's managing director. He describes the investigation as a 'witch hunt' against Mr Lee, and says the report is little more than 'justification, not justice'. Mr Nicholas Allen, the government inspector, gives indications of corporate misfeasance and innumerable breaches of securities regulations. However, he fails to reveal any great black hole in the Allied balance sheet, and does not leave the impression that Mr Lee has become a billionaire at the expense of his shareholders. Of greater importance, perhaps, is the fact that few people in the financial sector feel affected by what has become the largest commercial crime investigation in the history of the colony. Mr Lee, as a Malaysian with an Australian passport, is considered very much an outsider by Hong Kong's xenophobic corporate core. Whatever the outcome of the Allied investigation, it will not be seen as impinging upon their own fiefdoms. It may also be seen as having little direct relevance in the stock market, since investors have always labelled the group excessively speculative. For all that, however, the Allied investigation is at the front line of Hong Kong's regulatory image, and the outcome is therefore important. At present, the stock exchange and SFC are examining potential breaches of the listing rules, the Takeovers Code and disclosure of interest Ordinance. The maximum penalty would be a disbarring of individuals from holding directorships. At the same time, the government is considering legal action for breaches of the Companies Ordinance. This would probably focus on allegations of false accounting, misappropriation of funds, and market manipulation, all of which are detailed in the report. The dramatic police raid on Allied's offices last Wednesday suggests the police are confident they have grounds to prosecute. But they will need to proceed carefully. As Mr Barry Yates, managing director of brokerage Vickers Ballas, said: 'The government can't afford to have another Carrian on its hands.' The investigation into the 1983 collapse of the Carrian property empire has cost more than HKDollars 100m in taxpayers' money, but has yielded little sense of justice. Corporate Hong Kong would undoubtedly benefit from a demonstration of stock market wrong-doing being punished. However, if HKDollars 46m and 13 months of investigation is unable to yield any more than suspicion, the assumption will be that Hong Kong's no-holds-barred style of capitalism remains very much alive.</p>

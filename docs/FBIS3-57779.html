			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Einar Koch; </F> place and date not given: "Kinkel -- Why I Would Meet With the  Russian Hitler"]    [Text] [Koch] What is your greatest concern for 1994?    [Kinkel] My greatest concern continues to be the terrible  killing, raping, and pointless devastation in former Yugoslavia.  And, among numerous other conflicts in this world, I am worried  by the areas of conflict in the former Soviet Union.    [Koch] Can you still get a good night's sleep when you think  of the Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy?    [Kinkel] The way Zhirinovskiy behaves and makes comments  leaves me with an unpleasant feeling. His behavior toward our  consular official in Sofia is not acceptable. But we cannot  ignore the fact that, judging by the number of people who voted  for him, he evidently has support in Russia. He must be dealt  with on a political level. This is primarily the task of the  reformist forces in Russia, which we are still counting on.  Just isolating him does not help.    My decision not to let Zhirinovskiy enter Germany for an  18-day propaganda tour was necessary and correct. This,  however, does not rule out a different decision in the future  once a real political debate with Zhirinovskiy has been secured.  I personally would not shy away from a discussion with him.    [Koch] The situation in Somalia is getting more and more  dangerous. Should we not withdraw our troops as quickly as  possible?    [Kinkel] We must not steal away from responsibility  prematurely because of some isolated incidents. We have  promised the United Nations that we will stay until 31 March.  We will stand by our decision. In the future, we will have to  carefully check whether, when, and how we are going to take part  in such UN missions. The UN mission, and our mission, did not  go terribly well. We will have to learn our lessons from that.  But our troops have done an excellent humanitarian job.    [Koch] Are you afraid that the FDP [Free Democratic Party  of Germany] might go under in the 1994 elections?    [Kinkel] No. I am convinced that we will stand our ground  successfully. It must be our aim to achieve the best possible  result in the Bundestag elections so that we will again be  needed for forming a government.    [Koch] Do you know yet by whom?    [Kinkel] I am against coalition statements at the wrong  time. We will decide before each of the 18 elections whether we  will make such a statement, when we will do it, and what we are  going to say. What happens after the Bundestag election is up to  the voters.    [Koch] Will Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher remain the FDP's candidate  for president?    [Kinkel] We nominated Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher as FDP candidate  with an overwhelming majority. She is not a pawn who can be  exchanged at will.</p>

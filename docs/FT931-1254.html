			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sharp deterioration at Norwegian shipowner I. M. SKAUGEN, the shipowner that is listed on the Norwegian bourse, reported a sharp deterioration in 1992 pre-tax losses to NKr563m (Dollars 81m) from NKr183m. The company said the weak performance reflected the completion of a major turnround of the group, which aims to reduce financial and operational risks and debt. Gross freight revenue was halved last year, to NKr1.2bn from NKr2.4bn a year earlier, due to weak markets and a reduction in the fleet. Net financial items rose to NKr112m, from NKr87m. I. M. Skaugen said debt had been reduced by about NKr1bn to NKr826m, of which NKr652m was long-term debt. It said the winding up of former activities was not yet complete, but outstanding assets and liabilities were relatively minor. Administration costs were reduced by half to NKr271m. I. M. Skaugen last year transformed itself from a diversified shipowner to an owner and operator of petrochemical gas carriers. It established Norwegian Gas Carriers to cover this activity. It forecast continued weakness in the petrochemical gas carrier market in 1993, mainly due to profitability problems in the west European petrochemicals industry.</p>

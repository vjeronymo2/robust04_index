			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 20--The former Karnataka Chief  Minister, Mr Sarekoppa Bangarappa, has been expelled from the  primary membership of the Congress for a period of six years,  for violation of party discipline and anti-party activities.    A decision to expel Mr Bangarappa was taken by the  disciplinary action committee (DAC) of the All India Congress  Committee (AICC), which met here on Monday under the  chairmanship of Dr Balram Jakhar, vice-chairman of the committee  and Union Agriculture Minister. The decision, after considering  Mr Bangarappa's reply to the show-cause notice, was unanimous.  To expel the former Chief Minister for six years with immediate  effect.    Apart from Dr Jakhar, three other members, Mr A.K. Antony,  Mr  R.K. Dhawan and Mrs Omem Deori, attended the meeting. The  committee chairman and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr Kotla  Vijayabhaskara Reddy has conveyed his agreement over telephone.    The AICC spokesman, Mr Chandulal Chandrakar, who announced  the decision at his routine press briefing here on Monday, said  he was not aware whether Dr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the party's  Lok Sabha member from Cuddapah, who was also served a show-cause  notice along with Mr Bangarappa, has sent his reply to the  notice. He also had no official information from the committee  about Dr Reddy's reply and whether his case has come up for  discussion in Monday's DAC meeting.    Mr Chandrakar said he was informed only about the action  taken against Mr Bangarappa.    He said the DAC has taken the strongest action against the  former Karnataka Chief Minister in order to maintain discipline  in the party.    Mr Bangarappa had sent a very strongly-worded reply to the  show-cause notice served on him, in which he launched a  blistering attack on the leadership of the party president and  Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. Mr Bangarappa had also  leaked out the reply to a section of the press and announced his  intention to launch a regional party in the next few months. In  view of this, his expulsion was very much on cards and quite  anticipated.    As a matter of fact, the decision to expel Mr Bangarappa  from  the party was taken by last Friday's meeting of the DAC, which  was attended by Mr Vijayabhaskara Reddy, Mr Dhawan and Mr  Antony, and there was no need for the committee to meet again on  Monday. It was decided then that "strictist possible action"  should be taken against Mr Bangarappa for his recent utterances  against the party leadership.    The delay in announcing the decision was attributed to the  fact that the committee wanted to take the approval of Mr  Narasimha Rao, which in turn was delayed because Mr Rao was on  tour on Saturday and Sunday in Karnataka. The second meeting of  the committee was an attempt to explain the delay in announcing  the decision. This was the third meeting of the DAC on the  Bangarappa issue.    According to senior party leaders here, the expulsion of Mr  Bangarappa is not going to affect the interests of the party in  the State. The State leadership had conveyed to the Centre that  not a single legislator was likely to go with the former Chief  Minister, they said.    Mr Bangarappa's recent action had drawn flak from his party  colleagues both in the State as well as at the Centre. About a  dozen MPs had recently met Mr Rao and urged him to take drastic  action against Mr Bangarappa.    Mr Bangarappa reacted to his expulsion from the Congress on  Monday by announcing that he would launch a new State-level  party.    Mr Bangarappa said, "I am happy I am out of the Congress  headed by Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, who is unable to uplift the  poorer and farming community of the country." He also said that  Mr Rao had failed to protect secularism.    When the news of his expulsion was conveyed to him, Mr  Bangarappa remarked: "Congratulations, I am happy that I am out  of the Congress headed by Mr Narasimha Rao." He said it was a  pity that his friends were still there in the Congress under Mr  Narasimha Rao, "who is hobnobbing with the BJP [Bharatiya Janata  Party]."    Mr Bangarappa said he would decide the date and other  details  of launching the new party after consultations with his  supporters.    The Bangarappa camp received a shot in the arm when five  legislators, including three former ministers came out with a  statement that the expulsion only proved Mr Rao's "anti-down  trodden stand."    Alleging that Mr Rao's "singular objective" that to destroy  the leadership of backward classes in the State, they called  upon other Congress(I) men to quit the party and form a "new  force."    Mr Bangarappa had been toying with the idea of starting a  regional party and his expulsion would only hasten the birth of  a new party, sources close to him said.    He had toured the districts to scout for support for his  move.    In the meetings with his supporters, Mr Bangarappa was  understood to have discussed the issue of launching a separate  outfit to champion the cause of backward classes. In fact, he  had talked of a party on the lines of the Mulayam Singh  Yadav-Kanshiram combine.    The supporters of Mr Bangarappa said the expulsion could not  have come at a more opportune time with the panchayat elections  round the corner in the State. "This would be the acid test for  us," the sources said.    However, the supporters of the Chief Minister, Mr M.  Veerappa  Moily, were jubilant over Mr Bangarappa's expulsion. They felt  that dissident activity, which was dented with Mr Bangarappa  choosing to take on Mr Rao himself, would now become  inconsequential. The Bangarappa group had provided the backbone  for the "oust Moily" campaign.    The sources said the former Chief Minister would not be able  to draw significant support from the legislature party as a  majority of legislators would not be prepared to leave the party  for his sake.    Interestingly, this is not the first time that such drastic  action has been taken against Mr Bangarappa. He had faced a  similar situation earlier and he had floated a regional party  then also. The party failed to kick-off and he had to enact a  'home-coming' into the Congress.    Mr Bangarappa, who was made Chief Minister of Karnataka in  October 1990 after Mr Veerendra Patil, had to step down  following large-scale dissidence in the Congress Legislature  Party (CLP) and serious charges of corruption. He was replaced  by Mr Veerappa Moily in November last year.    Bangalore (UNI): The Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr  M. Veerappa Moily, has termed the expulsion of his predecessor,  Mr S. Bangarappa, on Monday as "inevitable."    Mr Moily said that by taking a strong stand against the  party  and its leadership, Mr Bangarappa had invited expulsion.</p>

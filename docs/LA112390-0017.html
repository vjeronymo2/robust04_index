			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THOSE DARN EXPERTS  </P> <P> "Oat bran, coffee, margarine -- every time I turn around, they're changing  their minds. First they tell us one thing, then they tell us something else. I  wish they'd make up their minds."  </P> <P> Who this they is isn't always clear. But what consumers lament are  discrepancies in nutritional advice that make it hard to tell, at any given  time, if you're doing the right thing and eating the right foods.  </P> <P> Some point a finger directly at "you nutritionists." The source of this  frustration, which we hear all too often, is not professional nutritionists,  who usually provide a consistent dietary message. It more likely stems from the  difficulty of interpreting the latest results in light of years of previous  research. Putting the two together is a tall order for scientists, let alone  the general public.  </P> <P> Public interest in the links between diet and health has never been greater.  Responding to -- and fueling -- this interest, the media provide a steady  stream of "latest findings," which often make front-page news. The bold  headlines look definitive, but conclusions often are drawn from single studies  -- some excellent, some quite good, others seriously flawed. Sometimes two or  more reports will follow in rapid succession, providing conflicting results.  </P> <P> Take coffee and cardiovascular disease. As a frustrated friend said: "If you  don't like the advice, wait a minute." On the surface, answering the question  of whether coffee raises the risk of cardiovascular disease sounds  straightforward. Yet it has been addressed in at least two-dozen studies dating  back more than 25 years, with inconsistent results.  </P> <P> The latest of these, incidentally, found that neither coffee nor caffeine  increases risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. It's probably reasonable to  assume, given the weight of the evidence, that drinking moderate amounts of  coffee as prepared in this country won't boost risk.  </P> <P> Why is it so difficult to reach firm conclusions about diet and disease links?  Sometimes, sample sizes are too small. In other cases, studies don't go on long  enough to demonstrate whether the measures on trial are truly effective.  </P> <P> Another classic problem -- a phenomenon researchers refer to as "confounding"  -- is failure to weigh all factors that might be associated with the disease in  question. For example, since people who smoke are more likely to drink as well,  exploring a link between alcohol and a particular disease is meaningless unless  smoking is taken into account.  </P> <P> Failure to do so could lead to claiming links between alcohol and disease when,  in fact, the more powerful link is with cigarettes. While that may seem  obvious, it's possible that other, more subtle, "confounders" are not known at  the time a study is conducted.  </P> <P> The real pitfall is the natural tendency to over-respond to news of the latest  study with respect to a single factor in our diet. Thus, the recent study  claiming oat bran had "no effect" on serum cholesterol led consumers who had  jumped on the bran wagon and upped consumption of bran products to throw up  their hands in frustration.  </P> <P> The fact of the matter is, the bulk of the evidence indicates that oat bran can  help in lowering serum cholesterol, but fat in the diet, especially saturated  fat and cholesterol, should be reduced at the same time.  </P> <P> A similar crisis in confidence in the nutrition message occurred several weeks  ago following a report that so-called "trans"-fatty acids found in margarine  may affect serum-cholesterol levels, raising levels of the "bad" type and  lowering levels of the "good." While trans-fatty acids occur in foods  naturally, they are also formed during the hydrogenation of margarine.  </P> <P> Again, early reports of that study failed to emphasize several important  points: The authors themselves noted that their results were preliminary and  don't provide a basis for changing current dietary recommendations. For one  thing, earlier studies had produced conflicting results. Also, the level of  trans-fatty acids consumed by study subjects was four times that normally  available in the U.S. diet. And finally, only 10% to 30% of the fatty acids in  margarine are the problematical trans-fatty type. (By contrast, about 60% of  the fat in butter is the highly saturated kind that drives up serum  cholesterol.)  </P> <P> However, because of the press hoopla, the net effect of this highly interesting  research was to leave many people anxiously wondering whether switching from  butter to margarine in the interest of controlling cholesterol had, in fact,  been the right thing to do.  </P> <P> Of course, people should take an interest in the progress of medical research  that strives to refine dietary guidelines and reduces risk of chronic disease.  But history shows that the findings of the latest diet studies reported on the  evening news shouldn't necessarily cause you to shift your dietary habits  overnight.  </P> <P> Altering your morning breakfast on the basis of one study rarely makes sense or  stands the test of time.  </P> <P> Question: I'm trying to control my fat intake, and I know that chicken skin  contains a lot of fat. Is it necessary to remove the skin before baking, or can  I cook the chicken with the skin on, as long as I don't eat it?  </P> <P> Answer: Available data indicate that fat doesn't migrate into the meat during  cooking. An average half breast of broiler chicken with the skin contains more  than 7 grams (about a teaspoon and a half) of fat and 195 calories. The same  amount of chicken without the skin, regardless of whether you've cooked it with  or without the skin, contains about 140 calories and just 3 grams of fat. And  leaving the skin on during cooking produces a juicier dish.  </P> <P> Q: Why are emulsifiers put into processed foods? A: Like an actor who slips  easily into different characters, emulsifiers perform a host of functions in  numerous foods from bread to sausages. By altering the surface properties of  ingredients, they allow them to combine more easily. For example, in making  mayonnaise, egg yolk acts as an emulsifier.  </P> <P> Emulsifiers are widely used to help mix oil and water. In bakery products, they  improve volume, moisture retention, uniformity and fineness of grain. They also  retard staling and help condition dough. They improve the texture of pasta and  inhibit clumping, of particular use when pasta is to be used in canned and  frozen foods.  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Clegg denies unlawful share dealing MR JOHN Clegg, who resigned three weeks ago as managing director of Wace Group, the printing services company, denied last night that he had in any way been involved in potentially unlawful dealings in the shares of Parkway Group, one of Wace's most ambitious acquisitions. Mr Clegg left the company after a press article on January 26 alleged links between Wace and the IRA. Wace immediately denied any such links. It has become clear that Wace's funding was investigated last year by security forces, and no evidence was found of links with the IRA. However, Wace's internal inquiry since Mr Clegg left has revealed that up to 4m shares in Parkway - about 9 per cent of its capital - were bought in the names of Mr Clegg's cousins and others at the same addresses in the months before Wace's bid on August 1 1990. Wace has passed a dossier on these dealings to the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Clegg said yesterday, in a statement issued through his solicitor, 'I have never acted on, or provided to others, any price-sensitive information. I am more than happy to co-operate in any enquiries which may be conducted by the London Stock Exchange, or the DTI.' He had 'little alternative but to resign' as the other directors of Wace 'became concerned at the possibility of continuing rumours regarding myself and my family which in the climate created by the original article they felt might be damaging to Wace.'</p>

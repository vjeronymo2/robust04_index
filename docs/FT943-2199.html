			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rubber prices help lift Anglo-Eastern Anglo-Eastern Plantations, the cocoa, oil palm and rubber cultivator, reported a 41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.7m. Turnover was up 42 per cent to Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.5m). Mr Rollo Barnes, executive director, said the smaller estates' results had benefited from an increase of nearly 40 per cent in rubber prices and better than expected cocoa production. Earnings per share were 4p (3p) and, as indicated, there is no interim dividend (0.5p); henceforth only a single, final distribution is being paid. Ultimate holding company is Genton International.</p>

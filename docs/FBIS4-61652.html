			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leanid Alyok] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The main goal of a visit by  [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw Hryb and [Prime Minister]  Vyacheslaw Kebich to Chisinau is to strengthen economic and  cultural ties between Belarus and Moldova. Having arrived here  at the invitation of this country's leaders, the Belarusian  delegation today conducted fruitful work. Mechyslaw Hryb and  Vyacheslaw Kebich held negotiations with Moldovan President  Mircea Snegur, which were concluded by signing two  intergovernmental agreements: an economic and trade agreement  and an agreement on social protection of citizens. Also signed  was a protocol on consultations between the Moldovan and  Belarusian Foreign Ministries. At a news conference, the state  leaders emphasized that the agreements signed here are in the  interest of both states and the people.    At 1500, Mechyslaw Hryb and Vyacheslaw Kebich went their  separate ways, as the saying goes. The Cabinet of Ministers  chairman and the parliament speaker followed their own programs  of the visit, which had been prepared, as I suspect, in  accordance with their specific functions and responsibilities.  Mechyslaw Hryb held a meeting with Moldovan Supreme Council  Chairman Petro (?Kuchynskiy), and Vyacheslav Kebich toured the  western regions of Moldova. The Belarusian prime minister  visited a children's resort in the city of [name indistinct],  and at a history museum, he learned about social and cultural  aspects of the development of the Moldovan countryside.</p>

In addition, the value of a decedent's reversionary interest under section 2037(b) or 2042(2) shall be determined without regard to the physical condition of the decedent immediately before death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1._Simultaneous deaths.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The decedent's will establishes a trust to pay income to the decedent's surviving spouse for life. The will provides that, upon the spouse's death, or if the spouse fails to survive the decedent, the trust property is to pass to the decedent's children. The decedent and the decedent's spouse die simultaneously in an accident under circumstances in which it was impossible to determine who survived the other. Applicable state law presumes that the decedent died first with the result that the property interest is considered to have passed in trust for the benefit of the spouse for life, after which the remainder is to be distributed to the decedent's children. Therefore, the spouse's life income interest may not be valued under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2._Terminal illness.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The decedent bequeaths $1,000,000 to a trust under the terms of which the trustee is to pay $103,000 per year to a charitable organization during the life of the decedent's child. Upon the death of the child, the remainder in the trust is to be distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The child, who is age 60, has been diagnosed with an incurable illness, and there is at least a 50 percent probability of the child dying within 1 year. The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the decedent's death is 10.6 percent. The standard life annuity factor for a person age 60 (7.4230) may not be used to determine the present value of the charitable organization's annuity interest because there is at least a 50 percent probability that the measuring life will die within 1 year. Instead, a special section 7520 annuity factor must be computed that takes into account the projection of the child's actual life expectancy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional Limitations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 7520 does not apply to the extent provided by the Internal Revenue Service in revenue rulings or revenue procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions of this paragraph (b) are effective with respect to estates of decedents dying after the date these regulations are published as final regulations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 25_GIFT TAX; GIFTS MADE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1954  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Par. 5. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The authority citation for part 25 continues to read in part as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  26 U.S.C. 7805 *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Par. 6. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 25.7520&hyph;3 is amended by adding the text of paragraph (b) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;25.7520&hyph;3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Limitation on the application of section 7520.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other limitations on the application of section 7520 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordinary beneficial interests. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) An  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ordinary annuity interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the right to receive a fixed dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth of the right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. If an annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at the beginning of each period, a special adjustment must be made in any computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) An  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ordinary income interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the right to receive the income from or the use of property during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the right to receive the income from $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. However, in the case of certain gifts made after October 8, 1990, if the donor does not retain a qualified annuity, unitrust, or reversionary interest, the value of any interest retained by the donor is considered to be zero if the remainder beneficiary is a member of the donor's family.

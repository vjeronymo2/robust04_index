Ministries and departments which were not  subject to reorganization under a recent Presidential decree  function normally. The composition of the heads of these  ministries was not reviewed.    As for the new appointments, first of all in the upper  echelons of executive power, all the candidates have been agreed  upon between Victor Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin and the  decree on their appointments was signed on January 18, V.  Sergeyev noted.    He also reported that Victor Chernomyrdin "was very  skeptical  about the enthusiasm of volunteers who suggested to form a new  government or who stand up for the resignation of the present  cabinet. There is no need to do it," V. Sergeyev quoted the  prime minister as saying, "the government exists, it works and  continues the course of reforms."    When asked about who was appointed the vice premier V.  Sergeyev named the First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays and Yuriy Yarov were appointed vice  premiers.    The decree of the President of the Russian Federation B.  Yeltsin on the main appointments will be published on January  20, said V. Sergeyev.    Meanwhile Interfax has learned that the decree on the  government has not yet reached the presidential office.    According to some unofficial reports Boris Fedorov may  remain  in the position of the finance minister, while Aleksandr Shokhin  was appointed the economics minister.    Other sources from the entourage of the prime minister V.  Chernomyrdin noted in their turn that the issue of B. Fedorov's  presence in the reorganized government had not been settled so  far.</p>

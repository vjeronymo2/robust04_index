			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HAVE A COKE AND A SCHOLARSHIP  </P> <P> Among San Diego County high schools, the Coca-Cola symbol and athletics have  been synonymous for years. Football scoreboards throughout the area feature the  soft-drink logo in return for company support of school sports programs.  </P> <P> Now Coke wants to be associated with academic achievement as well.  </P> <P> Beginning in September, Coca-Cola for Scholastic Achievement will become the  newest program in San Diego city schools to strengthen and reward student  efforts in the classroom.  </P> <P> School trustees Tuesday approved an agreement with the Coca-Cola Bottling Co.  of San Diego to award two $500 scholarships each year to graduating seniors, as  well as provide support for scholastic programs such as the Academic Decathlon,  the Academic League, the Science Fair, teacher appreciation days, dropout  prevention projects and the Math Field Day.  </P> <P> "We've had a good program for years stressing achievement in sports," said  Tetsuo Pettiford, youth market representative for Coke in San Diego. "Now we  want to have a program for youth academically as well."  </P> <P> Coke and city schools will set up an executive board, with two members from the  company and four from the San Diego Unified School District, to establish a  process for recognizing students, teachers and community volunteers. The Gifted  and Talented Department of city schools will coordinate district efforts. DAVID  SMOLLAR  </P></p>

[Amorim] I believe that a very important step was taken with  the approval of the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] by Congress.  This approval will allow the government to eliminate the public  deficit, thus taking the first step toward controlling inflation.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Is the success of the economic  plan  still endangered by any political hurdle?    [Amorim] Evidently everything can be politically negotiated,  but the most difficult aspect of the plan was really related to  the approval of certain taxes, which had to be debated within  the framework of the constitutional revision. This difficulty  has already been overcome, in a first round. We trust that it  will also be approved in the second round, because the issue  protects the interests of the country, and not of the government.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] How long will it take for the  effects of the stabilization program to begin being noticed?    [Amorim] They will be noticed in the very near future, I  believe. The plan's approval by Congress has already had a  positive psychological effect. Naturally, the plan also has a  monetary stage. In this stage, the inflation rate will have a  more concrete and immediate decrease, although it may take two  or three months for this to happen.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] This sort of program generally  brings about a stabilization of the national currency. In this  case, will the value of the real cruzeiro increase?    [Amorim] We are seeking to stabilize our national currency,  but we want to do it without falling into the other extreme,  which is economic recession. Brazil has many inhabitants and a  labor market full of young people. It is very important that  the process does not hinder economic growth.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Will the government try to prevent  the exchange rate from falling, harming export products?    [Amorim] The stabilization of the exchange rate will result  from domestic monetary stabilization. It will not be the result  of a law ordering the indexation of the cruzeiro to a foreign  currency. It will come about naturally, as a consequence of a  public deficit equal to zero and of the monetary measures which  are being implemented.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] The other Southern Cone countries  are expecting an opportunity to increase their exports to  Brazil. This is why the exchange rate aspect of the  stabilization program is important to them.    [Amorim] I believe that the growth of the Brazilian economy  is what will really favor those who export to Brazil. When the  economy grows, as it did in 1993, our partners' exports to our  country increase a great deal. I think that this is more  important than the type of exchange rate.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Everything leads one to the  conclusion that in 1995, Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  will have a unified tariff system but will not yet be a common  market. When do you believe the conditions will be adequate for  coordinating macroeconomic policies, and reaching the goal  established by the Asuncion Treaty?    [Amorim] Some fundamental stages must first be overcome. We  are moving very fast, in a manner that has perhaps not occurred  anywhere else in the world. We are completing the trade  liberalization process. In 1995 we will have a unified tariff  system, which may not be perfect, at least not with regard to  all products, but there will be a schedule to unify the tariffs  of the products that still have different tariffs.    I believe that this naturally results in creating harmonious  policies for various fields, such as for example rules for the  capital markets and financial flows that have been agreed upon  by the Mercosur member countries.    I therefore believe there will be a natural unification  resulting from the requirements of the trade liberalization  process and of the Common Foreign Tariff.    [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Will the full enforcement of a  common market depend in the domestic stability of the member  countries?    [Amorim] This is taking place very fast. You can see that so  far Europe still has no overall monetary policy, because it does  not have a single currency or a single central bank. I  therefore believe that the common market can exist with free  capital flow and hand labor, which are other elements of the  common market, even before the creation of an entirely completed  macroeconomic policy.    Surely there must be agreement about these policies, but I  believe they will come about naturally, because all countries  are engaged in the same process.</p>

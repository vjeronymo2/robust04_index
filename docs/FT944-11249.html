			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / FT Guide to the week 7 Monday Preparations for Apec Trde ministers and officials from 18 Pacific rim countries meet in Jakarta this week to prepare for the second summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. The summit, in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, will be hosted by President Suharto and attended by US President Bill Clinton and the heads of other Apec states. The summit will try to agree a declaration calling for 'open regionalism' and achievement early next century of free trade and investment in Apec, consistent with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Africa after Mitterrand: The Franco-African summit in Biarritz, south-western France, until Wednesday, will ponder whether France's special relationship will change when Francois Mitterrand's 14-year presidency ends. Prime minister Edouard Balladur, a possible successor, may warn leaders, jolted by last year's 50 per cent CFA devaluation, that France's Dollars 1.5bn annual aid is conditional on further reforms. Slovenia's prime minister Janez Drnovsek arrives in London, hoping for British support in persuading Italy to stop blocking negotiation of a European Union association agreement with his country. Italy is trying to use the issue to win Slovenian concessions on property rights for the heirs of Italian citizens who lost their homes in territory transferred from Italy to Yugoslavia after the second world war. Genetic drugs: The World Health Organisation, meeting in Geneva (to Nov 8), brings together scientists, doctors and consumer representatives to draw up safety and ethical guidelines for vaccines and drugs derived from genetic engineering. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, chairs a crisis meeting in Geneva to discuss sending UN troops into the lawless Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire. The Solomon Islands parliament is due to elect a new prime minister, following the resignation of Francis Billy Hilly last week. The Solomons have been the subject of international environmental concern recently, because of heavy logging activity, and the election may be critical to the way in which this issue is tackled. Top table talk: The Confederation of British Industry's annual conference gets under way in earnest in Birmingham (to Nov 8). Topics for discussion include European competitiveness and environmental legislation. FT Surveys: Birmingham and the West Midlands and China. Holidays: Bangladesh (National Solidarity Day), Colombia, Russia and Ukraine (Great October Socialist Revolution), Tunisia. 8 Tuesday US mid-term elections Elections take place for 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 36 state governors' seats. The big question is whether the Republicans can take control of the House or Senate, or even both, and thus make life even more miserable for President Bill Clinton (left). The 56 to 44 Democratic Party edge in the Senate looks most vulnerable, but a 40-seat Republican gain in the House is needed to overturn the 256-178-1 (an independent) deficit. Of the 36 governorships up for grabs, 22 are being defended by Democrats. Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin meets Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine self-rule authority, to discuss Israel's delay in handing over the occupied West Bank to Palestinian self-rule, and Israeli demands for a crackdown on the militant Islamic group Hamas. German-Czech manoeuvres: The two countries begin joint military exercises in Bohemia, aimed at increased military and security co-operation (to Nov 11). But they take place against the background of strained relations between Prague and Bonn, which have got worse following attacks on German tourists in the Czech Republic. War crimes tribunal: The international tribunal for war crimes in former Yugoslavia is due to open in The Hague. In the first such court in Europe since Nuremburg, Justice Richard Goldstone of South Africa will try defendants who are seated behind a bullet-proof shield - if there are any. One difference from its model at the end of the second world war is that the victor is not running the trials, so there is no authority to enforce extradition of alleged war criminals. European Union industry ministers meet in Brussels to discuss a joint Commission-industry plan to rescue Europe's steel sector by cutting capacity. People's MBA: The People's Republic of China's first business school is founded in Shanghai. The China-Europe International Business School is backed by the European Union, and a number of European companies including Airbus Industrie, are sponsoring it. Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for external relations, will lay the foundation stone. Courses are due to start in March 1995 and will produce 50 to 100 MBAs a year at first. FT Surveys: International Fund Management and India. Holidays: Russia and Ukraine (Great October Socialist Revolution). 9 Wednesday Finnish vote on EU treaty Finland's parliament had hoped to have voted in favour of European Union membership by today, clearing the way for the country to join the union on January 1 1995. The move, following last month's referendum when Finns voted in favour of membership by 56.9 per cent to 43.1 per cent, needs to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the 200-seat legislature. However, it may be postponed in the wake of delaying tactics by anti-EU MPs. Sri Lanka holds a presidential election. The current prime minister, Chandrika Kumaratunge, of the left- inclined People's Alliance is expected to win easily against Srima Dissanayake, widow of Gamini Dissanayake, the opposition leader recently assassinated by Tamil Tiger guerrillas. Endangered species: Threatened wildlife will be debated at the two-yearly conference of signatories to the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Among highly charged topics on the agenda are South Africa's desire to reclassify elephants and white rhino in a less critical category following growth in animal numbers. But green groups will be fighting for tighter curbs. Open channels: Turkey's president Suleyman Demirel opens an irrigation scheme for the arid Harran plain in the south-east of the country. Two giant tunnels extending more than 50km (31 miles) take water from the Ataturk dam on the Euphrates and then distribute it through a 14,000km network of canals and troughs that will eventually serve 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres). Saleroom: Monet painted the waterlilies in the garden of his home at Giverny more than 100 times, but only on four occasions in a circular format. The only example not in a museum comes up for sale at Christie's main autumn auction of important Impressionist and modern works of art in New York tonight. It is from the collection of the New York arts patron, the late Miss Alice Tully, and is expected to make between Dollars 4m and Dollars 6m. Fall of the Wall: Today is the fifth anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall. Celebrations and speeches are planned throughout the united capital of Germany. FT Survey: Bolivia and Finland. Holidays: Nepal (Constitution Day), Pakistan, Spain (Madrid only). 10 Thursday Sum put on Uruguay Round The Uruguay Round trade accords will make the world some Dollars 500bn a year richer within a decade, according to a report from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to be released today. Euro-Defence: In Brussels, representatives of the nine member states of the Western European Union are expected to choose a new secretary-general for the defence organisation, likely to increase its role in European security. Behind-the-scenes consultations having failed to produce a consensus, there are three leading candidates: Jose Cutilheiro of Portugal and Giovanni Jannuzzi of Italy, both career diplomats, and Enrique Baron Crespo, the Spanish socialist politician. Germany's newly-elected Bundestag, or lower house, holds its opening session at the Reichstag in Berlin. Air waves: Australia and New Zealand's transport ministers are to meet in Canberra to discuss their open skies policy. Last month, Australia unilaterally froze a memorandum of understanding giving Air New Zealand the right to fly internal domestic routes from November 1, causing outrage on the New Zealand side. Chess: Garry Kasparov tries to come from behind in the final of the Intel World Chess Grand Prix in Paris (to Nov 13). Grandmasters from India, Russia and the Ukraine lead the world No. 1 in the race for the Dollars 50,000 first prize. 11 Friday Apec trade ministers meet Apec trade ministers begin a two-day meeting to approve the final text of the summit declaration. Antiquities smuggling: A former senior Greek police officer, Michalis Nistakis, goes on trial charged with antiquities smuggling. Nistakis was fired in 1993 as chief of police for the Attica region, which includes Athens, following allegations that he collaborated with a German antiquities smuggler in exporting illegally excavated artefacts from his native island of Crete. Saleroom: Christie's in New York sells one of the most famous manuscripts in private hands, a group of loose sheets on which Leonardo da Vinci put down ideas and observations, including many drawings, in the first decade of the 16th century. Formerly known as the Codex Leicester, until the Earl of Leicester sold it at Christie's in 1980 to the oil billionaire, the late Armand Hammer, for Pounds 2.42m (Dollars 4m), the Codex Hammer is being sold by his private museum and is estimated at Dollars 10m. Ring of bright water: The Queen opens the 50-mile Pounds 250m Thames Water Ring Main. The pipe will help supply drinking water to more than 3m people in the London area. FT Survey: Hungary. Holidays: Belgium and France (Armistice Day), Poland (National Day), US (Veterans' Day). 12-13 Weekend Swedish EU referendum Sweden holds its referendum on membership of the European Union on Sunday. A nail-biting finish is in prospect, with polls giving conflicting evidence on the outcome. A Swedish No would almost certainly doom the pro-EU campaign in neighbouring Norway, which holds its own referendum on the issue on November 28. US-China trade: At an Apec side-meeting on Saturday, Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is due to hold bilateral talks with Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, on Beijing's negotiations to re-join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Italian trade unions plan a 1m-strong demonstration in Rome on Saturday to protest against the government's 1995 budget and pension reform. It follows a general strike two weeks ago. The government is struggling to retain the identity and objectives of its budget despite more than 1,000 amendments tabled by both the members of the governing right-wing coalition and the opposition. Rugby: England play Romania at the Twickenham ground in London on Saturday. Motor racing: The Formula One season ends on Sunday with the Australian Grand Prix at Adelaide. Compiled by Patrick Stiles.

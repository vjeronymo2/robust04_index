			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Polls seen as test of national strength VOTERS go to the polls in local elections across England and Wales today for what will almost certainly be the last significant test of strength for the political parties before a general election. With less than 15 months to go before a full election must be called, balloting for more than 12,000 council seats in 475 constituencies will be analysed minutely for its likely bearing on a national poll. No voting will take place in Scotland or London, but it was strong Conservative showings at similar local elections in 1983 and 1987 that persuaded the government to go quickly to the country to seek fresh mandates. On both occasions the Tories won handsome majorities in the House of Commons. This time politicians of all parties believe the Conservatives are highly unlikely to do well enough for Mr John Major, the prime minister, to risk calling an immediate poll. With widespread concern over the economy, two recent by-election defeats and continuing debate over the reform of the poll tax, the Tories are braced to lose a substantial number of the 5,200 council seats they took on a wave of popularity four years ago. Opinion polls show Labour level-pegging with the government on about 40 per cent of the vote, up from 31 per cent in 1987, and a near halving of the Liberal Democrats support to about 14 per cent. One Labour official said yesterday: 'A crucial factor will be how the old (Social Democrat-Liberal) Alliance votes go, with us hoping for them to get a rising vote in the south and a falling one in the north.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, predicted that his party would control more councils after the voting even though it was likely to lose seats after its strong performance last time. Mr Major said yesterday that membership of the European exchange rate mechanism and the end of a lending surge provoked by financial deregulation meant Britain was 'better equipped than ever before' to prevent a resurgence of inflation.</p>

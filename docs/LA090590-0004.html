			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON ON WORLD WAR II RELOCATION CAMPS  </P> <P> When we go to the library to study up on the history of World War II and the  Japanese attack on our country, we'll be sure to go to the fiction section.  </P> <P> How generous our parents, our taxpayers, our citizens are, allowing the  Japanese to rewrite a vital chapter in American history! Now all we lack is the  King George version of the American Revolution.  </P> <P> The editorial accuses Ferguson of "an attempt to revise history." It is, in  fact, a valid attempt to revise the revision.  </P> <P> Of course, there was anti-Japanese sentiment in the land -- there was real  fear. How were we supposed to react? Every country has a right -- and duty --  to save itself.  </P> <P> Anyone who stands up for traditional American values now better be prepared for  ridicule and condemnation by the pro-foreign press and too many government  officials.  </P> <P> ALICE SLUTZ  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

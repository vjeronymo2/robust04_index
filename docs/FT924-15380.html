			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nathu Puri buys Conder Structures from receivers MR NATHU Ram Puri, chairman of the private mini-conglomerate, Melton Medes, has purchased Conder Structures, the structural steel business of Conder Group, from receivers. Mr Puri refused to reveal the cash price, although he said it was a 'significant seven-figure sum'. Conder Group was placed into administrative receivership last month following the announcement of Pounds 22.6m in pre-tax losses for 1992. The company is believed to have suffered Pounds 31m in losses on two contracts last year, from which it never recovered. Conder Structures, which employed 337 people before the receivership, had sales of Pounds 40m in 1991. Mr Puri said he expected to retain between 50 and 150 jobs. Mr Puri, who is contesting a high court action by members of two pension funds controlled by Melton Medes, said he was considering the option of not having a pension scheme for employees of Conder Structures. The case against Melton Medes Pension Trustees and MM Fund Management, the funds' trustees, is expected to come to court next month. It was launched by the Graphical Paper and Media Union in an attempt to obtain information about the investment of scheme assets and in an effort to appoint a judicial or independent trustee.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hanminjon on Nuclear Arms Development of South Korean </F> Authorities " -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF]  (Hanminjon) published a white paper on March 30 exposing the  nuclear arms development of the South Korean puppet clique.    Cho Il-min, chief of the Pyongyang mission of Hanminjon,  distributed the white paper at a press conference on March 31.    To justify the anti-North fuss over the nuclear issue, the  white paper says, the Kim Yong-sam group has misled public  opinion by misrepresenting the pilot reactor of the North as one  for "the development of nuclear arms". But the atomic reactors  used for the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean  peninsula are the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea.    Stating that the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor  for nuclear arms development disguised as one for commercial  use, the white paper says: It is a plutonium-producing reactor  which has been introduced for the development of nuclear weapons  in view of its purpose and structure.    The traitor Pak Chong-hui who had politicized nuclear arms  development in the early 1970s made sure that a contract on the  import of pressurized heavy water reactor was signed with Canada  in December 1974 and the project was "pushed forward on a  full-scale" (WOLGAN CHOSON, August 1988).    Nuclear experts involved in the nuclear arms development in  those days and journalists testified: "Park Chong-hui seemed to  have ordered the import of a heavy water reactor, because he was  keen on developing nuclear weapons" (WOLGAN CHOSON, August  1988), "The Wolsong heavy water reactor was imported from Canada  to produce nuclear arms" (WOLGAN CHOSON, October 1991) and "The  heavy water reactor is entirely intended for the production of  plutonium" (WOLGAN CHOSON, March 1991).    The Wolsong heavy water reactor can change spent fuel at any  time without stopping operation, because it is designed for the  production of plutonium. Therefore, it is almost impossible to  supervise it. The Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large  amount of spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used  directly for the development of nuclear weapons.    Now South Korea has stockpiled spent fuel containing ten odd  tons of plutonium at present and the amount is foreseen to  increase to 24 tons by the year 2000. The plutonium produced by  the heavy water reactor in Wolsong till now since it started  operation in 1983 is enough to make more than 370 atom bombs.  When another heavy water reactor now under construction begins  operation, the annual amount of plutonium output will more than  double.    The white paper points out that the multipurpose research  reactor constructed in the Taedok complex is a reactor  exclusively for nuclear arms development under "research" veil.    It is disguised as one unrelated to the development of  nuclear weapons because it uses uranium enriched to 20 percent.  But it is, in fact, a reactor exclusively for the development  of nuclear weapons which plays the key role in nuclear arms  development in South Korea.    The Seoul regime got the "understanding" of its Washington  master through several rounds of negotiations under the cloak of  "research and production of isotopes". It began designing a  multipurpose research reactor in 1985, started its building in  1989 and completed it in 1992 in cooperation with Canada.    The multipurpose research reactor is not a research reactor  for peaceful purpose but a reactor for military use which is  used as a "diazole" in the production of nuclear arms. Its  designing itself has been for the manufacture of nuclear bombs  and it has opened the way for legally obtaining highly-enriched  uranium.    The multipurpose research reactor can be reconstructed into  a plutonium-producing reactor without difficulty any time.  Though it is camouflaged as a light water reactor fueling on  uranium enriched to 20 percent, it, in actuality, discharges  much spent fuel containing high-level plutonium in a shorter  time than the heavy water reactor. And it is closely linked  with reprocessing facilities.    The nuclear developing team of South Korea has built  experimental irradiation facilities along with the multipurpose  reactor in the atomic energy institute of the Taedok complex.  Thus, a perfect plutonium extracting system has been formed, in  which the spent fuel of the multipurpose research reactor is  directly reprocessed by the irradiation facilities.    Demanding that the Wolsong heavy water reactor and the  multipurpose research reactor of Taedok which are totally for  military use be destroyed, the white paper says:    The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], making a  noisy  fuss about the pilot reactor of North Korea, turns a blind eye  to the heavy water reactor and multipurpose research reactor for  military purpose in South Korea whose capacity is respectively  scores of times and several times that of the North's pilot  reactor. The IAEA has not disclosed as yet the results of  inspection of these nuclear facilities of South Korea.    The South Korean authorities are openly claiming the  "reexamination of the joint declaration on the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula," calling for "nuclear option." This  suggests that the South Korean authorities scheme to  unilaterally abrogate the joint declaration adopted between the  North and the South.    The South Korean authorities must give up the policy of  nuclear arms development and declare the removal of the heavy  water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are  used for the production of nuclear weapons.</p>

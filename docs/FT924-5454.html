			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC potato plan 'unacceptable' PROPOSALS FOR a lightweight European Community regime on potatoes that emerged from Brussels yesterday call into question the future of the UK's Potato Marketing Board. The proposals, which were yesterday termed 'unacceptable' by the PMB and the National Farmers' Union, will be discussed tomorrow in Brussels by Copa-Cogeca, which represents both agricultural unions and co-operatives in Europe. The plans could come before EC farm ministers at their next meeting on December 14, although some observers think the volume of business will delay consideration of the potato regime. The commission is proposing an Ecu 1.5m regime for potatoes in order to harmonise the different mechanisms applied in member states in the run-up to the Single European Market. It aims to encourage a free market and to establish a common approach to trade with countries outside the EC. The PMB at present controls the supply side of the UK market by setting a target area for potatoes and distributing quotas to its registered growers. It said yesterday that it would continue to lobby hard to maintain the system, which 'we consider protects not only farmers, but consumers and the industry as well'. The NFU said the lightweight proposals made no reference to 'our desire to see member states being able to take national measures when required. There is no reason why not if the measures are in line with EC competition law and do not disturb EC trade'. The agriculture ministry said yesterday it had not seen the detailed proposals, which would be subject to a lot more consultation before they were finally adopted. The Agriculture Bill at present passing through parliament gives ministers the power to end the potato marketing scheme, but not necessarily to close the PMB.</p>

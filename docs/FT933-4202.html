			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (19): Too quiet for comfort - Japan AT a Mitsubishi Motors showroom in Tokyo, visitors last month were sent home with a gift bag full of vegetables. Not to be outdone, the nearby Nissan dealer was offering prospective customers a bag of firecrackers and a yo-yo. Car dealers in Japan are having a quiet season. Last year, for the first time since the second world war, the Japanese car market experienced its second consecutive year of decline. The odds are increasing that the record will be extended to three consecutive years of decline unless the Japanese economy unexpectedly lifts itself out of its gloom. In the first six months of this year, domestic demand for cars shrank 6.6 per cent, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (Jama). After an early jump in sales in March - which proved a false warning, activity in the market has returned to the sluggish state that has become all too familiar in the past few years. Although the Japanese government is holding firm on its forecast that the economy will see a gradual pickup towards the latter part of the fiscal year, the continuing weakness of personal consumption and private capital investment are casting a dark shadow over that projection. Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan, admitted last month that, given the current state of the economy and the sharp rise of the yen, the company might have to revise downward its production target for the year. The Japanese car industry's troubles are not restricted to the home market. Overseas, Japanese carmakers are coming under severe pressure as a result of the sharp advance of the yen's value against the dollar. One Japanese manufacturer after another has had to raise prices overseas, particularly in the US, to try to salvage what profits they can, as the yen continues its surge. This has damaged their price advantage at a time when US manufacturers are increasingly challenging the competitive edge Japanese carmakers have had with their better-made cars. In the first three months of this year, the Japanese makers' share of the US market slipped to 27 per cent from 30 per cent. The political environment also makes it difficult for Japanese carmakers to seek to make up in exports the slack in domestic demand. As the Big Three US companies have brushed up their manufacturing, they have also stepped up political pressure to keep Japanese carmakers at bay, as well as force Japan to open its market more to US-made cars and car parts. They have tried to get the US government to impose higher tariffs on Japanese-made minivans by claiming that Japanese carmakers 'dump' their vans in the US. At the same time they have increased political pressure on the Japanese auto industry to buy more foreign-made car parts. In the EC, calls to curb the Japanese onslaught are no less intense. The European Commission is negotiating with the Japanese government to scale back an agreed target for Japanese car imports into the Community in 1993. Hopes have been pinned on the Asian market. However, even exports to China (a growing market) have been reduced this year as a result of the adverse effect of the yen's appreciation and a tightening of monetary policy by the Chinese authorities intent on cooling down their economy. The pressures facing the Japanese industry would have seemed less intractable were it not for the structural nature of many of the problems. The outlook for Japan's carmakers is now radically different from the years of strong growth, in the late 1980s, which led them to invest heavily in the latest production technology and expand rapidly abroad. In contrast to those days, the industry is today gripped by the recognition that there is an overcapacity in the global car market. For example, in Japan at the end of March last year, according to Jama, 87.3 per cent of households owned a car. Against that background, Mr Yoshihiro Wada, president of Mazda, expects growth in the industrialised world's car markets to be less than 1 per cent. Slower growth means that carmakers can no longer afford to supply a full range of models and compete with each other in every category. There needs to be a division of labour, Mr Wada says. That is already beginning to happen in Japan. The high and rising costs of development are bringing Japanese rivals together. Isuzu, a leading truck and commercial vehicle maker, is pulling out of passenger car production and buying cars from Honda. In exchange it is supplying Honda with recreational vehicles. Isuzu is also supplying Mazda with diesel engines. Meanwhile, Mazda and Nissan are negotiating about the possibility of swapping trucks and vans. Although Japanese and US carmakers have been making cars together for years, the growing links in the domestic market - where rivalries are fierce - reflect the heightened sense of urgency within the industry. The trend is likely to accelerate further. The urgent need to address environmental issues, to raise fuel efficiency and improve safety measures all require that carmakers bring their resources together, says Mr Junji Shibata, general manager of the European and North American Operations Group at Nissan. 'One of the key issues that the managers of carmakers will have to tackle in the future is how to maintain individuality within these alliances,' says Mr Taizo Yokoyama, managing director of Mitsubishi Motors. In the meantime, the Japanese industry is focusing its efforts on readjusting operations to suit the changed market environment. Carmakers are increasingly standardising parts in an effort to cut costs and develop cheaper cars that will cater to the more cost-consciousness Japanese consumer. But perhaps the greater challenge for Japanese carmakers lies in adjusting to a market that is already mature. Nissan shocked the nation when it announced earlier this year that it was closing a plant in the outskirts of Tokyo. Others may be forced to take similar measures to deal with their overcapacity. Mazda and Toyota, for example, built up considerable capacity in the boom years of the late 1980s. While plant closures and redundancies have a high social cost in Japan, the Japanese car industry probably has little choice but to shrink - unless new demand can be tapped in outside markets.</p>

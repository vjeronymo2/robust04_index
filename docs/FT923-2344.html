			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey points to top read in Europe THE fifth Pan European Survey (PES), the largest survey of the reading habits of professional and business executives from 16 west European countries, publicly available today , shows that National Geographic magazine is by far the most popular read from a basket of 380 newspapers and magazines, including 19 international titles. The survey questioned 8,000 men and women - selected from an initial sample of 26,000 - aged between 25 and 64, who satisfied at least one of the following criteria on an annual basis: a minimum gross personal income of Pounds 22,000; six or more business trips by air; director of an establishment with 25 or more employees; or possessed a higher degree. Another common factor was that four out of five use the English language. Sponsored by The Economist, Financial Times, International Herald Tribune, News-week, Scientific American and Time magazine, the study thus claims to have tapped into the reading preferences of the 5.7m people who fall into those categories. Among the findings of the study are: International publications have increased their share of this particular readership from 29 per cent in 1981 to 34 per cent today. Since the last PES survey in 1988, the Financial Times has expanded its readership to 292,000 from 264,000; the International Herald Tribune has shrunk from 74,000 to 72,000; and the European edition of the Wall Street Journal has almost doubled its readership, from 34,000 to 62,000. Over the same period, Time magazine has maintained its leadership position, growing from 261,000 readers in 1988 to 313,000 currently, followed by The Economist, up from 210,000 to 263,000. National Geographic leads the readership table of the 19 international publications considered, with 592,000, followed by L'Express (346,000), Time (313,000) and in fourth place the Financial Times.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Article" by R.J. Strider and Pyone Cho] </F>   [Text] The February issue of MYETKHIN THIT journal,  published by the intelligence service of SLORC [State Law and  Order Restoration Council], contains language detrimental to the  prestige of Thai Crown Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, and has  caused embarrassment to the SLORC.    On page 135 of issue no. 46 is an article in the form of a  dialogue between a Vietnamese national, Nguyen Nge and a Burmese  national, Saw Indei. The dialogue contains terms insulting to  Thai Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, daughter of the Thai king.  It makes references to Mahachakri Sirinthon being world-famous  for being born as a daughter of the Thai king. It contains  references saying that had she been born of a (?Burmese)  peasant, Sirinthon may well have been a prostitute.    The same article says prostitution has become a traditional  source of livelihood in Thailand and that Thailand is achieving  a high standard of living through prostitution and that the  revolutionary trait has disappeared. If such a rude reference  had been made to the daughter of the Thai king in Thailand,  there would certainly be charges of lese majeste and harsh  punishment.    Such an article could not have been published without  official authorization in Burma, where there are strict  censorship rules and the Army strictly controls the publication  of journals. MYETKHIN THIT has been published by the SLORC  since 1990 and has been used to blatantly attack democratic  forces inside and outside the country, political leaders,  foreign countries, and Western diplomats.    Po Kan Kaung's article in the February issue of MYETKHIN  THIT  journal has surprised many Burmese observers because relations  between Thailand and Burma have been good. Thailand, which has  been enjoying special privileges in timber and fishery  concessions, has been opposing international efforts to isolate  the SLORC. Lately, the SLORC, which has been expanding economic  relations with other countries, including Singapore, has accused  Thai businessmen of illegal fishing and logging.    It is possible that the article, which contains crude  language, may well reflect the SLORC government's displeasure  with the Thais. The article also contains references that could  damage the prestige of the Thai military. The article says that  since the end of World War II, Thailand has been instrumental in  spreading U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, and that the Thai  Armed Forces have been under the patronage of the U.S. Army.  While the Burmese and the Vietnamese Defense Services were  discharging their national duty, the Thai Armed Forces lacked  revolutionary characteristics.    Despite the allegations made by MYETKHIN THIT, there has  been  a surprising lack of reaction from the Thai Armed Forces and  entrepreneurs.    According to one source, although Thai military intelligence  obtained the article, they suppressed the report to prevent it  from leaking to the Thai public. It can be seen that although  the Burmese generals are insulting the prestige of Thailand,  Thai military officials are remaining silent over the matter for  their own self-interest.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT Even though Granada's predatory intentions were well flagged, LWT appeared wrong-footed when hostilities erupted. The Yorkshire-Tyne Tees flirtation proved an unwelcome diversion. But LWT has now wisely reverted to emphasising its fine trading record. Yesterday's forecast of a 43 per cent increase in 1993 profits enhances its management's reputation and bolsters the case for independence. Yet LWT's shareholders will be little swayed by sentiment. The bid still revolves around what constitutes a fair offer price. The prospects for an independent LWT are undoubtedly attractive. But they do not appear sufficiently racy to justify LWT's current rating in the absence of a bid. Independent forecasters do not expect much of a bounce in television advertising revenue. There is also diminishing scope for LWT to cut costs now it has boosted its trading margin to 28.2 per cent. It is tempting to believe media assets may be worth even more if further industry liberalisation follows. Then again, comparable US broadcasting stocks do not trade on higher ratings despite their deregulated market. If LWT's management is convinced Granada's offer is too cheap, they could always make a higher bid themselves. The management already owns 10 per cent of the shares. Cash is currently cheap to borrow. Granted, not too many UK banks are likely to lend money to a leveraged buy-out boasting so few tangible assets. But US banks or venture capitalists would better appreciate the attractions of LWT's cash stream; especially so if LWT could secure an equity injection from a media industry partner.</p>

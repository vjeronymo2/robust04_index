			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Muramoto The Tokyo stock market barely flinched in its first trading session after the failure of Muramoto Construction, an unlisted company but one with bank debts of an estimated Y590bn (Pounds 3.7bn). Its insouciance may be partly explained by the fact that Muramoto's debts have been parcelled out evenly among its 50 or so lenders, so that none of them is in serious danger despite the write-offs. Yet it is worrying that such a small company, only Japan's 24th largest construction group, can produce a collapse nearly half the size of Olympia &amp; York and with so little warning. One can only guess at the liabilities hidden in contractors many times Muramoto's size. Clearly, Japan's banks need to root out problem loans and write them off fast, instead of seeking to disguise them in their accounts as they have done so often in the past. Present incentives are inadequate. The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, which enables banks to speed up tax write-offs by selling bad loans and buying them back at a loss, is only attractive to larger banks with cash to spare. Financial market confidence also depends on support for smaller fry, like Nanto Bank, the regional lender which is among the most exposed to Muramoto. Perhaps the Bank of Japan should extend additional support in the form of cheap loans, or Japan's notoriously tight-fisted tax office could offer more generous tax treatment on write-offs.</p>

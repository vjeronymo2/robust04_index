			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Singapore ignores favourable prospects  -Domestic brokers shrug off any good news as an aberration Most investors in these troubled times would be happy to put money into the stock market of a country where the economy is predicted to grow at between 4 and 6 per cent this year and where brokers are forecasting average corporate earnings growth of around 15 per cent. Not so the glum speculators of Singapore. Ignoring the underlying strength of their own economy and the spark-ling stock market performance on Wall Street and in Hong Kong, they fear a repeat of the 1985-86 south-east Asian recession and have marked down the local stock exchange accordingly. Foreign investors have been forced to follow suit. Yesterday the Straits Times Industrial index slipped 3.52 to 1,441.84, for a fall of 3.3 per cent since the start of the year, in characteristically dull trading. Any hint of bad news has the Singapore Chinese punters nodding as if to say: 'I told you so.' Good news is shrugged off as an aberration: when DBS Bank announced 1991 profits at the higher end of expectations this month, the share price promptly fell. Even Sembawang Shipyard's 38.5 per cent increase in net earnings for last year has failed to lift the gloom. 'These are strange times,' says one foreign broker, who thinks the real economic prospects are relatively rosy. 'We have seen the market take fright over the economic outlook.' A local Chinese stockbroker explains that investors remain nervous about the effects of the world slowdown on Singapore's trade-dependent economy, and are more interested in the Tokyo market's poor performance  - and Japan's financial scandals - than in Wall Street. Furthermore, he complains, over-regulation by the Singapore authorities has driven away some of the speculators Growth prospects in Singapore's maturing domestic economy are less exciting than they were, and many of the most dynamic companies on the island are not those listed on the exchange, but the wholly-owned foreign enterprises on the industrial estates. 'In the domestic corporate sector, there is a lot of capital facing too few opportunities,' says another broker, 'and rightly they are cautious about overseas expansion.' Singapore may be dull, but few analysts think it has far to fall. The market is on a historically low prospective 1992 price/earnings ratio of about 15 times, local interest rates are low, liquidity is plentiful, and most large companies are not highly geared. The Stock Exchange of Singapore, meanwhile, hopes that turnover will be increased by the gradual introduction of paperless electronic trading, by the advent of stock options later this year, and by this week's allocation of SES seats to seven foreign stockbroking companies, known as international members. Mr Kok Kar Wing, SES executive vice-president, says: 'Ours is predominantly a retail market, but gradually the insti-tutional share is growing.' SES officials intend to make Singapore a regional share-trading centre: 10 Hong Kong shares and, for the first time, an Indonesian Depositary Receipt - for the tyremaker Gadjah Tunggal  - are already quoted on the central limit order book (Clob) system. So are 113 Malaysian stocks, because much of the stock is held and traded in Singapore in spite of the split between the Kuala Lumpur and Singapore stock markets three years ago. Malaysia has announced plans to go paperless, which threatens to take business away from Singapore, but the SES and the brokers are hoping to devise a way round the problem. 'I do not think the market in Malaysian shares will disappear,' says Mr Kok. 'We will find a way round the Malaysian thing,' agrees the Chinese broker. At least it gives everyone something to think about until the market recovers.</p>

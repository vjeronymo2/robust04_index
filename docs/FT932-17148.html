			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / N Korea nuclear dispute goes to the UN INTERNATIONAL pressure on North Korea to co-operate with nuclear inspections was stepped up yesterday when the International Atomic Energy Agency decided to refer the case to the United Nations Security Council. A two-day meeting of the IAEA's 35 governors in Vienna, which was forced to take a vote on the issue, ruled that North Korea had broken an agreement on nuclear safeguards. Mr Hans Blix, the agency's director general, is due to report to the Security Council on the dispute in the next few days. At the same time, the US, Britain and Russia issued a joint statement urging North Korea to retract its announced withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The three countries, which are the depositaries of the 1968 treaty designed to stop the spread of nuclear arms, said withdrawal would be 'a serious threat to regional and international stability.' They said it was in North Korea's interests to stay in the treaty and called on it to comply fully with the safeguards agreement it signed with the IAEA in January last year. North Korea accepted six inspection visits before refusing access to two facilities near its Yongbyon nuclear reactor complex. It has claimed they are conventional military facilities. However, experts suspect that the country may have used more nuclear fuel, and may have been able to separate more plutonium for possible weapon use, than it has declared. Without powers of its own to take action, the IAEA could do little else than appeal to the Security Council - the first time it has done so. However, it is unclear what the Council will do. China, which along with Libya voted against yesterday's IAEA ruling, is opposed to sanctions, arguing that it would be counterproductive to isolate North Korea further, and would be able to use its veto in the Security Council. Moreover, the rotating council chairmanship passes next week to Pakistan, which was one of four IAEA governing board members to abstain in yesterday's vote. The others were India, Syria and Vietnam. North Korea is considered still to be bound by the terms of the treaty, which stipulates three months' notice for withdrawal.</p>

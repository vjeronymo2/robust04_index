			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Charting the tastes of China's consumers - Lynne Curry meets two market researchers At a time of sweeping social and economic change, Yuan Yue and Li Kan represent a new breed of Chinese revolutionaries. Both men run organisations analysing a phenomenon that barely existed a decade ago - the growing clout of China's increasingly prosperous consumers. Yuan is the assistant president of China Market Research Institute. Li is the general manager of Connections Consulting Company. The two companies are among a dozen or so market research groups that have sprung up in the last year, some based in Beijing, others working in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in Guangdong province as partners of Hong Kong companies. All of them are geared towards charting the tastes of the new class of consumer produced by the country's capitalistic-style economic reforms. 'Market research is a new concept for Chinese enterprises because consumers had no choice under a totally state-run system,' said Yuan. Yuan and Li are at the forefront of the drive to develop this industry, carrying out market research on consumer products ranging from shampoo to gum to computers and copiers, and testing the market for those not yet available in China. But with China's increasingly complex economy, Yuan and Li have adopted different approaches towards marketing in the country. Yuan's China Market Research Institute uses a variety of western polling techniques: focus groups, door-to-door interviews, the telephone and mailings. The institute's 68 employees contact between 500 and 3,000 families for each survey, with the number varying depending on the product and customer preferences. Li's company, founded by a group of Chinese MBA graduates from the EC-sponsored Beijing-based China European Management Institute, has six full-time employees and conducts its business by interviewing distributors. The company has dealt almost exclusively with foreign firms. To many Chinese, accustomed to Soviet-style methods of collecting information, this process of data collection is almost revolutionary. The consumer response rate to market surveys is about 60 per cent, which is high compared with the western equivalent, according to Yuan. 'People think it's all so new,' Yuan said. 'They have never seen this before and they think 'why are you asking me?'' Traditionally, reports sent to officials and directors have always told them what they want to hear. They have never relied on a realistic appraisal of the market or canvassing ordinary consumers. This is still true among many state-run enterprises. 'Domestic Chinese companies don't want us to assess the market,' said Connections' Li. 'They want us to write a report that must be favourable. We generally avoid working for domestic companies.' Obtaining accurate market surveys has become more critical as companies become more profit-orientated. With many enterprises acquiring goods through unofficial means (including smuggling) outside the central distribution network, the compilation of official statistics about the breakdown of market share can be inaccurate. For example, a large demand for photocopiers has led to smuggling and a much greater market for these machines than official data indicate, Li said. He also noted that official statistics about the Chinese pharmaceutical industry have a high error rate and do not reflect how foreign pharmaceutical multi-nationals have begun to dominate the market. For these reasons, growing numbers of private Chinese enterprises, collectives and foreign companies are increasingly turning to organisations such as Yuan's institute and Li's company to do business. Even a few state-run enterprises are beginning to rely on western marketing tools. In a centrally planned economy, most managers of state-run organisations have never had a need to collect market data, or even to place advertisements in the official media. However, as state-run corporations face tougher competition from smaller, more efficiently run joint ventures and private enterprises, that attitude is slowly changing. Yuan cites the experience of one state-owned Chinese leather goods manufacturer in Beijing. A bestseller of leather accessories, the enterprise never knew consumers' opinions about its products or even the percentage of market share its goods occupied in the domestic market. The company relied upon its sales force to keep it informed about new styles and trends in China and abroad. Still, Yuan believes the future lies with China's growing private sector. His institute has surveyed about 1,000 private Chinese enterprises each with assets worth about Yn1m (Pounds 114,000). Most of these enterprises are based in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong and Fujian. The conclusions he and his colleagues reached are revealing: nearly all of the entrepreneurs interviewed believe the profits gained from running their own businesses are worth the risks, but their greatest worry is still political uncertainty. Despite this concern, Yuan, a law graduate who previously worked at the Ministry of Justice, plans to take advantage of the current hospitable economic climate towards private enterprises by severing his ties with the institute and going into the market research business with three other investors this year. If the can-do and risk-taking approach of men like Yuan and Li is any indication, they are on the ground floor of what could be a booming industry. 'In five years' time, the demand for marketing will be big,' Li said. 'We are ahead of domestic demand.'</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Maastricht ratified as Rees-Mogg bows out BRITAIN yesterday ratified the Maastricht treaty just hours after Lord Rees-Mogg announced that he was abandoning his legal challenge. Ratification was completed when Sir Patrick Fairweather, British ambassador to Italy, deposited the necessary instrument at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs just after 3pm. The Foreign Office said the necessary documentation had been sent to Italy by diplomatic bag over the weekend. The move, which made Britain the 11th of the 12 European Community states to ratify the treaty - Germany is the last - marked the end of the road for Tory Euro-sceptics who had fought tenaciously to kill Maastricht off in an epic 18-month parliamentary battle. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will be hoping the government can finally draw a line under what has been an immensely damaging episode for the Conservative party. But Euro-sceptics are already threatening a fresh revolt when the government brings forward legislation implementing an agreement to increase national governments' contributions to the European Commission in November. Euro-sceptic leaders were yesterday in defiant mood with Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford, arguing that Britain should not have ratified a treaty whose heart was 'torn out' with the 'collapse' of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Michael Spicer, the MP for South Worcestershire, said it was 'a matter of supreme irony that on the day that the ERM collapses we ratify a treaty whose objective is to create fixed exchange rates forever, with all the economic misery that this has been seen to entail'. Lord Rees-Mogg's lawyers said he had decided not to appeal against Friday's High Court ruling which rejected his claim that the government was acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without parliamentary approval. Gouldens, his solicitors, said his decision had also been influenced by the ERM crisis which had 'removed one of the key pillars to Maastricht'. It continued: 'In those circumstances, an appeal is not necessary; indeed there is not much of the union treaty left standing.' Lord Rees-Mogg and his backer the international financier, Sir James Goldsmith, had agreed to go no further, Gouldens said.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Bell Canada in CDollars 125m five-year Eurobond issue NEW issue activity was muted in the international bond market yesterday, with issuers finding only small pockets of demand for new paper. Canadian dollar bonds reacted positively to a government budget statement overnight on Tuesday, with benchmark government bonds gaining around  1/8 of a point in early trading yesterday. Bell Canada, the telephone company, took the opportunity to launch a CDollars 125m five-year Eurobond issue, lead-manged by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The 8 7/8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 100.375, where the yield spread over Canadian government bonds was 62 basis points. Participants in the deal expected strong demand from continental European retail investors, attracted by high coupon and status of the issuer. In contrast, the Australian dollar sector gave a less welcoming reception to a budget statement by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, which was seen as leaving little room for a further cut in Australian interest rates. Benchmark government bonds at the three-year maturity fell by nearly 1/2 a point immediately after the statement, before recovering some of the lost ground. Syndicate managers said that the negative tone could reduce the number of investors willing to re-invest the proceeds of maturing Australian dollar bonds back into new issues. KFW, the German government-backed finance agency, added Ecu150m to its outstanding 8 1/2 per cent Ecu250m five-year issue launched at the end of January. Deutsche Bank Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs International placed the bonds with a small group of investors at an undisclosed price. This cautious approach underlined the poor tone of the market, with even top-rated borrowers unwilling to risk substantial new issues. In the D-Mark sector, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC) launched a DM200m three-year deal via Deutsche Bank, aimed at German investors. However, new issue supply is expected to pause over the next week with German public holidays disrupting market activity. TMCC swapped the proceeds of the issue into floating-rate dollars. However, swap spreads have tightened recently, making the D-Mark sector less attractive to non-German companies. In the Swiss market, Tjiwi Kimia, Indonesia's largest pulp and paper company and part of the Sinar Mas group, launched a SFr50m convertible bond offering, the second such offering for an Indonesian borrower in the Swiss market. Although the Indonesian stock market is now open to foreign investors, many Swiss investors prefer the convertible structure, according to lead manager Credit Suisse. National Bank of Hungary yesterday unveiled plans to raise DM600m on the German bond market, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The seven-year bond issue will have a coupon of 10.25 per cent and will be priced on March 11 by Deutsche Bank, which has been awarded the mandate to lead manage the issue. The issue is considerably larger than the National Bank's two most recent bond issues. Last year, it launched a Dollars 100m issue and a Ecu200m issue in the international bond market. Speaking in Frankfurt, Mr Frigyes Harshegyi, vice-president of the Hungarian bank, said it was considering making further issues this year, probably on the US dollar and Ecu Euromarkets, although an issue in Swiss francs was also a possibility. MR Micheal von Brentano has stepped down as chairman of the International Primary Markets Association (IPMA), which represents top new issue underwriting firms in the international and domestic bond markets, writes Simon London. He is to take up an appointment as a partner of Merck Finck &amp; Co, the private banking firm owned by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr Brentano was head of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in London from its formation in 1985 until his retirement last year to work full-time for IPMA.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> 76ERS GO INTO FIRST WITH WIN  </P> <P> As Charles Barkley pointed out, the only thing the Philadelphia 76ers lost  Monday night was a big lead.  </P> <P> Barkley took command in the fourth quarter after the 76ers blew all but one of  a 24-point lead finishing with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in a  108-94 victory over the New Jersey Nets at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter how big a lead you lose as long as you win," Barkley said.  </P> <P> The victory moved the 76ers back into the Atlantic Division lead, one-half game  ahead of the idle New York Knicks.  </P> <P> Philadelphia scored 17 consecutive points to build a 39-15 lead in the first  quarter, but the Nets chipped away and pulled to within 84-82 early in the  final quarter on a basket by Lester Conner.  </P> <P> The Nets had a chance to tie the score, but Barkley stripped the ball from  Chris Morris at midcourt and raced in for a resounding dunk that began a  13-point run.  </P> <P> Hersey Hawkins added 21 points for Philadelphia, and Conner scored 18 and  Morris had 17 of his 19 in the third quarter for the Nets, who have lost 26 of  29 games.  </P> <P> San Antonio 113, Phoenix 102 -- David Robinson scored 34 points and Willie  Anderson had 12 of his 18 in the fourth period as the Spurs beat the Suns at  Phoenix, snapping their 19-game home win streak.  </P> <P> Terry Cummings added 23 points and 10 rebounds while Robinson grabbed 14  rebounds and blocked eight shots for the Spurs.  </P> <P> Kevin Johnson scored 36 points for Phoenix, but even his 18 points in the final  quarter couldn't keep the Suns from having an eight-game winning streak  snapped.  </P> <P> The Suns were playing without All-Star forward Tom Chambers, who has a strained  hamstring, and guard Jeff Hornacek, who is recovering from knee surgery.  </P> <P> Eddie Johnson and Mark West finished with 18 points apiece for Phoenix, which  had a 99-97 lead when David Wingate made a layup to start an 11-point surge  that put the Spurs ahead for good.  </P> <P> Cummings had two baskets during the spurt while Robinson added a three-point  play for a 108-97 bulge with 1:39 left. Robinson, who had nine points in the  fourth quarter, added a three-point play and two free throws in the final 1:19.  </P> <P> Utah 105, Sacramento 97 -- John Stockton had 27 points and 11 assists and Karl  Malone added 32 points as the Jazz downed the Kings at Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> The Jazz led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter, but the Kings cut  the deficit to 98-93 when Antoine Carr made two free throws with 1:26 left.  </P> <P> Wayman Tisdale scored 24 points for Sacramento and Danny Ainge added 21.  </P> <P> Dallas 117, Atlanta 110 -- Brad Davis made two three-point shots to spark a  10-point run and Sam Perkins scored 12 points in the fourth quarter as the  Mavericks turned back the Hawks at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Davis put the Mavericks ahead to stay, 93-92, on a three-pointer with 9:04  remaining. Over the next 1:50, Roy Tarpley made a field goal, Davis got another  three-pointer and Perkins scored a basket to make it 100-92.  </P> <P> Tarpley had 24 points and 14 rebounds for Dallas. Perkins and Derek Harper  scored 21 points apiece and Davis had 20.  </P> <P> Dominique Wilkins had 32 points for Atlanta.  </P></p>

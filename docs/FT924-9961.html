			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hollywood studio boss resigns MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S Twentieth Century Fox suffered its second high-level executive departure of the year when Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the Hollywood studio, said he would resign on January 1 1993 to form his own film production company at The Walt Disney Studios. Last February, Mr Murdoch assumed direct management responsibility for the Hollywood studio and the Fox television network following the resignation of Mr Barry Diller, who had been chairman and chief executive since 1984. Mr Roth's resignation, like that of Mr Diller, caught the US entertainment industry by surprise. It also kindled speculation Mr Roth might have been concerned at the increasingly hands-on management role played by Mr Murdoch. Neither Mr Roth nor Mr Murdoch could be reached for comment last night. Mr Roth, who joined Fox in 1989, was responsible for several films that generated hefty revenues. Among the most profitable films he helped to make was Home Alone, last year's blockbuster. Under the agreement with Disney, Mr Roth will produce at least 25 films that will be distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, under Disney studio banners including Touchstone and Walt Disney Pictures. Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, said the studio was pleased to be Mr Roth's 'financial partner' and praised his 'proven track record'. Mr Roth said he had known both Mr Eisner and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Disney studio head, for the past 10 years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- National Unification  Minister Yi Hong-ku said Monday [9 May] the goals and pursuit of  Seoul's North Korea policy should agree, though a flexible  approach is necessary in dealing with pending inter-Korean  problems.    In an article contributed to the government's weekly  "KUKCHONG SIMMUN" issued Monday, he added that inter-Korean  relations have a double structure of confrontation on the one  hand and dialogue for a gradual and peaceful movement toward  reunification on the other.    "Policy consistency must be maintained, but policy direction  should be adjusted and adapted to a new situation and a new way  of pursuing the policy should be developed," he said.    The current efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear  problem peacefully and through dialogue should be continued, and  the government should deal with the issue through increased  cooperation with the international community, he added.</p>

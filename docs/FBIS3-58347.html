			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saving Must Pay Off"] </F>   [Text] The Bundeswehr could save an estimated 3.8 billion  German marks [DM] per year just through rationalization. This  is indicated in a confidential interim report by an internal  Defense Ministry working group. The savings, which correspond  to 10 percent of the current operational expenditures of the  armed forces, are, however, only possible "in the long run." A  new system for monitoring costs and performance must be  established. In the view of the working group, first  investments of approximately DM100 million are necessary for  this purpose -- for new computers, for instance. Under the  slogan of "Saving must pay off," all soldiers should be  encouraged to participate in the "constant identification of  rationalization potential." "As far as it is useful and  possible," logistical tasks are to be transferred to private  companies. In addition, the working group, which consists of  military officers and representatives of civilian consulting  companies, suggests that armament projects should be supervised  more strictly. Tighter management could reduce procurement  costs by approximately DM400 million per year. In 1993, the  Defense Ministry spent almost DM7 billion on weapons and  ammunition.</p>

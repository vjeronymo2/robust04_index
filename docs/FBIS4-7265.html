			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Thailand has no involvement in the continuing  Cambodian conflict, which is between the Phnom Penh government  and the Khmer Rouge, and any monitoring along the border should  be on Cambodian soil, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said.    Phnom Penh has an absolute right to request United Nations  officers based in the capital to monitor the situation along the  Thai-Cambodian border, Prasong said.    "But if the UN officers want to conduct any monitoring on  the  Thai side, they have to ask the Thai government first. We,  Thailand, are not a party to the conflict and therefore we  should have nothing to do with the border monitoring," he said.    The minister was referring to a report that Cambodia is  requesting the UN to extend the operations of its 30-strong  mission based in Phnom Penh to allow them to monitor the border  situation.    He stressed that any monitoring from Thai soil would require  prior approval from Bangkok.    Bangkok had earlier turned down a request by the UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) to set up checkpoints  on the Thai side of the border, saying it would be a violation  of the nation's sovereignty.    A senior Foreign Ministry official said yesterday the Phnom  Penh request to the United Nations was apparently based on  suspicions that Thailand still supports the guerrilla faction.    The official, who asked for anonymity, said the Cambodian  conflict would become an international issue if the UN mission  was involved in a military confrontation with the guerrillas.    Thailand would probably reject any request for the UN  mission  to operate on Thai soil, the official said, and as a result  would again be accused of helping the Khmer Rouge.    Minister Prasong said the Burapha task force was still  investigating the most recent spillover from fighting inside  Cambodia which resulted in two Thai villagers being seriously  injured at Rongklu market in Sa Kaeo's Aranyaprathet district.    Prasong said he was ready to explain Thailand's position to  Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut, who is  visiting Indonesia and France, and was confident that any  misunderstandings could be settled at government level.

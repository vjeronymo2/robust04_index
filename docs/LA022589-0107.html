			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO MERE SHELL OF A MAN, SHOPKEEPER MAY ALSO BE KING OF THE CURIOS  </P> <P> You can buy purses, lamps, wind chimes and floral displays. You can buy picture  frames, clocks and turkeys. That's right, turkeys.  </P> <P> You can also buy cats, ducks and owls, and tiny figurines that appear to be  puffing cigars while brandishing pistols.  </P> <P> The pearl that each of these daffy curios has in common is that they're  composed entirely of seashells. That's right, put your ear right up to the  turkey's mouth and listen to the roar of the ocean.  </P> <P> You might say that Pervez Sukhadwala, who moved to the United States from India  two years ago, is waging the biggest shell game in San Diego County.  </P> <P> The soft-spoken Sukhadwala is hardly the sole seller of shells in San Diego.  Shops such as La Jolla Cave &amp; Shell Shop, Silver Sea of Old Town and  Seaport Village Shell Co. Ltd. have sold seashells from the seashore for years.  But, arguably, Sukhadwala's newly opened Shell World International on Sports  Arena Boulevard boasts the largest -- and most bizarre -- inventory.  </P> <P> Visitors are shellshocked by the number and strangeness of shells Sukhadwala  has on his shelves.  </P> <P> "We have hundreds of thousands of shells," Sukhadwala, 42, said as he stood  surrounded by row upon row of shell after shell.  </P> <P> Carolyn Hashimoto, manager of La Jolla Cave &amp; Shell Shop, said Sukhadwala  appears to have the largest number of shells in the county (by a narrow margin)  and certainly has the market cornered on the bizarre. In other words, it's hard  to find a shell smoking a cigar anywhere else in town.  </P> <P> Sukhadwala got into the shell business because his grandfather founded a  wholesale outlet in India and wanted his grandsons to manage it. Sukhadwala  discovered that, because the United States was by far his biggest export  target, he could make a tidy retail profit here as well.  </P> <P> Like many sellers of shells, Sukhadwala harvests his 500 varieties from ocean  floors all over the world. He sells the golden cowry and cyprae aurantiam from  Filipino waters for as much as $6,000. He sells some shells for as little as 49  cents.  </P> <P> Hashimoto said Sukhadwala hardly has the market cornered on low or high prices.  She said shell sales are booming and that her store, on Coast Boulevard in La  Jolla, offers a voluta shell from the Irvinae family for as much as $1,200. An  added bonus to Hashimoto's store is the seven natural caves leading from a  tunnel in the hillside 80 feet to the ocean below.  </P> <P> "People love shells for their natural beauty," she said. "You can't improve on  Mother Nature. There's a craze going on for minerals and crystals. It's the  same with shells."  </P> <P> Sukhadwala said he's counting on the "booming" collectors' market. He said  shells have become one of the world's items for avid collectors, keeping fast  company with stamps and coins.  </P> <P> "I love shells, and this shop definitely has the best selection in the county  -- even better than I've found in Hawaii," said collector Dorothy Tucker, a  retired art teacher from Point Loma who earlier this week was searching for as  many shells as she could find to decorate a home already saturated with shells.  </P> <P> "What do I love about shells? I love the color, the form, the feel . . . the  fact that they come from the sea. They have such an elegance about them. I used  to buy them from sportfishermen off Point Loma, but, for some reason, they  don't sell them as much anymore. So I was thrilled when I heard about this  place."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Absolutely Natural  </P> <P> Zuby Sukhadwala, who helps her husband mind the store, said: "Our shells are  absolutely natural. Each and every one is natural, in their color, everything.  None are plastic or make-believe or fake. They're not fake at all. The quality  is just as good as anywhere. We give out good stuff. Everything in our store is  natural -- and the best."  </P> <P> Sukhadwala buys from other wholesalers, who in turn buy from sportfishermen all  over the globe. He said that, in some quarters, shells rival fish as the  fishing industry's biggest-selling items.  </P> <P> Sukhadwala opened his store in October. His Shell World International can also  be found in Orlando and Kissimmee, Fla., and in Bombay, where shells are  considered more an item for the affluent than adornments that just about anyone  can afford.  </P> <P> Sukhadwala said most of the crazy "conversational" items -- shells that  resemble Billy the Kid, shells playing poker or drinking Budweiser -- are  crafted in India or the Philippines.  </P> <P> The popularity of the wacky items is greatest here, he said. They're bigger  sellers than even the locally grown abalone shells.  </P> <P> "People walk in, and they say, 'Wow, I've never seen so many shells,' "  Sukhadwala said. "It's hard for them to believe that all of these come from  nature, from the sea. The quantity alone makes people eager to come back."  </P> <P> Indeed, so many shell seekers are showing up at the door that, who knows, maybe  even celebrities will start popping in . . .  </P> <P> Shelley Winters?  </P> <P> Maximilian Schell?  </P> <P> Shel Silverstein?  </P></p>

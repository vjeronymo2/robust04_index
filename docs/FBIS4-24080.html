			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister and IFP leader </F> Mangosuthu Buthelezi by Shaun Johnson and Kaizer Nyatsumba;  place and date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  On his home affairs portfolio: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I find it very challenging in the first place,  because you have got civic affairs in it and therefore one has  to do certain things for the whole population. And of course I  find it amusing (to be Minister of Home Affairs) in view of the  fact that the former government took away my passport for nine  years and I am now in charge of the passports!  <H5>  On the question of immigration: </H5>   [Buthelezi] The second challenge (to the portfolio) is that  it has immigration as one of its segments ... in the past there  was discrimination...people from Europe were allowed to come  here more easily than black people from other countries. Now  already there are Africans from some of the southern African  countries or even from central Africa coming in here in the hope  of getting a job. How does one deal with that? The handling  seems to me to be a very sensitive thing because the needs of  South Africans are so vast...charity begins at home, while (at  the same time Africans) are our brothers and sisters. Last week  I had lunch with bankers from Switzerland, and one said he had  never heard so much French spoken in South Africa. That really  indicates what is going on now.  <H5>  On his experience with the new Cabinet: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I find that the cordiality (among) all of us is  really quite something because, to be quite honest, I sit there  facing some people who have really been vilifying me -- but I  have no animosity towards them and we joke. From that point of  view I think it is some kind of a miracle, really.  <H5>  On the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I think it (the RDP) is one of the best (pieces  of) writing I have ever seen. On the face of it, it has many  platitudes which no one would have any problem about. And also  as far as our economic policy is concerned there are many things  (in the RDP) which are the same. But my worry is: can one  deliver from the point of view of the fiscus? I have expressed  this concern in Cabinet, because the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  does not like too much intervention by the State in the economy.  But we are doing the best (we can) together, we are  co-operating. We'll try to do the best to deliver in terms of  it.  <H5>  On the RDP and the Province: </H5>   [Buthelezi] Responding to the President's speech I did state  my own feeling about deliver -- that unless these things are  delivered on the ground, and they can only be delivered on the  ground by the provinces, (not much will be accomplished).  That's why I have been fighting all along for the autonomy of  provinces.  <H5>  On the Melamet Commission's recommendations: </H5>   [Buthelezi] From the point of view of our people, black  people, I would say that they (the salaries) are too high.  (But) most of the perks are now no longer there. There used to  be a lot of perks for other Ministers.  <H5>  On the transfer of land to the Ingonyama Trust: </H5>   [Buthelezi] The issue that I thought might ruin the  Government of National Unity [GNU] was this thing of the  Ingonyama Land Trust. But the way it was handled by President  Mandela himself, and also by Minister Derek Hanekom and those  other colleagues who were in that (Cabinet) committee was such  that, really, I was pleasantly surprised. Because it seemed to  me that they went out of their way to ensure that it didn't  ruin the GNU.  <H5>  On whether IFP structures continue to function: </H5>   [Buthelezi] There is the issue of local elections, and I  don't think we should be caught flat-footed if and when that  comes. So, in fact, when I was addressing a victory rally in  Umlazi last weekend I stressed that we need to put our  structures in order. I was very unhappy with our structures.  <H5>  On mediation: </H5>   [Buthelezi] Well, there are some very good things in it (the  Interim Constitution), but I still say it is a flawed  constitution. And I'm still very concerned that the agreement,  on the basis of which I went into the election be implemented --  that immediately afterwards there should be international  mediation on the issue of the king and the kingdom. One must  set that ball rolling because I think that once the  Constitutional Assembly starts moving it would be impossible to  then have international mediation. We most definitely still  want that mediation.    I think, for instance, in terms of the RDP, I cannot see  that  we can deliver on the ground if we are as centrist as the  constitution is at present. So, I would really want that  changed in the constitution. And I was not quite happy with the  way (legislation on the Constitutional Court was (handled). I  rally do believe that if we want to deliver, it is really  essential (that we have true federalism). And I was very  interested in the meeting that Mr Mandela asked me to attend  with premiers, because I could see that the very bright people  who are premiers all over the place want to get on with the job  with the job to deliver. And that means power. It means  regional powers. One of them (ANC premiers) even joked with me  and said: "Why did you fight this issue alone for so long?"  <H5>  On the election atmosphere: </H5>   [Buthelezi] In fact, it was a miracle. People queued up  together, whether they were ANC, IFP, PAC [Pan Africanist  Congress] or anything, and there was no animosity or anyone  taunting anyone else. It was extraordinary, and I was  pleasantly surprised.  <H5>  On violence levels now: </H5>   [Buthelezi] Unfortunately, even if the media does not  highlight it, there is a lot of political killing going on even  ow. In fact, last weekend one of my first cousins was burying  his son in Mandeni, and I know of quite a number of people who  have died since the election, some of them prominent leaders of  the IFP.  <H5>  On what can be done to finally eradicate violence: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I said (in a recent speech) that it is wonderful  we have got our liberation, but I (also) said there is a dark  cloud because the state of emergency is still on the  KwaZulu/Natal, and I resent that very much because I didn't  think that it should have been imposed.  <H5>  On whether he has raised the issue with Mandela: </H5>   [Buthelezi] Let me share with you an informal conversation  we  had with him. In Parliament we were standing in the Assembly  with some of my colleagues, and he came over to our side. One  of our leaders raised this issue, and he (Mandela) said: "No,  no, no, that we will discuss with Shenge [Buthelezi's tribal  name]." He said it was a matter between us. But, of course, I  don't blame President Mandela that he hasn't (yet) done so. He  is a very busy person.  <H5>  On his relationship with Mandela: </H5>   [Buthelezi] President Mandela has always been very affable.  I defer to Madiba [Mandela] (because he is older than me). He  has said things which have hurt me, but I have never responded  in kind because for me, even before he was President, he is  still mnewethu [my brother], he is older than me and I respect  that. In spite of all those things that have hurt me, when we  are together this warmth surfaces.  <H5>  On his relationship with F W de Kerk: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I wouldn't say that we are close, but I think we  behave towards each other like civilized men, if I may put it  that way.  <H5>  On the possibility of a future IFP/NP [National Party] </H5> alliance:    [Buthelezi] Well, I haven't thought of that. The betrayal  (by De Klerk and his government) came up on issues like  federation. He and his party say they also believe in a federal  formula for this country but in terms of delivery, when it came  to negotiating with the ANC on a trilateral basis, there was no  evidence of that. And that's what, really, brought about the  mistrust between us.  <H5>  On pressure on him to enter the election: </H5>   [Buthelezi] My good friend, Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl invited  me to Germany. I have very high regard for Chancellor Kohl, and  after I had explained my position, he had no problem. But then  when I went to see his Minister of Foreign Affairs who belongs  to another party ... it was quite an acrimonious discussion, on  the basis that he was now seeing me as the fly in the ointment,  as the person who was blocking things from happening.    From there I went to Copenhagen, invited by the Foreign  Minister there, and it was the same kind of thing. And also my  last meeting with the Prime Minister of Britain, (John) Major,  wasn't very cordial. I didn't know him as well as Lady Thatcher  who really became a friend of mine. But I actually didn't blame  them myself. I blame the diplomats as a whole. In fact, the  American ambassador went out of his way to write me a very long  letter, which personally I wouldn't have thought an ambassador  should write.  <H5>  On whether his international relations have improved: </H5>   [Buthelezi] It is still too early to judge, but there have  been a number of ambassadors who have come here paying respects  or just coming to see me in my new capacity.  <H5>  On whether foreign pressure influenced him: </H5>   [Buthelezi] No. In fact, whenever there were those  discussions abroad, I always said to them: you don't have to  live with it, I have to live with it, which they didn't like  very much. I said that whereas I don't question the fact that  they have a right to advise and to help and so on, they are not  South Africans and in the final analysis I have to live with the  results of what they were asking me to do.  <H5>  On when people's standard of living will improve: </H5>   [Buthelezi] You are asking a very painful question because I  don't believe that however much we try -- and it's wrong,  perhaps, for me as a Minister to say so -- but I don't think  that in terms of the promises of the election and the  expectations which have arisen as a result of those promises,  that we can deliver in terms of those promises. I hope it  doesn't create disillusionment.  <H5>  On the possibility of an election before 1999: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I have said that people must prepare for an  election. If you look in the histories of many countries of  majority parties, when they cannot deliver sometimes they call  an election before there is too much disillusionment.  <H5>  On the IFP's election performance: </H5>   [Buthelezi] If you look at the vote I had and, of course, if  you look at the malpractices as well which robbed us of many  votes, even I was surprised. Not that I didn't know that people  supported me. It was not even (only) in the so-called Zulu  areas that I got the vote, but in many parts of South Africa.  If I had campaigned, It seems that I have a right to say I  would have done very well. I don't say I would have been  elected as the government, but I would have done far better if I  had campaigned.  <H5>  On allegations of tensions within the IFP: </H5>   [Buthelezi] It was a figment, really, of the imagination.  There was no such a thing at all. But I think that there were  some Members of Parliament that we had inherited that were keen  to maintain their careers, and they were the ones who were  feeding this to the press, (probably) to put pressure on me.  <H5>  On criticism of IFP `hardliners': </H5>   [Buthelezi] Dr (Mario) Ambrosini even now is very close to  me, not because he gives me political advice at all, but because  of his expertise as an international constitutional lawyer. He  is a very clever and competent person in that field. Mr  (Walter) Felgate has worked with me for nearly 20 years now.  This (criticism) of course was also fed to the press by the  government itself. Also, it is a racist idea that if any white  person is close to you, then he is your adviser in a sense that  he is a guru to you. For an old man like myself who has been in  politics for more than 40 years, to say that either Felgate or  Ambrosini then became my gurus, really, is laughable to me.  <H5>  On whether pre-election pressure on him took its toll on his </H5> health:    [Buthelezi] I really don't know. My mother, who died at the  age of 84, had a very strong constitution. I only say, perhaps,  I must have inherited my mother's constitution. But many people  say I am abusing it because of the pace at which I work, and the  way I work until late at night. I think that the pressure I was  under was such that I even marvel myself when some of the  doctors examine me wand say how low my blood pressure is, how  normal it is.  <H5>  On people's expectations: </H5>   [Buthelezi] I can only echo what President Mandela has said.  Our people, the South African nation, must really understand  that we do mean to deliver -- even those of us who are not  members of the ANC. We do mean to co-operate with the ANC in  the Government to deliver. But even he, President Mandela, has  said that these things can't be delivered instantly. One must  warn the nation that in terms of the vast needs, and the extent  to which the economy itself was damaged by disinvestment and  other things, people should just be a little patient with us.  They should not really look to the Government to do it (alone),  but to the Government to do it with them. I believe the twin  pillars are self-help and self-reliance.</p>

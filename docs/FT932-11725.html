			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: City police unrivalled in fight against urban terror Sir, I refer to your article headed 'Police plead not guilty to terror charges' (April 29). The article states that the City of London police force 'sometimes hasn't got cover at weekends'. This statement is entirely wrong. At all times the force area is covered by a significant number of operational police officers, both on foot patrol and in response cars, capable of dealing with any incident. Indeed, on the morning that the Bishopsgate bomb was discovered by police, the force immediately deployed officers to evacuate a very large area, thus reducing the number of casualties. In common with many other forces, the City of London Police has started setting target response times for attendance at incidents (which are graded in priority bands). This force sets very high targets (four minutes for the most urgent of incidents) and during the early months of this year a performance of almost 94 per cent was recorded across the full range of incidents. Over the past three years, the force has dealt with five bombing incidents in the City of London, and gained unrivalled experience in fighting urban terrorism. It takes a leading role in training on this subject at the police staff college at Bramshill. Because of the heightened risk of terrorism to the City of London, officers have been redeployed from the fraud squad and other specialist departments to undertake anti-terrorist duties. Our officers work closely in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist branch, and at any given time we have up to 30 officers working with them. We feel that it is important that the citizens of the City of London are confident that their police provide a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week service, capable of meeting their needs. Colin Coxall, assistant commissioner of police, City of London Police, 26 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8DJ</p>

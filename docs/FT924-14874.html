			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Tesco executive attacks 'second-rate' suppliers MANY OF Britain's food manufacturers are second-rate, out of touch with consumers and heading for failure, according to a senior executive with a leading supermarket chain. Mr David Robey, Tesco's director of corporate marketing, shocked members at a recent meeting of the Institute of Practitioners of Advertising with his candid and virulent attack on suppliers. Mr Robey said many deserved to fail because of their poor marketing practices. He said a raft of inferior 'me-too' brand names had sprung up in recent years. Mr Robey said second-rate suppliers failed to understand the needs of consumers and conducted their marketing activities from 'ivory towers' from which they 'flattered the egos of clients'. Industry experts said Mr Robey's remarks were part of the growing discontent among large supermarkets with many British suppliers. Mr Alan Mitchell, editor of Marketing magazine, who highlighted the comments on LBC radio, said last night: 'It is quite unprecedented for such a senior marketer with a major multiple to say these things in such an abrasive fashion in public.' Tesco declined to comment on Mr Robey's remarks. Mr Robey qualified his comments by saying that not all suppliers were second-rate. He said there were numerous quality manufacturers in the food and cosmetic sectors. But a tier of 'second-rate' manufacturers had sprung up which failed on a number of scores including value for money.</p>

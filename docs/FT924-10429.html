			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Bush heartened by narrowing of gap in polls POLLING news continued to encourage President George Bush but failed to depress the hopes of his rival, Governor Bill Clinton, yesterday, with less than 100 hours left before election day. As both leading candidates in the presidential race wrapped themselves in the mantles of popular former presidents, Mr Ross Perot invoked only himself and flatly predicted he would carry all 50 states on Tuesday. The now controversial CNN/USA Today daily tracking poll of 'likely voters', taken on Thursday and published yesterday, had the two leading candidates statistically inseparable, with Mr Clinton on 41 per cent, Mr Bush on 40 per cent and Mr Perot down to 14 per cent. The two previous surveys had given Mr Clinton two and three point leads. The likely-voters poll has been criticised by Mr Clinton, among others, for not taking sufficient account of first-time voters. In its parallel measurement of registered voters it put the Democrat ahead by six points, at 42:36:16. Four other polls yesterday put Mr Clinton's lead at between two and nine points. An average of all recent polls by the New York Times, excluding those published yesterday, divides 43:36:16. Mr Bush, addressing a Kentucky Fried Chicken convention in Tennessee, again conjured up former president Harry Truman and assailed what he called Mr Clinton's 'trample down economics'. Under this policy, he said, dreams of small businessmen would be crushed under government bureaucracy. He went from Senator Al Gore's state later yesterday to Missouri and on to Wisconsin, where he will spend today on a train. Dog-tired and fighting a cold, Mr Bush said on television yesterday morning he was not quite sure where he would be going next. When asked about his opposition to the 1964 civil rights act, he looked bemused but admitted 'a mistake', which Mr Clinton, he charged, never did. Mr Clinton began his day by flatly denying he had committed marital infidelity. Mr Clinton's main theme, however, was his middle class values. In a day even more frenetic than Mr Bush's, he spoke in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Georgia. Today he moves from Georgia to Wisconsin and back to New Jersey. All are critical 'battleground' states. The consistent evidence that his popularity is falling did not deter Mr Perot who predicted he would win every state. He also said he would accept no pay for being president. Mr Perot said he would modify the diplomatic service. Ambassadors, he said, were 'as relevant as dinosaurs,' because heads of state talked on the phone to each other all the time.

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ping fails to win support for Opec price action MR JEAN Ping, president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, flew home to Gabon yesterday after a tour of the Middle East having failed to reach any agreement among the ministers he visited for Opec action to prop up the oil price. Mr Ping's visit was prompted by expectations that Iraq would soon return to the export market after talks with the United Nations in New York. He scheduled an emergency meeting for this Wednesday, but was persuaded by Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, to postpone it. No date has been set for another Opec meeting and ministers continue to snipe at each other's overproduction. The pressure has been taken off the organisation by steady oil prices and the fact that talks between Iraq and the UN have not yet resumed. Iraqi negotiators are still in Baghdad although they are expected in New York to resume talks within the next two weeks. Oil prices have barely moved for several days as traders wait to see what will happen in the Iraqi negotiations. 'I think the market over-anticipated how soon Iraqi oil would come back and now prices are on hold until there is more action from either Iraq or Opec,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, consultant with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in the US. The North Sea Brent crude price for September delivery rose 16 cents yesterday to Dollars 16.81 a barrel.</p>

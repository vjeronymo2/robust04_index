			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leaders of the Japan New Party [JNP], including  Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, will hold separate meetings  this week with leaders of the ruling coalition parties,  including Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa. Through the meetings with coalition  leaders, the JNP intends to seek their cooperation for its idea  of setting up a "policy study group," taking into consideration  the proposal by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, JNP  representative, to form a unified parliamentary group of the  ruling parties within the House of Representatives. The idea  leads to an attempt to build a structure led by the ruling  coalition parties in preparation for an upper house election set  for the summer of next year as well as the next general  elections. This JNP move means that the party has come into  close relations with Shinseito and Komeito which are citing the  need to form a "new party" in a bid to establish a political  system based on two major parties. For this reason, JNP leaders  are expected to face tough going in coordinating views with the  SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger  Party] which are trying to differentiate between them and the  Shinseito-Komeito bloc.    Immediately after Prime Minister Hosokawa gave up his plan  to  reshuffle his cabinet, the JNP changed its executive members at  the prime minister's designation, and members who have close  ties with Sakigake have been excluded from the party executive.  In response to this, the JNP has been activating its exchanges  with both Shinseito and Komeito. For example, Shinseito  Secretary General Ozawa ate successively with young JNP members,  and young members from the JNP and Komeito have started a study  group.</p>

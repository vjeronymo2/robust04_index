			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 7: Beset by a string of handicaps - Italy / Italian property is difficult for the outsider LIKE much in Italy, the property market promises immense potential but offers foreign investors limited results, at least in the short term. That is the lesson learned by the handful of UK property consultants which have established local offices in the past two years. The market should be appealing. Italy's is the world's fifth-biggest economy and the northern half of the country is one of Europe's industrial and commercial powerhouses. In terms of income per capita, northern Italy - and particularly the Lombardy region surrounding Milan - ranks among Europe's richest. With only 15 per cent of Italy's population, Lombardy accounts for about a third of the country's gross national product and exports. According to a survey of 504 European companies conducted last year by Healey &amp; Baker, the UK property group, 62 per cent already had some presence in Milan, whether through commercial offices, manufacturing facilities or warehousing and distribution. The city ranked third in Europe behind London and Paris in terms of existing representation. The strength of Milan's international reputation and the shortage of office space have ensured considerable interest on the part of UK property consultants. Jones Lang Wootton (JLW), St Quentin and Healey &amp; Baker all have local offices. Last year, Healey &amp; Baker expanded its presence in northern Italy by buying Trend, a Bologna-based firm, while Hillier Parker has an arrangement with Gabetti, Italy's biggest property consultancy group. Despite its potential, Italian property is beset by a string of handicaps making it difficult, and sometimes even forbidding, for the outsider. As a result, much of the foreign consultants' time has been spent explaining the vagaries of the system to the uninitiated. Meanwhile, growing valuation work has helped them pay the rent. The foreigners' 'missionary' role has been reinforced by the fact that Italy has little tradition of specialist property consultants and few firms geared to international needs. Only a third of commercial property transactions are believed to be handled by professionals. Hence there has been no pressure to produce the sort of reliable information on which most international investors depend for their property decisions. Even basics such as the measurement of buildings are far from standardised. 'The lack of uniformity makes the assessment of a building's worth more erratic', says a JLW spokesman. 'Decisions tend to become very subjective and it puts a much bigger burden on the agent'. New developments face particularly tough problems. Firm conservation policies severely limit the scope within city centres. Even refurbishment behind a preserved facade is restricted by tight rules on retaining the original use of floorspace. And the frequent need to provide some residential accommodation within a redevelopment can make the figures even less attractive to the investor. Add to that the bureaucracy of most big-city councils, where planning applications can languish for years, and a persistent reports of corruption, and Italy's problems come into perspective. Structural factors have made the commercial market particularly sluggish. Italian insurance companies - the predominant institutional owners of property - tend to be less active in managing their portfolios than counterparts elsewhere in Europe. Buildings are kept in structural order. However, owners tend to sit back and focus on rental yields and, until last year's sharp halt, rocketing city-centre capital values, rather than feeling compelled to trade their portfolios. Prime rents in the core of Milan shot up by about 80 per cent between 1986 and 1990, according to JLW. But subsequent stagnancy, or even falls, in rents has done nothing to stimulate the sale market, and agents complain of a continuing 'reality gap' among owners. The lack of liquidity in the office market has been exacerbated by the very high level of private ownership and owner occupancy. For many families, ownership of a city-centre palazzo is an asset only to be touched in the most dire of emergencies. Such factors have limited foreign investment in Italian property. London &amp; Edinburgh Trust is one of a handful of non-Italian groups which have been active in the market, along with a sprinkling of Swedish, French and German names. Foreign consultants such as Healey &amp; Baker's Mr Paul Bacon, believe matters will change with over time. Limitations on city centre developments have spurred new office projects outside city centres on old industrial sites or in greenfield locations in neighbouring districts. But even then, quality tends to be mixed. Surprisingly few of the more recent developments have good air conditioning, raised floors or large column-free spaces. Limited possibilities in the office market have spurred interest in retail developments but obstacles still prevail. Mr Richard Branson, head of the UK's Virgin group, expressed surprise that it had taken 18 months to open the new Milan Megastore, compared with much shorter periods for similar projects in France and Germany. By contrast, local observers were astonished at the speed with which the venture progressed. With city-centre sites limited and immense premiums required for the best locations, out-of-town shopping centres have become a growth area. Opposition from small shopkeepers, who can exert a strong influence on local authorities, has traditionally restricted such developments. However, Mr Bacon thinks matters are now changing and that such developments offer the best prospects for international investors to enter the market.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 10 per cent-15 per cent of a building               of one year's rent                             Legal fees: up to 5 per cent of one                             year's rent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: 10 per cent-15 per cent of a building               of one years rent                             Registration: nominal fee  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Agents fees: 2 per cent of sale price or owner/occupier           Stamp tax: 0.14 per cent of purchase price  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Agents fees: 2 per cent of purchase price or owner/occupier           Notary fee: 0.5 per cent of purchase price  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

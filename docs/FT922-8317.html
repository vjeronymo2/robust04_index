			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (11): Scandals revealed - Why Pagina/12 has become required reading HOW IS IT that a muckraking, stridently anti-establishment newspaper launched on a shoestring five years ago has become one of Argentina's best selling and most influential newspapers? Pagina/12 is now required reading among businessmen, diplomats and politicians as well as its target readership of professionals, students and left wingers. It has built up an average daily circulation of 110,000 with a diet of punchy news, investigative journalism, opinion and cultural columns. Mr Jorge Lanata, the newspaper's 32-year-old editor, explains that 'people read us to get information. We began attracting readers with our political coverage and businessmen began reading us because they needed good information.' Pagina/12 - so-called because it was launched with just 12 pages - was thrust into the vortex of national politics in January last year when Mr Horacio Verbitsky, its leading political columnist, wrote that Mr Menem's brother-in-law had demanded a bribe from an American company. The scandal, which forced Mr Menem to purge half his cabinet, put corruption more firmly than ever on the political agenda. Three months later, Pagina/12 again beat the opposition by breaking the news that Mr Menem's sister-in-law - who is also his appointments secretary - was under investigation in Spain for laundering drug money. The ensuing scandal almost brought Mr Menem down. It is hardly surprising that he loathes Pagina/12 and its 110-strong staff. Last year he even attempted to throttle the newspaper by cutting off federal government advertising - a bid that boomeranged when it set off an international outcry against press censorship. The advertising embargo was quietly lifted after two weeks. The paper's unconventional layout - it covers nearly all its front page with photomontages that invariably ridicule a member of the government - also sets it apart. Its bold headlines and snappy text makes it easily digestible. Nonetheless, its narrow focus on capital city politics and sterile government infighting can be tedious. Pagina/12's success reflects the growing maturity of Argentine society. Mr Lanata says: 'We are not a left or a right wing newspaper. I say we are a liberal newspaper. The left attacks us for belonging to the new right and the right attacks us for being on the left.' Nonetheless, Pagina/12 rarely finds anything praiseworthy in Mr Menem's government. The press, led by Pagina/12, has become one of the few effective checks on Mr Menem's growing personal power. The courts, congress and supposedly independent control agencies have come under growing government influence. As Pagina/12 began publishing exclusive stories, people in the government, the armed forces and business realised its reporters protected their sources and would print almost any story it thought reasonably accurate and newsworthy. That has made Pagina/12 the preferred medium for government leaks, giving it access to yet more exclusive stories which have boosted its circulation still further. However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, like ministers all round the world, complains that the media twist the news. He says: 'Verbitsky suggests that the corruption now emerging means that what we are doing is bad, and that is not true. What we are doing is a real struggle against corruption. Eighty per cent of what he writes is true, but he adds 20 per cent of his own version that changes the conclusion.' He says the media, particularly Pagina/12, has a disproportionate influence on public opinion because its readership is heavily concentrated in wealthy and middle class areas of central Buenos Aires. Mr Cavallo claims the paper is hardly read in the outskirts, where the government draws a lot of its support among low income groups which have benefited the most from his policies. The competition is having to react to Pagina/12's successes. For instance, the tabloid Clarin, Argentina's best-selling newspaper, has promoted younger and more aggressive editors who have begun to outflank Pagina/12 with exclusive articles of their own. Pagina/12 has also shown considerable entrepreneurial spirit. Its solidly faithful readership has made it an attractive vehicle for advertisers. Mr Jorge Prim, the paper's vice-president, says: 'Businessmen pay, and pay well, to advertise. Freedom of the press is good for business.' Revenues have doubled since last year to an average of Dollars 1.2m a month. It broke into the corrupt entertainments advertising market by refusing to accept payment for positive notices of films, plays or concerts. Instead, it began holding film previews of its own and sold tickets to readers from its offices. When advertisers saw that Pagina/12's previews sold out in two hours and could literally fill large cinemas to capacity, it began taking out advertisements - irrespective of the critics' notices. In a recent marketing effort, the newspaper has begun giving away paperback books free once a month on Sundays. It finances the offer with advertising on the back of the books, which are usually by highbrow local and foreign authors. Mr Lanata says print runs of 150,000-160,000 on Sunday editions with books sell out, whereas on most other Sundays he sells 7 per cent fewer newspapers. Mr Lanata had the idea of launching a newspaper shortly after Argentina returned to democracy in 1982. He found a backer in Mr Fernando Sokolowicz, a progressive young businessman who put up the capital and still owns all the newspaper's shares. While Pagina/12 still only breaks even or makes a small operating profit, it has an entrepreneurial spirit that seems out of place in a newspaper that rails against big business and struggles for a fairer society. Like so many businesses in Argentina, Pagina/12 suffered greatly from hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990, and like so many others, it is now benefiting from low inflation and booming demand. So much so, that it is running out of capacity as demand outstrips supply: Pagina/12's presses simply cannot turn out enough newspapers. It plans to increase circulation later this year by printing in Cordoba Argentina's second city 650 km west of Buenos Aires. Mr Lanata says Pagina/12 will be Argentina's first newspaper to use satellite technology to transmit pages to the presses in Cordoba. Using its customary flair, Pagina/12 is financing the introduction of computer technology to the newsroom with an advertising swap with IBM. The feasibility study was farmed out to university computer science students.</p>

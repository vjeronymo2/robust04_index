			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Appointments: Orange pump-priming for BP Oil British Petroleum has appointed John Orange to head its BP Oil UK division following the retirement of Viv Thomas after 33 years with the company. Orange, 49, moves into the UK petrol retailing sector at a time of intense competition for market share as supermarkets challenge the oil companies' business. BP has recently revamped its forecourt set-up and is leading an aggressive assault for motorists' business. No stranger to a tough position, Orange has been responsible, over the past two years, for pushing through BP's cultural change programme which has involved cutting through layers of bureaucracy to give more responsibility to individual managers. The culture change has been controversial inside the company since it has coincided with a period of substantial job losses for which it has often received the blame. Orange previously spent 18 months at BP's operations in Iran just before the revolution in 1979. He then returned to London as legal adviser for two years before being made regional co-ordinator for the Middle East. After that he headed BP Denmark and later BP's New Zealand operations.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Airbus denies signing super-jumbo accord THE FOUR European partners in the Airbus consortium are discussing the possibility of joining Boeing in studying joint construction of a 'super-jumbo' airliner, but have not yet signed an accord with the US company, officials said yesterday, David Buchan reports from Paris. Both Aerospatiale, Airbus' French partner, and Boeing denied a newspaper report quoting Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman of Deutsche Aerospace, Airbus' German partner, saying a transatlantic agreement had been signed to examine the feasibility of building a 600-800 seat aircraft. The supervisory board of Airbus, whose four partners also include British Aerospace and CASA of Spain, yesterday held its monthly meeting in Toulouse. But the issue of the study with Boeing was said to be more for the four partners individually than for the consortium.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Light escape likely for Balsam bankers: How Germany's newest scandal contrasts to the Schneider case Following shortly after the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property group, Germany's large banks have been hit by another case of alleged fraud at a heavily indebted company. The company at the centre of the new debacle is Balsam, a manufacturer of flooring materials used to make tennis courts, artificial surfaces for football pitches and running tracks and other sports installations, based in the town of Steinhagen near Bielefeld in Westphalia. Balsam owes DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) and its entire four-man board was arrested earlier this week on suspicion of credit fraud. Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank and other large German institutions own an indirect 15 per cent stake in Balsam via WFG Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Wagniskapital, a venture capital company. Despite this bankers said yesterday that the direct and indirect credit risk is spread between 40 banks and that no individual bank is owed more than DM100m. This contrasts with the case of Schneider, where banks are owed DM5bn and Deutsche Bank alone is owed DM1.2bn, against which it has had to make a DM500m provision. But although the Schneider case was significantly bigger than Balsam, there are parallels. Both companies were led by charismatic entrepreneurs whose apparent wealth served to dampen bankers' fears about mounting debts. Just as Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur whose disappearance triggered the property crisis, always paid his interest bill on time - so Mr Friedel Balsam, chief executive of the floorings group, was always punctual in meeting his payments to bankers. 'Moreover he was always willing and able to inject further cash into the business from his own resources,' said one banker yesterday. It was perhaps for this reason that bankers were indifferent to the scale of Balsam's debts which seem vast for a company with turnover of a modest DM460m and net profits of only DM15m last year. This parallels bankers' nonchalance about a rapid build-up of debt at Schneider prior to his recent disappearance. Bankers, due to gather last night in Wiesbaden for their first talks on Balsam, said the company's biggest direct creditor was Procedo, Germany's largest factoring company. Factoring, a financing technique which is in its infancy in Germany, is at the heart of the alleged fraud. Factoring companies advance cash to their customers against the security of unpaid invoices. They take a commission for the service provided and assume responsibility for collecting their customers' outstanding receivables. According to Mr Jost Schmiedeskamp, state prosecutor in Bielefeld, the four directors of Balsam have been arrested on suspicion of forging documentation to support factoring agreements. Mr Schmiedeskamp said the board stood accused of concocting large orders from foreign customers, or of inflating the value of real contracts by a factor of 60 in some cases. The invoices for these fictitious orders were presented to Procedo in conjunction with documents purporting to be from a US bank and a US accounting firm, but these documents were alleged by the prosecutor to be fraudulent. He said that the cash raised against the invoices was used by Mr Balsam and his boardroom colleagues to speculate in the currency markets. The fraud has allegedly been running for a number of years and the state prosecutor said it opened its investigations into the case in late 1992. The alleged fraud is given an added twist by the fact that Mr Balsam, 85 per cent shareholder in the flooring company, is also a minority shareholder in the company he is accused of defrauding: together with his finance director he has has a 3.9 per cent stake in Procedo. But business between Procedo and Balsam was conducted on an arms' length basis, Procedo has insisted. Balsam is believed to have been Procedo's biggest customer, but how much Procedo is owed has not yet emerged. Neither is it clear how much Procedo itself owes the banks with which it refinanced its factoring business. For bankers mulling on the similarities to the Schneider case, there is one consolation: while Mr Schneider's whereabouts are unknown Mr Balsam is at least behind bars.</p>

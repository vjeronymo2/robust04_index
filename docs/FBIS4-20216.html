			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Surprisingly, the Bonn coalition  leaders have temporarily shelved the disputed Bundeswehr thrift  plans presented by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, [according to  the] Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. Obviously as a result of  pressure exerted by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the body, chaired by  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, decided on Tuesday [26 April] to  establish a working group consisting of defense experts of the  CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP. These experts are  to intensively discuss Ruehe's plans -- including the reduction  of the armed forces to 340,000 men -- before any decisions are  made.    According to reports from coalition circles, a detailed  commitment to the future structure and strength of the  Bundeswehr has been avoided. This is to be made before the  Bundestag elections, if possible even before the summer recess,  participants in the meeting said.    Kinkel had reportedly come out against the reduction of the  armed forces to 340,000 men, which Ruehe is striving for, and  has insisted on the current upper limit of 370,000 men.  Primarily, it must be asked how big the Bundeswehr must be in  view of Germany's security policy, Kinkel said. This determines  the financial demand and not the other way round, namely that  the financial demand determines the size of the Bundeswehr. In  the CDU/CSU, too, the number of soldiers is disputed.    After the meetings of the coalition representatives and the  Cabinet, Ruehe stressed that, apart from the question of  personnel, the basic issues of his concept met with agreement.  This applies to the financial demand of 47.5 billion German  marks per year, the division of the Bundeswehr in crisis  reaction forces and main defense forces, as well as a  correspondingly differentiated military service of 12 and 10  months respectively. General compulsory military service is to  be maintained in any case, Ruehe told journalists. This year no  further decisions will be made about the future of individual  barracks.    Ruehe repeated his view that with the current financial  volume it is not possible to maintain a strength of 370,000 men,  modernize the Bundeswehr, and raise the investment share from  the current 20 percent to the planned 30 percent all at the same  time. The savings outside personnel reduction, which Kinkel is  demanding, are envisaged in his concept anyway, Ruehe said. He  is confident regarding the further discussion; he feels "very  much supported" by his party. CDU/CSU circles said that the  decision by the coalition representatives was surprising after  the FDP had signalled basic agreement after talks with Ruehe  over the past few days.    The German Bundeswehr Association has meanwhile called the  minister's ideas "well founded." In the future, too, the army  will be large enough to fulfill its tasks, Association Manager  Bernhard Gertz said on Deutschlandradio Berlin.    In the response to a parliamentary inquiry by the Party of  Democratic Socialism, the Federal Government stated on Monday  that about 169,000 recruits were drafted for basic military  service last year.</p>

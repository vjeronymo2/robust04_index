			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television When you think about the effects of putting a dam across the Euphrates, or atoning for past genocidal crimes by ceding water rights to Indian tribes such as the Shoshone and Arapahoe, it puts into perspective any difficulties the damp land of Britain may experience from drought. However, water is clearly such an important and fraught subject that it makes good sense for BBC2 to mount a series called Water Wars to deal with such matters (8.10). Charles Stewart, master of the hand-held camera, takes his gear aboard the London-Leeds express to tell the story of the people who try to keep British Rail's trains running in Inside Story (9.30 BBC1). Dontcha love the Americans? Given the technology of cable TV and the protection of freedom of expression under the Constitution they came up with Manhattan Cable (11.00), a system which permits every health freak, sex nut, and religious loony to get on the screen and proselytise. And why not? Channel 4 begins a new series showing excerpts from MC. Later C4 screens Ingmar Bergman's The Rite (12.15), not a film but a TV production made in nine days.</p>

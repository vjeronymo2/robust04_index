			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Record Pounds 2m at Hicking Pentecost RECOVERY AT Hicking Pentecost was confirmed yesterday as the Cardiff-based textiles and specialist castings manufacturer reported profits ahead to a record Pounds 2.17m pre-tax for the year to the end of March. The outcome - scored on turnover ahead to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 21.1m) - compared to Pounds 782,000 last time and a deficit of Pounds 1.69m the year before. Mr John Lister, chairman, said that Nicholson Plastics, which makes glass reinforced plastic water storage tanks, made a better-than-expected contribution to profits since its acquisition last July. Since the year-end, Hicking has acquired Thompson Horseley Bridge, another water tank manufacturer, and Mr Lister said that further purchases were being sought. Operating margins and return on capital improved, he said, and the proceeds of last year's open offer, after the Nicholson purchase, helped to cut borrowings. Gearing was eliminated by the year-end with a net cash balance of about Pounds 1.5m. After an increased tax charge, earnings per share improved 44 per cent to 11.25p (7.82p). A proposed final dividend of 2.2p lifts the total by 51 per cent to 3.4p.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Chamorro blocks investment bill MRS Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Nicaragua's president, has vetoed a new foreign investment bill, arguing it is not sufficiently attractive to overseas investors, writes Tim Coone in Managua. The bill was passed by the National Assembly last month, after several important amendments were made to the original draft. One amendment prohibits the use of debt-swap instruments for new foreign investments. Another created an unwieldy 12-man committee to supervise foreign investment applications.</p>

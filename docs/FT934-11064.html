			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 1.3% as region continues to set records PROFIT-TAKING in East Japan Railway dampened sentiment, and the Nikkei average lost 1.3 per cent on arbitrage linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average ended 264.73 off at 19,438.24 after opening at the day's high of 19,656.97 and slipping to a low of 19,375.24 in the afternoon. Volume was a thin 200m shares, against 297.6m. Declines led rises by 594 to 363, with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.84 to 1,619.75, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.11 to 1,283.67. Traders said individual investors and second tier brokers were selling JR East. Meanwhile, much of the downward pressure came from arbitrage selling linked to Nikkei 225 futures. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities commented: 'The market is not going to turn up until JR East rises above its initial trading price of Y600,000.' JR East receded Y28,000 to Y492,000, slipping below the psychological support level of Y500,000 for the first time since its debut last Tuesday. Technical analysts hope the Nikkei index will be supported at its 52-week moving average of 19,200. 'That is the lowest it is likely to fall in the near term,' said a Japanese broker. Margin buyers sold Sumitomo Metal Mining, which fell Y30 to Y836, and NEC, down Y2 at Y949. High-technology shares, which gained last week on the rise in the dollar against the yen, declined on profit-taking. Large-capital issues also eased on profit-taking: Nippon Steel dipped Y8 to Y326 and NKK Y4 to Y269. Banks were lower as a leading Japanese brokerage house sold Nikkei 300 linked shares: Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y20 to Y3,340 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y40 to Y2,360. Carmakers, on the other hand, firmed on foreign buying. Toyota Motor, the most active issue of the day, rose Y20 to Y1,900, while Honda Motor moved ahead Y20 to Y1,610. NTT advanced Y3,000 to Y834,000 on bargain hunting. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 110.54 to 21,511.11 in volume of 7.9m shares. Small-lot selling was one reason; and railway stocks lost ground in tandem with JR East. Roundup FOREIGN buying brought further records to the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG continued to be propelled higher by further strong US and Japanese demand, although the advance slowed towards the end of the session with the emergence of profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 300.10, or 3.2 per cent, up at a record 9,629.19, after establishing an all-time intraday high of 9,710.08. BANGKOK finished its most active trading day ever at another historic high as foreigners continued to pour funds into the market. The composite index rose 65.25, or 5.2 per cent, to 1,326.16 in turnover of Bt28bn, against the previous record of Bt27bn set on October 7. NEW ZEALAND registered its seventh consecutive advance with the NZSE-40 capital index 35.52, or 1.6 per cent, ahead at 2,199.50 - its highest level since August 1989. AUSTRALIA climbed to another six-year peak, encouraged by a narrowing in the current account deficit, a 9 per cent jump in exports and a rise in building approvals. The All Ordinaries index added 20.2 at 2,132.4. SEOUL advanced in brisk trading as buying interest in large-capitalisation export-oriented issues gained momentum. The composite index closed 11.04 higher at 761.76 in turnover of Won866.32bn. JAKARTA was firmer in active trading, with both local and foreign investors focusing on banking and property stocks. The official index finished 2.95 ahead at 469.10. KARACHI saw the KSE 100 index recover 12.14 to 1,540.08, writes Farhan Bokhari. The market had turned lower on profit-taking during the previous two days. However, after official predictions of a bumper 12m-bale cotton crop this year, there was concern over new estimates from some officials and businessmen who predicted between a 10 and 15 per cent shortfall from the estimated figure due to recent pest attacks in central Punjab. BOMBAY relinquished further ground as brokers continued to wind down positions ahead of December 1 when new capital adequacy norms will be applied. The BSE index shed 52.46 to 2,621.28. KUALA LUMPUR was dragged lower by a retreat in Telekom Malaysia. The KLSE composite index dipped 4.94 to 967.05 as Telekom fell 80 cents to MDollars 20.80.</p>

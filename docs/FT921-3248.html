			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Israel and US in clash over 'weapons sales' ALREADY-STRAINED ties between Israel and the US have come under greater pressure from new reports that Israel sold US military technology to China, South Africa and other third countries. Israel has hotly denied any unauthorised sales, but US officials have confirmed they are examining possible transfers of military technology. 'We have some concerns. We are discussing it with the Israelis. I don't want to go beyond that,' said Mr Robert Clarke, assistant secretary of state in charge of politico-military affairs, whose office supervises US arms exports. The row reflects deep splits in the Bush administration over how to handle US-Israeli ties. Besides the immediate point of contention, the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn)-worth of loan guarantees Israel has asked to help it settle up to 1m immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Israel's entire role in US foreign policy is now in flux. The loan guarantees question may be edging nearer solution, as leading senators have reportedly worked out a compromise which addresses US concerns that the guarantees should not directly or indirectly finance Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza. But it is not clear if Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, is ready to accept this Senate compromise. Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, Israeli spokesman, said yesterday his country would co-operate with any US investigation of alleged unauthorised sales of US military technology, said to include air-to-air missile supplies to China, anti-tank missiles to South Africa, and cluster bombs to Ethiopia. Israeli officials have reacted angrily to the reports, denying the allegations and accusing the Bush administration of trying to smear Israel. But beneath the anger, concern is clear over the effect the issue may have on the country's strategic relationship with Washington. 'Israel has nothing to hide and is prepared to make everything available to the US government,' said Mr Netanyahu. 'I can guarantee you we have scrupulously abided by our commitments to the US. We have a lot at stake here and we do not want to jeopardise it.' While denying illicit trade in US technology, officials have been forced by the reports to make public statements about Israel's arms exports from its own defence industries which have a record of copying and enhancing foreign technologies. Mr Moshe Arens, defence minister, who is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, in Washington today, said publicly for the first time at the weekend that Israel had sold some of its own arms to China. 'Our industrial base is microscopic, so I think nobody should be surprised that Israel sells some of the products of its defence industries to other countries, including China,' Mr Arens said on Saturday. Israel is worried that the raising of the issue by Washington is a signal by the Bush administration, already at odds with the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir over policy in the occupied territories, that it attaches less importance to the strategic relationship with Israel than in the past. Any restriction of US military co-operation would be a serious blow to the Israeli Defence Forces and Israel's ailing defence industries which have big sales in the US.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (4): Scandals mar City's image - Foreign bankers in London criticise legal and regulatory structure the collapse of Polly Peck, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Maxwell Empire - could not have come at a worse time for the City of London. Just when the City is trying to persuade other European financial centres to adopt its practices, these frauds have led some financial institutions to question whether the City is the best model for European markets. Many foreign banks have suffered heavy losses in their British operations over the past two years, much of the losses resulting from these corporate failures. The reactions of these banks vary according to their national origin and their individual strategies. Nonetheless, most say that the prestige of London has been damaged and that they are likely to scale down their activities. However, a massive exodus is unlikely. Most foreign banks blame the severe UK recession for the scale of their loan losses, which in some cases compare in size with those of UK banks. But others raise questions about the legal and regulatory structure. Their criticism is not always accurate or fair. But it demonstrates that the City has developed an image problem. Foreign banks began to criticise the legal structure just over a year ago, when the House of Lords ruled that all swap deals - complicated financial transactions - carried out with local authorities were illegal. Many foreign banks had been involved in this market and they therefore faced huge losses as a result of the ruling. Bitterness persists. 'We thought London was a free market, where innovation was possible,' says the managing director of one Continental institution. 'Then the Lords decided that deals made openly for years should never have taken place]' An American banker makes a similar point: 'Obviously, foreign institutions are very concerned if financial transactions they have undertaken in good faith have unexpected legal consequences. We thought we knew the British legal system pretty well. But now, we have to wonder what will happen when trying out other inventive types of transactions.' More recently, UK accounting and auditing standards have become a target of criticism from overseas bankers who profess astonishment at the way in which various leading British groups have collapsed. The problem as they see it is that accounting rules are much more relaxed in the UK than elsewhere making it easy to overstate profits or assets. Auditors, who approve the accounts of companies which have later collapsed, are criticised severely. Some bankers are concerned that accounting firms may not be sufficiently rigorous when conducting an audit, if, at the same time, they are offering other services to that company. The chief executive of an American merchant bank in London makes a separate complaint: 'There is a difference between the UK and the US in the potential liability the auditors face if it is shown they did not exert sufficient diligence in their audit. So, UK auditors are not quite so terrified of making a mistake'. The evolution of market regulation since Big Bang is also questioned. Since Big Bang, says one German banker, new laws have been introduced which have put business on a legalistic basis which did not previously exist when he City operated to the code My Word is my Bond The regulation of the City is thus viewed as being too much and too little. Too much, according to an American financier, because it is much more expensive to abide by than in France or Germany, but too little in the pension funds area, where the lack of regulation was exposed by Mr Robert Maxwell's plundering of his companies' pension funds. As for the role of the Bank of England, some foreign banks compliment the Bank on its efficiency in the territory it covers, but wish it had broader responsibilities. Continental bankers are occasionally wistful about the more interventionist policies of their own central banks, which often play a more active role in preventing large corporate collapses. Other bankers also regret that there is not a central register of borrowings in Britain, as there is in all big continental European countries. Such a register, which records all bank loans to large companies, could have prevented lending to the Maxwell empire running out of control, since bankers would have been alerted earlier to the overall size of the debt. A German banker says: 'If there had been such a register, the Maxwell disaster would have been impossible.' Sharp and wide-ranging as these criticisms may be, they should be viewed cautiously. The anger among foreign bankers is clearly related to the size of their losses from doing business in the UK. That prompts the suspicion that by attacking the City's practices, bankers are trying to excuse their responsibility for making some imprudent loans in the British market. Banks also tend to react differently according to their nationality. French banks are the most vocal critics of London. Part of the explanation might be that in the 1980s they increased rapidly their exposure in the UK - their aggregated loans to the Maxwell empire were second only in size to those of the British banks. Another factor might be their disillusionment which followed their great admiration for London and its Big Bang. German bankers tend to take a softer line and put the emphasis more on the UK economy: 'As German banks,' says one of them, 'our view is that the UK environment is missing the solid economic basis we are used to.' Americans take a more phlegmatic view. 'In the last resort, it's up to the banks to protect themselves against crooks and to have a better knowledge of the market,' says the head of an American institution in London, before adding that Tokyo and New York have problems, too. Even the most outspoken critics do agree with this last point: the regulatory and legal structure is not necessarily better elsewhere. The Foreign Banks Association is talking to the Bank of England about the possibility of setting up a register of borrowings. Foreign banks had also been awaiting with great interest the preliminary report, published last week, of the committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Alexander, the chairman of National Westminster Bank, set up to investigate possible pitfalls and loopholes in the UK legal structure for City business. Nonetheless, some reduction in the scale of foreign banks' activities in the UK is likely, with foreign institutions becoming more cautious and scaling down their operations. 'They will have to keep their presence in London, but they will not expand as they might have done,' says an American banker. The role of London as an international financial centre, for foreign exchange or Euromarkets should not be affected but British companies might find it more difficult to get credits from foreign banks which, two years ago, were desperate to lend.</p>

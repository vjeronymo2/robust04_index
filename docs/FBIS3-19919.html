			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finland will extend its territorial waters from the  current four to 12 nautical miles. However, according to a  decision made by the government at its informal evening meeting  a little while ago, there will be a passage of at least six  nautical miles between the territorial waters of Finland and  Estonia in the Gulf of Finland. Markku Lehto reports:    [Lehto] Behind the government's decision in principle to  extend Finland's territorial waters to 12 nautical miles lies,  first of all, the need to monitor traffic off the Finnish coast  more closely than before. Here is what Foreign Minister Heikki  Haavisto says:    [Begin Haavisto recording] Well, I believe that now our  Frontier Guards establishment, operating under the Interior  Ministry, will have new kinds of possibilities, because now the  distance within which we can take measures will increase  considerably, that is, this will considerably improve Finland's  security. [end recording]    [Lehto] Another reason has been international pressure; our  neighbors implemented the extension of their territorial waters  earlier: Estonia extended its territorial waters to 12 nautical  miles a year ago, and earlier both Russia and Sweden made a  similar decision.    The planned new nautical border for Finland differs from the  main principle of 12 nautical miles in the Gulf of Finland and  in (Bogskaer) of the Aaland Islands. A passage of three  nautical miles of open sea will be reserved from the center  toward the coast in the Gulf of Finland to meet the needs of  shipping mainly near St. Petersburg at the end of the Gulf of  Finland. The Estonians have also left a similar passage for  Russian shipping, so that traffic to and from St. Petersburg can  in future use a passage of six nautical miles.</p>

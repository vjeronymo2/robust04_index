			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / French defend fish curb France yesterday defended its controls on fish imports after protests from trade partners including the US, arguing that they were in line with world trade rules and prevented fraud, Reuter reports from Paris. 'Once they are aware of the gravity of some of the fraud, no country will question these measures,' Mr Jean Puech, French agriculture and fisheries minister, said at the opening of the Paris Farm Fair. 'The US cannot but accept our move.' A ministry official said customs had destroyed an unspecified tonnage of US fish which contained a chemical substance used to retain water in products such as ham, meat and fish and which is illegal in France. 'It's fraud. A US trader was caught red-handed. . . US exporters will go along with them if they want to do trade,' he said. France started strict controls on fish imports on February 3 in an effort to appease its angry fishermen hit by falling prices and cheap foreign imports. The move raised strong protests from some of its non-European trade partners.</p>

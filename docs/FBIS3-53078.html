			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani at a </F> ceremony in Tehran marking the anniversary of the Prophet's  divine appointment -- recorded]    [Excerpts] May this auspicious and glorified day be a  blessing for our Hezbollah community. On behalf of those  present, I congratulate the honorable and esteemed leader of  revolution. This is a great day for all Muslims and for our  nation. [passage omitted]    It is obvious that Islamic Iran is at the head of a movement  today. The first word was spoken by our late imam, and today  your excellency is repeating the message, guiding and  supervising our people and humanity. We know that as much as  this path and way is important for us, it is heavy and bitter  for the enemies of Islam. Unable to wage physical war they are  frantically waging a psychological war against the Islamic  revolution. They miss no opportunity and no occasion to somehow  weaken this revolution, the Koran, and the prophet's mission in  the world. But, thank God, they usually fail and they are now  losing the last game.    In Your Excellency's frank and very clear address to the  people of Qom yesterday, you determined a suitable path, a fresh  move in the new battle scene, by warning pencil-pushers,  talkers, and the practical and active forces. Prior to this...  [pauses] In the second development plan we have policies which  you sketched out and which officially entered the plan for the  first time in the history of the revolution. Although in the  first plan too we enjoyed the imam's frank messages and views,  this time we, the government, had an organized and codified  guideline on which to plan policies. Today it is up to the  Majles to carefully review the policies which are the rights of  the leader, according to the constitution and to religious law.  And so we could have policies with peace of mind in the next  few years.    I think with the very frank language which you used  yesterday, our tribunes, pens, and tongues will not allow our  enemies in this psychological war to weaken the spirit of our  ummah, the Koran, and Islam, or to achieve something by  motivating and inspiring the dejected enemies of Islam. Our  nation has been and shall continue to be vigilant and to guard  the messages and orders of the guardianship of the juriconsult.  [passage omitted]</p>

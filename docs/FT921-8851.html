			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar jumps on US sales data THE DOLLAR steamed ahead on the foreign exchanges yesterday, using the excuse of better than expected US retail sales figures for its 1 1/2  pfennig gain on the D-Mark, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US unit ended in London near its high for the day of DM1.6270 at DM1.6230. Economists said the dollar was now approaching a new psychological barrier of DM1.6350, the level reached in its first rally earlier this year. It closed still at DM1.6230 in New York. Strong underlying demand fuelled the dollar's rise, as well as retail figures which showed sales up 0.6 per cent in January, compared with a forecast 0.2 per cent. In the short term, economists expect the dollar to continue its upward path. 'It would be a brave man to stand in the way of the dollar at the moment,' said Mr Mark Austin, an economist with Hongkong Bank. However, he warned that the retail figures should be treated with caution. 'Nothing fundamental has changed,' he said. The foreign exchanges appear to have forgotten the threat of a rate cut in the US. The dollar's strength was most notable against the D-Mark and the Swiss franc. The Swiss unit continued to suffer from rumours earlier in the week that the central bank would not halt a drop in the franc. Although that speculation was refuted by the Swiss National Bank, the denial had not been 'as vehement' as usual, said Mr Austin. The Swiss currency closed weaker at SFr1.4575, compared with SFr1.4385. Mr Nigel Newman, senior economist at Barclays, suggested that the Swiss central bank could 'be staging a managed depreciation'. Against the yen, the US unit was still hampered by fears of central bank intervention. However, the dollar firmed from Y127.55 to Y127.70. The D-Mark's weakness was noticeable against most European currencies, but traders said the problem lay with a strong dollar rather than an inherently weak D-Mark. The German unit fell against the peseta, from Pta 62.96 per D-Mark to Pta 62.92. Contrary to some expectations, the Bank of Spain did not cut rates upon publication of figures showing core inflation for January up 1.5 per cent. The Spanish currency's strength put extra pressure on sterling, which remained at the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism grid. Sterling was still fairly resilient against the D-Mark, in spite of disappointing UK jobless figures. These showed unemployment up 53,000 to 9.2 per cent of the workforce in January - the highest level since October 1987. Forecasts had been pitched at a 30,000 rise. The pound closed steady at DM2.8725. Traders suggested that the pound's performance in recent days could offer the government a window of opportunity to reduce interest rates. However, sterling would have to strengthen further against the D-Mark, to allow a buffer in the ERM grid.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esad Cerovic] </F>   [Text] The Congress of the Serbian People in  Bosnia-Herzegovina ended yesterday with the adoption of the  Declaration of Citizens of Serbian Nationality. The Declaration  asks the international community that they [the Serbian  citizens] be included in negotiations on the integral peace  solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite the fact that many  assessments consider that the Congress should have been  organized at a much earlier date, this assembly in Sarajevo  marks the process of differentiation and a national awakening of  the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It shows that this  process is not deadlocked and it raises to the surface the  question of whether the national feeling of the Serbs of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will take the form of the Bosnian Serbs  journeying to a civic society.    Yesterday's Congress in Sarajevo answers this question. This  Congress was the matriculation examination for the Serbs who  live in Bosnia-Herzegovina, their "No" to fascism, primitivism,  and national socialism. What had been halted by force and  ideology -- as was evident at yesterday's Congress of the  Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has come out of the  shadows and offered light in place of darkness and truth in  place of lies. It has also shown a tie to the Bosnian land and  the desire to live with all the other peoples. Karadzic's grim  ideology, an ideology of darkness, murder, massacre, expulsion,  national socialism, was unmasked at the Sarajevo Congress, and  the [word indistinct] that he represents all the Serbs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina was taken away from him. With this, the  Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina have lifted to the level of  reality their chance not to live at the tail of events, but to  move on toward Europe, toward a civic society. The personal  feeling of belonging to an ethnic identity must certainly be  respected, and it will be. That is why we need to differentiate  both in alphabet and speech. The right to be called Bosnian  Serbs belongs to that part of the Serbian people that yesterday  clearly expressed its political position.    To put it as nicely as one of the participants in the  Congress of Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina put it:  Karadzic can probably represent only that part of the people  that voted for him and that unreservedly support him, or -- more  precisely -- the chetnik part, the part that sees the chetnik  ideology as its own. This ideology has always ended up on the  garbage heap of history.    Of course, yesterday's Congress in Sarajevo did not appeal  to  the [word indistinct] factory of lies. A commentary speaks  about passers-by that were picked up off the street. However,  in the name of truth, the Serbian people -- those who may have  been unable to see this gathering -- need to be told that the  following people actively participated and were present in the  congress hall: Ljubomir Berberovic, Tihomir Berberovic, lawyer  Zarko Bulic, Miro Lazovic [B-H Assembly chairman], [Presidency  member] Tatjana Ljujic-Mijatovic, [Presidency member] Mirko  Pejanovic, Dragutin Braco Kosovac, Mico Rakic, Nikola Kovac,  Nada Mladina, Gavrilo Grahovac, Goran Simic, and Zivko Babic.  Every Serb, regardless of where he lives, is probably aware  that Dragutin Braco Kosovac, Mico Rakic, and Ljubomir Berberovic  have far more distinguished reputations than the criminals  Karadzic, Koljevic, and Krajisnik.    Theories that advocate the existence of (?worthless) peoples  and states are wrong. Yesterday's Congress of the citizens of  Serbian nationality struck a blow to Karadzic's theory of the  impossibility of joint existence and his primitive nationalism,  and this blow will send it to where it belongs -- the garbage  heap of history.</p>

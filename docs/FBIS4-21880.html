			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A senior Fatah official was  kidnapped by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists in  Gaza city over the weekend. Hamas claims that the man was  collaborating with the Israeli authorities. Palestinian sources  told our correspondent Moti Amir that the real reason behind the  kidnapping was a dispute over land in Rafah. In the course of  the kidnapping a violent fight broke out; one Hamas activist was  killed and 30 were injured. The sources stressed that because  of the continuing clashes with Hamas, Fatah was making efforts  to capture influential positions and seize control of land and  installations before Hamas does.    Our army affairs correspondent has learned that two wanted  Hamas activists turned themselves in to the IDF over the past  few weeks. IDF commanders in the Gaza Strip are continuing to  hold contacts and meetings with Hamas members in an effort to  persuade them to halt terrorist activity. Military sources said  that the Hamas activists have a great deal of motivation to  carry out terrorist attacks and they are expected to increase  their efforts over the next few days.</p>

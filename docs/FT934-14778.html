			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Car shell to change Carmakers will radically change the materials they use in cars in the coming decade as steel and cast iron increasingly give way to aluminium and plastics, and to a lesser extent magnesium, writes Kevin Done. According to a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit the motor industry is on the threshold of a significant change in the use of materials in the race to save weight and to respond to environmental pressures. The use of aluminium by the world car industry is forecast almost to double by the end of the decade and the use of plastics will increase by more than 30 per cent.</p>

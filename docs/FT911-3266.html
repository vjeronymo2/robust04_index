			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Bonn and Tokyo accept forces can serve abroad JAPAN and Germany yesterday both took significant steps in relaxing the way their post-Second World War constitutions are interpreted, allowing their defence forces to play a role in the Gulf. The German cabinet yesterday agreed to send 300 Bundeswehr soldiers to Iran to build a camp for Kurdish refugees. This eased restrictions on the operation of German troops outside the Nato area: such deployments had been considered politically unacceptable, although it has never been clear whether they are banned by the constitution. Japan meanwhile formally approved the despatch of minesweepers to the Gulf and the grant of Dollars 100m (Pounds 59m) to help Kurdish refugees. The moves could signal a new willingness by Japan to contribute to world affairs following international criticism of its passiveness during the Gulf war. The despatch of six ships is the first time since 1945 that Japanese troops have been sent on active service overseas. But Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, said in a rare televised press conference last night that the move would not set a precedent for sending other Japanese military forces abroad in future. He insisted Japan remained wedded to its peace constitution. He urged the government's critics at home and overseas to show their support  -an appeal aimed particularly at China, which has expressed concern that the minesweeping mission might set a dangerous precedent. Mr Kaifu will have further opportunities to reassure Japan's Asian neighbours during a tour of south-east Asia next week. Mr Kaifu spelt out reasons why Japan felt it was now right to send minesweepers after the government had rejected the idea in 1987 and again last year. First, since the Gulf war was finished, there was little risk of Japanese servicemen being drawn into combat,a development which could infringe the peace constitution. Next, minesweeping was different from other kinds of military duty so no dangerous precedents would be set; then, the safety of ships, including oil tankers bound for Japan, had to be secured; also, the Gulf states needed the mines cleared before they could rebuild their economies; finally, Japan had to make a bigger contribution to the world. Mr Kaifu said: 'It is not right for Japan to stay aloof from the rest of the world." Germany's decision to send troops to Iran, following talks with the Iranian government, comes soon after its own decision to send minesweepers to the Gulf. Although both operations are described as exceptional, with the action in Iran labelled as 'humanitarian' rather military, they indicate a significant redefinition of what had previously been thought possible. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has promised to revise existing restrictions before the end of the year. Officials in the Defence Ministry, who have always supported a wider role for German troops, have privately welcomed the recent decisions. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, for long opposed to out-of-Nato operations, seems to have relaxed his position.</p>

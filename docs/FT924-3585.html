			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Letter: Location inspires long-standing indecision in the EC Sir, Observer noted in 'Talking heads' (December 3) that Euro ministers could not agree on the location of a future European Drugs Agency. The question of seats for European institutions, and the hassles between member states that go with it, is now 41 years old. Even today, the EC Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have no permanent seat. The EC Council, composed of ministers from national governments, has to decide unanimously on matters of seats or locations. Unanimity could not be reached in the past because France insists that, first, Strasbourg must become, officially and finally, the seat of the European Parliament. Several other decisions are pending, such as the location of the European Environmental Agency and the future central bank. In 1951, the foreign ministers of the six-nation Coal and Steel Community tried, and failed, to decide where the future capital of Europe should be located. I was then a United Press correspondent covering that meeting in Paris. It was 3.30 in the morning after endless hours of discussion when Konrad Adenauer emerged from the conference room, shaking his head, murmuring 'poor Europe'. Each member state had made several proposals, he said, 'but when Luxembourg suggested (as its umpteenth proposal) to have Europe's capital in Mondorf-les-Bains, I left. I do not even know where it is and how it is spelt.' That was 41 years ago. Rudiger von Wechmar, D-8000 Munich, Amalienstrasse 45, Germany</p>

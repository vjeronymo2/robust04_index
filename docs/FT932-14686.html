			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Boost to food costs pushes up inflation: Prices are up 1.9% but construction suppliers say it is difficult to make rises stick SHARPER PRICE increases for food were the main influence behind the rise in inflation last month, official figures showed yesterday. The retail prices index rose by 0.4 per cent in March from 138.8 in February to 139.3. Compared with a year ago, prices were up by 1.9 per cent, marginally higher than in February, when the annual rate was 1.8 per cent. Although mortgage interest rates fell more steeply last month than at the same time last year, increases in food prices were sharper than a year ago. This, with price rises for motoring, clothing and household goods, nudged the all-items index upwards. The Central Statistical Office reported that excluding mortgage interest payments - an underlying measure favoured by the Treasury - the annual rate rose to 3.5 per cent in March from 3.4 per cent. The month-on-month rise in this index was 0.7 per cent. The sharpest price increases were for seasonal food, in particular fresh vegetables and home-killed lamb. The CSO said price increases for non-seasonal foods such as beef, dairy products, sugar and soft drinks reflected the recent devaluation of the 'green pound' in which agricultural products are priced. Overall food prices rose 0.8 per cent on the previous month and 1.5 per cent in the year to March, the largest March rise since 1986. There were also big price increases for clothing and footwear. On the month, prices rose 1.9 per cent, reflecting recoveries from the sharp reductions in the winter sales and increases for the new seasons' fashions in the shops. A 0.2 per cent month-on-month rise in fuel and light prices reflected increases of domestic heating oil prices. The final phase of the recent increase in telephone charges was behind a 0.5 per cent rise in household services prices compared with February. Motoring expenditure prices rose by 1 per cent on the month, mainly as a result of increases in petrol and second-hand car prices. City economists had been expecting an unchanged inflation rate in March, although the modest increase is unlikely to generate new concerns about growing pressure on price increases. Increases in excise duties announced in the Budget will start to affect the retail prices index this month. Statisticians said the effect on the annual rate would be fairly neutral, however, because of similar rises a year ago.  ------------------------------------------------             INFLATION RISES TO 1.9%  ------------------------------------------------ Housing (172)                       -3.6% Motoring (143)                      +3.1% Food (non-seasonal) (130)           +2.8% Alcoholic drink (80)                +5.0% Household goods (77)                +1.3% Clothing &amp; footwear (59)            +0.3% Household services (48)             +4.2% Leisure goods (47)                  +1.7% Catering (47)                       +5.3% Fuel &amp; light (47)                   -0.2% Personal goods, serv.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- Cuba took a new step today in  its national offensive against any type of criminal activity by  enacting the decree-law that calls for the confiscation of goods  and assets obtained through illegal enrichment.    The official provision, which was published this morning in  the newspaper GRANMA, reflects the decision adopted by the  National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament) [ANPP]  this month, charging the Council of State with adopting  exemplary measures against those who acquire property illegally.    Popular protests, staged by worker meetings throughout the  country, and popular condemnation reported by the media demanded  stiff sanctions for speculators and those responsible for  exploiting state funds.    Also, it was demanded that money hoarders [macetas],  individuals who, through their participation in illegal ventures  and black market activities, get rich and negatively affect the  interests of society in general, be dealt with sternly.    The decree-law provides for the confiscation and  expropriation by the Cuban State of the goods and properties,  without any right of indemnification to persons who, directly or  through third parties, increase their possessions illegally in  amounts beyond their normal income.    The confiscation process will be directed against property  owners, holders, or bearers of the goods and assets, including  third parties who benefited from them and who, in a simulated  manner, appear to be owners.    One of the articles states that any resolution of this type  cannot be appealed and will be turned over to the public  prosecutor, who will determine what measures will be taken to  confiscate goods or properties, provided sufficient elements are  available following the pertinent investigations.    Among the final provisions is the determination that the  decree-law's implementation will be retroactive, given its  relation to social, public, and national needs.    One of the most obvious expressions of the criminal acts  that  will deserve sanction is the illegal sale of houses and  vehicles, an action which has been detected of late and was  denounced during the ANPP sessions and in worker meetings.    A recent meeting of the presidents of the Provincial  Administration Councils, local power organizations, concluded  that hundreds of vehicles and thousands of motorcycles, which  were sold as incentives to manual and intellectual workers,  wound up in the hands of money hoarders through illegal  operations.    The illegal sale of such vehicles was carried out,  disregarding the initial sale contracts signed, which  established that the state has the right of preference to buy  them if the owner decides to sell.    Similar instances occurred with many homes, violating the  existing principle that the right of personal property does not  authorize its use as a means of enrichment because the country's  objective is to satisfy family needs, providing a home to  whomever needs it.    With the decree-law, the government also responded to the  reiterated demand of the people that harsh penalties be meted  out to black market speculators, who sell staples at exorbitant  prices, many times obtaining the products from cooperatives or  state entities.    It was explained that investigations will be carried out by  competent organizations before the established sanctions are  applied in order to prevent injustices. It was noted that,  above all, the people must remain watchful in the process to  combat criminal actions.</p>

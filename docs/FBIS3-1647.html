In light of these problems, Gu Erxiong stressed: The month  before the spring sowing of cotton is the key to decide the  success or failure in this year's cotton production.  Governments at all levels should adopt feasible measures to  successfully assign cotton growing quotas to peasants and ensure  the scale of cotton growing acreage.</p>

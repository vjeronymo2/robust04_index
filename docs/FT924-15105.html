			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BZWIM withdraws offer BZW Investment Management has withdrawn its offer of Pounds 710,000 to take over the management of Temple Bar investment trust from Guinness Mahon. BZWIM said it was disappointed with the rejection of its offer by Temple Bar, and claimed that it would have increased the trust's net asset value. The company has also written to Professor Sir Roland Smith, the chairman of Temple Bar, asking him 'to clarify to all shareholders precise details of the arrangements between the trust and its managers.' However, BZWIM made clear that it regarded the offer as only 'temporarily suspended', and asked Temple Bar to confirm that, in the event of any proposal to change the formal management arrangements, shareholders would be consulted.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New chief executive for Hartstone HARTSTONE, the troubled hosiery and leather group which is in refinancing talks with its bankers, yesterday announced that it had found a new chief executive to replace Mr Stephen Barker, the founder of the company who left following a series of profits warnings earlier this year. Mr John Hunter, aged 56, former chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer Brands, will take over as chief executive from November. He is also a director of Wace Group, Blue Circle Industries and David Lloyd Leisure. Mr Hunter, who retired from SKB nine months ago, said he had accepted 'because I like a challenge . . . and there are opportunities as well as challenges in this business.' Mr Shaun Dowling, who has been conducting the refinancing talks and running the group as executive chairman since May, said the appointment marked a 'red letter day for Hartstone'. He and Mr Hunter would be jointly involved in the refinancing talks, which must be completed by January when a standstill agreement expires. Hartstone is believed to be considering a further appointment to the board, possibly a US director.</p>

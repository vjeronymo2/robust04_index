			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OK BAN ON BILLBOARDS  </P> <P> An 18-month campaign by a La Crescenta man and his supporters to halt  construction of large billboards in their semi-rural community has ended in  victory.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last week unanimously created the  largest billboard exclusion zone in the county in La Crescenta and Montrose,  permanently prohibiting construction of new outdoor advertising signs along  Foothill and Ocean View boulevards and Montrose Avenue.  </P> <P> There are nine large signs along a 1.3-mile stretch of Foothill Boulevard, said  Dave Cowardin, county staff planner. Those signs will remain but cannot be  replaced or moved. All billboards in the isolated, unincorporated island of  county territory will eventually be phased out.  </P> <P> The billboard issue was the first taken up by the Crescenta Valley Town  Council, formed in March, 1989, in a grass-roots effort by residents to gain a  greater say over their community of 20,000.  </P> <P> Councilman Bill Beavers won his first bid for office campaigning against  billboards, which he said constitute a visual blight. Beavers this week called  the victory "absolutely fantastic for the people."  </P> <P> He said he will work next to beautify Foothill Boulevard, the community's main  commercial strip.  </P></p>

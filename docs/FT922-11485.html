			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Fed to relax its banking curbs THE US Federal Reserve yesterday said it was relaxing its rules to allow bank holding companies to offer more kinds of financial services. Ms Susan Phillips, a Fed governor, said the new rules would allow bank holding companies and their non-banking affiliates to offer full brokerage services for corporate clients, as well as to provide financial and investment advice in certain areas. The Fed will also broaden the types of leasing operations banks may undertake. The changes are among measures announced yesterday by the administration as part of its 90-day effort to reduce regulations. President George Bush said yesterday that he would announce more deregulatory moves next Wednesday. Mr John Robson, treasury deputy secretary, also said the four federal agencies which regulate banks in the US - the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision - would be working to harmonise supervisory procedures. The agencies plan to agree on uniform interpretations of banking regulations and, in cases where a bank is supervised by two or more agencies, to co-ordinate inspections in order to cut down on compliance costs. Mr Robson also announced a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency which will clarify the circumstances in which lenders may have to assume liability for cleaning up toxic waste sites under the Superfund law. He said some banks had been unwilling to lend to companies because they feared that if they later had to foreclose on the loan they could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up the company's polluted sites.</p>

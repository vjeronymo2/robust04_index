			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 established the requirement that, within the extent permitted by law, a Federal regulatory action may be undertaken only if the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society. In response to this requirement, and in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has estimated the anticipated benefits and costs of this rulemaking action. The FAA has determined that this rule change is not a ``significant rulemaking action,'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The results are stated in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule, by extending the compliance date by up to 1 year, would allow for the installation of DFDR's to coincide with the installation of noise abatement equipment on, or the retirement of aircraft that are affected by the December 31, 1994, noise compliance date. The current exemption limits the relief from the current deadline for installing DFDR to Stage 2 airplanes that will be retired by the end of the decade, leaving aircraft intended for retrofitting with noise abatement equipment subject to the current deadline of May 1994. Any aircraft that are scheduled for retirement by the end of the decade for which an exemption has not been obtained will also be subject to this deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential benefits of this rule change will be the cost savings realized by the operators of Stage 2 aircraft in part 121 service that plan to retrofit these aircraft with noise abatement equipment or have not received an exemption for those Stage 2 aircraft they plan to retire by the end of the decade. The rule change will afford these operators up to an additional year in which to install the required DFDR equipment. Operators that plan to retrofit their aircraft with noise abatement equipment before May 1995 would derive the greatest cost savings because DFDR retrofit could be accomplished at the same time that the aircraft was being retrofitted with noise abatement equipment. Therefore, no additional nonroutine downtime will be required for the upgraded DFDR retrofit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of the potential cost savings accruing to operators planning to retrofit their aircraft prior to the May 1995 deadline was estimated using industry data. Information provided to the FAA by ATA members indicates that the installation of upgraded DFDR's could require from 2 to 5 days of downtime per airplane, depending on the type of equipment. The major carriers responding to the ATA survey estimated the costs of this downtime from $14,000 to $26,000 per day per airplane. The FAA forecasts that about 250 Stage 2 aircraft will be retrofitted with noise abatement equipment over the next year. Operators of these aircraft can therefore expect cost savings between $10 million (based on 2 days of downtime per aircraft and an average cost of $20,000 per day) and $25 million (based on 5 days of downtime per aircraft and a cost of $20,000 per day) from this rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comment, the ATA estimated that 25 percent of the existing noncomplying Stage 2 fleet would not have to be specially scheduled to meet the May 26, 1995, compliance date. The FAA used a slightly higher estimate of the proportion of the fleet that could avoid nonroutine downtime. However, the ATA estimate of the potential cost savings of $9.8 million was near the low end of the FAA's estimated range ($10 million). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators planning to retrofit their Stage 2 airplanes with noise suppression equipment after May 1995 will not receive as great a benefit in terms of reduced downtime, however, because the additional 1 year afforded by this rule change may not be sufficient for them to avoid any nonroutine downtime. Nevertheless, these operators will be able to benefit from the opportunity to delay incurring installation costs for the upgraded DFDR equipment by up to 1 year, the value of which is calculated in the following paragraph. Available FAA data indicates that about 490 Stage 2 aircraft will fall in this category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA was able to estimate the opportunity cost of capital savings that operators could expect from being able to delay incurring the expense of installing upgraded DFDR equipment up to 1 year. Responses from a survey of its members conducted by the ATA indicated that the installed cost of the equipment would range from $20,000 to $40,000. Given the expected rate of return on capital of 7 percent that is mandated by the OMB, the FAA estimates that the opportunity cost savings expected to result from the rule change would amount to about $1.03 million, using the midpoint of the expected range of equipment installation costs (.07 &times; $30,000 &times; 490 aircraft). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

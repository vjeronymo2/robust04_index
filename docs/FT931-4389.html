			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: The Arditti's Schoenberg - Recital The Arditti Quartet launched its cycle of the Schoenberg quartets on Monday to a comfortably filled Purcell Room. There are four concerts in all, each made into an attractive package with the quartets of Berg and Webern, and a token representation by Zemlinsky, placed alongside Schoenberg''s four (the posthumously published D major quartet from 1897 is not included), together with Verklarte Nacht and the String Trio. The opening brought the first official Schoenberg, his Op. 7; it was prefaced by Berg's Lyric Suite and Webern's Five Pieces Op. 5. All are works the Arditti play with easy familiarity and the efficiency they bring to so much of the 20th-century's quartet literature. The technical difficulties of the Berg cause no problems and the thematic tangles of Schoenberg's sprawling structure are negotiated without hesitation; it is note-perfect playing with not a marking misplaced. There was not, though, much sense of occasion in their performances, more a take-it-or-leave-it attitude which often worked against the grain of music that demands a finely judged appreciation of idiom and intensity as much as technical skill and perfect co-ordination. The Webern pieces need room to breathe, and a massive concentration of physical and mental resources; here they were reeled off almost automatically, as if they were thin little sketches rather than fiercely compressed miniatures. Everything had been squeezed into a narrow band of dynamics between piano and forte; there were few extremes, so that both the vertiginous excesses of the Lyric Suite (if ever a work demanded that its interpreters delve beneath the surface it is this) and the romantic effusions of Schoenberg 1, the big tunes and the bracing counterpoint, had very little expressive power. The perfectly contained Arditti approach with its careful analytical sound may be one of contemporary music's most precious assets but for the classical texts of the Second Viennese School something richer and more searching is now required. Purcell Room; further programmes March 11, 14 and 19</p>

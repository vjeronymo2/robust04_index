			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S TRAIL ENDS OMINOUSLY IN SPAIN;  </P> <P> CRIME: STEVE JUGGERT OF ORANGE VANISHED MONTHS AGO DURING A EUROPEAN  HITCHHIKING JOURNEY. HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF ROBBERS.  </P> <P> Weary of the frenetic pace of his sales job, Steve Juggert set out a year ago  today for the back roads of Western Europe and the Middle East on a journey of  self-discovery.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old Orange man began his trip in Spain, carrying with him only a  backpack, a camera and a note pad in which to chronicle his adventures.  </P> <P> In his only letter home, postmarked Dec. 19, 1988, Juggert wrote of  encountering herds of sheep and goats, visiting quaint mountain villages and  meeting warm, friendly natives while hitchhiking through the Spanish  countryside.  </P> <P> "So far the trip is going better than I expected," he wrote to his parents. "I  am safe and I have not run into any sort of problems."  </P> <P> The letter was followed by a collect phone call to his parents three days  later.  </P> <P> Then the communication stopped.  </P> <P> Months later, his parents learned that $1,300 worth of his traveler's checks  were cashed in one day at a bank in a Spanish port town, all bearing forged  signatures. The checks, family members said, represented almost all the money  Juggert took for what was to be a yearlong trip.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the U.S. State Department notified the family that four men  suspected of robbing hitchhiking tourists had been arrested in Europe, two of  them in a Spanish coast town near where Juggert was traveling and the other two  in West Germany. The family fears the worst as authorities examine stolen  property recovered from the men to see if any of Juggert's belongings are  included.  </P> <P> "It is and it isn't our hope that some of Steve's stuff is there," said Bob  Oppermann of La Habra, Juggert's brother-in-law. "The fact that we don't have  an answer is the hardest part of this. We just need to know one way or  another."  </P> <P> The case of Steven Lee Juggert has drawn international scrutiny from law  enforcement agencies. The agencies involved include the La Habra Police  Department, the State Department, Spain's Guardia Civil and Interpol, the  international police agency that is coordinating the investigation.  </P> <P> Although Interpol officials, by policy, would not comment on this or any other  pending cases, U.S. officials in Washington and Madrid confirmed Tuesday that  they are working with Spanish authorities on the case.  </P> <P> "We are taking this very seriously," said State Department spokesman Phil  Covington in Washington.  </P> <P> In Madrid, Begonia Alvarez, a U.S. consulate services assistant, said the  Juggert case is the most serious of any now under investigation involving  Americans missing in Spain.  </P> <P> "We have Americans that sometimes families call us about, but no one like  this," Alvarez said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Alvarez confirmed that the police in Spain are investigating two men arrested  there last month in connection with a string of robberies, mostly involving  hitchhiking tourists. The robberies, she added, have been occurring for several  months.  </P> <P> Alvarez said that hitchhiking is just as unsafe in Spain as it is in the United  States and many other parts of the world. She noted that Juggert did not  register with the local U.S. Embassy and leave an itinerary when he arrived in  Spain -- an important precaution, she said, for anyone intending to hitchhike  unfamiliar back roads, as Juggert told friends and family he was going to do.  </P> <P> Juggert was a novice world traveler. According to his longtime friend, John  Davis, Juggert had never ventured outside the United States, "except to  Tijuana." He had spent much of his adult life building an impressive sales  record at industrial products companies in Orange County.  </P> <P> Davis and others who knew him said Juggert loved sports and was an avid camper.  It was this camping experience, Davis said, that helped prepare Juggert for his  travels in Europe.  </P> <P> Although Juggert had outperformed many of his fellow salespeople, he found  himself out of a job and at a crossroads in life when his Chicago-based  employer went out of business in the fall of 1988, Davis said.  </P> <P> That's when he decided to go to Europe and the Middle East.  </P> <P> "He was just going for the nice trip that everyone wants," said Davis, 31, of  Long Beach, who grew up with Juggert in Bell.  </P> <P> Frustrated with the "rat race" of Orange County sales, Juggert was searching  for something more meaningful, said Davis.  </P> <P> "He wanted to be a writer," Davis said. "He took two books with him: One was  the Bible, and the other was a book on grammar so he could study up while he  was there."  </P> <P> Juggert left no fixed itinerary. Davis said Juggert told him he planned to  visit Spain first, because of its warm Mediterranean climate during December.  </P> <P> "From there he would go to Israel and then to Greece and he would work his way  north, to Scandinavia, for the summer," Davis said. "He was basically planning  to take a year or until his money ran out. There were no official plans."  </P> <P> Juggert also left behind his former girlfriend, 29-year-old Susan Ramage of  Orange, and their 4-year-old daughter, Jenni-Sue, this year's Orange County  United Cerebral Palsy poster child. Ramage said Jenni-Sue misses her father and  their weekend outings at the park.  </P> <P> "I want to play at park with my daddy," the child said as her mother recounted  the frustration of dealing with the disappearance.  </P> <P> "This one needs some answers," Ramage said. "You feel like if you could go to  these places, you could turn over the rocks and get some answers. But we're so  far away."  </P> <P> Bob Oppermann, who is married to Juggert's only sibling, Laura, said that  Juggert's parents were against the trip, especially his father. They were  worried about his traveling alone so far from home.  </P> <P> Juggert's parents, Carl and Paula Juggert of Bell, are so distraught over their  son's disappearance that they declined to comment. In an Aug. 28 letter to  their congressman, the Juggerts expressed their frustration.  </P> <P> "We are deeply upset," they wrote in urging Rep. Matthew G. Martinez  (D-Montebello) to initiate speedier U.S. search efforts for their son.  </P> <P> In his only letter home, Juggert gave no hint that anything was amiss. He had  been in Spain for 12 days and had hitchhiked from Madrid to Andalusia, a  sprawling region of mountains and hills in southern Spain. He had spent the  last nine days camping in the mountains, and wrote that he was headed toward  Spain's southern beaches.  </P> <P> "The skies are very blue and very clear, except for Madrid," Juggert wrote from  the mountain town of Cazorla. "It is so clear you can see Mars or Venus amid  millions of stars.  </P> <P> "The people here," he wrote, "are very friendly, also very small. It is little  poorer than the U.S. but not too noticable (sic). There are very few fancy cars  and fancy homes, but the people live well. They all seem very dignified.  </P> <P> "I have seen no other travelers yet, but I'm sure I will once I get on the  coast," Juggert wrote. "I love you all and wish you a Merry Christmas."  </P> <P> Three days later, on Dec. 22, 1988, Juggert telephoned his parents collect. He  did not say where he was. The call lasted eight minutes. He promised to write  or call again soon.  </P> <P> Family members grew concerned when February rolled around and they still had  not heard from him. Oppermann said he called the State Department to try to  start an investigation.  </P> <P> "They said he was probably lying on a beach somewhere," Oppermann said.  </P> <P> The family spent the ensuing months waiting and wondering. Finally, in August,  they received evidence of foul play -- American Express notified them that  Juggert's forged traveler's checks all had been cashed in Huelva, an Atlantic  coastal town of about 60,000 near the Portuguese border.  </P> <P> A review of American Express records also revealed that the last known place  Juggert had been was Mojacar, a village near Cazorla in which he cashed one of  his $100 traveler's checks, Oppermann said.  </P> <P> A missing persons investigation was then launched. Oppermann said he was told  to file a missing persons report with La Habra police, and then relay pertinent  information such as photographs and other identifying information to the State  Department.  </P> <P> The family and friends are still waiting by the phone for confirmation of their  worst fears.  </P> <P> "My feeling now is everything is in limbo," Davis said. "You want to hold out a  little bit of hope that he is alive somewhere. But at this point, I don't see  how that is possible. It's just been so long now."  </P> <P> STEVE JUGGERT'S JOURNEY THROUGH SPAIN  </P> <P> 1. MADRID, DEC. 7, 1988: Juggert arrives in Madrid.

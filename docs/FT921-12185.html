			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Inquiry opens today into proposed Pounds 25m bridge to Skye THE CONTROVERSIAL plan to build a privately funded toll bridge over the sea to the isle of Skye, off the west highlands of Scotland is to be tested at a public inquiry starting today. Many local people reject the principle of a toll bridge on a route that has no easy alternative. They oppose the formula for setting tolls in line with the ferry charge of Pounds 4.20 for a car, with a 50 per cent discount for locals. By comparison, the toll for a car on the Forth road bridge is 40p. Others object to the design of the concrete box-girder bridge. Some oppose the construction of a bridge altogether and would prefer to keep the Caledonian MacBrayne ferries, which began operating a 24-hour service last year. Last month the Scottish Office signed contracts with a joint venture of Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company, and Dywidag of Germany. The consortium will build the bridge and have a concession to charge tolls for up to 27 years, although the bridge is expected to pay for itself in about 15 years. The bridge will cost about Pounds 25m, of which Pounds 8m will be paid by the Scottish Office for the approach roads. It will be the first privately financed toll bridge in Scotland. In England, Trafalgar House operates a toll bridge across the Thames at Dartford and an Anglo-French consortium is building one across the Severn. The inquiry, which is to be held in Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland side of the crossing, will consider nearly 200 objections and may take three weeks. There are no objections from people or institutions directly affected by the project. Miss Elizabeth Haran, the Scottish Office reporter (inspector) at the inquiry, might in theory recommend against the plan for the bridge. However, the contractors hope to start work in April for completion in early 1995. Many of the 9,000 people on Skye want a bridge, believing it will benefit the island's tourist industry and reduce the sense of isolation resulting from being linked to the mainland only by the ferry. The crossing takes four minutes. However, a minority of the inhabitants, including many who have moved to the island from England, believe that extra tourists will ruin the island, and want to preserve its separateness from the mainland. Recently the National Trust for Scotland, which owns part of the land that the bridge and its approach roads will cross, agreed modifications to the bridge with the Scottish Office, which will add Pounds 1.3m to its cost. Some Trust officials had favoured a more spectacular but expensive bridge of the cable-stay type for this beauty spot, but that objection was dropped. In spite of the opposition to the high tolls, the government says that a publicly funded bridge could not be justified for 25 years.</p>

			<p>Sanctions                                  SUMMARY      Mindful of the need to demonstrate progress in protecting  intellectual property rights (IPR) in China or face the  imposition of new U.S. sanctions, Beijing in recent days has been  publicizing the steps it is taking to protect these rights.  At  the same time, Beijing has warned Washington that any attempt to  pressure China on the IPR issue will be counterproductive.                             END SUMMARY      Seeking to deflect U.S. criticism of its IPR protection efforts,  Beijing has undertaken an extensive propaganda campaign to  document China's alleged progress in this area.  As the  centerpiece of this campaign, Beijing on 16 June issued a white  paper entitled "Intellectual Property Protection in China" that  chronicles the history of China's legislation on this issue and  details its alleged progress in implementing these laws (see  box).  In a clear reference to Washington, the paper, which was  released by the State Council's Information Office and carried by  Xinhua on the 16th, denounced as "unfounded" charges by "some  naysayers" that Beijing has "not yet established a 'full and  effective' intellectual property system."   Beijing, the paper  claimed, has made "big strides" in protecting IPR and now has a  "complete legal system" for their protection.   BOX:  Progress in IPR Protection      The white paper offered the following as evidence of China's  progress in protecting intellectual property rights:      -- Programs in IPR education have been initiated at "over 70  institutions," and the education system for training professional  personnel in this field has provided "batch after batch of  qualified personnel in IPR protection."      -- In 1993 China received "170,000 applications" for trademark  registration, including "130,000 applications for new  trademarks."      -- Higher people's courts in several provinces and municipalities  directly under the central government--such as Beijing, Shanghai,  Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan--have, since 1992, established  intellectual property rights courts.  Intermediate people's  courts in "all special economic zones as well as Beijing and  Shanghai" have also set up IPR courts, while the intermediate  people's courts in the capitals of other provinces and autonomous  regions and municipalities have set up "collegial panels"  specializing in IPR cases.  From 1986 to the end of 1993, "3,505  cases concerning IPR disputes were accepted and handled by  people's courts throughout the country."      -- Between 1992 and 1993, the people's courts "have accepted 734  criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of which 731 have  been tried, with 566 people being sentenced to fixed terms of  imprisonment, criminal detention, or other punishments."      -- China today has "more than 50 patent offices" established by  local governments and "more than 20 patent offices" established  by various ministries and departments under the State Council.  China also has "well over 7,000 full-time trademark  administrative personnel throughout China in addition to 300,000  part-time personnel."      -- From June 1991 to the end of 1993, "local administrative  organs" have "investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases"  involving pirated books and video products.      -- In the last ten years, "administrative departments for  industry and commerce" have dealt with "130,000 cases of  trademark violation and counterfeiting," including "3,000 cases  involving the counterfeiting and other violations" of foreign  trademarks.   END OF BOX      Despite its claims of substantial progress in protecting IPR, the  white paper admitted that China still has "much work" to do to  "optimize" its IPR protection system.  In particular, the paper  noted that "awareness" of IPR remains "comparatively weak and  underdeveloped" in China and in "some" government departments  there is "insufficient appreciation of the importance" of IPR  protection.  The paper went on to say that the State Council has  drawn up a "Decision on Further Strengthening IPR Protection"  which, when implemented, will mark a "great new step forward" in  China's efforts to "ensure" IPR protection.      PRC Media on IPR Protection      Since the beginning of June, Chinese media, particularly  Beijing's English-language paper, China Daily, have been replete  with examples of China's alleged progress in protecting  intellectual property rights.      -- Trademark protection.  On 3 June, for example, China Daily  provided evidence of China's alleged success in protecting  trademarks, reporting that "a number" of illegal producers and  retailers in Guangdong Province had been "closed down" for  infringing on the rights of British holders of the Lucozade  trademark.  The article went on to note that Chinese  administrative authorities handled "13,042 cases of trademark  infringement and counterfeiting," of which "about 500 cases  involved foreign trademarks."  The 19-25 June edition of Business  Weekly--China Daily's weekly supplement--touted China's efforts  in protecting foreign trademarks, such as M &amp; M, Readers' Digest,  and the Financial Times, quoting a lawyer with the Beijing office  of a U.S. law firm as saying that China's IPR laws provides  "protection which is as good as that in other Asian countries."      -- Compact and laser disc piracy.  A 13 June China Daily article  highlighted China's alleged progress in addressing another area  of U.S. concern, the piracy of compact (CDs) and laser (LDs)  discs.  The article claimed that "momentum is gaining" in the  nationwide crackdown against pirated CDs and LDs. According to  the paper, the crackdown, which began in mid-April, is  "particularly gaining ground" in Beijing, Jiangsu, and Guangdong.  In Beijing, for example, police "last week" allegedly "smashed"  three stores, confiscating 1,607 LDs and 125 CDs in addition to  1,480 cassettes and tapes.  In Jiangsu Province, the paper said,  investigators targeted two LD factories and found one of them-  -which was fined 200,000 yuan ($23,000)--in violation of the  copyright law.  They also conducted "six secret checks" in the  provincial capital, seizing 5,000 smuggled and pirated discs.  In  other cities, they "seized more than 15,000 copies."  In an  interview carried by Xinhua on 21 June, Shen Rengan, a deputy  director of the State Copyright Bureau, cited more evidence of  China's alleged progress in protecting IPR.  According to Shen,  "incomplete statistics" show that in 1993 the State Press and  Publications Administration (PPA) "confiscated 480,000 boxes of  pirated videocassette tapes."  He said Beijing has achieved  "remarkable results" this year in its crackdown on audio-visual  publishers.  An 18 June report on Shen's remarks went even  further, suggesting that the crackdown had resulted in "several"  illicit production lines being "destroyed."      -- Book piracy.   In yet another effort to show China's progress  in this area, a 21 June China Daily report revealed that Beijing  has started a crackdown against book pirates.  According to the  article, police have been "cracking down" on the sale of  "illegally published and pornographic" material following the  issuance of a PPA "directive" requiring PPA regional branches to  "cooperate" with local Public Security organs in starting a  "comprehensive search" for pirated books and pornographic  material.  The paper claimed that the  crackdown has been  particularly successful in Beijing, Hunan, and Guangdong, and  quoted Huang Xiaoxin, a spokesman from the PPA's Distribution  Department, as saying that printing houses and backroom printing  shops in these locales had been "closed down and the main  offenders arrested."  In Hunan, for example, Huang said that a  number of people from a county printing house are now "awaiting  trial" for "illegally printing" 250,000 copies of the Xinhua  Dictionary.  Huang went on to note that a book merchant now  awaiting trial in Heilongjiang Province faces the "death penalty"  if found guilty of pirating.      New Legal Punishments      In addition to indicating that Beijing plans to step up its  efforts to protect IPR, Chinese media reporting has also  suggested that Beijing plans to legislatively stiffen the  penalties for copyright infringement.  Song Jian, State  Councillor and head of the State Science and Technology  Commission, for example, suggested that new penalties are in the  offing, noting, in a statement carried by Xinhua on 16 June, that  Beijing plans to "further amplify" its laws and regulations and  that future punishments for IPR violations will be "more severe."  According to a spokesman for the National People's Congress  (NPC), the upcoming session of the NPC Standing Committee, which  is scheduled to open on 28 June, will again "deliberate" the  draft regulation regarding copyright violations.   The NPC  Standing Committee had discussed, but failed to pass, the  regulation at its last session in early May.  Media reporting at  the time had indicated that the draft regulation included  provisions for prison sentences of up to five years, criminal  detention, and/or fines for those convicted of "serious"  copyright violations (Xinhua, 5 May).     Warnings on U.S. Sanctions     Although admitting that China's present IPR protection system has  a number of shortcomings, Beijing has indicated that attempts by  Washington to pressure China on IPR issues will be  counterproductive.  Deputy Director Shen, for example, clearly  had Washington in mind when he pointed out that "threats to  exercise pressure" through sanctions does not represent a  "constructive attitude" toward seeking a solution to what he said  are the "inevitable" problems accompanying the development of an  IPR protection system (Xinhua, 21 June).  Hui Yongzheng, a Vice  Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, went  even further in warning Washington, saying that while China is  "always ready to cooperate" with others on the IPR issue, it will  "resolutely oppose any act of interference in its internal  affairs under the pretext of IPR protection" (Xinhua, 22 June).     Prospects     With growing internal pressure from its own market reforms acting  as the driving force for change, Beijing will continue its  efforts to develop a comprehensive IPR protection system.  However, it is likely that differences over IPR issues will  continue between Washington and Beijing.  (AUTHOR:  HEBBEL.

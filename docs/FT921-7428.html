			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Directionless trading in stock index futures, with few significant features, saw the March contract drift away after a promising start, writes Christopher Price. Following a 50-point overnight gain on Wall Street, March opened brightly, reaching 2,570 within minutes. This proved to be its high point however, with a poor poll for the Conservative party setting the negative tone for the rest of the session. The futures index fell back and by the mid-morning was trading at a discount to fair value. A poor Wall Street provided little inspiration, the appearance of a number of sellers in the late afternoon completed a dispiriting day. London's lack of direction prompted some traders to move into the livelier Paris and Frankfurt futures markets. March closed at 2,555, 9 down on the previous session and some 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Volume was a poor 4,437. The LTOM also saw low volume of 16,337 contracts in what one trader described as 'dull and lifeless' trading. There were no trades above 500 lots, Glaxo being the leading stock with 817, followed by Dixons (754) and Amstrad (720).</p>

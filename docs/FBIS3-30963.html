			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Adler] </F>   [Text] Geneva, Feb 13 (AFP) -- The mainly Moslem Bosnian  Government is ready to cut a deal for peace without trying to  exploit NATO's air strike threat to revive its dream of a full  multi-ethnic state, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told  AFP. "We have agreed to reorganize our country," he said in an  interview late Saturday [12 February] in Geneva.    He was answering questions about the Moslems "bottom line"  --  their minimal demands as the West finally takes decisive steps  to end the 22-month-old Bosnian war. Washington has presented  itself as the savior of the Moslems.    The latest round of E.C.-UN-mediated peace talks ended here  Saturday without any progress as direct US and Russian diplomacy  took over with the clock ticking on NATO's deadline for Serbs to  end their siege of Sarajevo. If heavy weapons are not withdrawn  by midnight next Sunday, NATO warplanes will destroy the guns.    The Bosnians insist on the idea of a united Bosnia but this  would be under the already accepted formula of three ethnic  mini-states, one each for the warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats.  Bosnia became independent in April 1992 as a state without  ethnic divisions.    The main remaining problem in the formula, which allocates  one-third of Bosnia to the Moslems, is the 15 areas claimed by  the Moslems but held now by either Croats or Serbs. Silajdzic  said he wanted these areas "to be demilitarized and put under UN  administration until we stop the war." This would apparently be  a way of bypassing the bitterly intractable disputes over places  like Zvornik in eastern Bosnia. Zvornik, on the border with  Serbia, has been described by one analyst here as the "Serbs'  Golan Heights," a strategic town they would never give up.    Silajdzic is equally stubborn about Zornik, one of the prime  sites of ethnic cleansing, where the 70 percent non-Serbian  population was driven out. "Those still alive," Silajdzic said  bitterly, must one day return. "We must not accept gains by  force," he said.    He said, however, that the Bosnian Government understood  that  the Americans, the driving force behind the NATO initiative,  have not given them a carte blanche for re-taking territory.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Saturday here  expressed concern about the advantage Moslem infantry will soon  have. "Moslems have three times more numerous infantry than the  Serbs. Serbian weaponry was the element of strategic balance.  If we put our heavy weaponry under (UN) control, then the  Moslem infantry should be under control too," he said. But  infantry and light arms are not mentioned in the NATO ultimatum  issued February 9.    Asked if his troops would take advantage of the situation,  Silajdzic said emphatically: "They will not." He said the  Bosnians would not risk their credibility.    Silajdzic said the outlines for peace have become clear.  NATO's military pressure has been matched by a geopolitical  forcing that leaves the Serbs little choice but to stop the war.  For instance, the neighboring patron of the Bosnian Serbs,  Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic is a man "condemned to  peace," Silajdzic said. International economic sanctions have  put Serbia in a position where Milosevic can not be defiant. "I  think he's dragging that country into an abyss," Silajdzic said.    Russia, anxious to share in the peacemaking role with the  United States, is also expected to pressure Bosnian Serbs to  compromise, analysts here said.    Silajdzic said NATO's active involvement had restored "a  balance of power." "There is a recognition that superpowers  must lead and that not being involved eventually leads to  dangerous situations where loss of life and resources is  inevitable," he said.    But he still described himself as a disillusioned man. "We  have sanctions (arms embargo on former Yugoslavia), we have  shells coming in and we have grey-haired children (in Sarajevo  from the long siege). What more could there be, an atomic  bomb?" he asked.</p>

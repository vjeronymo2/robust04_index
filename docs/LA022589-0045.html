			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOVIET CELLIST GUTMAN IN PHILHARMONIC DEBUT  </P> <P> Before the current illness of composer/conductor Oliver Knussen intervened, the  Los Angeles Philharmonic program at the Music Center this week contained three  first performances as well as major works by Shostakovich and Stravinsky.  </P> <P> In Thursday night's event at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, with assistant  conductor Heiichiro Ohyama substituting for the indisposed British musician,  Shostakovich (the Second Cello Concerto) and Stravinsky ("Firebird" Suite)  remained. But the premieres still await exposure.  </P> <P> Ohyama led the first of three performances of this agenda, now including  Mussorgsky's Prelude to "Khovanshchina" and Elliott Carter's Elegy (the  scheduled premieres had been by Knussen and Carter). The auditorium was not  full, but those who attended expressed approbation, at least at the ends of the  larger pieces.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Philharmonic played strongly, and with a full palette of dynamics.  It sounded better, in fact, than Ohyama's sometimes tentative gestures looked.  </P> <P> After a timid run-through of the Mussorgsky excerpt, the 41-year-old  violist/conductor gave Natasha Gutman solid and informed support in the  depressed and depressing rhetoric of Shostakovich's virtuoso lament.  </P> <P> Because the Soviet cellist made all its tricky and complicated passages seem  easy, one's attention could be fully focused on the work's thoroughgoing  sadness. Through even its fast and loud perorations, this basically muted solo  piece manages to sap the energy of its performers and auditors.  </P> <P> In her Philharmonic debut, the 47-year-old Gutman produced as wide a range of  expressiveness as may be possible in this work, and with a thorough economy of  means as well as genuinely imperturbable technique. After the quiet, receding  closing bars of the dance-on-the-grave finale, the audience went to the other  extreme with noisy approval.  </P> <P> There was poetry as well as noise in the Philharmonic's polished playing of the  "Firebird" excerpts. If Ohyama's reading offered nothing new or distinctive, it  gave full value to the well-known virtues already present in the score.  Preceding the Stravinsky suite, the conductor drew lush and motivated playing  from the Philharmonic strings in Carter's 50-year-old Elegy, a relic that reeks  charmingly of the 1930s.  </P></p>

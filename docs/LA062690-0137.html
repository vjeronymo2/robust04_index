			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORTHLESS CAUSE  </P> <P> As I read the article on the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit  physical desecration of the flag (June 22), I see, as true to form, our Orange  County gang of five congressmen crawled out of their bomb shelters to cast a  yea vote on the flag amendment.  </P> <P> Isn't it amazing that these five insecure individuals have so little confidence  in our governmental institutions and the people that they would agree to  jeopardize our Bill of Rights to vote for this worthless amendment?  </P> <P> When, if ever, will Orange County get an independent congressman who will not  be led around by the nose of the incumbent administration?  </P> <P> GEORGE E. MOFFAT  </P> <P> La Habra  </P></p>

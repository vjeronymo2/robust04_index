			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Tecs warned over role in local economic activity Training and Enterprise Councils must define more sharply their own role in local economic development, an employment research centre has warned. Tecs' work in the economic development of their areas is 'strong in aspiration but modest in effort', says a report prepared for the Tecs' national council by Professor Amin Rajan of the Centre for Research in Employment and Technology in Europe (Create). The report, published today, calls for action by government and Tecs. Its findings will be considered at the employer-led bodies' national conference in July. Tecs were set up by the government to improve training in England and Wales as well as to be strategic bodies for local economic development. Professor Robert Bennett of the London School of Economics last week published a book that highlighted the organisations' lack of progress in a number of areas, including playing a role in local economic development. He called for a number of institutional changes, including the merging of Tecs with chambers of commerce. The Create report is neither as prescriptive nor as ambitious. But it calls for an acceleration of Tecs' activities, including the establishing of viable partnerships with other local bodies. The report urges tax relief for companies participating in the Investors in People programme, which seeks to link the training and development of employees more effectively to their companies' business needs. The scheme is the Tecs' main programme for improving training of people in work. The role of Tecs in Local Economic Development.

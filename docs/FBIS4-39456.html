			<p>BFN     [Text] A top-ranking official of the Russian Defense  Ministry has said that reports on the start of the deployment of  peacekeeping forces in the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict on June 7 are not true.    The Russian general who spoke on condition of anonymity  pointed out in an interview with Interfax Tuesday that President  Yeltsin had given the Defense Ministry no instructions to start  deploying peacekeepers along the border river Inguri to separate  the warring sides.    The Interfax interviewee emphasized that the ministry was  not  entitled to independently make such decisions. At the same  time, he did not preclude that the peacekeeping operation could  start in the conflict area within the next few days.    With a majority of one vote, the Federation Council declined  Yeltsin's request to send a 1,500-strong Russian contingent to  the conflict area last week. The deputies decided that the  Russian troops' legal status had not been worked through as  thoroughly as it should have been done.    Moscow did not preclude that the Federation Council would  return to considering the Russian peacekeepers' deployment along  the Inguri at its regular session on June 21.</p>

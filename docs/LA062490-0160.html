			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT THING  </P> <P> Why is it not surprising that Young Americans for Freedom is so attractive to  the fundamentalist Christian right when it attracts the kind of person who can  say, "Compassion is someone else's job" -- thereby blithely violating one of  Christ's basic precepts?  </P> <P> The face of hatred never changes. We have seen these same people shouting  "Nigger bitches!" at blacks trying to integrate American schools and heard them  even earlier screaming "Jew bitch!" in Hitler's Germany.  </P> <P> Nothing has changed but the targets.  </P> <P> MARK DONNELLY  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek: "Finish of Presidential </F> Marathon"]    [Text] The presidential marathon is nearing its end.  There are seven presidential nominees (often called "big  seven"), and only a few of them have real chances to win. The  state press, whose circulation has dramatically decreased, were  the first to show their sympathies to this or that nominee.  "HOLOS UKRAYINY" (parliament's newspaper) has the circulation  of just 325,000 copies while "ROBITNYCHA HAZETA" (workers'  gazette) -- 90,000. This concerns not only the state press, but  also the popular "KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI" (Kiev news) and once  mighty "VECHIRNIY KYYIV" (Kiev at night) -- 185,000 and 36,000,  respectively. Even such small numbers of copies create the  illusion of influence in the broad public. Last week, "HOLOS  UKRAYINY" published 10 articles supporting Kravchuk's  candidature and seven articles backing up Speaker Moroz. The  articles supporting Moroz were the biggest (17,500 characters)  which is quite natural since the newspaper belongs to the  parliament. At the same time, "ROBITNYCHA HAZETA" (founded by  the Cabinet and interregional association of businessmen)  published just one but big article (13,000 characters)  supporting the candidature of L.Kuchma. According to poll  results, 27 percent of the electors will vote for Kravchuk, 20  percent for Kuchma, 11 percent for Moroz (sociologic center  "Socis"); 35 percent for Kuchma, 20 percent for Kravchuk, 10  percent for Moroz (sociologic center "Ukrainian barometer"); 37  percent for Kuchma, 27 percent for Kravchuk, 16 percent for  Lanovyy (sociologic center "News"). So, the basic contenders  are Kuchma and Kravchuk. Regional studies in Ukraine's south  and east show the following: 21 percent for Kuchma, 7 percent  for Kravchuk, 4 percent for Moroz (center "Democratic  initiatives"); 23 percent for Kuchma, 19 percent for Kravchuk,  10 percent for Moroz (center "Naval- express"). It is evident  that Kuchma and Kravchuk will win the first round but it is hard  to say who will be elected the President. The basic role here  belongs to the central Ukraine having 10-15 percent of electors  who still have not decided whom to support -- Kuchma or  Kravchuk. Taking into account the fact that all votes of  Plyushch and Talanchuk will go to Kravchuk like part of the  votes of Lanovyy and Moroz, while the other part and all votes  of Babych will go to Kuchma, I can predict that Kravchuk will  receive 47 percent of votes, Kuchma -- 53 percent, or 35 percent  and 33 percent of votes, respectively.</p>

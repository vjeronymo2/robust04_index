			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement adopted at the meeting of the Central Executive </F> Bureau of the Social Democracy Party of Romania in Bucharest on  22 February; published by ROMANIA LIBERA under the headline:  "Divorce, For Reasons of Love"]    [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] took  note of the open letter that the nine members of the Greater  Romania Party [PRM] leadership addressed to President Ion  Iliescu. This letter directly affects our relations with the  PRM, which has thus announced the electorate that it "suspends  all negotiations begun with the PDSR regarding a participation  in the government."    In these circumstances, it is necessary to explain our  party's position on the issues raised by that letter, which  motivated the respective decision of the PRM leadership.  <H5>  With Electoral Demagoguery, Forward! </H5>   1. The letter of the nine members of the PRM leadership  depicts the current Romanian society in a way that we cannot  agree with. Their description of the country's situation, in  apocalyptic terms, is not based on a serious analysis of the  circumstances. We would have expected the leadership of a  parliamentary party to overcome the stage of electoral  demagoguery and make a profound analysis of the processes and  trends in Romanian society.    The situation is indeed difficult, but a lucid examination  should primarily emphasize the causes of this situation. After  the 1989 revolution, Romania has lost half of its foreign  markets and the mechanisms of the centralized economy were  eliminated without us having developed the specific mechanisms  of the market economy to replace them. All this has caused  Romanian industry to operate at half of its capacity.    To all this, one should add the Gulf crisis, which caused  Romania losses amounting to almost $3 billion, and the embargo  imposed against Yugoslavia, which cost us another $7 billion in  direct and indirect losses.    Romania has been and is still being faced with a number of  very serious crises. Their cumulative effect is quite hard to  endure and it has generated social discrepancies, various cases  of corruption, and a state of discontent among the people, who  must cope with many hardships.    However, one cannot solve these problems through laments and  demagogic and populist formulas. You need an authentic will if  you want to accomplish that. The real problems of the economy  must be solved by taking into consideration the context of the  real world, the world in which we live and from which we cannot  isolate ourselves, by replacing it with an utopian world or by  turning back to the past.  <H5>  From "Proven Criminals" to the "Future Convicts" </H5>   2. The entire language used in the letter is vulgar and  unworthy of the leadership of a parliamentary party. It abounds  in totally unfounded accusations and personal attacks, which  again prove that the nine signatories of the letter consider  themselves to be above the law. They want to supplant our legal  bodies -- which are the only ones in a position to decide who  are "proven criminals" and "future convicts" -- on the basis of  arguments contained in some anonymous letters sent to the  editorial staff of the ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA magazines by  "several earnest Romanian women with the fear of God in their  souls," by "a group of generals," or others.    The rule-of-law state relies on arguments, proofs, and the  observance of rights and laws, primarily the observance of the  basic principles of the presumption of innocence until proven  otherwise. The rule-of-law state does not rely on letters  received by the editorial staff, on their number, on the  "people's verdict," or on the conviction of some party leaders  that they represent the law. We cannot accept the "judicial  messianism" that the nine members of the PRM leadership arrogate  to themselves. They may display its exclusively before their  supporters, at their party meetings; however, in their capacity  as parliamentarians, they must subordinate themselves to the  law, as far as their actions and manners are concerned.    We believe that, before pronouncing on the major problems of  the country, the nine members of the PRM leadership should begin  by apologizing to those whom they have slanderously attacked in  their letter, primarily the country's president.  <H5>  Slightly More Than 3 Percent </H5>   3. In connection with all this, we would like to state our  position vis-a-vis the claim of the PRM leadership that it  speaks on behalf of the people or of "the Romanians" and that it  "echoes the people's discontent." We believe that these habits,  which were acquired during the reign of the sole party, cannot  be imposed on us as a norm of behavior and a criterion of  political superiority; they might belong to a party that,  although it claims to represent "the Romanians," have barely  exceeded the 3 percent threshold required for being represented  in Parliament.    In a pluralistic democracy, the PRM leadership only has the  right to talk on behalf of the "25,000 card-carrying members."  Whose capacity to mobilize correctly reflects the people's  interests is periodically checked by elections.    4. As a matter of fact, the entire letter signed by the  nine members of the PRM Steering Committee proves that it is  motivated by electoral campaign considerations, rather than the  desire -- if any at all -- to find solutions and answers to the  real problems facing Romanian society today. The reference to  early elections that can be found at the end of the letter  proves that the PRM leadership is not concerned with the  consequences of political acts and of their own responsibility.  The appeal, which is made in a purely electoral style, to "all  Romanians who love their country" and whom the National Bloc is  "awaiting with open arms," has nothing to do with tackling and  solving the country's problems.  <H5>  Patriotism as a Party Monopoly </H5>   5. We consider that patriotism cannot be the monopoly of a  political party, the PRM's appanage. Being a patriot does not  mean isolating Romania from the modern world, but rather  protecting its interests and sovereignty within the framework of  the modern world. You do not accomplish this by going back to  the communist system and rekindling Ceausescu's image, but by  realizing that our country's evolution depends on European  developments, which the PRM seems to ignore. Our political  intelligence and the principles and values we believe in should  not lead us to making enemies left and right -- both inside the  country and abroad -- through demagogic, populist, xenophobic,  or antisemitic speeches.    These manifestations, which are unanimously condemned,  project an unfavorable image for Romania abroad and cause us  great difficulties in connecting our country to the modern world.    6. It is true that we have reached a pretty tense situation  in the country's political life. A good part of these political  tensions, which affect the government's action capability, were  artificially created, on the one hand by the ambitions of  certain politicians who want to change the composition of the  government at all costs and, on the other hand, by an erroneous  understanding of the role of the opposition in a pluralist  democratic system.    All these problems can be resolved through negotiations  among  the political parties. Therefore, the PDSR welcomed the  Romanian president's initiative on the conclusion of a political  pact and pledged to achieve it.    From the letter of the PRM Steering Committee, we note that  the differences between our parties on the ways and means to  overcome these tensions are profound and quite susceptible to  lead to a real political crisis, whose consequences -- imputable  to the PRM leadership alone -- the PDSR is ready to face.  <H5>  Inciting to Violence </H5>   7. Resorting to totally groundless propagandistic cliches  ("imported reform") and accusing the government of things that  it has not done, and which actually contradict our party's  principled positions ("shock therapy"), the PRM is projecting a  true scenario of incitation to violence and justification of  violence. The exclusively negative description of the country's  situation should serve the goal of presenting the PRM leadership  members as "justice seekers," the only one capable of saving the  people from being "robbed" by the "alliance" between the power  and the opposition.    At the same time, this true denigration of the country seems  to be a justification of violence. The message of the PRM  leadership's letter is that, if there is misery, hunger,  epidemics, and crime, the only solution to all this is violence  -- the violence of the workers from the Grivita Workshops and a  "possible outbreak of popular despair," which, in the view of  the PRM leadership, "would be more devastating than the December  1989 revolution."    The entire text of the PRM leadership's letter contains no  concrete solution. The proposed political philosophy seems to  be the threat that "if we come to power, within 24 hours we will  do away with the robbery, chaos, and the profanation of the  Romanians in their own home."  <H5>  A Simplistic Way of Thinking </H5>   Beyond the recollection of other times and political forces,  when some "24 hour" solutions were tried out, this passage  clearly proves a simplistic way of thinking, for which the  entire process of institutional restructuring is nothing but  "chaos," while the economic reform and the privatization process  are nothing but "robbery."    We have all due respect for an economist from Diaspora, such  as Professor Anghel Rugina. However, we are not convinced -- as  the nine members of the PRM leadership seem to be -- that "this  idealist," who, out of objective reasons, is not familiar with  the specific problems of the Romanian economy, would have a plan  that can "avoid all the errors committed in the other Eastern  countries." We are open to his ideas, but we consider it an  unacceptable insult to accuse our government, the Romanian  economists engaged in working out and implementing the reform,  and those who are planning the integration of the Romanian  economy into the European and world economy of being "doubtful  experts only intent on lining their own pockets."    8. In these circumstances, the PDSR can only take note of  the decision to suspend the talks that the PRM leadership has  adopted. The responsibility for this act and its implications  fully devolves on the nine members of the PRM Steering  Committee. As a matter of fact, given the "platform" emphasized  in that letter of the PRM leadership, it is hardly likely that  we can still find some elements of dialogue.    For us, it will be very difficult in the future to  differentiate between the pamphlet writer Corneliu Vadim Tudor  and the party leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor, head of the PRM. At  the same time, we believe that the PRM members will show  understanding for our position. As far as our relationship with  the PRM deputies and senators is concerned, we have often had  constructive, joint or closely similar positions on certain  draft bills. However, we assure them and the PRM rank-and-file  members that we are still open to a dialogue with them, provided  that party leaders show responsibility, that they are prepared  to adopt reasonable positions, and that they are truly concerned  with the real problems the country is facing in this period of  transition.    This statement was adopted at the enlarged meeting of the  Central Executive Bureau, with the participation of the PDSR  parliamentary groups, on 22 February 1994.</p>

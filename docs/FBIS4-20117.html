			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party </F> of Austria [FPOe], by Werner Schima; place and date not given:  "I Can Live With Isolation"]    [Excerpt] [Schima] Before the controversy in the province  of Carinthia [about which of the coalition parties would provide  the provincial governor] -- you acted as one of the major  parties -- you said you would not recommend how to vote in the  referendum on the European Union [EU]. Since the problems in  Carinthia you have been acting like a spurned lover with a chip  on your shoulder and are initiating an anti-EU campaign.    [Haider] I do not have a chip on my shoulder. Our strategy  has not changed. The term anti-EU campaign was used by the  media. We just want to provide information.    [Schima] About the disadvantages of membership. And then you  tell the people that you do not care how they vote?    [Haider] Of course, we care. I am just convinced that my  arguments are the better ones and that no recommendation is  necessary.    [Schima] Will you disrupt the holding of the referendum on  12  June with tricks in the Nationalrat's standing orders or  filibustering in Parliament?    [Haider] We wanted a date in autumn -- but postponing the  referendum by a week is pointless. Therefore, we accept 12 June  now.    [Schima] Will you also accept the result of the referendum?  By pointing to the possibilities of challenging the results  because of defects in the text of the treaty you have left  yourself a loophole.    [Haider] The FPOe will accept it. However, we cannot  guarantee that the referendum will not be challenged by citizens  who are critical of the EU.    [Schima] Your prediction for the referendum?    [Haider] A very narrow no.    [Schima] A NEWS poll has shown that 52 percent of Austrians  think it is right to isolate you. Is it not frustrating in the  long run having to haunt the scene as a pariah?    [Haider] I can live with isolation quite well. And it is not  a shame to be isolated by Mr. Fuhrmann [parliamentary leader of  the Social Democratic Party of Austria]. On the contrary: It  is better to polarize than to leave everybody indifferent. It  would be worse not interesting anyone.    [Schima] However, your dream of becoming chancellor in 1998  seems to be over, which is also in the interest of Austrians.  According to the polls, only 4 percent want you as chancellor,  43 percent would prefer you to continue in opposition.    [Haider] The dream is more alive than ever. The FPOe will  remain in opposition for another four years, and in 1998 it will  overtake the Austrian People's Party. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> STATE CALLS FOR NEW PROJECT REVIEW;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE ORIGINAL STUDY IGNORED THE IMPACT ON A RARE FISH IN THE SANTA  CLARA RIVER, THE UNARMORED THREE-SPINE STICKLEBACK.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office, joining the fractious debate over a  proposed condominium project in Santa Clarita, on Monday severely criticized an  environmental review of the project and called for it to be redone.  </P> <P> Among other things, the original study ignores the fate of the unarmored  three-spine stickleback, the attorney general's letter complained.  </P> <P> The environmental impact report (EIR) on the proposed Santa Catarina  development "inadequately, inaccurately or altogether fails to address a number  of significant issues," wrote Deputy Atty. Gen. Nilda M. Mesa in a letter to  the Santa Clarita City Council.  </P> <P> The strongly worded 10-page letter said the report relied on out-of-date  studies, failed to support its conclusions with strong data and underestimated  the potential impact of the proposed 1,452 units on plants and wildlife along a  nearby stream and the Santa Clara River.  </P> <P> "Moreover," the letter said, "the EIR inexplicably concludes that there would  be no potential for cumulative impacts in any category except that of traffic."  </P> <P> The letter was signed by Mesa on behalf of state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de  Kamp. Disgruntled homeowners who say the project is too large asked the  attorney general to intervene.  </P> <P> The letter was sent to the city, which is responsible under state law for  ensuring that the report meets state requirements.  </P> <P> The 6-inch-thick report does not comply with state environmental law because,  among other things, it failed to address the potential loss of habitat of the  unarmored three-spine stickleback, a tiny endangered fish found in some  portions of the Santa Clara River, the letter said.  </P> <P> The report, prepared by a consultant for G.H. Palmer Associates -- the would-be  developers -- lifted portions of an already published environmental study on a  nearby project to prove the Santa Catarina development would not harm the fish,  the report said.  </P> <P> "An EIR for another project can not demonstrate the effects of this project on  the stickleback," the letter said.  </P> <P> Representatives of Palmer Associates could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> The company has proposed to build 1,452 units on the 135-acre site north of  Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. In return for city  approval, developer Dan Palmer has pledged to build millions of dollars in road  improvements badly needed in a city choked by traffic.  </P> <P> The City Council, however, has said it is willing to approve no more than 800  units. The city and developer are still negotiating the issue.  </P> <P> The City Council recently expressed concerns about the project's impact on the  river habitat and asked city planners to review the environmental impact  report. The planners said the report was sufficient.  </P> <P> Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said Monday that Palmer Associates at least will have to  revise portions of the report. "I don't see any way they can get out of it,"  Darcy said.  </P></p>

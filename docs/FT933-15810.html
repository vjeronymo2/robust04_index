			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: UK's 'rare breed' hit by computer tariffs Sir, I would like to echo the cry for scrapping tariffs in the computer sector made by Mr G S Shingles, chairman of Digital Equipment (Letters, July 5). We have just finished exhibiting in a leading UK computer show. We were astonished at the responses we received when it was mentioned that we were a UK company that designs and manufactures all its products in the UK. Reactions ranged from raised eyebrows and looks of incredulity, to comments like 'good luck to you' and 'good grief'. It is sad that UK manufacturers in the computer industry are such a rare species, and the high level of tariffs this government has imposed is a major contributing factor. Mr Shingles has focused on the UK computer industry's ability to compete in the world computer market, but there is an even more urgent reason at home for abolishing high tariffs in the computer sector. In the UK, local manufacturers are facing competition from US and Far Eastern manufacturers, which pay import duties of less than half those we pay on imported computer parts that cannot be sourced in the UK. Unless this is changed, it is no wonder that people should marvel at the purpose/logic behind a UK manufacturer.

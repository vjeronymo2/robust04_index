			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Tide turns in the world economy Turning points have so often been diagnosed in the world economy that any suggestion of a new one must be made very tentatively. Yet a glance at the charts in this article suggests that one may have arrived; and the thought is re-enforced by two disquieting themes which have emerged from the UK Budget. One is the pessimistic Treasury projection of a widening gap between actual output and productive potential, despite the so-called recovery. This has abysmal implications for unemployment, despite last month's freak good figures. The second theme is that a yawning Budget deficit is still in prospect even after the chancellor's tax increases. The two themes together lead to a dilemma which is brought out most starkly by the more pessimistic projection provided by the Treasury as an alternative to its central assumption. This shows that, with a growth rate only  1/2 per cent a year below the central path, the public sector borrowing requirement would remain in 1997-98 - one year or more after the next election - nearly twice the Maastricht limit. This is probably too pessimistic. But if the British government were faced with this prospect, should there be fierce curbs on public spending and more tax increases - which might make low growth even worse? Or should the deficit be allowed to run or even increase, despite galloping debt interest, which by the late 1990s is expected to exceed Pounds 30bn and account for almost all the projected deficit? There has been a near-silence on this dilemma since I posed it last week. For no one has yet satisfactorily resolved whether Budgets are primarily exercises in government housekeeping or whether they have a wider role in balancing the economy, which might make it legitimate deliberately to budget for a deficit. A longer and international perspective might help. The background to the revival of sound money orthodoxies in the 1980s was the experience of the later 1960s and the 1970s. By then the attempts of governments to spend their way into full employment objectives led to increasingly rapid inflation, without any discernible benefits for unemployment which soared from one business cycle to the next. The end of the Bretton Woods system, and the first oil-price explosion following the Yom Kippur war of 1973, signalled the end of the postwar golden age. Subsequently, stagflation - high unemployment combined with high inflation - dominated the scene. The ground was thus prepared for the counter-revolution which declared that Budgets should be balanced, or nearly so, at least over an economic cycle, and that monetary policy should be given the task of trying to avoid both inflationary and deflationary shocks. Growth and jobs were then left to supply-side policies - often a euphemism for lower and more flexible wages and weaker unions. A fresh bout of rethinking may now, however, be required. For we are no longer in a world where each successive cycle takes inflation to new heights. The inflationary peak of 1990 was well below the peaks of 1974 and 1980. On the contrary, inflation now seems to be declining steeply from one cycle to the next. The application of the monetary brakes required to deal with the much more moderate inflationary upsurge of the late 1980s has nevertheless led to a severe increase in unemployment. It will not be surprising if it goes higher than in the previous cycle, especially in Europe. It is thus at least worth considering whether we may be approaching a period of secular demand deficiency - by which I mean a period when output and employment are held down by an inadequate level of private and public spending. The Keynesians who cried 'wolf' so often in the postwar decades may eventually come into their own. It is vital not to exaggerate. The increase in total spending in the Group of Seven countries, measured by nominal GDP (which is also equivalent to inflation plus real growth) has never fallen below 4 1/2 per cent per annum in the recession of the 1990s - admittedly further than it did in the 1980s, when it never went below 6 per cent. But this is still a complete contrast to the 1930s when prices fell by double digit amounts in the US and Germany; and even in the UK prices dropped by an average of nearly 5 per cent for three years running. Indeed, it is ludicrous for enemies of the franc fort policy, under which French inflation has fallen to 2 per cent, to compare its tribulations with the prewar period when France remained too long in the gold bloc. In that period French prices fell for five years in a row. Nevertheless it is just possible that the macroeconomic environment may become an obstacle to employment in its own right. In any case, it is quite likely that ingrained habits and institutions are such that attempts to reduce inflation literally to zero run into a strong resistance barrier and thus have an effect on output and employment similar to that arising from outright deflation between the wars. With consumer price inflation in the G7 countries now averaging just less than 3 per cent a year the world is not far from reasonable price stability. If inflation remains low or negligible over the next few cycles, but unemployment continues to creep up and output to stay well below potential, it will not be good enough just to parrot the slogans of the 1980s. How then should we respond to a problem of medium-term demand deficiency if it occurs? I have just finished reading the second volume of Robert Skidelsky's Keynes biography, The Economist as Saviour, covering the 1920s and 1930s. I am still unable to compete in saying what Keynes really meant or should have meant. But some features hit one in the face. Keynes's most frequent theme was the need for low interest rates to prevent demand deficiency from occurring. He was acutely aware that interest rates were a highly psychological phenomenon and he was always sensitive to anything which would give an unnecessary upward push to market ideas of the normal rates. For instance, he argued in 1937 that the main part of the cost of prewar rearmament should be met out of taxation. For he was very anxious not to use interest rates as a brake on demand. 'If we allow the rate of interest to be affected,' he remarked, 'we cannot easily reverse the trend.' In the 1990s, it is clear that long-term real interest rates are set in the international capital markets. There are, moreover, limits to how far even nominal short-term interest rates can be reduced unilaterally. Even outside the European exchange rate mechanism, attempts by medium-sized European countries to reduce interest rates too far on their own can all too easily lead to continuing depreciation and high rates of inflation, without any offsetting benefit to jobs. This is in contrast to the 1930s when the presence of outright deflation drew the sting from currency depreciation. Today, it is only in the context of a stabilisation programme for a large group of countries, such as the G7, that the low interest rate route is feasible. The main obstacle to its achievement is the Bundesbank's desire to reduce interest rates slowly because of post-unification stresses, despite the gathering German recession. But to come back to Keynes: his flirtation with public works began in the 1920s, when the commitment to stay on gold at the 1914 parity precluded a cheap money policy. In the 1930s he had a more fundamental worry. This was that it might not be feasible to get interest rates down far enough to secure maximum non-inflationary levels of employment. Thus public investment acquired a new role as a supplementary method of demand management, irrespective of the external and monetary regime. Nevertheless the role of investment in stimulating demand does not follow from Keynesian theory, whatever Keynes himself might have thought. Formally, Keynes emphasised investment because it was the component of demand that fluctuated most. But when there is a deficiency of total spending, whatever its origin, increased spending of any kind, including consumer spending, is just as good at plugging the hole. How about using Budget deficits to stimulate private spending? Keynes never made quite clear, or fully worked out, what he really thought of Budget deficits. Sometimes he claimed that public investment would so stimulate activity that the Budget would be rebalanced within a few years. At other times he emphasised the need for a separate capital Budget. In our own time the first instrument for maintaining adequate nominal demand growth must be monetary and interest rate policy. But if recovery turns out to be weak or very prolonged, we may have to settle for a series of quite high Budget deficits as shock absorbers. Even though an internally held national debt is mainly a transfer burden between citizens, it is a burden nonetheless. It is better to avoid levying ever-heavier taxes on one group of citizens in order to make ever-high interest payments to another and overlapping group. The sooner the burden can be transfered to monetary policy, the better. In the meanwhile, the UK government should adopt a less cavalier attitude to the debt interest rate burden and try to minimise it by devices such as more short-term borrowing, and more borrowing on indexed terms. If at all possible, the Budget should be brought back towards balance, or at least towards the Maastricht guidelines in the course of the 1990s. The weasely 'if possible' is there because the chance of a Keynesian liquidity trap, which would prevent interest rates falling to a level consistent with non-inflationary growth, has to be taken seriously, for the first time since the second world war. When the world was hit by a negative demand shock after the first oil price explosion in the 1970s, it was very easy to have negative real interest rates. Because of the inflationary background quite high nominal interest rates could be combined with negative real ones. Although this had its disadvantages, it was of some help in cushioning the recession of the 1970s. Today, this route is closed. For the very success in reducing inflation now makes it hard to get negative, or even very low, real interest rates. But I cannot resist remarking in conclusion that a nominal GDP objective - an old hobby horse of mine - would serve equally well if the need still is to rein back against inflation, or if it turns out to be something more expansionary.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo A strong stock market performance and better-than-expected economic data has drawn some investors from bonds and caused a sell-off. Late Friday sales dragged government bond futures down for the sixth day in a row and cash government bonds also remained under pressure. There is some indication the Japanese economy is on the mend, but bond market sentiment remains bearish. Traders and analysts are looking for direction from the Bank of Japan's June 10 announcement of the Tankan index of business sentiment, a quarterly survey of 7,400 companies. The biggest news last week was Mitsubishi Corporation's blow-out sale of Y200bn in 5-year maturity AA-rated bonds in less than two hours. According to a spokesman at Morgan Stanley, one of 16 dealers that handled the offering, the Mitsubishi offering was more than just a big bond sale. Mitsubishi's plan was to create a secondary market for the bonds issued. In the past, the 5-year market was the exclusive domain of long-term credit banks. So well established was the market that the long-term prime rate was set simply by adding 90 basis points to bank debenture coupons. Mitsubishi hopes it has created an equally liquid vehicle to meet its own future financing needs.</p>

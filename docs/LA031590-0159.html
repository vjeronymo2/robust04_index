			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS;  </P> <P> CITYHOOD SUPPORTERS SAY SIGNS LOOK GOOD  </P> <P> Leaders of an effort to create Orange County's 30th city in the Laguna Hills  area announced this week that they have collected enough signatures to place  the issue on the November ballot.  </P> <P> The petitions call for the creation of an eight-square-mile city bounded by  Irvine, El Toro, Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel and Aliso Viejo. Ellen Martin,  head of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, said the group has collected more than  4,200 signatures.  </P> <P> At least 3,750 signatures, 25% of the area's registered voters, were needed to  qualify the measure for the ballot.  </P> <P> "This is really doorstep democracy," Martin said. "It's been terrific. The  morale (among workers) is very high. We are getting such great support when we  meet people at the door."  </P> <P> Citizens to Save Laguna Hills still needs to await completion of a financial  feasibility report by a consultant before the organization can take its  application to the Local Agency Formation Commission. The study will be paid  for by donations collected by pro-cityhood forces in the Laguna Hills area.  </P> <P> A preliminary study showed that the proposed city of Laguna Hills, anchored by  sales tax revenue from the Laguna Hills Mall, would have a $3-million to  $4-million budget surplus in the first year of operation, Martin said.  </P> <P> Martin expects to submit the application by the end of March and hopes to have  a LAFCO hearing scheduled for late April. The Board of Supervisors is also  required to hear the application before a ballot measure is approved for the  Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> The latest attempt to create a city of Laguna Hills in June failed by 284 votes  due to strong opposition from Leisure World residents. The new proposed city  boundaries will not include the sprawling retirement community, but a  homeowners group in Aliso Viejo is opposed to cityhood because a portion of  that planned community would become part of Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, cityhood proponents in nearby El Toro have released a completed  financial feasibility study that shows a proposed 21-square-mile city composed  of three communities would have a $2.3-million surplus in its first full year  of operation.  </P> <P> Helen Wilson, head of Community Coalition for Incorporation, said the  feasibility report confirms the group's longtime claim that a city composed of  El Toro, Lake Forest, Portola Hills and the undeveloped Foothill Ranch would be  financially secure.  </P> <P> Wilson also said her group has gathered half the 8,000 signatures needed to  place the issue on the November ballot.  </P> <P> A handful of residents turned out Tuesday night to hear a presentation on the  viability of the proposed city. Cityhood advocate Ron Benjamin told the  homeowners gathered at the Lake Forest Sun and Sail Club that cityhood will  protect the community from unwanted development.  </P> <P> "We have what I see is a serious risk to the quality of our lives," said  Benjamin, an El Toro resident. "We need a real solid community identity." JAMES  M. GOMEZ  </P></p>

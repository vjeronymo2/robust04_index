He said:    At the recent meeting of the board of governors of the  International Atomic Energy Agency, the forces hostile to the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea adopted an unreasonable  "resolution" against it in defiance of the opposition of many  countries and presented it to the United Nations Security  Council.    This indicates that the IAEA Secretariat is further  internationalizing the DPRK's "nuclear issue," joining the  hostile forces in the efforts to stifle the DPRK, and is further  widening its partiality, instead of rectifying it.    "The resolution" alleged that "the noncompliance with the  safeguards agreement has grown in scope" because we did not  allow some of the activities for the continuity of safeguards.  This is an assertion totally reversing black and white.    Now we are in a special status with the temporary suspension  of the effectuation of the DPRK's declared withdrawal from the  nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. So, we are not under  obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections under the  safeguards agreement.    What we can allow at this moment is only an inspection for  the maintenance of the continuity of safeguards.    The latest inspection by the inspectors group of the IAEA  was  enough to fully confirm that nuclear materials had not been  diverted at our nuclear facilities and definitely maintain the  continuity of safeguards.    Therefore, no one can find fault with the results of the  recent inspection, saying they are "not satisfactory", and  charge the DPRK with "non-compliance with the safeguards  agreement."    We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the  "resolution" urged the DPRK to "immediately allow the IAEA to  complete all requested inspection activities as the first step  and to comply fully with the safeguards agreement."    During the recent inspection, we fully allowed all  inspection  activities needed for maintaining the continuity of safeguards  in accordance with the Vienna Agreement, and we have nothing  more to "allow."    The director general of the IAEA himself in his report and  address at the meeting of the board of governors admitted that  all inspection activities had been carried out satisfactorily as  demanded by the IAEA Secretariat at most of the nuclear  facilities.    As for the smear-taking in the glove box area at the  radiochemical laboratory, with which the IAEA Secretariat takes  an issue, it has nothing to do with the maintenance of the  continuity of safeguards.    So, the insistence on smear-test in this area contradicts  the  Vienna agreement, which says that "this inspection does not  include the verification of the completeness of the initial  inventory of nuclear material."    Moreover, the smear-taking at the area is a matter of  relevance to "inconsistency", an outstanding issue between the  two sides.    However, out of the spirit of cooperation, we proposed the  method of taking samples of tracer liquid whereby to inspect  more effectively the glove-box area.    This liquid is what the Secretariat of the IAEA had put into  the three tanks in the glove-box area during their earlier  inspection to freeze the outflow of nuclear material in the  area. Accordingly, solution samplings were enough to verify  whether or not nuclear material had been diverted in the area.    The inspectors group itself agreed to our constructive  proposal and took samples of tracer liquid there.    This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat argued in a  far-fetched manner that they could not "verify that no  processing activities had occurred at the radiochemical  laboratory", simply because their request to make a few smear  tests was not accepted. This is unreasonable either from the  scientific-technological point of view or in view of the Vienna  agreement.    All the facts clearly prove that the purpose on the recent  inspection by the IAEA Secretariat was not to verify whether  nuclear materials had been diverted at our nuclear facilities,  or not, but to pursue a sinister political aim from the  beginning according to a pre-arranged strategy.    The IAEA Secretariat widened its partiality still further by  adopting another unreasonable "resolution" at the meeting of the  board of governors.    If the IAEA Secretariat really wants to see a fair solution  to our nuclear issue it should take a measure to immediately  withdraw its "resolution" based on the unjust assessment that  the IAEA "could not draw any conclusion on whether nuclear  materials had been diverted" to DPRK's nuclear facilities.</p>

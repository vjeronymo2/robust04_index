			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The bogeyman will be back After the British government's latest reprieve in the interminable struggle over Maastricht in the House of Commons, it begins to look as if the treaty may eventually be ratified. If that should be the outcome  - the battle is far from over - it would be a realistic but unenthusiastic expression of the balance of opinion in parliament. Many of its members dislike aspects of the treaty, but only a small minority dislike the whole thing so passionately that they welcome the opportunity to challenge Britain's membership of the European Community. The conclusion of the ratification process would therefore be a relief all round; but it would not be the end of the story. If the government imagines that the controversy over the objectives of Maastricht will be put to sleep by ratification, it is deluding itself. Europe has long been a malicious bogeyman for the British, and it will leap right out at them again, not in some distant future, but immediately and repeatedly; and it will continue its haunting until the day (if it ever comes) when the British political establishment finally resolves its ambivalent feelings about the European Community, one way or another. Second, the surreal procedural by-ways along which the House of Commons is crawling towards ratification must raise questions about the credibility of those very constitutional arrangements of national sovereignty which the British Euro-sceptics so fervently profess to defend. Last week provided a striking example of official procedural jiggery-pokery. The Labour party had fashioned an amendment attacking the government's opt-out from the treaty's social chapter. Through a de facto alliance between Labour and the Euro-sceptics, it looked as though this amendment might bring down the treaty. But lo and behold, the government was miraculously saved because the deputy speaker ruled that the amendment was out of order. He gave no explanation, but his reason was said to be that the amendment was unacceptable because it was critical of the treaty. This interpretation is bizarre, perverse, incredible; which does not mean that it is not true. Even without Maastricht, the case for constitutional reform was already on the agenda, at least for the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, last week set out a long list of desirable reforms, including the election of the House of Lords, protection of human rights and freedom of information. But Mr Smith's list also included reforms to bring Britain up to date in its constitutional relationship with Europe. The restoration of strong local government, and the creation of strong regional government, may have their own domestic justification; but Mr Smith also argued the case as part of a four-tier European structure of government, of which the nation-state would be only one tier. As it happens, the Maastricht treaty will require the establishment of a committee of the regions, to which each member state will nominate a national contingent. This will be simple for Germany, France, Spain or Italy, because they have regional governments of various kinds. But it will be a poser in Britain, which has no regional governments in England, and only paternalistic substitutes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In any case, British ratification is not the end of a story, just the beginning. Before the end of this year we shall be plunged into a new debate on the objectives of the treaty; before the middle of next year, we shall be engaged in renegotiating it; and that means we shall have to go through parliamentary ratification again. First, there is bound to be a far-reaching reassessment of the credibility of the programme for economic and monetary union. It cannot easily take place in public until there is complete ratification, for fear of frightening the voters or encouraging the speculators; but it may be precipitated if the next French government presses for an accelerated rapprochement with Germany. Second, the negotiations for the admission of new member states, starting with the west European candidates from Efta, are bound to set off a serious re-examination of the general objectives of the treaty, and in particular its institutional arrangements. Ostensibly, the candidates will disclaim any demand for British or Danish-type opt-outs. They can hardly avoid a debate about the treaty's long-term aims. The institutional question will be more controversial. At present, the weighted votes in the Council of Ministers are heavily skewed in favour of the smaller member states, in comparison with their share of EC population. Officially, the Community has disclaimed any desire to change the voting weights. The candidates would join with the same votes as comparable existing members. The problem is that all present candidates, and almost all future candidates, are small countries. The official position is really just a polite fiction which must be kept up until Denmark's second referendum on May 18. But the voting weights must be changed, because the big countries will not agree to the progressive domination of the small, especially since the political commitment of the new members is at least open to question. In logic, the small countries should demand some political compensation for a cut in their votes; this could take the form either of a strengthening of the role of the European Parliament, or of an increase in unweighted majority voting. Either way, the enlargement treaty, which must be ratified in parliament, will pose a serious dilemma for the British government.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Renault unit chief quits next month Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, head of RVI, the trucks and buses operations of Renault, the French state-owned vehicle group, is leaving the company at the end of next month to take up a new job, Renault said yesterday. He will be replaced by Mr Shemaya Levy, currently managing director of the European operations of RVI. Renault officials said that Mr Capron's departure, which has been rumoured for several weeks, was not related to the failure of the planned merger between Renault and Volvo of Sweden. Mr Capron was not due to form part of the five-member executive board to run the merged vehicle group and has been linked with a series of posts in French industry over recent months, including the chairmanship of Bull, the computer group. The change at the top of RVI, however, comes at a sensitive time for the group. The collapse of the merger has removed one of the central elements of Renault's strategy and has raised questions about the future of industrial co-operation with Volvo. The two groups aimed to share the rising costs of product development in trucks and buses as well as in cars and sealed their alliance through a series of cross-shareholdings. RVI said that the future of the industrial alliance would not be clear until discussion with the new management at the Swedish group. Mr Capron, who devoted much of his time to developing the alliance with Volvo, also helped steer RVI through depressed international trucks markets. RVI, which fell into loss in 1992, is expected to announce another loss for 1993, although industry analysts believe it will be substantially less than the FFr1.6bn (Dollars 269m) suffered the previous year. Despite the downturn in the industry, however, RVI said that it managed to increase its share of the French and European truck market last year. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman, praised Mr Capron who, he said, had 'guided RVI through an unprecedented crisis in the market'. He added that Mr Capron had implemented a recovery plan at Mack Trucks, the group's US subsidiary. A Renault spokesman said that the US group was on target to break even by mid-year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary today, TISHRIN says: The entire  population of Damascus took to the streets, raising banners of  sorrow and mourning and expressing their deep pain for the  national loss represented by the death of Basil al-Asad. In a  mammoth march of 1.5 million people, Damascus renewed its  truthfulness to the great national leader, President Hafiz  al-Asad, and expressed its love and sympathy to him.    TISHRIN adds: What has befallen leader al-Asad has been a  blow to Syria as a whole. Every house and family are now  bereaved. Yesterday, Damascus was a bright and lofty symbol of  national unity whose pillars were laid down by President Hafiz  al-Asad, who has strengthened this unity over the years.  Al-Asad nurtured this unity by his work, sincerity, and  struggle. This unity has borne fruit in terms of pride,  dignity, and steadfastness in the face of enemies and suspect  plots; in terms of adherence to values, principles, rights,  land, and sanctities; and in terms of the relentless defense  until the return of all the occupied Arab territories and the  establishment of the Palestinian people's rights.    TISHRIN says: Today, Syria is waging its greatest ever  battle, namely, the battle for a just and comprehensive peace  that will end occupation, return the land, and establish rights  and truth. TISHRIN notes that the firm national unity as  expressed by our people on this great national loss, and which  Damascus expressed by its mammoth march, will strengthen Syria's  stand in its fierce battle for just and comprehensive peace.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: The great departed has left pain  and sadness among his family and the Syrian families, but leader  al-Asad has always derived strength and determination from the  people's trust and waged the greatest and most noble battles.  His last battle, the battle for a just and comprehensive peace,  will be a new deed to be added to his many immortal deeds.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH stresses that the march that was  staged in bereaved Damascus yesterday was an expression of the  sincerest condolences to leader al-Asad and his honorable family  on this grievous calamity.    Al-THAWRAH says: This shocking calamity was unexpected.  However, God's will is unavoidable, and the patient believers  are the only ones who can stand fast and pass this test. Just  as he has always been at all difficult times and in misfortunes,  President al-Asad was, despite the calamity, the great leader  and father whose heart has enough room for everyone and for all  griefs and sorrows. He is the one who consoled all the sons of  the nation who were bereaved of the noble knight, Basil.    AL-THAWRAH explains the nature of the stage and the size of  the grave threats and challenges to the homeland and the nation.  This, the paper say, necessitates that we rise above our pain  and heal our wounds in order to continue the battle of existence  and destiny and of restoring rights.    AL-THAWRAH adds: The Syrian people were not alone in living  the sorrow and anxiety, for the entire nation, throughout the  greater homeland, mourned and shed tears on the departure of the  knight Basil out of their faithfulness to the leader and father  who carried their pan-Arab issues and concerns and who has  honestly defended and is still defending them. The people and  the nation stood at the side of President al-Asad, wishing him  long life and strength so he will continue to be the inspired  leader under whose banners the people will continue to line up  and to seek support against tragedies and misfortunes.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: This is loyalty and  faithfulness. Our people, who staged marches in Damascus and all  the governorates yesterday to mourn the deceased, and who showed  the greatest images of cohesion and national unity, are the same  people who pledged allegiance to President al-Asad as a leader  forever, and adhered to his triumphant march until the full  liberation of land and the restoration of rights.</p>

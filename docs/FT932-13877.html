			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Guangdong poised for Dollars 150m issue A Dollars 150m floating rate note is expected to be launched tomorrow for Guangdong International Trust &amp; Investment Corporation (Gitic), a development arm of the government of China's fastest-growing province. The issue, led by Union Bank of Switzerland, will have a five-year maturity and carry a Baa1 rating from Moody's. Mr Huang Yantian, Gitic's president, said the coupon was expected to be 55 basis points above Libor. Gitic plans to use the money to finance projects which are already under way in power generation and acrylic fibre production. Guangdong's economic growth last year, at nearly 20 per cent, outstripped the 17 per cent growth in its power generation capacity. Foreign investment has been pouring into Guangdong, particularly from Hong Kong and ethnic-Chinese businesses elsewhere in Asia. However, there are concerns about the strains created by rapid growth. Prices in Guangzhou, the province's capital, rose 17.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 over the same period last year.</p>

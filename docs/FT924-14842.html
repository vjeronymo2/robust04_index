			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Serbian forces complete the jigsaw: Laura Silber reports on the significance of the capture of the town of Bosanski Brod THE FALL of the northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Brod to Serb fighters marks a serious setback for both Croat and Moslem forces in the region. The victory, on Tuesday night, consolidated the hold of Bosnian Serbs over the former Yugoslav republic. It has enabled them to widen the east-west corridor which they now occupy between Serbia in the east and Banja Luka, their military headquarters, in the north-west. The military success also gives the Bosnian Serbs easier access to Serb-held territories in Croatia. The battle was won in hand-to-hand fighting after Serb forces overran Bosanski Brod. The bridge linking Bosanski Brod with Slavonski Brod, its Croatian twin city across the River Sava, was blown up, cutting off access to the town from the Croatian side. Military police in Slavonski Brod said yesterday that about 10,000 civilians fled into Croatia in boats and barges, or across the bridge before it was mined. The town's oil refinery was ablaze and the streets were reported to be littered with corpses. Casualty reports have not been confirmed but most of the 34,000 civilian inhabitants of the town and surrounding villages had already fled. Serb forces now control all but three towns in the Posavina, the rich land along the River Sava which marks the border between Bosnia and Croatia. Moslems and Croats still have tentative control over Orasje, Gradacac and part of Brcko, north-eastern Bosnia. However, it appears that it will be only a matter of days before Serb forces, which control about 70 per cent of Bosnia, defeat these isolated strongholds. Belgrade radio reported fierce clashes around Brcko yesterday. Bosanski Brod was one of the first towns in Bosnia to erupt in violence at the end of March after Croats and Moslems in Bosnia voted for independence for the republic against the wishes of the Serb population, who boycotted the referendum. The Serbs wanted to stay within a Serb-controlled Yugoslavia. Croatian forces initially had the upper hand in the area, but in July Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, ordered the withdrawal of Croatian army units from the town. The order followed threats by the international community that United Nations sanctions would be imposed on Croatia for its role in the Bosnian war, diplomats say. (UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were placed on the rump Yugoslavia on May 31). Mr Tudjman has been criticised by many Croats for failing to support Croat and Moslem fighters in Bosanski Brod. Slavonski Brod is hit daily by grenades and mortars fired by Serb forces into neighbouring Croatia. Posavina is a key region which before the war was inhabited by some 20 per cent of Bosnia's 750,000 Croats. The failure of the Croats to hold Bosanski Brod reflects the Croat leadership's preoccupation with Western Hercegovina, the sparsely populated but ethnically compact region declared by Croats as part of Herceg-Bosna, the self-proclaimed Croat state in Bosnia, a western diplomat said yesterday. Mr Mate Boban, leader of the Croatian Democratic Union, the sister party of Croatia's ruling party, has had frequent contact with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnian Serb forces, in an attempt to divide Bosnia between the two republics. According to another western diplomat, the two leaders share a contempt for Moslems, who made up 44 per cent of Bosnia's pre-war population of 4.35m. 'Boban appears to believe he can strike a deal with Karadzic. But the Croats, more poorly armed, will end up losing,' he said. If Bosanski Brod was part of a deal between Croats and Serbs to divide Bosnia, it would appear Mr Boban has wildly miscalculated. It leaves Slavonski Brod and parts of Croatia vulnerable to Serb forces. However, the Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to be able to maintain their grip over all the land they have captured in the former republic. Belgrade radio yesterday reported fighting around Brcko and Bosanski Brod as well as in the eastern Bosnian towns of Zvornik and Bratunac, on the border with Serbia. The occupation by Serb forces in certain areas could be tested by a guerrilla campaign which could be launched by Moslem and Croat soldiers anxious to improve their positions before winter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 15 SAPA -- The National Economic  Forum [NEF] is likely to become a statutory body, continuing to  advise government on economic policy and its implementation,  senior NEF officials said Wednesday [15 June] in Johannesburg.  NEF labour convenor Jayendra Naidoo told a media briefing a  final report on the co-operative business, government and labour  body would be made next month.    However, he said key conclusions of the report suggested the  NEF become a statutory body funded with public money.    The report, by a task force formed in February, also urged  the merging of the NEF with the National Manpower Commission to  enhance the tripartite role of the current forum in economic  matters.    "Tripartism has a role to play in formulating and  implementing economic policy," Mr Naidoo said, "it has proved to  be very useful."    NEF government convenor Japie Jacobs, also special advisor  to  the finance minister, said the NEF would have to be re-focussed  but was still a vital body. "I can't see us governing the  country economically without a body like the nef," he told  reporters.    NEF business convenor Bobby Godsell also expressed his  support for the body's role, saying it was "an instrument for  government to govern with civil society".</p>

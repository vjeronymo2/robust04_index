			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Polish flights The Polish airline LOT's first passenger flight to London for four months left Warsaw yesterday following the resolution of a flight-allocation feud with British Airways. Under an agreement announced earlier this month, each airline has been allotted nine flights a week during the winter season ending March 26 and up to 15 flights a week during the summer season. The two carriers will each have 12 flights a week between the end of March and the peak summer season (June to August) when three additional flights will be added. The Anglo-Polish dispute erupted last October when Warsaw refused British Airways permission to double its number of flights between the two countries. London retaliated by banning LOT flights to Britain, and Poland replied in kind. LOT business manager Jan Mich said the airline had lost about Dollars 1 million in ticket revenues during the dispute.</p>

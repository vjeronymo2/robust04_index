			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the department of politics under the rubric </F> "Press Digest. `Election-94'": "Parties Are Beginning To Define  Themselves"]    [Text] Last week the first election bloc, the Alliance of  the KhDNF [Christian-Democratic People's Front], took clear-cut  shape. On 9 November it was registered by the central election  commission. Leaders of the Alliance made programmatic statements  in the weekly TARA. Iurie Rosca, chairman of the Executive  Committee of the KhDNF Council: "The power satellite parties are  competing with still greater diligence in grovelling before the  three pillars of the Chisinau administration--Snegur, Lucinschi,  and Sangheli--hoping to retain their cushy positions in the  future.... Unlike the rest of the political parties and  entities, which represent mere groupings of transient interests  and have emerged solely with the intention of getting into the  future parliament at any price, the KhDNF does not consider the  forthcoming elections to be an objective unto itself, or, even  less, the final point of its activities. To be sure, we would  certainly like to convince as many voters as possible of the  need to support our platform. For us the struggle did not begin  today, nor will it be completed on 27 February 1994. To us,  freedom is not a preelection slogan but a current demand:  freedom for the political prisoners of Tiraspol; national  freedom; freedom to assert human rights and to endow peasants,  whom the communist regime has reduced to poverty, with land and  farm equipment; freedom to engage in economic activities  unhampered by artificial barriers thrown up by the old Bolshevik  guard which has usurped all power in the state; conditions for  providing normal wages for the population and retirement  benefits that would ensure a comfortable existence for old  people."    Sergiu Mocanu, another leader of the Alliance and chairman  of  the Presidium of the Council of the Volunteers Movement,  analyzes those who fight against the statehood of Moldova.    "Recently, the idea has been propagated increasingly often  that sociopolitical entities that belong to the  national-liberation movement are fighting against the Republic  of Moldova's statehood. The absurdity of this assertion, which  is being persistently propagated by the president of the state  and the power satellite parties, is obvious from the very  beginning.    "We, participants in the combat for the integrity and  independence of the Republic of Moldova, members of the  Volunteers Movement, were not and cannot be against the state we  have defended and for whose sake we paid a price in blood and  the lives of our brethren who fell on the battlefield. We owe it  to the blessed memory of their names to continue our struggle  for the People and the Motherland. We are joining the election  struggle because we are firmly convinced that only in this  manner will we be able to rid ourselves and others of the need  to fight for independence with weapons. In our actions we  proceed from the principle that `the state constitutes the  foundation for the exercise of the right of all peoples to  decide their own destinies.' In other words, it is a means to an  end, and not an end unto itself. We, those who come out for the  unity of the People and the Motherland, are not the ones  fighting against the state, but rather it is those who have  turned the state into an instrument for exploiting our dignity  for personal and clan interests."    Valeriu Babara, the third activist in the preelection bloc,  general secretary of the executive bureau of the OKhDM  [Organization of Christian-Democratic Youth], is a figure who is  little known in politics. He outlined the tasks of the OKhDM in  the newspaper TARA:    "Young people, who are referred to in official speeches with  nauseating frequency but have almost always been ignored and  abandoned, are the social group which has retained its purity  and unity of ranks. In essence, they are the hope of the nation.  Young people have earned indisputable credit in the  national-liberation movement, in the defense of its  accomplishments, in the anticommunist struggle. After the more  than five years since the beginning of the national-liberation  struggle, young people are coming to the conclusion that a  serious threat to their future is looming, along with the future  of the entire nation. Young people regard with anxiety the  phenomena of a split within our society, and note the inability  of our current leaders to find and use the only correct scenario  for the quickest possible solution to the most serious problems  we are facing.    "The structure I represent wants to bring youth into the  political life of the Republic of Moldova, which is frequently  smothered by egoistic caprices and interests. Only young people  are free from the spiritual fetters of the obsolete communist  system. Members of the nomenklatura who cling to power for dear  life and claim to have some kind of `political experience'  forget to specify that the experience they gained in the years  of the old regime is unsuitable for the new reality. All of us  experienced this `Red experiment' firsthand for more than 50  years."    The time has come when Bolsheviks will be forced to step  aside. It is not ruled out that by Bolsheviks, Valeriu Barbara  means parties of a centrist and left-wing orientation which are  also striving to win the elections. The weekly RESPUBLICA has  published a report on a press conference given by the leaders of  the Social Democrats. Oazu Nantoi, Victor Josu, and Sergiu  Bernevec answered questions put by journalists. Victor Josu:    "We have decided not to make any projections on the results  of the forthcoming elections. Naturally, for this reason we will  not venture to assert with certainty, a priori, that we will  receive more than one-half of the votes. The issue is being  raised in a different manner--the Social-Democratic Party has  set for itself the task of gaining no less than 50 percent of  the votes of the electorate, plus one, in the elections.  According to our observations, the political apathy which has  prevailed in recent years has begun to abate sharply. The people  are becoming interested in the party, in its program, and in its  proposals. People from literally all rayons of Moldova come  every day to our headquarters at 11 Cogelnicianu Street, invite  us to meetings, enroll in our party, and offer us their  assistance."    Oazu Nantoi:    "We are the first political party of a parliamentary type in  Moldova. As early as three and a half years ago we perceived  that our society needed a genuine multiparty system. We remain  the only party which has its own doctrine--the doctrine of  contemporary European Social Democrats.    "From the very beginning, even under pressure, our party has  advocated the idea of statehood for the Republic of Moldova. As  early as 1990 we maintained that Moldova is a citizens' state.  We proposed the idea of popular privatization for certificates,  whereas the government proposed privatization for money. In our  opinion, this would have brought about the dangerous social  stratification of our society into very rich and very poor.  Undoubtedly, the voters have come to know us during these three  years.    "We maintain that we have a rich land and a hard-working  people. However, given the high density of the population and  the European market, which is closed to competitors, Moldova  will only survive if it complements efficient agriculture with  equally efficient industry. As a mere agrarian republic we can  only be an appendage of some other country. It is known that  highly efficient agriculture employs a few percent of the  population. We have a terrible imbalance here. Thoughtless  implementation of high technology in rural areas creates the  risk of making hundreds of thousands of people unemployed.    "We are facing two problems--to switch to a market mode what  remains of socialist industry, and to create a genuine national  economy. No major research of any consequence has yet been  carried out in this area. If we have no high technology or  electronic industry, our state will have no future.  Unfortunately, things are bad now; enterprises are closing down.  Despite all the hopes of the socialists, our working class is  silently dying."    Experts of the ADPM [Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova]  are also paying serious attention to economic issues. On the  pages of the newspaper ZEMLYA I LYUDI, Aleksandr Muravskiy  writes:    "As it evaluates the progress of reform in the agrarian  sector, the ADPM supports the fundamental line of  transformations aimed at developing a multisectoral agriculture.    "The ADPM believes that agrarian reform does not come down  merely to the universal redistribution of land and the  establishment of exclusively owner-operated farms, and that an  economic system which combines in a rational manner small,  medium-size, and large farms with various specialties and of  various types and forms of ownership should be the main result  of reforms. Transformations that will result in unprepared  people being left alone to tackle their problems should not be  implemented, like, for example, what has already happened to the  Vatic sovkhoz in Orkheyskiy Rayon. The transformation of  kolkhozes and sovkhozes should be accompanied by the appropriate  development of a market infrastructure, including a system of  credit associations, land banks, and cooperative and joint-stock  enterprises which provide material and technical support to  farmers and sell their products. We must not lose sight of the  fact that accelerated privatization will bring about the release  of a large number of employees from the sphere of agriculture,  as, for example, happened in the former GDR, where in two years  of reforms the number of agricultural employees has fallen by a  factor of more than three. However, there it has been  accompanied by tremendous financial infusions from West Germany  in order to create new jobs.    "Aware of the fact that radical reforms that affect the  fundamental basis of a society (ownership arrangements, social,  moral, and ideological priorities, the place and role of a  country in the international division of labor, and so on) are  unavoidably accompanied by painful phenomena, the ADPM considers  it necessary to make a number of proposals aimed at invigorating  social policy. Measures aimed at stabilizing and subsequently  increasing the level of employment of the population are the  foremost in this package of proposals, because it is virtually  impossible to ensure economic and social stability in the  republic in an environment of growing unemployment. To this end  it is necessary:    "--to invigorate, as much as possible, the activities of all  state structures aimed at the development of small and  medium-size businesses;    "--to provide incentives, by way of tax relief and credit  preferences, to industrial enterprises establishing their  branches, subsidiaries, and other structural subdivisions in  rural areas;    "--to develop a streamlined system for using citizens who  are  temporarily out of work for public works to upgrade roads and  localities and build facilities of social infrastructure;    "--to develop and adopt a special program for the export of  labor;    "--to put in order the system for cadre retraining, taking  into account structural changes underway in the economy of the  republic."    The leadership of the Socialist Party takes an  ostentatiously  antiunionist position in its press organ, DREPTATE: "The idea of  a national renaissance of the Moldovan and other peoples  residing on the territory of the republic has been stolen,  distorted, and financed [as published] by the destructive forces  of unionist frontism, as have been the most radiant hopes for  building a sovereign, independent, and democratic Moldovan  state. Our noble thoughts and expectations were defiled by the  maniacal ambitions of patriot-radicals (actually, the  new-fangled national-communists of Ceausescu's ilk) who fancied  themselves martyrs and heroes of the indigenous nation, the  infallible messiahs of its deliverance. They, the ones afflicted  with the virus of national superiority and pathological  xenophobia, have destroyed numerous economic links between  Moldova and other republics of the former Soviet Union, thus  ushering in chaos in the economy, pushing it toward catastrophe,  and opening up boundless opportunities for speculation,  corruption, thievery, utilitarian attitudes, and the mafia to  bloom.    "At present, these `chosen representatives' of the nation  are  trying again (yet again!) to undergo an ideological  metamorphosis by creating all kinds of congresses and  Christian-Labor-Democratic parties, forswearing odious frontism  verbally but actually carrying on secret intrigues aimed at  selling out the Moldovan people and their sovereign republic.    "Let us be vigilant! Let us guard ourselves--this time, in a  manly and secure manner--against the demagogic froth of slogans  steeped, just as before, in anticommunism, pseudodemocracy,  nationalism, and inhumanity. They should not pass now! Let us  not be misled by their moaning about, you see, `dark  pro-imperial forces' which have gotten out of the trenches and  allegedly pinned on them--who have `given back' to us the  language, the alphabet, the tricolored flag, and the `Romanian,  awaken!' anthem--the blame for inconceivable poverty, spiritual  decay, and the incredible suffering of the people. They say that  the `fifth red-and-brownshirt column,' a figment of their sick  imagination, is to blame.    "The people have been silent too long! However, they have  not  slept a lethargic sleep. They have mustered their will and  pondered their decisive word. We will hear this word--wise,  unprejudiced, every kind [as published] of word--during the  forthcoming early elections to the parliament and local organs  of power."    A commentary is probably unnecessary. The reader will  himself  find the party and slogans that are to his liking.</p>

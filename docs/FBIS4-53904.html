			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Perspectives: Ties Further Strengthened"] </F>   [Text] The visit of the Prime Minister of the Socialist  Republic of Vietnam, Mr Vo Van Kiet, to the Union of Myanmar  [Burma] at the invitation of the Prime Minister, Senior General  Than Shwe, helps further strengthen the existing strong ties  between our two Southeast Asian nations.    Though the two nations do not share common border, both had,  each in a different way, to suffer being made a colony of a  foreign power. Both nations had long and arduous freedom  struggles, each in its own way, but nevertheless were able to  expel the intruders.    Premier Vo Van Kiet noted with nostalgia the visit of his  country's beloved leader, President Ho Chi Minh, to Myanmar 36  years ago.    Today, both nations are bringing about economic reforms in  similar ways. This has prompted Senior General Than Shwe to  note that gaining knowledge from each other's experiences and  developing mutually beneficial cooperation at the present moment  would enable the two nations to see prosperity and move on  toward creating a prosperous region.    Moreover, the Senior General, in his banquet speech, has  also  opined that from the mutual goodwill generated by the visit, the  spirit of mutual assistance, goodwill and understanding, and  unified cooperation will flourish in our region of Southeast  Asia.    The Vietnamese Premier was also pleased to note that in the  current new situation, the good traditional relations thus far  nurtured by our two peoples are now gathering new momentum to  further develop through sincere cooperation for the prosperity  of the two nations.    The Senior General shares these views. He said he firmly  believes that through the frank and open exchanges of views  during the visit, the two nations will be able to enhance the  mutual regard and understanding and the friendly ties which  already exist.    Our two nations share common values, common ideals and  similar culture. It is with this common identity and respect  for each other that nations like ours must work together in  order to accomplish what we wish to.    The Vietnamese Premier and entourage are taking in Mandalay  and Pyin Oo Lwin in their short visit. They will at least be  able to get a better idea of the socio-economic changes brought  about in this country.    The reforms being brought about in our two countries and the  initial strides we have made reflect the wisdom and integrity of  the leaders and the peoples. We wish our distinguished guests  an enjoyable stay.</p>

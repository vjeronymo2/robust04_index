			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Strong underlying growth at Carrefour Carrefour, one of France's leading hypermarket groups, yesterday continued the positive trend in the French retail sector, reporting strong underlying growth in earnings for the first half of 1994. Although total net profits fell sharply due to a reduction in exceptional credits, the company estimates there was growth of more than one-third in net earnings, before exceptional items. Total net profits for the six months were FFr871m (Dollars 156m), against FFr1.66bn in the same period of 1993. However, the underlying rate of growth was stronger than expected, as Carrefour made only FFr101m in exceptional profits in the 1994 interim period against FFr1.09bn last year, when it sold the Castorama chain of furniture stores. The French retail sector has been under pressure for the past two years due to the static state of consumer spending. However, France is pulling out of recession and confidence has recovered. This brighter picture is reflected in the current round of retailers' interim results. Carrefour was no exception. Sales rose 6.4 per cent during the first half to FFr61.34bn, against FFr57.64bn. The company said net profits before exceptional items rose 36.3 per cent to FFr770m from FFr565m. One of its most buoyant activities was the Pryca subsidiary with earnings growth of 26 per cent. Ms Michele Wolff, retailing analyst at Societe Generale securities house in Paris, said the results were better than expected. She said she would slightly upgrade her profits forecast for the full financial year. Carrefour forecast continued sales growth during the autumn to a total of FFr133bn for the whole of 1994, which would represent a 7.5 per cent increase on the 1993 total of FFr123bn. It anticipated further underlying profits growth with net profits before exceptional items rising 'at the same rate as last year'. This means a 24.3 per cent increase to about FFr2.06bn from FFr1.66bn in 1993.</p>

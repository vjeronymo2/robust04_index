			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / US Treasury clears British company A BRITISH company blacklisted by the US Treasury as a suspected agent of the Iraqi government was yesterday cleared of suspicion and allowed to continue trading with American corporations. Sollatek, an electronics company based in London, is the fourth organisation named by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on April 1 to have been issued with a licence pending its removal from the blacklist. The action follows discussions with officials at the UK Department of Trade and Industry. PMK, Qudos and Liverpool Polytechnic were granted similar licences last week. Mr Manhal Allos, director, said last night he had not ruled out legal action against the US government.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col. Oleg Falichev: "The Main Thing Is Combat </F> Readiness: Press Conference of the Minister of Defense"]    [Text] The Armed Forces of Russia have an anniversary  on 7 May 1992: It is two years since the beginning of their  formation. That is enough time to summarize results and to talk  about problems and prospects.    This is really what was discussed at the press  conference in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the  Russian Federation, where Minister of Defense Gen. of the Army  Pavel Grachev spoke to Russian and foreign journalists.    "Two years is truly a short time," he said. "But for  military  people these years were extraordinarily filled with doings. In  this time we realized very clearly the kind of responsibility  that the army has. For this reason, one of the main results of  its formation is this: The armed forces are a dependable  institute of the state and the guarantor of its security. Real  patriots of the motherland are now serving in the army under  these difficult circumstances. They serve in accordance with  their conscience and not for rubles and dollars. The truth is  this: Whatever difficulties Russia may experience, the armed  forces will retain their combat capability and will remain  controllable. I thank the officers, generals, and soldiers for  this."    The main task today, the minister of defense stressed, is to  support the army and navy at a level of combat readiness that  quarantees the defense of the state under any conditions. And it  is being fulfilled. The Strategic Nuclear Forces remain the  guarantor of the security of Russia. And they will continue to  be the main means of deterring the unleashing of nuclear war.    The process of establishing new force groupings is being  concluded. The Mobile Forces will play an important role in  them. Work is now under way in the forces to bring them up to  prescribed strength.    The minister of defense gave a brief assessment of what has  been done in each branch of the armed forces. He said that the  mixed principle of manpower acquisition will be retained. In  1994, for example, it is planned to accept 64,000 men in the  Ground Forces. And it is planned to have 50 percent of them be  contract service personnel by 1995. The minister found a  shortcoming in the fact that we have not yet learned to work  with this contingent. As a result, about 25 percent of the  contract people had to be discharged.    As for the Air Defense Forces, about whose demise there has  been much talk, they will remain. It is planned to reorganize  them into Aerospace Defense Forces.    Overall the Minister of Defense had a rather high assessment  of the combat readiness of the troops. The situation is best in  the Strategic Missile Forces, Moscow Military District,  Leningrad Military District, the GRVZ [Group of Russian Troops  in Transcaucasus], and Leningrad Naval Base. Things are worse in  the Pacific Fleet. The minister of defense stressed that  beginning with the summer training period the armed forces will  put rigid demands on the work. Two years was enough time, he  said, to eliminate shortcomings and to establish efficient work.  Among the problems that require a decision at the national  level, Gen. of the Army Pavel Grachev named the dependable and  stable financing of the armed forces, their adequate strength  level, the conclusion of the troop withdrawal, and the provision  of housing and facilities for the troops in the territory of  Russia.    We will speak in more detail in the next issue about  the problems raised at the press conference with respect to the  development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.</p>

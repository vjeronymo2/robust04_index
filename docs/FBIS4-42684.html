			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Guenter Bannas: "Peace Negotiations Like Those </F> in Geneva--Lafontaine, Dressler, Scharping, and the  Sociopolitical Debate in the SPD"]    [Text] Bonn, May--Rudolf Dressler's criticism of  sociopolitical statements by Oskar Lafontaine is seen by veteran  Social Democrats as representing the future battle line within  the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. "Anyone who wants  to use the reduction of social services as a means for  conducting Social Democratic politics will have the opportunity  to present this for consideration at the forthcoming SPD party  congress in Halle"--thus the response by deputy parliamentary  caucus chairman and sociopolitician Dressler to the  minister-president of the Saarland, who, more in passing than  anything else, had stated that, in a consolidation of the budget  under an SPD government, social services could also be  considered for cuts. Not the traditional right-left debates over  foreign policy or the relationship with the Greens would  characterize the various wings of the party, say Social  Democrats from the tradition-bound SPD from the Ruhr District.  The position taken relative to social policies and to cutbacks  in funding for social services will become the distinguishing  feature. Only people with their own swimming pool could do  without the public pool, the debate escalates.    The triviality of the cause and the efforts being made to  clear the matter up indicate that Rudolf Scharping has only  succeeded in settling the dispute for the time being, but not in  eliminating the more deep-seated differences of opinion.  Following a conversation with SPD finance ministers of the  laender, Lafontaine had explained the familiar finance policy  details of the campaign platform: No increase in the tax rate,  budgetary austerity. As long as an economic recovery had not  gotten off the ground, there could be no cuts in the federal  budget, since jobs would be threatened otherwise. But if there  is an upward trend in the economy, one sustained not only by the  demand for exports but also by demand at home, "social services"  would also be put on the "test stand." There would be "a wailing  and a chattering of teeth" if that happened, he indicated.  Dressler felt compelled by reactions from within the party and  probably also from shop stewards close to the SPD to come up  with a clear reply. "The assertion that an SPD-led Federal  Government would also resort to a curtailment of social services  as a means for consolidating the public finances is not  justified by anything." Within the Bundestag caucus, critical  questions along this same line were asked. "The consolidation of  public finances cannot be achieved through a cut in social  services," deputy party chairman Thierse was quoted as saying.  Scharping was called upon to mediate. Before making public  criticisms, those involved should make use of the telephone, he  said. His admonitions were viewed as "elegant" because he had  named no names and had thus "damaged" no one. A telephonic  conference circuit among Scharping, Dressler, and Lafontaine was  intended to settle the dispute.    Many are comparing Scharping's efforts with "Geneva" peace  negotiations, at the conclusion of which the chairman announced  the formula for settlement. The federal deficit threatens to  strangulate the state budgets; the share borne by the state  cannot be increased. The SPD will keep the increase in Federal  spending "below the increase in the GNP." Scharping is trying to  do justice to both sides. With respect to Lafontaine,  Scharping's text contains the following: "The consequence is  obvious: In the course of putting the federal finances back on  an even keel, and on the basis of an environmentally compatible  growth, the SPD will subject all federal services--including  taxation and social--to continuing scrutiny." Meant for Dressler  was the assurance that the essential thing now was to establish  the "aiming accuracy" of federal services and to avoid  "weakening effects." "That is not social dismantlement, but, on  the contrary, a component of the urgently needed modernization  of activities by the state." Recommendations taken from the  SPD's governing program on child allowances and on "doing away  with unjust tax exemptions" were appended. All sides were able  to affirm afterwards that the dispute was now "settled."  Conjectures to the contrary have remained.    Dressler's intention had been to counter false signals which  might have weakened the will of the party to conduct an active  electoral campaign. He may have recalled earlier statements made  by Lafontaine. "The second is--that too must be said here--that  only massive intervention in consumer spending--I repeat:  massive intervention in consumer spending--will be able to slow  down the continued dramatic rise in the Federal deficit once the  economy has begun to recover again." The applause of the party  congress for these clear words by Lafontaine was not effusive at  this point of his speech. His election as one of Rudolf  Scharping's deputies nevertheless turned into a vote of  confidence. He received 381 votes last November in Wiesbaden, 20  more than Scharping received in his election as party chairman,  and almost 60 more than Rudolf Dressler got in the election to  the party executive. The voters must be told the truth,  Lafontaine had called out, as if to affirm anew his campaign of  1990.    Despite his success at the party congress, Lafontaine has  long been viewed by tradition-bound Social Democrats as  representing an individualistic political approach, one which  underestimates the importance of societal "solidarity."  Representatives of the labor unions and also the socialist left  wing of the party join forces here. The fiscal policy of  Lafontaine and of deputy parliamentary caucus chairwoman Ingrid  Matthaeus-Maier are destroying the foundations of the SPD,  critics note--softly, for the time being, so as not to disrupt  the campaign. And many are also looking at Scharping, who had  made Lafontaine the deputy chairman of the election platform  committee, as well as the fiscal and economic policy spokesman  of the party leadership. The two of them, they are wont to say,  want to form a "strong axis." The turmoil surrounding  Lafontaine's statements, which contentwise are nothing but a  watered-down version of his announcements of last November,  shows how thin the ice that sustains them is in the event of a  conflict.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traditional suppliers seek EU sugar supply priority The European Union's traditional raw sugar suppliers have asked to be given first call on any new import quotas required and have started negotiations to supply about 260,000 tonnes per year of raw sugar which will be needed by Portugal. The price which the EU has suggested for additional sugar imported from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group is based on a formula which adds four cents to the going world market price, which would currently be about nine cents less than the ACP gets for its guaranteed sales of 1.3m tonnes per year. Officials of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean, who reported on the talks with the EU, said that the expected expansion of the Union would create to the prospect of 'additional access for ACP sugar to the EU of possibly between 330,000 to 400,000 tonnes each year at preferential prices'. In particular, the group is targeting Portugal which has been receiving about 75,000 tonnes per year from four ACP states - Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi, Swaziland, Zambia. Portugal needs 260,000 tonnes per year of raw sugar which it now gets from the world market, according to the Sugar Association. ACP members want to be given first call on any quotas issued for imports by Portugal.</p>

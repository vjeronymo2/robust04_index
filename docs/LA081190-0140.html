			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA MUSEUM HONORS EARLIER L.A. MODERNISTS;  </P> <P> EXHIBIT: 'TURNING THE TIDE: EARLY LOS ANGELES MODERNISTS 1920-1956' DISCREDITS  THE NOTION THAT MODERN ART DIDN'T BEGIN IN CALIFORNIA UNTIL THE '50S AND '60S.  </P> <P> On Oct. 27, 1941, Life magazine did a story on the new wave of art combining  "freedom and tradition" that was coming out of California. This art was created  in a land less cramped for space than the East or Midwest, the article burbled,  the "land of experiment."  </P> <P> But, as Susan Ehrlich pointed out in her lecture at the Laguna Art Museum on  Thursday, the article never mentioned any of the modernist artists who really  embodied the spirit of the new in Southern California.  </P> <P> Ehrlich, 47, is co-curator with Barry M. Heisler of "Turning the Tide: Early  Los Angeles Modernists 1920-1956," an exhibit (at the Laguna museum through  Sept. 16) that aims to correct the prevailing notion that no truly innovative  work was done in the Southland before the crush of well-known artists of the  late '50s and '60s.  </P> <P> Moving with brisk good humor through a discussion of works by several of the  artists in the show, Ehrlich, a professor of art history at USC, made a point  of discussing interwoven influences on the artists' work.  </P> <P> These diverse influences included the still-pristine expanse of coastal  landscape, friendships (with other artists as well as collectors and members of  the film community, a few of whom dabbled in art dealing), outside employment  (particularly on the team that made the Disney movie "Fantasia"), political  pressures from the far right, personal interests in Eastern philosophy and the  quirks of a larger community that remained suspicious of serious culture.  </P> <P> One member of the close-knit arts community of the '30s was Peter Krasnow, who  drove to Glendale from New York City with his wife, Rose, in 1922. A gregarious  man, he befriended the photographer Edward Weston, modernist architects Rudolph  Schindler and Richard Neutra, Expressionist artists' representative Galka  Scheyer and numerous painters, film directors and others.  </P> <P> In Ehrlich's view, the strict horizontals and verticals in Krasnow's  hot-colored abstract paintings can be compared to the framing elements of  houses by his architect friends.  </P> <P> Krasnow showed at the Stendhal Art Gallery on Wilshire Boulevard, which also  handled work by such European artists as Klee and Kandinsky. But during the  Great Depression, buyers were scarce, and in any case the knowledgeable art  community was very small. So owner Erle Stendhal opened a candy store above the  gallery where he sold chocolates made by his own plant in boxes decorated with  reproductions of the art in his gallery.  </P> <P> Ehrlich said she came across a photograph of Stendhal's goodies and noticed a  familiar-looking gold foil-wrapped chocolate object in the background. On  closer observation it proved to be an edible copy of Krasnow's 1927 bronze  sculpture, "Atlantis."  </P></p>

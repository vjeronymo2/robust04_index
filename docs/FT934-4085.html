			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Management: Five principles for an organised day - Tips from the top James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, offers advice on ways to manage time According to Tom Peters, the management guru, there are only two kinds of managers in the nanosecond 1990s - the quick and the dead. That may sound trite but it contains more than a grain of truth. A recent survey by Management Today painted a worrying picture of men and women working under extreme pressure. More than 80 per cent of respondents to the survey complained of incompetent senior management, poor internal communications, time pressure, constant interruptions and unrealistic business objectives. As today's pressures mean a continual drive to add more value with less people, the manager's work is increasingly becoming a source of stress as well as satisfaction. Time management starts with a clear definition of goals and priorities and continues with the organisation of all activities around them. Pareto's Law applies to time management, too. Some 80 per cent of your results are going to flow out of 20 per cent of your activities. There are many pressures which lead to wasteful use of time - meetings that should not be on the agenda, social events that need not be attended and tasks that should be delegated. Time can also be wasted if a company's organisational structure is not balanced and the span of managerial control is too wide. That comes back to picking competent people, listening to them and ensuring that they are empowered to do their job. Correcting mistakes and repeating tasks is unproductive. Encourage those you control to get it right - first time, on time, every time. We all complain about meetings but they are vital to the completion of tasks in an organisation. Always question the need for your presence and watch out for that insidious corporate art - upward delegation. As a chairman of a meeting, you are its referee and leader. You must keep it on track, ensure that only the relevant people attend, summarise decisions and make sure all participants are aware of the implications of these decisions including the actions which are required of them. If you are chairman of the board, estimate the time each agenda item is likely to take. It's much better to deal thoroughly with four or five items and come to clear and well-understood decisions, than to deal unsatisfactorily with eight. And then there is that great corporate comfort blanket, the diary. We've all become used to its tyranny but it can be one of our most flexible business tools. A productive diary is one which has a lot of space in it. You may not be able to predict the future but at least you can leave time to deal with it. And don't leave it entirely to your secretary. Thinking ahead is a must. Plan each week carefully and take a few minutes each morning to review the day's work and to set realistic objectives for yourself. Be prepared to fail. If you find you are transferring a task from week to week, then perhaps it would be better delegated. Travel time can be used to great effect. Not only for thinking but also for working. If you are fortunate enough to be driven from engagement to engagement then you can virtually set up office in the car with a mobile telephone and a memo tape. In the UK, there is a deep-seated cultural distaste for working at home. There is a clear psychological division between office and home. That division will become increasingly blurred with the kind of communication improvements available now, though that doesn't mean we all need to turn into workaholics. Here are my five principles of good time management. Set goals for your business and your private life and make sure they are realistic. Question every action. If you feel you should not be doing something then delegate. Don't be a slave to your diary or any other office system - get them working for you. Leave time in your day to think and plan - and to listen. Finally, recognise your own limitations - you're only human. Next Monday: Liam Strong of Sears on keeping yourself briefed.</p>

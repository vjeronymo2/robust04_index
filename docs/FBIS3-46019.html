			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev reiterated here today that Russia must  maintain its military existence in the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) and the Baltic nations to protect  Russia's interests.    Russia's interests in these areas are "critically  important,"  Kozyrev told a Foreign Ministry meeting on Tuesday. "The major  threats against Russia also come from there," he added.    Kozyrev strongly opposed any attempt to withdraw Russia's  military presence in these areas, describing it as "extremist  attitude."    One of Russia's policy priorities in these countries is to  solve the issue of dual citizenships for Russian residents  there, he said.    He said Russia should improve the efficiency of its  cooperation with other CIS members and the Baltic nations and  work out short, medium and long-term strategies in setting up an  economic union with them.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / An overture to the main event: German public-sector returns to work as engineering and metal workers prepare to down tools SOME accounts were easily calculated and quickly settled. 'I'm going to take the rise, tear up my card and quit the union. That way I'll be DM38 (Pounds 12.90) a month better off,' a dispassionate Dusseldorf bus driver declared. 'All that hassle for absolutely nothing,' concluded a colleague, back at the controls of his tram for the first time in 11 days. The only consensus was that the public purse will have to yield up a further DM16bn to pay for the settlement this year, and that the loss of production and sales attributable to the disruption of post, transport, telephones and other services will cost a further DM1bn. There is as yet no accounting for the loss of confidence among union members, the loss of jobs, proclaimed as inevitable by learned economists, the loss of face in Chancellor Kohl's government and, not least, the loss of patience. While the machinery of the public sector rolled back into service as quickly and smoothly as it had been brought to a standstill, tempers frayed for the first time. 'We Germans don't like striking. We like to work. But we don't like doing either for nothing,' said a Bonn postal worker, unhappy at being asked to work overtime to clear the backlog. The mood was further undermined by the mounting certainty that the events of the last two weeks were nothing more than an overture to the main event: a strike in the engineering and metal-working industry. Few people had clear recollections of the last public sector strike, 18 years ago, and for most there was a certain novelty about the latest stoppage. Bicycles were hauled out of cellars, taxis ran impromptu, meticulously scheduled 'bus' services, normally dour drivers gave lifts to the bikeless. In Hamburg earlier this week, at the high point of the strike, dustmen turned out voluntarily to clean up the Reeperbahn 'entertainment' quarter because they did not want tourists to leave with the wrong impression of Germany. But few have forgotten the last engineers' strike, remembered as the hardest and bitterest post-war campaign. At its peak, the union called out a mere 58,000 workers. Management responded by locking out a further 160,000 and laying-off 450,000 without wages or strike pay. At one stage the country's entire car industry was paralysed. The issue then was shorter working hours. The issue now is pay. This week's public sector deal provided the first component of a complex and difficult equation. The headline pay increase of 5.4 per cent for workers who, in the words of IG Metall leader, Mr Franz Steinkuhler 'produce nothing' will not be nearly enough for the 4m people operating the machines which generate most of Germany's wealth.

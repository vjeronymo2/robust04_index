			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Palestinian spokesman has announced the following:    Operations of violence and killings have recently been  escalating in the occupied Palestinian territories. This  violence has deliberately been directed against our students and  children by the Israeli Army and armed settlers which has  constituted a serious precedent especially after the signing of  the Cairo agreement. However, in the same breath, we do not  agree with and rather denounce the attack on women and  especially the pregnant among them as happened recently in the  killing of a settler, which is in contrast with Arab and Islamic  ethics.    This escalation harms the peace process. Self-restraint is  required from everyone, especially toward the unarmed peaceful  civilians.</p>

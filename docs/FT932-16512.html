			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Gonzalez wants a head to roll - or he'll go: PM threatens to quit as Socialist party leader over a scandal JOSE LUIS Corcuera is, to put it mildly, a persuasive man. A former Basque steelworker he is big, strong and not very subtle. He is also Spain's minister of the interior and has just been given a remarkable job by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. By the end of the week, Mr Corcuera has to persuade the administrators of Spain's ruling Socialist party that unless one or more of them resigns, then Mr Gonzalez will go as party leader. He will quite needlessly add that if Mr Gonzalez resigns the Socialists will certainly lose the election later this year so it had better not be him that does so. Mr Corcuera is perfect for the job because he comfortably straddles the two worlds Mr Gonzalez has to live in - as prime minister and leader of a conservative government, and as secretary general and leader of a more left-wing Socialist party. For more than three years he, along with most of the country, have watched the prime minister and his fellow party leaders arrive at this week's stand-off. For a long time after being first elected in 1982 Mr Gonzalez was able to inhabit his two worlds. But as Spain's economic boom faded, government opted for financial prudence while the party resisted subsidy cuts, privatisations and looser labour laws. Mr Gonzalez found himself siding with his conservative cabinet colleagues, in particular his finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, but party lobbying against fiscal responsibility has invariably won the day. Now Spain is in recession and Mr Gonzalez, facing election, seethes over opportunities lost. This alone would not have been enough to bring tension between party and government to a head. The vital element has been corruption charges  - illicit party financing and influence peddling - that have been levelled against the party (in fact against almost all Spanish parties) and which it has reacted to by burying its head in the sand. It started in 1990 with the revelation that the brother of the then deputy prime minister and deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra, had enjoyed the use of a government office in Seville - from which he worked as an 'adviser' to his brother - to conduct lucrative business affairs. Incredibly, Mr Guerra took more than a year to resign as deputy PM. He remains deputy party leader to Mr Gonzalez. Their relationship, rooted in the years of exile during the Franco dictatorship, has become slowly more poisonous. Mr Guerra, though, has helped return three Socialist majorities since 1982 and is popular in the poor south. Then in 1991 Spanish newspapers discovered that senior party officials had taken control of a fake consulting company, Filesa, in Barcelona. They had then 'sold' industrial research worth about Dollars 10m to big financial and corporate clients. The money was used to finance Socialist election campaigns in the late 1980s. The newspaper reports were brilliantly documented but the Socialists attacked them as opposition campaigns. In the past year a lone judge has taken on the party and searched its headquarters to loud complaints of victimisation. Late last month, though, three treasury inspectors seconded to the judge confirmed the reports. Public opinion - with an eye on the corruption arrests in Italy and the Socialist collapse in France last month - is demanding that heads roll. If nothing is done, the conservative opposition, level with the Socialists in the polls for the first time in a decade, will surely make new gains. Mr Gonzalez has made a simple choice. He was persuaded against his better judgment to stand for a fourth term as prime ministerial candidate for the party and he has now decided to withdraw - by resigning as party leader - if someone who knew about the financing scam does not own up to it and go. He himself was probably not aware of the scam - he pays little attention to party details. The public gaze, however, does fall on two men whose arms Mr Corcuera will be twisting until the party executive meets on Saturday - Mr Guerra and the party number three, Mr Jose Maria Benegas. More than any other leaders, Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas have taught the party to denigrate every attempt to make it accountable to the public in cases of suspected corruption. The resignation of either man would be a sensation and might restore some public confidence in the party. Mr Gonzalez's tactics are not new. He resigned briefly as party leader in the 70s over an ideological disagreement with the left. In the 1986 Nato referendum he made it clear he would resign if the country voted against continued membership. This will be nastier. The party leadership has been together for 20 years and the infighting will be personal. But Mr Gonzalez is likely to stand his ground. His resignation as party leader would mean he would see out this term as prime minister and retire. As he faces down old friends in the party his impatience to go and the Corcuera bludgeon are his best weapons.</p>

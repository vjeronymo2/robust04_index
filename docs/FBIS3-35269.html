But, at the same time it is a point of agreement for Cairo and  Khartoum that Sudan should stay united with all its seven  provinces.    The repeated U.S. attempts to convince Egypt of the need for  the secession of southern Sudan has expanded to include  Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. In the past three months, the U.S.  Administration exerted intensive efforts to convince these three  countries' presidents to support the right to self-determination  for the inhabitants of south Sudan and of Jabal al-Nubah in  western Sudan. Harry Johnston, vice chairman of the African  Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, played an  important role in these efforts. This prompted Kenyan President  Daniel arap Moi to invite Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir for  talks in Nairobi on 18 February. Ethiopian President Meles  Zenawi had already accused Khartoum of interfering in Ethiopian  affairs and warned it against attempting to export terrorism to  Ethiopia and Eritrea through Islamic groups.    The three countries' presidents had received U.S. reports  about the southern Sudanese people's need for military and  material support to confront the Sudanese Government, who has  succeeded, according to these reports, in supporting and  increasing the strength of the Eritrean al-Jihad Movement. This  group is hostile to the Eritrean Transitional Government in  Asmara, the Somali Union Organization in northeast Somalia, the  Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromo in Ethiopia, the  Islamic Union Forces in "Ogaden," and the Islamic groups in  Kenya.    Egypt's Foreign Ministry sources pointed out that the  Al-Bashir-Moi meeting in Nairobi will be followed by meetings  with the two leaders of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army  [SPLA], John Garang and Riak Machar, who signed the agreement in  Washington last year on working together to obtain the right to  self-determination for southern and western Sudan.    These sources stressed that Harry Johnston told the three  African presidents that one of the aims behind the dispatch of  U.S. forces to Somalia in the "Restore Hope" operation was to  resolve the southern Sudan problem within the framework that  maintains security and stability in the Horn of Africa region.    The sources added that the U.S. interest in south Sudan is  Khartoum's support for the Islamic movements and exporting them  to neighboring countries. To make the Sudanese Government stop  this support, the U.S. Administration sought to change the  approach to solving the problem in the south from negotiations  to the overt call for its secession from the north. For this  purpose, the U.S. Administration recently held direct contacts  with some southern leaders, including Machar, to prepare for  large-scale military operations against the Sudanese forces to  achieve self-determination for the southerners. Machar recently  called for international intervention in the south to stop what  he called the genocide of Christian civilians at the hands of  the "Islamic" Sudanese Government.    The sources noted that Cairo learned of the U.S. contacts  with the secessionists in the south and the U.S.  Administration's inclination to move U.S. forces from Somalia to  southern Sudan. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S.  ambassador in Cairo to ask about these contacts and the nature  of the role U.S. forces deployed in Somalia will play in the  south.    The same sources noted that the U.S. ambassador's answer,  conveyed to President Husni Mubarak at the end of December,  pointed out that the goal of the U.S. military reinforcements in  the south is to confront centers of "terrorism" in Khartoum,  which represent a threat to security and stability in  neighboring states. According to the same sources, the U.S.  ambassador went beyond this explanation when he asked President  Mubarak to back these U.S. efforts by requesting direct Egyptian  participation in any military operations that may be carried out  against the Khartoum Government. He expressed his country's  readiness to work out military arrangements that could secure  the participation of some Egyptian military units, particularly  since the U.S. State Department appreciates the embarrassment  Egypt could face as a result of a potential direct military  confrontation with Sudanese Government troops.    Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources have disclosed that the  number of U.S. troops prepared for dispatch to southern Sudan is  4,000, along with equipment and modern military aircraft. In  early January, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry learned of a deal  involving the supply of advanced U.S. weapons to the rebel  troops in southern Sudan via Israel.    According to Arab diplomatic reports from Washington, direct  U.S. intervention in the south is serious. The sources added  that Britain had agreed to join in this intervention. Some  British societies, sponsored by Baroness Cox, have invited  leaders of the Sudanese opposition and the two wings of SPLA to  "a meeting on Sudan" to be held in the House of Commons in  London this month. The meeting will discuss the two main  issues; the political and the humanitarian problems in southern  Sudan.    The same sources disclosed that the United States will use  some military bases in neighboring African states as launching  pads for attacks against the Sudanese troops in the southern  areas, particularly in the Equatoria Province, Bahr El Ghazal  Province, and the Upper Nile Province.    An expert on African affairs at the Egyptian Foreign  Ministry  has pointed out that the objective of these U.S. military  preparations is not just to protect the U.S. interests in the  Horn of Africa but to cover up the failure of the operation in  Somalia. This failure has been a major political setback for  the new U.S. Administration and has resulted in a 30 percent  drop in the U.S. public's support for President Bill Clinton's  foreign policy. President Clinton personally wishes to score a  major victory in his foreign policy similar to that achieved by  former President George Bush during the Gulf war. The Egyptian  expert added that, aware of his mistake in settling matters  inside Somalia, President Bill Clinton was convinced of his  friend Harry Johnston's advice that a major military victory  over Sudanese Government troops is possible, particularly since  the southerners will provide all the necessary military  assistance to make the U.S. role in this mission successful.    The expert adds that Clinton expects the southern Sudan  operation to last two months. During the operation, the U.S.  Administration will declare the right to self-determination for  the southerners within a state independent from the north.    The Egyptian expert points out that the United States  decided  to take part in the operation in Somalia to create permanent  posts after the restoration of stability in that country. To  achieve this objective, U.S. military officials visited Somalia  successively to determine the locations of the posts. They  initially chose seven posts and held exchanges with some Somali  leaders. However, six of those leaders, including President Ali  Mahdi, did not approve the establishment of the posts on Somali  territory.    The Egyptian expert disclosed that the U.S. Administration  recently went back on its decision temporarily to build military  bases in Somalia lest these bases be sabotaged by the Somalis.  Hence, Johnston advised that these bases could possibly be set  up in southern Sudan as this move enjoys the approval of the  southern rebels leaders, particularly since Machar previously  called for establishing secure zones in southern Sudan. The  Sudanese Air Force would not be allowed to overfly these zones,  similar to northern and southern Iraq.    The Egyptian expert pointed out that the idea of building  permanent U.S. military bases in southern Sudan is an old one.  It was first expressed by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and  George Bush, but they could not implement it because of the  instability in southern Sudan. Bill Clinton is now trying to  achieve this objective within the context of Washington's  statement advocating the southerners' right to  self-determination by setting up an independent state.    The Egyptian expert noted that the strategic importance of  these bases is to ensure an advance U.S. presence during  disturbances and military operations in the African Horn states,  adjacent Arab countries, and the Red Sea. Cairo has urgently  asked the U.S. Administration not to intervene militarily in the  Sudanese problem and not to dispatch U.S. forces from Somalia  for this purpose. In its request, Cairo said that supporting the  secession of the south from the north is bound to encourage  several ethnic groups in Sudan and Ethiopia to take similar  measures. This would actually threaten stability in the Horn of  Africa.    Sources said that although the U.S. ambassador in Cairo  tried  to convey his government's assurances that it would not carry  out military intervention in Sudan, he said that Washington  wants the Egyptian Government to cooperate with it to curb  "terrorism," which takes Khartoum as its center, and to support  the idea of independence for the south from the north, as it  represents the ideal solution to the southerners' suffering and  does not harm Egypt's southern security.    This solution would also enable the independent Sudanese  southerners to establish good relations with Cairo and to revive  joint economic projects, including the Jonglei Canal project,  which has been obstructed by the ongoing war. However, Cairo  received all these assurances with extreme caution and has not  supported the U.S. position on the matter.    The Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources said that the reasons  for the U.S. retreat from direct military intervention in the  south, which became apparent from the U.S. ambassador's  assurances, were the differences that erupted between the  secessionist leaders over accepting the U.S. role in the south  and the condition of setting up permanent U.S. military bases in  their areas. While some, including Machar, backed the  establishment of these bases, Garang expressed some reservations.    To narrow the differences between these two leaders, Harry  Johnston sought to tell them that the U.S. Administration will  make military commitments to the rebel forces. In this context,  he effected a reconciliation between Garang and Machar (leader  of the Nuer tribes) to get the two leaders to agree on these  military commitments, which Washington will make later.    Confirmed Egyptian information noted that Machar approved  these military commitments while Garang opposed them and  expressed fears about them, and even conveyed these fears to  Cairo.    In view of this frenzied activity on the part of Washington  to resolve the problem of south Sudan on the basis of  self-determination, intensive Egyptian-Sudanese contacts were  held at the end of last month during which a message was  conveyed from the Egyptian president to his Sudanese counterpart  in which he stressed Egypt's support for Sudan in any attempt to  partition it. The Egyptian president also underlined the link  between Egyptian and Sudanese security.    Egyptian and Sudanese sources in Cairo said that Mubarak's  message to al-Bashir left a good impression on Sudanese  officials. This led to the two countries' agreement on resolving  the Egyptian-Sudanese dispute over the Hala'ib triangle within  the framework of the bilateral joint committees and on resolving  the differences between them over the issues of terrorism. In  this connection, the Sudanese authorities recently built a port  on the Red Sea and not in Shalatayn (the disputed area between  the two countries) to avoid any disputes and to improve  bilateral relations.    As part of Egypt's efforts to achieve a common conception of  security interests in the Horn of Africa between Cairo and  Washington, President Husni Mubarak contacted the presidents of  Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Eritrea, and some Somali leaders in his  capacity as OAU chairman. The contacts were designed to  underline the importance of the Egyptian role in the Horn of  Africa and the possibility of Egypt playing a prominent and  direct role in protecting U.S. interests and African countries'  interests in this region. This Egyptian role could be the  alternative to the direct role that Washington intends to play  in southern Sudan.    Although this common concept has not been achieved yet,  Washington, according to the African affairs expert in the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry, has not been convinced of the  Egyptian role in this region, especially in Somalia, and has  sought to belittle its importance or to marginalize it.  Washington is insisting that any action taken in the Horn of  Africa has to go through it. But Cairo continues to believe  that the problems of the region could be resolved within the  framework of the OAU and UN charters, which call for maintaining  the territorial integrity of Africa's countries and prohibits  their partitioning.</p>

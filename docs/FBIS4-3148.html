			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Two United States Navy  transport ships carrying Patriot missile batteries arrived in  the southeastern port of Pusan in South Korea Monday [18 April].    The first shipment contains six Patriot missile batteries,  with a total of 48 launchers, the South Korean news agency  YONHAP said.    Normally, a Patriot battalion has three to six batteries,  with eight launchers each. Each launcher carries four missiles.    These missile launchers are expected to be deployed at  military bases in South Korea by April 29, YONHAP quoted  military sources as saying.    The 13,000-ton "Comet" and 16,460-ton "Meteor" left the U.S.  Navy base in Oakland on March 23. Earlier reports said a total  of 192 Patriots would be sent to South Korea.    The patriot anti-missile missiles are a more advanced  version  than those used in 1991 Gulf war, according to the sources.    The missiles will considerably reinforce the air defense  capability in South Korea, a ministry official said, adding that  "it is the most effective defense system against possible air  attack."    U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered the patriots to  South  Korea to boost its defense capabilities during a growing  confrontation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) over Pyongyang's nuclear issue.    The DPRK strongly opposes the deployment of Patriot missiles  in South Korea, saying the missiles are designed for offensive  purposes.    Two weeks ago, some 1,000 students staged a demonstration  here to protest against the deployment of the U.S. weapons.    Patriot missiles, which were requested by U.S. commander in  South Korea Gary Luck, gained fame during the Gulf war for  intercepting Iraqi Scud missiles.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Intel continues legal battle against chip companies INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, is continuing its aggressive legal assault against imitators of its microprocessor chips. The company has filed patent infringement suits against Chips &amp; Technologies, another Silicon Valley semiconductor company which sells semiconductor devices to personal computer manufacturers. Last summer, Chips &amp; Technologies announced plans to sell a family of chips based on its version of the 386 microprocessor, Intel's top-selling product. Intel alleges Chips &amp; Technologies 386 and a related 387 co-processor chip violated Intel patents. Chips, which does not have its own manufacturing plant, sub-contracts production of these devices to Texas Instruments, one of the largest US chip-makers. Chips and Texas are also reported to be in talks about a possible licensing agreement related to the microprocessor devices. However, Intel's suit, filed on Friday, attempts to block any such agreement between Chips &amp; Technologies and third parties. Intel is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent transfer of the microprocessor technology. It also asked for an injunction to prevent sale of the semiconductor devices and for unspecified damages in connection with the alleged patent violations. Chips &amp; Technologies rejected Intel's allegations. 'Intel's lawsuit is a continuation of its policy to exert a monopoly over the microcomputer industry,' said Mr Gordon Campbell, president and chief executive of Chips &amp; Technologies. Intel is also involved in intellectual property disputes with Advanced Micro Devices and other US chip-makers. Mr Campbell alleged the Intel suit was 'an attempt to delay the adoption of our superior microprocessors by the computer industry.' 'Because of our belief that Intel would misuse the legal process, Chips took extraordinary precautions in designing our microprocessor and co-processor products,' Mr Campbell said. He claimed all Chips' products were designed from scratch and Chips' microprocessors and co-processors substantially outperform the equivalent Intel microprocessors. 'We will take whatever actions are necessary to strongly defend our intellectual property and our right to conduct business,' Mr Campbell said. Intel and Chips &amp; Technologies are holding talks which began before Chips' introduction of its 386 microprocessor. 'During the course of these discussions both companies had agreed to standstill agreements. On Friday, Intel abruptly and without warning, filed this lawsuit and requested a temporary restraining order,' said Mr Campbell.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PLANS DAILY SESSIONS ON DEFICIT;  </P> <P> BUDGET: HE IS EAGER TO STRIKE A DEAL BEFORE CONGRESS' AUGUST VACATION. TOP  LAWMAKERS ARE SKEPTICAL IT CAN BE DONE THAT QUICKLY.  </P> <P> Amid signs of a possible thaw in the frozen budget talks, the White House  announced Monday that President Bush will meet daily this week for "hard  bargaining" with top congressional leaders over the federal deficit.  </P> <P> "This is a period of very intense negotiations," White House spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said, "so they felt the leadership should get together and do some  hard bargaining to see if we can't get it resolved."  </P> <P> The White House is particularly eager to obtain an agreement before early  August, when Congress leaves for a month-long vacation, but top lawmakers  remain skeptical that a final deal can be struck that quickly.  </P> <P> Congressional aides said that differences between the Democrats, who control  Congress, and the White House have narrowed considerably but that major  disputes remain over taxes, defense spending and reform of the budget process.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, congressional Republicans expressed growing frustration over having  been excluded from the numerous behind-the-scenes talks that have been under  way recently between Administration officials and top Democratic lawmakers.  </P> <P> House Republicans already have lined up against any increase in taxes, largely  undercutting their ability to influence the details of a budget agreement. Now,  however, more-cooperative Senate Republicans are also becoming upset over the  White House tactics.  </P> <P> Bush plans to meet with the five top congressional leaders -- three Democrats  and two Republicans -- for breakfast today before flying to Philadelphia and  New York for political speeches.  </P> <P> The morning sessions are expected to continue for the rest of the week, with a  larger group of budget negotiators meeting in the afternoon to work on fleshing  out details of a deficit-reduction agreement.  </P> <P> "We are going to . . . exchange ideas and approaches," House Speaker Thomas S.  Foley (D-Wash.) said Monday. "We do not intend to make agreements outside the  summit group."  </P> <P> Bargainers already have agreed informally on the broad outlines of a  deficit-reduction plan that would cut roughly $50 billion from next year's  estimated budget gap of $169 billion.  </P> <P> According to aides, lawmakers expect to extract roughly $10 billion to $11  billion in savings from benefit programs such as Medicare, pensions and farm  subsidies; $10 billion to $12 billion from the Pentagon; $1 billion to $3  billion from nondefense programs, and $20 billion to $27 billion from higher  taxes and user fees.  </P> <P> But the budget group remains mired in disputes over which measures it should  recommend to reach those targets -- for example, whether to rely mainly on  Medicare savings to reduce the cost of benefits or to go after the politically  sacrosanct Social Security program.  </P> <P> Another key difference between the White House and Democrats centers on taxes.  Bush Administration officials have been insisting on a cut in capital gains  taxes, but so far have been unwilling to accept higher income tax rates for  upper brackets, which the Democrats are demanding as a quid pro quo.  </P> <P> One reason that both sides are pressing for an agreement is to avoid cuts of  more than $100 billion that otherwise would be mandated by the Gramm-Rudman  deficit-reduction law, if it is not changed.  </P> <P> Moreover, Congress will have to consider raising the ceiling on the national  debt before it leaves for its summer vacation in early August -- a deadline  that could prod negotiators into making enough progress to ward off crippling  amendments to the debt-limit bill.  </P> <P> Besides Foley, other lawmakers scheduled to attend the White House breakfast  sessions are House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), House Minority  Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell  (D-Me.) and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). Joining Bush from the  Administration will be White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu; Richard G.  Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady.  </P></p>

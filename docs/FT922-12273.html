			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late program buy order leaves Nikkei above 17,000 ARBITRAGE unwinding amid quiet trading depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average briefly slipped below 17,000 in the last few minutes of trading before moving back above that level on a program buy order, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 509.33 or 2.9 per cent to 17,071.36. The index opened at the day's high of 17,548.07 and reached the session's low of 16,935.67 just before the close. Volume fell to 200m shares from 300m. Foreign investors were absent due to the holidays, while domestic investors were inactive. Declines overwhelmed advances by 890 to 123, with 118 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 28.72 or 2.2 per cent weaker at 1,292.69. Selling by investment trusts and individuals was noted. Of the currently held Y3,000bn margin positions, some Y1,000bn are expected to expire this month, with the bulk due this week. Investors expect bio-technology issues, actively traded last autumn on margin, to be depressed on unwinding. Meiji Milk Products, which surged last year on development of an anti-Aids drug, dipped Y8 to Y728, and Okamoto Industries, the leading condom maker, retreated Y60 to Y1,090. Bank shares fell. Investors were discouraged by last week's comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve Board chairman, hinting that an easing of Bank of International Settlements' capital-to-asset rules was undesirable. Industrial Bank of Japan dropped Y70 to Y1,730 and Fuji Bank Y120 to Y1,310. High-technology issues declined as foreigners, who have been leading buyers recently, were absent. Hitachi shed Y9 to Y823 and Sony Y70 to Y4,120. Two chemical companies of the Mitsui group were initially sought on reports of a possible merger. However, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals was finally Y4 down at Y356 and Mitsui Petrochemical Y10 off at Y610 after announcements that they had yet to discuss specific plans. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 430.41 to 19,429.98 in volume of 6.1m shares. Turnover plunged to the lowest level since April 1958 as investors remained sidelined. Prices fell across the board, with Shimano, the bicycle maker, down Y70 to Y1,310 and Ono Pharmaceutical Y210 lower at Y5,200. Roundup MARKETS on the Pacific Rim were mixed yesterday, but Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand were closed. Bombay was shut for the second day as brokers continued their protest against increased registration fees. SEOUL was notable for a strong rally in small-capitalisation issues in response to the government's announcement that it would provide loans to help ease short-term debt. The composite index edged up 0.02 to 587.81 in turnover of Won303.95bn or 25.57m shares, against 18.43m shares in Saturday's half-day session. TAIWAN picked up in thin trade. The weighted index recovered 19.93 to 4,547.74 in turnover of TDollars 11.66bn, after TDollars 11.7bn during Saturday's half-day trading. Analysts said investors have been concerned that the three-day programme of demonstrations staged by the Democratic Progressive Party, the country's largest opposition party, may cause disruption. The demonstrations, which end today, are appealing for a popular vote in 1993 on the election of the president. Yangming Marine, which became listed yesterday, rose TDollars 1.1 to TDollars 17.1. The government has released 100m shares, 11 per cent of the state-owned group, to the public under the privatisation programme. Construction and cement shares led the day's gains. SINGAPORE closed slightly ahead in thin volume. The Straits Times Industrial index added 2.18 at 1,412.79 in volume of 23.21m shares. MANILA gained ground, mainly because of a strong performance by Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which rose 20 pesos to 880 pesos. The composite index moved up 5.42 to 1,176.22 in turnover of 172.25m pesos. Analysts said sentiment had improved following the release of a number of positive economic indicators. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index declined 3.29 to 572.46 in volume of 21.3m shares worth MDollars 55.1m, compared with 26.9m on Friday valued at MDollars 59.4m. Arab-Malaysian Finance was the most active stock with some 3.9m shares changing hands. It finished 52 cents ahead at MDollars 3.52. Genting lost 20 cents to MDollars 11.50, while Malaysian Airline System, Malayan Banking and Tanjong slipped 10 cents each to MDollars 6.80, MDollars 7.70 and MDollars 10.90 respectively. BANGKOK weakened on news that opposition parties plan to protest at the selection of the new prime minister. The SET index fell 14.04 to 808.84 in turnover of Bt4.74bn.

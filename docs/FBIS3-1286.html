The officer commanding the far  north command, Major General Faan Grobbelaar, says the step had  followed reports that people were planning to damage key points.  General Grobbelaar said that the sites to be guarded included  the Lebowa police magazine, to prevent the theft of arms and  ammunition. The government building and petrol depot would also  be guarded. Other defense force units were being deployed at  strategic places to ensure the maintenance of law and order. He  said their task was being made difficult by striking Lebowa  policemen.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: ONE BREAK AND MEXICO WILL BE READY TO BOOM  </P> <P> Amid all the news of global change these days, a story that often isn't in the  headlines could provide one of the bigger surprises of the next decade: the  coming prosperity of Mexico.  </P> <P> The talk in New York financial circles is that Mexico is the next hot country,  the rapid developer of the 1990s as were the newly industrializing countries of  Asia -- South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong -- in the 1980s.  </P> <P> "Mexico has more potential than all the other developing countries put  together," says a Wall Street investment banker, reflecting widely held  opinion. It has a disciplined labor force, able and willing workers -- and lots  more of them.  </P> <P> New York's confidence is matched in Mexico City. "We're going to have a boom,"  says John Rhoads, a former Californian who heads CBI Casa de Bolsa, a major  investment house in Mexico City. Mexico's economic growth, based on the  predictions of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, could speed up to more than  7% a year -- from practically no growth since 1982. "We're heading into another  cycle of optimism," says Rhoads.  </P> <P> But "another cycle" are the operative words there. Mexico has boomed before,  especially in the 1970s after major new oil discoveries. And it has gone bust  before -- severely in this decade, when living standards have been cut in half.  </P> <P> So how much of today's confidence reflects reality? And why should Americans  care, when they have their own troubles with far larger economies in Japan and  Europe?  </P> <P> Americans should care because a neighboring country of 85 million people holds  enormous implications for the United States. First, it's a great customer. In  1981, before its economy declined, Mexico took $20 billion of U.S. exports --  as much as Japan that year. Last year, even with a stagnant economy, Mexico  took $23 billion of U.S. goods, far more than any of the smaller Asian nations,  and 75% of what Japan bought. Real development in Mexico would provide a big  and growing market for U.S. industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> History of Investment  </P> <P> Also its development would provide opportunity for investment -- and put to  useful purpose some of the billions now rocketing around the global money  markets.  </P> <P> Mexico has a long history of foreign investment. First it brought in too much,  from Britain and America during the 19th-Century regime of Porfirio Diaz. The  money led eventually to revolution and a reaction against foreign ownership  that was capped by the seizure of U.S.-owned oil properties in 1938.  </P> <P> Now, 50 years later, policies against foreign investment are being relaxed by  the Salinas government, which recently announced limited openings for foreign  ownership. Ultimately, Salinas -- who stresses the fact that his two sons are  studying the Japanese language -- wants to attract sizable foreign investments.  </P> <P> They will be needed, among other things, to help expand and modernize the  telephone system. D. A. Campbell Inc., a Los Angeles investment company that  specializes in Mexican securities, estimates that Telefonos Mexicanos, the  national telephone company, will have to increase its current $1-billion annual  capital investment by 10% a year in the next decade just to keep up with  expanding demand. Yet despite such needs, TelMex stock has been rising in both  Mexican and U.S. trading because it is seen as a symbol of the country's  potential.  </P> <P> So far, however, confidence in that potential is more political than economic,  resting largely on the performance of the Salinas government. Salinas, who is  only 40 years old, won the Mexican election last year with a narrow majority,  because powerful unions -- particularly the corrupt oil workers union -- swung  their votes to another candidate. Derided as "the mouse" by political  commentators in Mexico City, Salinas took office amid expectations that he  would be too weak to rule.  </P> <P> But he turned apparent weakness into strength. He used the oil workers  defection from Mexico's ruling party as a weapon against them, moving boldly to  arrest the head of the union. Other moves followed, asserting presidential  authority over labor and business.  </P> <P> Yet still, the Mexican economy is growing at a rate of less than 1% a year and  Mexican business, to say nothing of foreigners, are reluctant to invest. At  least $25 billion of Mexican capital remains outside the country.  </P> <P> What's the economy waiting for? It's waiting for some sign of success in June  as Mexico once again renegotiates terms of more than $50 billion of its foreign  debt with international banks. It has had such negotiations every year since  1982.  </P> <P> This year, however, is different. This year, Mexico's request for debt  reduction -- for the opportunity to give the banks long-term bonds in exchange  for its loans -- has the backing of the U.S. Treasury, which has announced a  policy favoring debt reduction. Success in the negotiations could reduce  Mexico's interest payments by $3 billion a year and, more important, attract  back Mexican capital and new foreign capital.  </P> <P> "In the next month must come the solution," said Mexico's leading newspaper  Excelsior Monday. If it does, confidence in Mexico will be more than just talk.  </P></p>

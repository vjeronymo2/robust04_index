			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (5): Shock of a shake-up - The impact of social reforms IT IS just over a year since Mr Jim Bolger's newly-elected National government launched a calculated Blitzkrieg against New Zealand's health, education and industrial relations establishments. Determined to extend the outgoing Labour government's 'Rogernomics' to the labour market and welfare state, Mr Bolger and his colleagues knew they had to move decisively in year one before the trimming inevitable in the run-up to next year's election stopped reform dead in its tracks. The Employment Contracts Act (ECA) is the most ambitious component of the package, cutting a swathe through half a century and more of industrial relations policy. Gone, in one fell swoop, is the closed shop which held sway over large chunks of (mainly blue-collar) industry, and with it national, occupation-based, union-negotiated awards which are still the norm in Australia. The act swept away the special negotiating rights and privileges of trade unions, allowed employers to insist on individual or enterprise-wide contracts in place of the former collective contracts, and limited the role of the courts in employment disputes. These changes, largely drawn from plans formulated in the late 1980s by the influential Business Roundtable, have had most impact on the unionised 40 per cent of the workforce. But there have been significant knock-on effects for the country's managers. 'General managers now have to manage the most important aspects of their business - pay and conditions,' claims Mr Alan Jones, industrial relations director at Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's largest conglomerate. 'It's been a shock for many of them - but it's about time,' he adds. For Campbell Tubes, a small car components manufacturer in Thames, near Auckland, the ECA has meant a zero pay increase this year, greater managerial flexibility in deploying staff, and an end to the old regime of time-and-a-half for the first three hours of overtime and double time thereafter. But only after a week-long stoppage before the Engineers' Union would sanction the new single-company contract. The union sent its national officials down to Thames to consult the staff and negotiate the deal - the first time the company can recall seeing them in Thames. It has been a similar picture throughout unionised industry, with tourist-related concerns the biggest gainers. New Zealand's business elite is convinced the ECA has given the country an edge over 'sleepy' Australia, for whom an equivalent of the ECA is still but a gleam in opposition leader Dr John Hewson's eye. But it is early days, and as yet concrete examples of investment diverted are hard to find. Predictably, the Council of Trade Unions cries foul play. But the transition has proved fairly smooth in most of the private sector, which was anyway in the throes of radical restructuring in reaction to the 'Rogernomics' and economic slowdown of the 1980s. Mr Ken Douglas, the council's president, claims that wages have been screwed down. But with inflation at 2 per cent and declining, and the economy still weak after a decade of low growth, it might more accurately be described as an end to the 'cost plus' mentality. However, in the public sector the transition has been far from painless. In particular, the government's termination of collective contracts for teachers has led to strikes and virulent protest. Teacher unions see the move as an integral part of ministerial designs to shift all state funding, and with it control of teachers' pay and conditions, down to schools. This is undeniably the government's objective. Dr Lockwood Smith, the education minister, is piloting complete devolution of funding to the 'trustees' (elected governors) of 60 schools, and before even assessing the pilot has shifted funding of all senior staff to schools. Dr Smith speaks approvingly of England's grant-maintained schools, and wants to create similar 'private schools without fees' in New Zealand. Health reform is driven by the same desire - and UK models - for separating 'purchasers' from 'providers' and evicting politicians from the detail of public sector management. The country's 14 integrated area health boards are being replaced by four appointed regional health authorities which will buy services from between 20 and 25 'Crown Health Enterprises', each of which will run a general hospital plus a range of ancillary services. Unlike Britain, the model is not to be extended to primary providers, but in New Zealand they were only ever partially absorbed into the 'free' national system, and the government has contented itself with removing entirely the subsidy paid for visits to GPs by above-average income earners. They must now pay the full cost - averaging around NZDollars 30 (Pounds 9) - for such visits. Gone, too, are most remaining universal welfare benefits, including a significant reduction in payments to pensioners. Most controversial, though, are new part-charges for hospital visits, introduced earlier this year. Labour and leading health practitioners say this is the first step towards fully privatised health care. Mr Simon Upton, the health minister, vigorously refutes such claims. 'Our agenda is simple: to cope with the fact that we are a heavily indebted country that will have to contain spending to survive,' he says. The charges will extend to only 20 per cent of users - but now the charging structure is in place, they can easily be extended downwards, say the critics. To an outsider, the welfare reforms look positively revolutionary. But Mr Upton insists: 'The only significant political debate in New Zealand is whether governments of whatever party will be able to resist calls for a social dividend from growth.' For the government, debt reduction must have first call; doctors, teachers and union leaders have other ideas.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Hyundai strikers go back to work The threat of widespread industrial action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, appeared to recede yesterday, raising hopes that the country will not be convulsed by labour strife this year, writes John Burton in Seoul. Workers at Hyundai Precision, a container and jeep manufacturer, who initiated labour action within the giant industrial group on June 5, agreed to return to work after they gained concessions on job conditions following the mediation of the labour minister, Mr Rhee In-je. Daewoo also faces industrial action, but the government hopes that resolution of the Hyundai disputes will persuade Daewoo workers to drop their proposed action.</p>

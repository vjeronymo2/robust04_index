			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The first hint of the political cataclysm brought on  by these elections comes from an examination of the accompanying  table. It highlights the differences between the 1989-94  legislature and the one that will sit from 1994 to 1999.  Although a few details remain to be worked out concerning  proportional representation and the inclusion of other  minigroups or personalities, the character of the new congress  can now be discerned. A reader offended by the way the table  treats one group or another may safely change some names. This,  it seems to me, will do little harm since, from a structural  standpoint, the results will remain the same. The congress will  still be made up of four major blocks. The largest will hold 30  percent of the seats and the others around 20 percent each.    This means that for the time being it will take an agreement  among at least three blocks to get a quorum in the Chamber of  Deputies. The MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] block becomes  decisive. To gain a quorum or develop any sort of legislative  program, the other two coalitions will have to court MAS and win  it over. This situation resembles the previous session in both  the Chamber and the Senate with one very important exception.  Before, only one group needed the socialists, and the  socialists, for their part, were in competition with New  Democratic Generation [NGD]. In practice this resulted in a  dominant coalition made up of AD and the group led by Wladimir  Gessen, who has now retired to the practice of psychology. For  its part, COPEI's [Social Christian Party] alliance with MAS  could not proceed on its own. COPEI had to seek more support  elsewhere, and help was hard to come by. This meant the congress  tended to follow the lead of AD with support from NGD.    By contrast, in the new Senate, if the two largest groups  act  as a block, they will not have to look to a third group for  support. If this happens, then the block composed of the next  two largest groups will be obliged to seek support from a third  group. In addition, as the table shows, a three-way accord among  Convergence, Causa R, and MAS will not produce a majority. It is  possible to speculate about other combinations, too, but the  point remains that agreements will be hard to reach and  maintaining a smooth flow of legislative business in the new  session will not be easy.    This outlook, although it may seem a bit alarming, is also  rather static. We are assuming there will be no breaking of  ranks within the parties that have won seats. However, there are  reasons to believe this is not very likely. Take COPEI, for  example. It will be under pressure from Convergence, and some of  its followers may decide to leave the fold rather than oppose a  "social christian" government headed by the founder of their own  party. However, this is a two-way street. In the long run, COPEI  could pick up defectors from Convergence as some lawmakers grow  disenchanted with the government or find other reasons to shift  allegiances. Causa R has undergone explosive growth, and it  remains to be seen if new members assimilate and toe the line.  Experience indicates that this sort of movement that sweeps into  existence with no clear ideology is prone to division. Given the  likelihood of a fluid situation, the party with the most to gain  is clearly AD since it is less susceptible to erosion either  from within or without. Stability gives AD lots of resources and  plenty of bargaining chips.    But that is not all. A new factor that must be considered is  that half the members of the new Chamber represent single-member  districts, and this poses a threat to parliamentary cohesion.  Representatives of single-member districts regard themselves as  first-class lawmakers who won office on their own merits and by  forging personal ties to those who elected them. This gives them  a great deal of liberty in the face of pressure to toe the party  line.    All these factors presage a Congress that is highly  unpredictable and hard to rule. Paradoxically, however, this  could offer a way out of some of the problems of governing and  legislative relations that are bound to arise in the coming  year. Despite the prospect of some ugly spectacles, there is  reason to hope that defection, restructuring, and realignment  will combine to produce a pro-government alliance or an  opposition open to constructive agreement on certain basic  issues. There is, however, another scenario to be considered.  The president-elect has reserves of prestige, ability, and  tenacity that transcend the election results. Intensive use of  this political capital could put Congress on the defensive in  the eyes of public opinion and force the creation of blocks and  coalitions that seem unimaginable at present. Or the president  could use his political capital to promote constitutional  reforms and press for the innovations of which he seems fondest.  These include referendums and the possibility of being able to  dissolve legislatures. Changes such as these would alter  completely the picture painted here. For a task of such  magnitude, the first months of the new administration will be  decisive.    For any of these developments to take place, there will have  to be an arduous process of negotiations of all sorts. The costs  of these transactions will, as the economists say, be enormous.  It would be nice if the president had at his side someone like  Richelieu to keep him from being consumed by such an engrossing  task. The president badly needs someone who would let him  concentrate on problem-solving and substantive matters of  policy. However, he has no such partner anywhere in sight.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chamber of Deputies                                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Party                    |1989-94                  |1994-99                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |AD                       |97(48.3%)                |44(23.%)                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |COPEI                    |67(33.3%)                |49(25.9%)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MAS                      |18(9%)                   |14(7.1%)                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Convergence              |0                        |43(22.8%)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Causa R                  |0                        |14(7.4%)                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others                   |19(9.5%)                 |0                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                    |201                      |189                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Senate                   |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |AD                       |23(48%)                  |13(27.7%)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |COPEI                    |20(41.8%)                |12(25.5%)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MAS                      |3(6.3%)                  |3(6.4%)                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Convergence              |0                        |11(23.4%)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Causa R                  |0                        |8(17%)                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other                    |2(4.17%)                 |0                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                    |48                       |47                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

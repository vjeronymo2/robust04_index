			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The wool market this week inclined easier again, but there was variation between categories. Fine Merinos opened steadily, then prices fell away, leaving the 19 micron indicator at 1463 cents, compared with 1541 a week ago and a recent peak of 1620. The overall Eastern states market indicator closed at 739, compared with 756 a week before and a recent peak of 835c/kg. New Zealand and South African sales showed a roughly similar pattern. The market setback is seen as providing a buying opportunity for those with longer term needs to cover, but little new business appears to have been attracted so far. Uncertainties related to the wider world economic situation play a part in buyers' caution.</p>

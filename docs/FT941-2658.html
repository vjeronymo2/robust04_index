			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysian affair - insensitivity and mistaken beliefs (5) Sir, Aside from his personal attacks on Andrew Neil and his cri-de-coeur of a 'northern' bias against non-whites, Dr Mahathir's now famous letter does point out that Britain's soft loans and aid-trade provisions are only marginally more attractive than others available to Third World rulers. How useful. The implication is clear. Regardless of the innate appropriateness of projects, on financial, environmental or social grounds, the north continues to sell emerging economies a bill of goods, which are primarily in the north's financial self-interest. Should the soft financing be particularly attractive and possibly allow leeway for front-end overrides, payable to recipient country decision-makers, even totally inappropriate projects have a greater chance of acceptance. Through Gatt, the OECD, the EU and the multilateral agencies, greater monitoring and disciplines are needed, to ensure that a level playing field is created for only truly viable projects to proceed. Should dams silt up before debt servicing is complete, it is generally from the hide of a nation's poorest citizens that final debt servicing is provided. In such an environment, world business leaders must know that follow-up contracts become less likely.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F> Bossi by Giovanni Cerruti in Rome; date not given: "I Could  Even Vote Against Them"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cerruti] Honorable Bossi,  what are you doing? Are you shouting orders at the Berlusconi  government, are you making the first step toward a break, or are  you announcing that the League has outside backing?    [Bossi] None of these. It is a pause. A pause for reflection  that we are conceding to Berlusconi, and also to the country.    [Cerruti] To the country?    [Bossi] Perhaps people have not understood well. I agree  that the desire for a stable government prevails. However, it  is necessary to consider that this Berlusconi does not have a  party behind him, but a band to fill the void. He cannot  provide any guarantee of democracy, other than his three damn  guarantors....    [Cerruti] It may also be a pause, but it has the tone of a  clash. Is this all because of the "no" to the Viminale  [Interior Ministry]?    [Bossi] It is not just the Viminale. In the meantime that  man [Berlusconi] goes around hand in glove with AN [National  Alliance]; not only does he not want to give us the Viminale,  they also want to palm us off with the stuff they do not want.  We are federalists, we have been fighting for the distribution  of power for a lifetime, and that man wants to keep it all for  himself: interior, foreign policy, treasury, justice, post  office.... Who is he, Nembo Kid?    [Cerruti] He is Berlusconi.    [Bossi] Then he should start to respect the rules of  democracy. He cannot summon the first political force  represented in parliament and say: Here you are, take these  less powerful ministries... Ooohhh! What does he think? When I  got up he tried to make me stay, but I hope that he has  understood one thing; the ideals of the League, starting with  federalism, are not for sale.    [Cerruti] Are his members of parliament also asking that  this  government be formed?    [Bossi] I do not know, if it will be his personal  government... He could even invoke Article 92 [of the  Constitution] and go to the president of the republic, and then  present himself in parliament and we will see.    [Cerruti] What will we see?    [Bossi] We will see if a coalition government with the  political participation of the League can be set up.    [Cerruti] In this way we return to the obstacle of the  Viminale and we are at the beginning again...    [Bossi] He would make us a present of three-quarters of the  less powerful ministries rather than give it to us. All sorts  of stories have been invented...    [Cerruti] What sort of stories?    [Bossi] [AN leader] Fini's sort. He says that we are from  the North, and that we are unable to understand the problems of  organized crime, the Mafia, and the South, and that we could not  be relied upon. Just think, I have to get somebody from  National Alliance, which is 85 percent Italian Social Movement,  to give me a license to say that I am reliable!    [Cerruti] Today you are meeting the members of parliament  from your party, tomorrow you should see Berlusconi and Fini  again; it is said that the new prime minister could already make  his debut in the Senate coming Tuesday [10 May]    [Bossi] What a rush. Let us wait until tomorrow's meeting.    [Cerruti] Will it be decisive?    [Bossi] It could be. However, I must make it clear that the  League wants to be in the government to interfere, to control an  autocrat who moves without even having a party, and who wants to  put all his men into the board of directors of the Italian  system. Heh! Wake up! The autocrat is extremely dangerous.    [Cerruti] And this is why you decided to suspend the  meetings?    [Bossi] This is our resistance, and it will become much  stronger, because we know the dangers that lie ahead of us.  That man has put four of our ideas together, and put them on  his television, thanks to the lack of regulations governing  television. He took the votes, and now he wants to take the  whole country.    [Cerruti] Honorable Bossi, is the Viminale still the last  trench?    [Bossi] Yes, for that which comes under the Viminale, and I  am referring most of all to the local authorities.    [Cerruti] Is there any condition under which you would cede  it?    [Bossi] None. We want to be seen and to be decisive. We  want to be the guarantors of democracy against the autocrat, and  our resistance will continue.</p>

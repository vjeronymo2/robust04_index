			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / London Motor Conference: Threat to parts makers identified MOTOR component makers were warned yesterday that Germany could soon start to close a unique 'window of opportunity' for them to lead Europe in quality and productivity. The opportunity had been created by the presence in Britain of three Japanese car plants. The Nissan, Toyota and Honda plants had already created a quality and productivity 'revolution' in the UK industry, Professor Daniel Jones of Cardiff Business School told the Financial Times London Motor Conference. The three plants are expected to be producing a combined total of at least 600,000 cars a year by the late 1990s. But German vehicle and parts makers, facing a collapsing domestic market and soaring costs, had begun rapidly to adopt Japanese methods of 'lean' manufacturing and to attain 'world-class' quality and productivity standards. He said: 'The Germans have lapped up the message with alacrity, but the effects have yet to be become visible. The UK has a head start which has got to be used.' Prof Jones is a member of a team that recently studied Japanese and UK component suppliers. It concluded that the best Japanese component plants had twice the productivity and 100-times-better quality than other mainly UK suppliers that it examined. German component companies 'are already slashing domestic prices dramatically in order to protect their market', Prof Garel Rhys, who holds the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chair of motor industry economics, told the conference. The Germans were seeking to respond to what Prof Rhys calculated was a price advantage for a revitalised UK component industry of up to 30 per cent helped by sterling's devaluation last year. Prof Rhys warned that European car prices were set to be driven down in real terms by Japanese carmakers on their way to a possible 30 per cent share of the European market . An average employee needed to work 15 weeks to buy an average saloon in Japan, 21 weeks in the US, but 27 weeks in Europe. As a result 'the next decade will see a degree of competition in Europe the like of which has not been seen since the late 1920s and early 1930s'. This would lead to further restructuring of the European industry in which UK-based carmakers would have a significant role as a result of Japanese plants in Britain and increased efficiency. UK car output by the year 2000 could be as high as 2.8m, he predicted, compared with 1.3m last year.</p>

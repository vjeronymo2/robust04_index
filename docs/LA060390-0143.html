			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRACTICAL MIND: EASING THE ACHE GAY MEN RECOVERING FROM COMPULSIVE  BEHAVIORS BY DAVID CRAWFORD (E. P. DUTTON: $18.95)  </P> <P> David Crawford (a pseudonym, as are all the names in this slim, anguished work)  sits at the intersection of his homosexuality and his alcoholism, and writes  specifically for gay men who fight compulsive behaviors, from too much drink  to, in this era of AIDS, too much careless sex. He began fighting his addiction  to liquor in the traditional Twelve Steps program of Alcoholics Anonymous, and,  while he was successful, he came to realize that gay men often felt constrained  in heterosexual AA groups.  </P> <P> Crawford's book is an effort to translate what he learned into a gay vernacular  in hopes of reaching readers who felt they couldn't tell the truth in AA, or  who found, like Crawford, that they were reluctant even to identify the sex of  the person they lived with. Sadly, much of what he writes is in the  misery-loves-company/true-confessions vein. He can paint a vivid scene and  describe in painful detail the various dents to one's self-esteem that lead to  addictive behavior, as well as the difficult crawl back up. But his advice is  terribly dilute by comparison, full of therapeutic platitudes. Although his  experience and his desire to heal seem genuine, what he offers -- his talk of  spiritual victory -- does not seem enough to sustain a beaten soul. Would that  it could -- but even his description of his brother's death from AIDS, and what  he learned about the process of "softening and severing" ties, seems a helping  hand held just out of reach.  </P></p>

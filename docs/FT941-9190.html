			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Recruitment: As much back to the future as basics - Wanted, a change of focus for recruitment advertising as the recession comes to an end What makes a good job advertisement? This question stems not just from a voguish desire to get back to basics but is prompted by the mission set for this column by my predecessor: to ensure that society's most important jobs are filled by the people best able to do them. Some guidance might be gleaned from the two premier UK recruitment advertisement awards currently bestowing laurels on the best of last year's efforts. The British Recruitment Advertising awards run by The Independent and Personnel Today were held three weeks ago at a gala evening in Grosvenor House, London. The rival Recruitment Industry Awards, given jointly by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Institute of Personnel Management are about to be judged ahead of the awards ceremony in April. In the most recent crop Austin Knight UK, the recruitment advertising, consulting and communications company, scooped the Advertisement of the Year for its London Fire Brigade contribution. The advertisement aimed at graduates and school leavers featured 'an ad within an ad' as if someone had torn a vacancy from a newspaper and placed it on a blank page. It said: 'Pounds 56K salary, generous leave, car loan scheme, retirement at 55, excellent pension.' At the foot of the otherwise blank page a statement read: 'We haven't mentioned the bit about saving lives.' The real information came underneath, mentioning three salary tiers and reminding prospective applicants that they were looking at a career with 'serious senior management' potential. To give the gist, it said: 'That fifty six thousand is what you'd earn as an Assistant Chief Fire Officer: take away 'assistant' and you're looking at another Pounds 20K at least.' Then came the news that there were no short cuts or soft options for graduates who would start as a firefighter on a basic of Pounds 15,000. The other 16 categories were dominated by Macmillan Davies, the recruitment consultancy and advertising agency that was recently taken over by Omnicom, the US communications group. Macmillan Davies collected six awards and 15 commendations, including the best campaign award for a series of advertisements for Norwich Union. They depicted teams in tug-of-war, rowing and climbing, all pulling together in the same direction. A more mundane Norwich Union vacancy in these pages last week, looking for an economist, still managed to stand out even though it was no more than average sized. It was the only one that was not framed in a lined-box. Another omission was the salary. The only figure quoted was the Pounds 30bn and more that the Norwich controls in managed funds. The debate about whether or not to include salaries continues to tax recruiters. Richard Goldie, managing director of Macmillan Davies, says that conventional wisdom holds that it is best to state the salary but employers are sometimes chary about flagging up internal comparisons. 'If you know the salary is competitive, I think it's best to state it,' he says. A compromise could be to include a salary range or possibly an overall package figure to give some scope for negotiation or the provision of a 'cafeteria' choice of reward. A recurring grumble at the IPM Compensation Forum's annual conference in London recently was about the lack of imagination in reward systems. Other than the standard salary with perhaps a performance related bonus and a car, there is often little to differentiate one form of benefits package from another. The cafeteria idea is to provide an overall figure against a list of benefits to allow scope for bespoke tailoring of the salary package fitted to individual preferences. Optional benefits might include medical insurance, added pension contributions, child allowances or flexible hours. The challenge to become more imaginative in reward packages and advertisements will grow as the recruitment market becomes more competitive. Awards judges are still looking for creativity within limited budgets. One of the simplest but most effective advertisements in the BRA awards was in the black and white category won by the J Walter Thompson agency. The ad, seeking a pianist to play in an RAF band, used a logo of a fighter jet with a music note as its wheel and undercarriage. Good pianists are rare commodities but with some posts it might not pay to be too clever. Tim Gibbon, UK chief executive of Austin Knight and chairman of the IPA/IPM awards panel, believes that one effect of the recession has been to suppress creativity in recruitment advertisements. When the most ordinary advertisement and basic job description is likely to attract 200 applicants, he argues, it can be counter productive to entice thousands of applicants that cost time and money to process. Gibbon says: 'One of the challenges in a recession is to create ads to reduce the number of replies because the response management side has become a problem for our customers.' While advertisers concede that the number of appointments is growing again, there is still a limited budget for recruitment. A recruiter would expect to spend between 5 and 10 per cent of the salary level on the vacancy advertisement and would rarely book a repeat slot. 'It's not like selling a can of beans,' says Gibbon. 'Every job is different. You are looking for the unique selling point that will prompt a person to apply. It is often not the salary. It might be the challenge. If you can say with a technical job, for example, that the company is offering opportunities at the leading edge of technology, people will want to work there.' He believes the most important aspect of the recruitment advertisement is to answer the question 'What's in it for me?' from the applicant. 'The idea is to become tougher on the specifications. Take out the preferables and the probables,' says Gibbon, but not without subtlety. 'One of the problems with 'Only the best will do' ads is that everybody wants to pick up on the challenge.' Bold, direct messages have become fashionable. One of the award winning Norwich Union advertisements stated: 'The difference between Norwich Union and others is simple: It's much harder to work for Norwich Union.' The intention, says Goldie, was to be arrogant and aggressive. 'The theme was that you had to be to be good enough to work for Norwich Union. The idea was that by saying the Norwich job was harder to do you would be attracting the people who think they are the best and most ambitious.' The technique, called employee branding, adopts the same principles used in creating product brand consciousness among customers. It creates a certain employer status, in people's perception at least, and theoretically has a broader impact on customers generally. The advertisement is thus performing a dual function by appealing to job seekers and by creating a general brand image. In this case, that the Norwich is for toughies. The items in some newspapers last week about CV bloomers collected by Accountemps, the Birmingham-based financial recruitment consultants, made me wonder whether anyone has ever spotted any glaring mistakes on CVs attached to the top jobs. The Accountemps collection included the candidate who wrote that she had 'terminated herself' and one who listed among his skills 'Excellent memory, strong mathematical aptitude, excellent memory'. Does anyone have any similar gems? A final thought. Prospective Norwich Union job applicants might want to list a few sports in their CVs. What about tug-of-war, mountaineering and rowing?</p>

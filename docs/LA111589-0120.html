			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO WEIGH PRESERVE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Proponents of a plan to develop the rural landscape of Talega Valley into the  area's next planned community are requesting that city and county officials be  given a minority voice in a committee that would oversee a proposed 1,175-acre  nature preserve in the project.  </P> <P> The request by Santa Margarita Co. officials to change the wording of the  conservancy management plan will be considered at 7 tonight by the City  Council.  </P> <P> Because 1,000 acres of the conservancy lie in county territory on Rancho  Mission Viejo and 175 acres are in city territory, the landowners have said  they oppose each entity having a one-third representation on the management  board, according to a report from city planner James R. Barnes.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita Co. officials have said they would like to retain a majority  voice on the conservancy management board for 1,000 acres in county territory  and dedicate to the city its 175-acre portion of the preserve.  </P> <P> Planned are 5,000 homes as well as commercial centers, hotels and two 18-hole  golf courses. It is located off the east end of Avenida Pico. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

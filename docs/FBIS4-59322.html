			<p>BFN     [Text] Staff Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir, the defense  minister, affirmed that the retreat of the forces of the  al-Ahmar ruling gang and the heavy losses inflicted on them was  a logical and natural result, because their soldiers are waging  this war against their own will, and they do not realize for  which goals they are fighting except defending the interests of  the tyrant lackey family. That is why they are fighting with low  morale and later they join their brothers in the broad popular  base which defends the unity, democracy, and the convention  document.    This was mentioned in the important press talk which was  given by him [the defense minister] to SAWT AL-UMMAL in its  issue tomorrow. He indicated that the number of casualties among  the Armed Forces defending the unity and democracy is incredibly  few.    He indicated to the reports by the mass media about tens of  victims of children, elderlies and women, who were attacked by  missiles and rockets in their houses as the result of random  shelling of peaceful towns and villages and residential  apartments by the al-Ahmar ruling gang. The defense minister  added that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] does not boast of  victory in this war, which was forced on our people and homeland  by the al-Ahmar gang in a desperate attempt to hold on to power  and control the wealth of our people. He affirmed that the  national base is broadening daily and our people are determined  to continue to repel the gangs of this adventurous family until  the great victory is achieved.    The defense minister added that the YSP had dealt with the  merger of the Armed Forces with the sincere intention to build  the Yemeni Armed Forces, which stabilize the unity. The defense  minister affirmed that the YSP did not bother about the  positioning of military units which were deployed from the  southern part to the northern part and vice versa, on the eve of  22 May 1990, because the party had the national responsibility  towards the homeland which it hoped to share with the People's  General Congress.    He added that the subsequent days and circumstances proved  that the executive leadership of the al-Ahmar gang had deployed  their forces in accordance with intentions to ignite war and  control the southern governorates by force, which is not  acceptable. The defence minister appreciated the heroes of the  Armed Forces and the Yemeni people, who are defending the unity  of the people and the homeland.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: IRS RULES MURKY ON OPTIONS SALES  </P> <P> QUESTION: You recently discussed how the Internal Revenue Service depends on  Form 1099 reports from stockbrokers to keep track of stock sales by taxpayers.  My broker does file those forms for my stock sales, but he does not report my  dealings in stock options. Does this mean that the IRS has no record of these  trades? -- G. B.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Yes, so it would appear. But just because the IRS doesn't require  brokers to report options trades, this doesn't relieve you of your  responsibility to report these transactions on your income tax return.  </P> <P> According to our experts, the issue you raise is one of the many murky areas --  one Wall Street attorney called it a "quirky quagmire" -- in the tax codes that  has defied all attempts at clarification. And until the IRS issues new  guidelines, most brokerage houses are not reporting stock option sales.  </P> <P> Here's some background: Internal Revenue Code Section 60.45 and accompanying  regulations 1.6045-1(a) 9, do not include options among the types of assets  whose sale must be reported to the IRS. The reason, brokers say, is that the  IRS recognizes that it is often next to impossible to isolate the profits and  losses generated by a single options trade since it is often made as part of  another transaction.  </P> <P> Further, since all reporting is now handled by computer, any reporting system  would require an easily completed form. The problem is that such a form would  probably not accommodate the complex transactions that option sales usually  involve.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to come up with workable reporting systems," says one  securities attorney. But another attorney jokes: "The IRS is smart enough to  know that no one ever really makes any money on options."  </P> <P> The IRS says only that its current regulations do not cover option trades and  that, while it is always possible that the agency will issue new regulations,  no revisions in this area are in the works.  </P> <P> Q: I think I have lost two Series EE bonds. How do I find out for sure? Can  they be replaced? -- J. C. C.  </P> <P> A: Your local branch of the Federal Reserve Bank can help you. The tracing  service, which covers all Series E, EE and HH bonds, is free and takes about a  month.  </P> <P> The process is easiest if you have the serial numbers of the bonds that you  believe are lost. You probably do not have these serial numbers. Don't worry.  Help is still available.  </P> <P> You must provide the name and address of the bondholder, the Social Security  number under which the bonds are held, the denomination of the bonds and, if  possible, the month and year of their issuance. Researchers will trace the  bonds by the Social Security number of the holder and provide you with the  serial numbers of the bonds that have already been redeemed and those still  outstanding. You may also ask for photocopies of all bonds issued to you.  </P> <P> To get duplicate bonds, ask your local Federal Reserve Bank for a "lost bond  claim" form. Complete it and return it to the enclosed address. You will  shortly receive a duplicate.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the Federal Reserve Bank is located at 950 S. Grand Ave.  Address all correspondence to the bank to P.O. Box 2077, Terminal Annex, Los  Angeles, Calif. 90051. Savings bond inquires should be directed to the  "savings" office.  </P> <P> Q: I am 56 years old and am taking early retirement from my job. If I receive a  lump-sum distribution from my pension plan and immediately roll it over into an  individual retirement account, may I immediately begin drawing an annual  disbursement without penalty, just as if I were age 59 1/2? -- W. C.  </P> <P> A: Yes, you may. The Internal Revenue Service will waive the 10% early  withdrawal penalty from IRAs under one circumstance: The amount of the  disbursements you take must be calculated according to the life expectancy  tables for your age -- 56 in your case -- not that of a 59 1/2-year-old, the  age at which withdrawals are otherwise allowed to begin.  </P> <P> According to the latest tables, the life expectancy of a 56-year-old person is  27.7 years; for a 59 1/2-year-old, it's 25 years. To calculate your annual  disbursement, divide the total balance in all of your IRA accounts by your life  expectancy -- or, if you want, your life expectancy and that of the  beneficiary, or beneficiaries, of your IRA accounts. Once you reach age 59 1/2,  you may withdraw more funds from your IRA accounts without penalty -- but never  less than the life expectancy amount.  </P> <P> Q: I was forced to close my 10-year-old dry cleaning and Laundromat business  because the building where I was renting was severely damaged during the  October, 1987, earthquake in Los Angeles. The building is still uninhabitable,  but it may eventually be brought up to code. My equipment was not damaged by  the quake, but best estimates are that the boiler will not function after such  a long period of non-use. The rest of my equipment is so old that it has no  sale value. I have virtually abandoned my business and have had to find other  employment. Is there anything I can do on my taxes? -- J. T. W.  </P> <P> A: Our experts studied the facts you provided and concluded that you have  little, if any, recourse with the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> To begin with, your ability to deduct losses stemming from the earthquake is  limited to any actual physical losses you suffered, such as damaged or  destroyed equipment. And your deductions are further limited by the extent to  which you have already depreciated this equipment. By your own account, the  equipment was not actually damaged. Further, even it it had been damaged, given  its age, you may already have fully depreciated it.  </P> <P> You might think that you would be allowed to claim the loss of the "goodwill"  -- the value of a business above and beyond its actual assets -- that your  business built up over the years. However, unless you bought the business from  someone else and actually paid for this goodwill, the IRS does not recognize it  as an asset that can be damaged.  </P> <P> By the way, if you did have deductable losses, the time to claim them was last  year. Now you would have to file an amended return for 1987, the year in which  the earthquake occurred.  </P> <P> Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this  column to financial questions of general interest.

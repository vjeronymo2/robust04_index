			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Shuffle shilly-shally The conundrum of the moment is not whether or when Mr John Major will reshuffle his cabinet, but whether he dares to do so. For any change that the prime minister makes will upset one or another faction of the Conservative party. Instead of restoring his authority, it might leave him in an even more precarious position. Mr Major managed to avoid this danger when he appointed the inoffensive Mr Peter Brooke to replace Mr David Mellor as secretary for the national heritage. But that was a one-off. There are few Peter Brooke clones, and not one of them is as able as the original. The prime minister tried hard to keep Mr Mellor - partly, perhaps, out of an understandable fear that any move he made could set off an explosion within what has become an extremely volatile party. The same logic suggests a bias in favour of continuity now. Yet the forces that favour change are strong. Slapping ministers around is the way prime ministers assert themselves. Some incumbents, notably the chancellor, should be moved elsewhere. Those are two positive reasons for encouraging a reshuffle. There is also a reason for not doing so: that the right, having tasted blood in parliamentary battles over the past six weeks, now seeks to demonstrate its strength by telling Mr Major how to construct his cabinet. None of these arguments is conclusive. A reshuffle does not always have the desired effect on public opinion, as the late Harold Macmillan discovered when he sacked seven ministers in July 1962. That midsummer 'night of the long knives' was widely regarded as an act of panic. It was one of the events that led to Macmillan's downfall 15 months later. Then again putting a new chancellor in would not itself restore confidence. Much would depend on who was chosen. Mr Major's difficulty is that the party has as much to say about that as he does, and it may reject his first choice. As to the ambitions of the impertinent right, there is little to be done even if the prime minister is weak enough to accede to its demands. All the right-wingers of stature are now in the House of Lords. Lady Thatcher and Lords Tebbit, Parkinson and Ridley are unavailable to the Commons. So is Lord Lawson, a right-wing conservative of a different stripe. Lord Howe, who is pro-European and not in any anti-government faction, is also trapped upstairs. It would make little difference to the unity of the Tories if all six of these noble persons were still MPs. The thrust of their common European policy when in office was at least as pro-European as the one the Tory Europhobe right is currently attempting to destabilise. Their absent heroes, and heroine, acted one way then, and speak another way now. The Single European Act gave more central power to the Brussels bureaucracy than any other instrument since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. That act was initiated, bargained for, and bulldozed through by a gang of Thatcherites under the eponymous heroine herself. Very well then, it is said, why not promote some of the remaining representatives of the right? The list of junior ministers is unconvincing. If you put the sceptical Mr John Redwood around the table at Number 10 Downing Street then why not the loyal Mr Stephen Dorrell? The cabinet itself is, we must suppose, a happy band of brothers and sisters. Messrs Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo may to various degrees harbour doubts about Mr Major's European and other policies, but none of them has resigned. They share the collective responsibility imposed by the prime minister's characteristic method of asking everyone around the table to indicate assent in advance of each important pronouncement. There is an additional argument in favour of keeping the cabinet intact, at least for the immediate future. This week Treasury ministers will speak to every backbencher in an effort to soften up the party in advance of Thursday's statement on public spending. The exercise constitutes an admission that the votes of Conservative members cannot be taken for granted by this Conservative government. The party will be asked to resist the temptation to break into factions representing one aggrieved group or another - nurses, say, or teachers. The government's hope is that it will be seen to be presenting a tough but properly thought-out economic programme to which every minister subscribes. Fanciful as this endeavour may seem, it would stand less chance of success if the Autumn Statement was followed by a reshuffle of the very cabinet which is supposed to be so united in support of it. The restoration of the government's authority depends above all on a renewal of confidence in its ability to guide the economy out of the recession. To achieve that, the prime minister must start getting some decisions right. To reshuffle or not to reshuffle is among the most important of those decisions.</p>

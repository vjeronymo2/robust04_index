			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> DATE SHAKE STAND GETS NEW OPERATOR  </P> <P> A Corona del Mar merchant has won the bidding for the Sunshine Cove date shake  stand, a landmark along Coast Highway between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Arden Flamson will take over the reins from Virginia McKinney, a Laguna Beach  woman who has managed the business for the past 16 years, said Roberto  Vellanoweth, chief of the Concession Programs Division for state parks, on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Flamson is co-owner of The Place, a Corona del Mar tavern, and Beach Access  Inc., a South Coast Plaza beachwear store. Long active in the arts and with  local charities, Flamson is currently board president of South Coast Repertory.  </P> <P> Flamson's husband, Richard, is board chairman of Security Pacific Corp., the  nation's fifth-largest bank. Until January, he was also the bank's chief  executive officer.  </P> <P> The date shake stand will be operated by Flamson's son and daughter-in-law,  Mike and Katie Flamson of Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> Flamson edged out six competitors, Vellanoweth said, noting that officials  considered factors such as previous business experience and how much rent the  bidders were willing to pay the state.  </P> <P> Flamson offered the state 18% of the first $10,000 gross per month and 18% of  the gross over $10,000. McKinney offered a package of 10% and 12%, according to  state concessions official Carlos Toirac.  </P> <P> The business averaged $126,000 a year in gross income over the past five years,  Toirac said. "We believe it could do a lot better and so, obviously, did the  bidders who bid so high," he said.  </P> <P> Vellanoweth said state officials expect Flamson to run a "top-notch" operation.  </P> <P> "I think you'll see a tremendous change in the way we're requesting this  concessionaire to operate now," he said. "And I think it's going to be a  tremendous benefit for the community."  </P> <P> Flamson received extra points for being a woman and a small-business owner,  state officials said. Since she applied for the business independently, her  husband's position was not a factor, they said.  </P> <P> McKinney, who had applied to keep the stand but later wearied of competing,  said this week that she is ready to close up shop at the end of the month, as  requested by the state. Her daughter, Teri Pollard, however, cried when she  heard the news.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it. I'm in tears," she said. "They're sitting up there in  Sacramento dictating what's going to be done down here."  </P> <P> Flamson is expected to reopen the stand in mid-June after it has been renovated  and other necessary changes are made to bring the business into conformance  with state guidelines for such concessions, including offering beachside  service. The new operation will be required to sell or rent items such as  umbrellas, suntan lotion and Frisbees, Toirac said.  </P> <P> Some things, however, will not change. Date shakes, for example, will still be  on the menu, Flamson said.  </P> <P> It's understandable, she said, that people will be sad to see McKinney leave  after all these years. However, she added, "I hope they will be just as pleased  with the service that we will give." LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

Buds Are  Swelling, Along With Coup Rumors" -- first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] The Moscow political and journalistic worlds are in  turmoil: The specter of another putsch is abroad within the  Sadovoye beltway. Our correspondent was one of the first to see  its real ghost (but is it real?). A late-night phone call got  him out of bed during the night of 17 March. The caller was....  In a nutshell, quite an influential and well-informed person  with quite a good post in a very important state structure.  Without beating around the bush he immediately asked him to  turn on the fax machine and take a look at a document. Once our  correspondent had read it, he was jolted into wakefulness, and  discussion over the phone was out of the question. In short,  that same night your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent found  himself in the office from which the fax had been sent. We  fully retain the spelling and punctuation of the document.    Confidential    Theory 1    (according to information as of 16 March 1994)    Attention! Upon the emergence of a new theory the  previous ones are discarded.    According to available information, a group of statesmen --  First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, General Staff Chief M.  Kolesnikov, and Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov -- plan to make an  attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin. V. Shumeyko, M. Poltoranin,  and B. Mikhaylov (chairman of the Russian Federation State  Committee on the Press. That is what the document says --  Editorial Office) reportedly also belong to the group. There is  information that the members of the group do not intend to  involve S. Shakhray; as one of them put it in a private  conversation, "Shakhray used to be one of our people, but now  the little creep is no longer on our side."    The overall plan of action to remove B. Yeltsin from power  is  as follows. Those listed above have already held tentative  talks with P. Grachev, V. Yerin, and S. Stepashin (defense  minister, internal affairs minister, and director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service respectively -- Editorial Office),  and by employing various arguments managed to obtain their  agreement not to take countermeasures. In addition, B.  Mikhaylov is currently trying to establish contacts with Ye.  Primakov's (director of the Foreign Intelligence Service --  Editorial Office) inner circle. A pretext for launching the  action should be an address by a prominent public figure or an  industrialist on the "Ostankino" first television channel  putting forward the initiative in question and giving as reasons  the deterioration of the president's health and his physical  inability to run the country. To substantiate the argument, a  television documentary should be shown portraying the president  as a man of poor health and a heavy drinker at that. (According  to information in the hands of the editorial office, such a  program has been prepared at a foreign television company's  studios. The instigator is Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the  Association of Commodity Producers. It is also known that law  enforcement organs have a copy of this television program.)  Then the aforementioned statesmen plan to initiate through  their allies in the State Duma the constitutional procedure of  handing provisional presidential powers over to V. Chernomyrdin  so as to hold emergency presidential elections in the country  within the next three months. The chiefs and activists of the  Russian Federation Communist Party State Duma faction are aware  of the group's plans, and Chernomyrdin's assumption of power  suits them, but they are displeased with the presence of Yu.  Luzhkov in the group.    According to available reports, the action is scheduled to  be  carried out in March, or at the latest April of this year.  Considered as a preliminary option is the imposition of a state  of emergency or some elements of it, possibly on limited  territories, under the pretext of the difficult economic  situation and the struggle against crime.    The first attempt to start the action was made 10 March --  on  that day Yu. Skokov was scheduled to make a television address  and the documentary was to be shown. V. Chernomyrdin himself  left on that day for Nizhniy Novgorod and then set out for  Finland. P. Grachev was in Germany at the time. The attempt  fell through, however, because A. Yakovlev, chief of the  "Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company, refused to  provide television airtime and advised the president's inner  circle of the intentions. Immediately afterward, a number of  those who were directly or indirectly involved in the action  left Moscow: Yu. Skokov for Germany, M. Kolesnikov for France  (he will return on 16 March). S. Stepashin was hospitalized.    According to other information, Yu. Skokov's television  address and the showing of the documentary did not take place  because the instigators of the action decided to postpone them  until a later date, doubting whether preparations for the action  were complete. A number of the instigators of the action  believe that they have not yet formulated their own ideology, so  B. Yeltsin should remain in the post of president for the time  being.    It should be noted that during that same week when the  unsuccessful attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin was made and also  during the preceding two or three weeks a whole range of  politicians, primarily those in opposition to the president,  made statements about the need for Boris Yeltsin to resign one  way or another and for early presidential elections to be held.  One argument in favor of B. Yeltsin's resignation was his  inability to function in this post in view of his state of  health. Articles in the press on this subject and analyses of  possible candidates for the post of president also began to  appear in the press.    Despite the initial failure, the group of aforementioned  statesmen have not given up their plans to depose Boris Yeltsin  by using an approximately similar plan of action. Currently,  talks are under way with R. Vyakhirev, chief of the "Gazprom"  joint-stock company, to persuade him to deliver an address  similar to the one Yu. Skokov failed to make.    Given that, it is noteworthy that P. Grachev postponed his  working visit to the Leningrad Military District, which was  scheduled for 14 March. This was done at the eleventh hour,  when airplanes with a Defense Ministry delegation and a group of  journalists had already left. The official explanation is the  need for reliable control of strategic nuclear forces in the  absence from Moscow of Supreme Commander in Chief B. Yeltsin and  Chief of General Staff M. Kolesnikov. During the afternoon of  14 March a number of staffers of the Defense Ministry press  service tried to circulate via "tame" journalists the story that  P. Grachev had stayed on in Moscow to see off B. Yeltsin when he  left for Sochi and thus to demonstrate yet again his good  relationship with the president.    Some career officers in the Defense Ministry and General  Staff regard the story regarding control of nuclear forces as  "another ridiculous claim" since in normal circumstances there  is no need for the defense minister to have constant personal  control over these troops. And in an emergency the minister  would be unable independently to issue orders to the nuclear  forces without the supreme commander in chief and the chief of  the General Staff. Moreover, P. Grachev has previously often  left Moscow during the absence of both B. Yeltsin and M.  Kolesnikov.    In late February a secret directive to limit contacts with  the press and minimize the number of events involving the  participation of representatives of the mass media was  circulated at the Defense Ministry.    There is information to the effect that on the whole the  Armed Forces leadership can be divided into two groups: Boris  Yeltsin's "loyalists," who have repeatedly expressed their  commitment to the incumbent president, including P. Grachev and  his first deputy, G. Kondratyev; and the "opposition"  represented by General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov and Deputy  Defense Minister A. Kokoshin. It is noted that in late  February-early March a member of the top brass, asked whether M.  Kolesnikov might resign, stated in an unofficial conversation  that "maybe you can speak with a greater degree of probability  about the imminent resignation of P. Grachev, and it is still  not clear which of the two (P. Grachev and M. Kolesnikov) feels  more confident."    According to available information, Deputy Defense Minister  A. Kokoshin maintains close ties with O. Soskovets; he regularly  does various services to him, his deputies, and relatives. A.  Kokoshin and O. Soskovets meet virtually twice or three times a  week.    On 15 March, from 1700 to 1800, P. Grachev met with V.  Chernomyrdin. The subject of the meeting has not been  disclosed. The very fact of its taking place has not been  publicized.    However, on 16 March P. Grachev held a press conference at  which he categorically denied rumors about the possibility of  the military coming to power. P. Grachev stressed that, so long  as he is defense minister, "there will be no military  dictatorship. The Army is outside politics. The Army will  intervene in events in the country only when it sees the start  of civil war. The Army will not tolerate civil war."  <H5>  Our Commentary </H5>   Let us think back to 16 August 1991. A similar document  comes into the hands of the editorial office. In prospect there  is the signing of the Union Treaty and stability that has more  or less emerged in relations between the center and the  republics. In the past is the serious -- but not taken  seriously enough -- warning by then Foreign Minister  Shevardnadze about an impending coup and subsequent  dictatorship. Then came the SCSE [State Committee for the State  of Emergency].    But let us return to this strange but serious document.  Although why is it strange?    Theory 1. Events since the release of the Lefortovo  prisoners give grounds for believing that stormclouds are indeed  gathering over the president. "Friends betray you," Napoleon  said. In politics real friends are extremely rare. Yeltsin had  only to start planning to go to Sochi on vacation for the  long-standing rumors about the president's poor health to begin  gathering strength. Let us note that the emphasis has  increasingly been placed on "this matter"; Ostensibly Yeltsin is  not only quite a drinker, but cannot properly run the country.  So he has gone to Sochi for further rehabilitation.    Meanwhile in Moscow there is a marked increase in activity  and a large-scale militia operation is being held under the code  name "Elbrus" to combat crime, primarily organized crime.    And on Tuesday, 15 March, as though by arrangement, at a  press conference Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin  resolutely declares a ruthless war on crime involving all  available forces. Internal troop units wearing militia uniform  are immediately additionally moved into Moscow, and cadets at  Ministry of Internal Affairs educational establishments in the  capital also take part in "Elbrus." But even "Elbrus" is not  sufficient pretext for concentrating forces in the capital.  However, the upcoming 17 March opposition rally devoted to the  third anniversary of the all-union referendum on the unity of  the Union provides weightier grounds for "considering" the  security of Muscovites, especially as the Working Russia members  and their supporters were meeting on Teatralnaya Square, not far  from the Kremlin, to sing the praises of the late "united and  indivisible" state. In general, there were all too many militia  in the city that week.    Echoing Mr. Yerin, boss of the entire Russian militia,  Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko (once again  probably a coincidence) suddenly began to speak about a state of  emergency in view of the grave economic situation. Admittedly,  he later made the proviso that he was referring merely to a  state of emergency in the economy and finance.    Also probably by accident, the question of an economic state  of emergency was discussed during the evening of 14 March at a  meeting of the two parliamentary speakers Vladimir Shumeyko and  Ivan Rybkin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. The State Duma  chairman told INTERFAX of this. However, the premier expressed  his attitude toward the question of a state of emergency only  Friday 18 March. He was against a state of emergency. Probably  by then the crisis in the economy was over. The rally on  Teatralnaya Square also passed off without excesses. Moreover,  the document under discussion, so it transpired, was already  passing through the hands of extremely influential and respected  personalities.    Constitutional Court Chairman Valeriy Zorkin, the chairmen  of  both television companies -- Oleg Poptsov (Russian TV) and  Aleksandr Yakovlev ("Ostankino") -- Sergey Filatov, leader of  the President's Administration, Federal Counterintelligence  Service Director Sergey Stepashin, and a number of other  respected people had familiarized themselves with its contents.    Clearly sensing that something was wrong, LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who  once again was left on the sidelines, dropped a bombshell at a  meeting with bankers which also "happened" to coincide with the  statements by Yerin and Shumeyko, saying that a repetition of 21  September last year was possible any day now. "All the signs  are there, the symptoms are present, the papers and documents  are ready, and the troops have long since been moved in for  street fighting."    The behavior of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who  cancelled  his visit to the troops of the Leningrad Military District at  the last moment, 14 March, is also perfectly explicable against  the background of these events. Obviously Grachev had to be in  Moscow at all costs at this time. His well known opponent in  the Army Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov was returning  to the capital 16 March. And, I repeat, an opposition rally was  scheduled for 17 March. We think the story of Pavel Grachev's  actions is as follows.    After the abortive attempt, if the document is to be  believed, to oust Yeltsin the defense minister decided not  merely "not to oppose" the aforementioned "group of state  figures" but also to make his own contribution to the course of  events. Neither the president (if the "conspirators" failed)  nor the "conspirators" (if they were victorious) would forgive  him further fence-sitting like that of October last year.  Probably the remark in the document by a member of the top  brass forecasting the resignation of Grachev or Kolesnikov has a  real foundation. "The Army will intervene in events in the  country only when it sees the start of civil war," the military  minister hurriedly declared at the press conference hastily  convened 16 March. And, let us note, it is also possible to  initiate a civil war. For instance, to instigate mass riots  which, who knows, could begin at that very rally. And, judging  by the mayor's statement, real preparations had been and were  being made for them.    It is no accident that the main communist leaders were not  seen at the rally. We have managed to establish from circles  close to one of the special services that steps were taken to  ensure that they themselves would not want to take part. The  scenario for the state of emergency could have been more or less  as follows. The crowd is whipped into a frenzy (the opposition  leaders have seemingly become very expert at this) and then at a  suitable moment there is an explosion in the midst of the crowd  -- then a fight and total mayhem. The OMON [Special-Purpose  Militia Detachments] and internal troops positioned nearby move  in. Mass riots are guaranteed. Then a state of emergency is  declared in Moscow. Meanwhile the president is on vacation in  Sochi. He is seriously ill and incapable of leading the  country. Under the Constitution power passes to the premier.  Nobody knows what the outcome would be of the presidential  elections that must follow within three months. They may not  take place at all. But for the moment that is all conjecture.  What are the facts?    The reasons prompting the president's erstwhile supporters  to  seek methods of removing him from power are as follows, I think.    The military-industrial lobby, headed by First Vice Premier  Oleg Soskovets and First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey  Kokoshin, has long quite openly expressed its dissatisfaction  with the president. Yeltsin takes no particular notice of them  and is squeezing funding for the military-industrial complex.    Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin is facing the clear  threat of being left without the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] as a result of its radical reorganization, which may  signal the end for this monster. In the very near future, so we  are told by sources within the president's apparatus and the  State-Legal Administration, the MVD will lose the department's  most powerful structure -- the internal troops. It is planned  to use them as the basis for setting up a National Guard. On  top of this, so we learned from the same sources, in the spirit  of the fight against corruption the Moscow Main Internal Affairs  Administration may be placed directly under the command of the  president.    Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov, in the event of  the possible removal of Yeltsin from the presidency, would be  the first and probably only contender for the post of military  minister.    Theory 2. The president deliberately instigated the  appearance of this "confidential" document in order to  strengthen his grip on his team, which is getting out of  control, and remove from the game troublesome individuals whom  he dislikes.    But in both cases the reasons for the disagreements between  Yeltsin and the "conspirators" remain as before: They no longer  suit each other. Somebody has got to go. But who?    Theory 3. It is a blatant forgery. But who is responsible?    P.S. Painless prevention of a coup d'etat is possible only  when notice is given of it before it begins. It is better to be  wrong ahead of time than to reflect on the reasons behind a  conspiracy as you count the number of victims after the event.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURFERS SHOULD CHALLENGE WAVES, NOT EACH OTHER  </P> <P> Whose ocean is it? As an active surfer since 1957, I find it a shame that some  surfers don't understand the value of enjoyment and camaraderie that surfers  have shared since I began surfing.  </P> <P> Challenging the elements, not other surfers, has been an important part of my  life. To have to fight your way into or out of the ocean is absurd. It is a  lower form of animal thinking that brings out territorial rights. Richie  Collins, as good as he may think he is, has a lot to learn about human rights  and sharing.  </P> <P> GENE BOYER  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Groupe Bull offshoot to share US air force order ZENITH Data Systems, the personal computer arm of Groupe Bull of France, and Government Technology Services Inc. of Chantilly, Virginia, have been jointly awarded a controversial Dollars 724m (Pounds 479m) contract to supply personal computers to the US air force. The award of the contract, known as Desktop Four, should end one of the longest-running sagas in recent military procurement history. Ironically, the contract, for about 300,000 personal computers, was placed under new Pentagon procedures designed to speed procurement. Zenith, of Hernden, Virginia, has been a subsidiary of Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer since 1989. Government Technology Services Inc is a large systems integrator and equipment supplier specialising in the government market. The award of the contract seems to be a victory for those who were critical of an earlier decision, which was announced last summer, to give the contract in its entirety to Zenith. Protests came from competitors including Apple Computer and Electronic Data Systems. Just before last Christmas, to the consternation of Groupe Bull and Zenith, some of the protests were upheld, throwing the future of the contract into confusion. The protests were upheld on the grounds that Zenith's monitor screens did not comply with the Trade Agreements Act designed to ensure substantial US labour content in products sourced abroad and that the Air Force had not considered sufficiently the advantages of sourcing from more than one supplier. It is still not clear what proportion of the order will go to each company. It is understood, however, that the terms of the contract provide each company with a licence to sell its products to the Air Force. Each will be forced to fight for its share of the overall contract. The Air Force said yesterday that the computers, printers, software and other equipment will be supplied by the companies by February 1998. Some 370 bids for the contract had been received, along with 22 proposals. The award comes as a great relief to Groupe Bull which is still losing money and which was counting on Desktop Four to generate revenues, re-establish its credibility and show that foreign ownership was no bar to doing business with the US government. It is not know yet whether the disappointed competitors will appeal one more time against the latest decision.</p>

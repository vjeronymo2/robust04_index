			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> This could be the worst insult yet aimed at Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Alien Nation," a new television series set in 1995, revolves around the lives  of some extraterrestrials who land in the Mojave Desert and, naturally, move to  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Their hairless heads are shaped like overripe melons and adorned with red  squiggles.  </P> <P> At the end of the show, a disclaimer says that "any similarity to persons  living or dead" is "purely coincidental."  </P> <P> Speaking of extraterrestrial communities, the Venice Chamber of Commerce  unveiled a new logo Tuesday, replacing the old image of a gondolier plying the  canal waters.  </P> <P> "We wanted something more representative of Venice today," a chamber spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Venice today? What a great straight line! How about a turbaned weightlifter  juggling a chain saw and roller-skating down the boardwalk while his faithful  snake slithers along at his side?  </P> <P> Alas, the new logo is more corporate than colorful -- merely Venice spelled out  in various type styles.  </P> <P> Of course, the name is underlined by a squiggle that's suspiciously similar to  the type found on the heads of the "Alien Nation" characters.  </P> <P> A recent mention of the inclusion of L.A.'s Bullwinkle-and-Rocky statue in the  book, "Roadside America," prompted a couple of letters that reveal the origin  of the 30-year-old landmark.  </P> <P> Publicist Goldy Norton fondly recalls passing the Sunset Boulevard sculpture of  the cartoon stars in the late 1950s on "my frequent walks to the dearly  departed Plush Pup hot dog stand or Schwab's Drugstore."  </P> <P> The statue, Norton says, was inspired by "a Sahara Hotel billboard on the north  side of Sunset, which was topped by a larger-than-life statue of a showgirl on  a rotating base. When Jay Ward, the genius behind Bullwinkle, built his  headquarters across the street, he decided a comparable statue . . . would be  appropriate."  </P> <P> And why is Bullwinkle holding Rocky in the palm of his hand?  </P> <P> Attorney John Hamilton Scott, whose father Bill Scott was the voice of  Bullwinkle, says that the showgirl was "holding a cowboy hat in her  outstretched arm. The Bullwinkle statue was a mordant comment."  </P> <P> This sounds like a joke but isn't. The theater chain Cineplex Odeon, which  offers such delicacies as designer water and capuccino, now accepts American  Express cards. And, why not? Tickets now go for $7 a pop. The chain so far has  no plans to issue its own credit cards. You know -- Cineplastic.  </P> <P> The family sport of the future? Forget about bowling, tennis and miniature  golf.  </P> <P> Verne Langdon believes it's only a matter of time before Dad and Junior are  grappling in the ring. How about best two out of three falls to see who does  the dishes?  </P> <P> Langdon is the creator of Slammers, a new Sun Valley attraction that bills  itself as "L.A.'s only wrestling gym for the entire family."  </P> <P> He claims wrestling "is great exercise," especially if low-impact aerobics  doesn't inflict enough pain on your body.  </P> <P> The 17-foot-by-17-foot ring rents for $35 an hour, a rate that might offend the  Andre the Accountant in your family. But Langdon points out you can have the  whole family in there bouncing off the ropes at once -- a Battle Royal!  </P> <P> Another contribution from the local car culture: PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), a  line of swimwear named after a roadway.  </P> <P> Attention Beverly Hills Visitors Bureau: Your letter, which arrived here even  though it was addressed to "Mr. Steve Garvey, Only in L.A.," has been forwarded  to the San Diego ballplayer-turned-radio host.  </P> <P> You're welcome.  </P></p>

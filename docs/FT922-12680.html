			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Haden MacLellan tumbles to Pounds 14.6m HADEN MACLELLAN Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, suffered difficult trading conditions in its main markets and saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 14.6m in 1991. UK profits fell sharply while the US side dropped into losses. However, directors recommended a maintained final dividend of 5p giving an unchanged total of 8p, covered 1.4 times by earnings per share of 11p (20p). Mr Philip Ling, non-executive chairman, said that there were as yet 'no clear signs of an upturn' in business. Group sales fell marginally to Pounds 352.2m (Pounds 354.5m) but an increase in costs reduced cut operating profits to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 25.7m). Associate companies incurred a loss of Pounds 264,000 (profit Pounds 576,000). However, there was interest received of Pounds 369,000, compared to a charge of Pounds 2.6m. Cash balances stood at Pounds 18.2m at the year-end, up from Pounds 12.8m. After a tax bill increased to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 6.8m), minorities of Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 191,000), an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.2m) - relating to the possible closure of a paint recycling centre in the US - and dividend costs, the group added a mere Pounds 100,000 to reserves, against Pounds 8.3m last time. Operating profits from the manufacturing division, where the products range from vandal-proof toilets to iron bridges, were more than halved to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 5.5m) as inquiries from customers failed to turn into orders. Mr Ling said that so far in 1992 the inquiry level was high but there was still no sign of orders improving. Operating profits from distribution businesses - supplying nuts and bolts, machine tools and spares for agricultural equipment - fell by a quarter, from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 4m, partly as a result of the disposal of the Rubber and Allied Products group. A strong performance was seen in the European and Australian parts of the automated manufacturing systems division where profits advanced from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 9.9m, benefiting from the completion of two significant paint systems contracts. Mr Ling warned it would not be possible to repeat the 1991 figure in 1992. In the US there was a loss of Pounds 1.8m (profit Pounds 5.5m) and management changes were being made. COMMENT These results were a surprise to no-one but are nevertheless a disappointment. They must mark the end of the great hopes for the Drypure paint recycling system, and they show how recession has exposed the weaknesses of the US management. Costs have been cut, but with the end of the two big orders in Europe, and no sign of orders picking up yet, it would be prudent to expect no more than maintained profits and earnings in the current year. The saving grace is that the group's cash-generative abilities mean the dividend is safe. And with the shares unchanged yesterday at 120 1/2 p, the yield is 8.9 per cent.</p>

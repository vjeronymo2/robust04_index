			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: OLSON INDUSTRIES LOSES $914,730 IN 2ND QUARTER  </P> <P> Olson Industries, a Sherman Oaks plastics-packaging concern, reported a  second-quarter loss of $914,730, compared with a loss of $1.04 million a year  earlier.  </P> <P> The loss came despite an increase in sales in the quarter that ended June 30,  to $17.9 million from $16 million. Olson, as it has in recent quarters, blamed  the loss mostly on higher prices for resins, the main raw material used in its  packaging goods.  </P> <P> Olson's principal unit, Dolco Packaging Corp., is operating under Chapter 11 of  the U. S. Bankruptcy Code, whereby it is protected from creditors' lawsuits  while working out a plan to restructure its finances.  </P> <P> For the first half of 1989, Olson lost $1.58 million, compared with a loss of  $1.46 million a year earlier. Six-month sales rose to $37 million from $33.6  million.  </P></p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / 'Gentle' recovery predicted for homes THE HOUSING market should start a gentle recovery in the spring, but further measures might be needed to stimulate low levels of demand and help householders with negative equity, Halifax Building Society says today. In a review of the market in 1992, the society says house prices have recently been slipping by about 0.5 per cent to 0.7 per cent each month. It says these falls could continue over the winter months, but prices should stabilise from the spring. Some monthly increases are probable in the second half of next year and market activity is forecast to rise by 10 per cent to 15 per cent from the depressed levels this year, when about 1.1m house moves took place. The building society bases its forecast on the affordability of houses, which it says are as cheap now as at any time in the past 10 years. It says: 'We also believe that the recovery in the economy as a whole could be stronger than expected. The chancellor's forecast of 1 per cent GDP growth next year could well be a little pessimistic with the out-turn nearer 1.5 per cent.' It believes house prices will rise next year in line with earnings - about 5 per cent to 6 per cent - with house moves reaching 1.5m to 1.6m, up 30 per cent on current levels. Halifax says: 'This will mean a well-functioning housing market with prices rising slowly in real terms but with people able to buy and sell houses much more easily than has been the case for the past few years.' The society's forecast for this year, made a year ago, proved to be wide of the mark - it said prices should rise in line with an inflation rate of about 4 per cent - and there are caveats in its current forecast. It says there are several reasons why householders may not react to better affordability as they did in the mid-1970s: rising unemployment - particularly among the white-collar sector and in the southern half of the UK; concerns about possible further house price falls, and the phenomenon of negative equity. The Halifax says further reductions in interest rates would help, but it also sees 'a good opportunity for the government to reform the current mortgage interest tax relief system to target subsidy more directly to those who need it.'</p>

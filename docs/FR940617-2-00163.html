Such exemptions are subject to certain exceptions, limitations and conditions set out in the Commission's exemption, including compliance with French law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The activities referred to above are (a) buying and selling Relevant Securities for the accounts of such Underwriters (or their affiliates), whether for purposes of risk management in connection with the offering, arbitrage or otherwise, (b) buying and selling Relevant Securities on behalf of customers, (c) advising customers as to the purchase or sale of Relevant Securities, including publication of specific company and industry research reports, (d) engaging in securities lending transactions in Relevant Securities and (e) stabilizing the market (as described below). As a result of these activities, the Underwriters may at any time be short or long in Relevant Securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is general market practice in France for the Underwriters, and the lead Underwriter in particular, to maintain an orderly market in subscription rights and existing shares, and it is expected that the lead Underwriter will take measures to avoid extreme price fluctuations during the distribution period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The activities referred to above may result in the market prices of the Relevant Securities being different from those that might otherwise have prevailed in the open market if rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 had applied in France and elsewhere outside the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> United States Securities and Exchange Commission; Division of Market Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> June 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> M.

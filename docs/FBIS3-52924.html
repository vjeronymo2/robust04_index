			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 7 Jan (MENA)--Iraqi officials have stated  that Iraq has adopted a clear and frank stand on Arab  reconciliation based on the need to reach a common Arab formula  that would achieve better joint Arab action and guarantee  inseparable and comprehensive pan-Arab security. The officials  believe that such joint action should prevent any foreign  aggression against any Arab country and that it should guarantee  nonintervention in these countries' internal affairs, amend the  Arab League charter, and set up an Arab court of justice to  settle inter-Arab disputes without foreign intervention.    In statements to the MENA correspondent in Baghdad, a number  of these officials expressed Iraq's interest in and support for  joint Arab action in light of the great challenges facing the  Arab nation. They also expressed Iraq's genuine desire to settle  inter-Arab disputes because, as they put it, this "will help  lift the blockade against Iraq."    Ambassador Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent delegate to the Arab  League, said his country has presented its opinions of Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's paper on  Arab reconciliation. He said that, in this way, Iraq has proved  its desire for interaction and allowing the opportunity for  dialogue and an exchange of views to improve the situation.    The Iraqi delegate added: Many of those who talk about Arab  reconciliation consider the so-called Gulf crisis to be the  primary challenge the Arab nation has faced. They believe that  this crisis caused the current situation, while Iraq thinks that  perhaps the Gulf crisis was the result or one of the results of  the bad situation that had existed before.    Ambassador Najm said Iraq believes that anyone who  contemplates reconciliation must overlook past conflicts and  establish a new groundwork that would enable us to bring about  the desired Arab situation.    He said that his country is ready to positively and  constructively discuss all issues pertaining to Arab  reconciliation if there is a serious dialogue to achieve  reconciliation on a new, sound basis. He noted that there are  many challenges facing the Arab nation and that the  reconciliation process should not ignore these challenges,  particularly the cultural invasion, the growing military power  of the Arab countries' neighbors, the water shortage, and Israel.    The Iraqi delegate spoke about the Kuwaiti prisoners  issue--a  result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that many consider the  primary cause of Arab nation's division. He said: Iraq does not  hold prisoners, but there are cases of people who have been  missing since the war. Baghdad already agreed to receive Arab  League envoys on the issue and is about to receive another envoy  to ensure that all the prisoners have been released.    In a statement to MENA's correspondent in Baghdad, Iraqi  National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih affirmed his  country's willingness and sincere desire to work for Arab  reconciliation. He added: We hope there will be a distinction  between what are called the Kuwaiti prisoners and the issue of  the missing people because Iraq does not have any Kuwaiti  prisoners. Perhaps there are missing people.    He said that Baghdad will welcome any Arab League envoy who  wants to investigate the Kuwaiti prisoners issue.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN ENDS SLIDE WITH VICTORY OVER DOMINGUEZ HILLS  </P> <P> After losing four consecutive games, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball  team dodged a bullet to defeat Cal State Dominguez Hills, 56-52, in a  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at Toro Gymnasium on Friday night.  </P> <P> Leading, 52-51, with 1 minute 3 seconds to play, Northridge extended its  advantage to three points on a pair of Kris Brodowski free throws.  </P> <P> But the Matadors missed the front end of four consecutive one-and-one  opportunities down the stretch to keep the Toros in the game.  </P> <P> With 40 seconds left and Northridge leading, 54-51, Andre Henry missed a free  throw. With 28 seconds to play, it was Derrick Gathers' turn, and, seven  seconds later, Kendell McDaniels missed.  </P> <P> After Raymond Bennett hit one of two free throws for the Toros, Gathers missed  another foul shot with 10 seconds remaining, but McDaniels was there for the  rebound and he fed Brodowski for the final basket.  </P> <P> "This was a very big win for us," said Brodowski, who scored 12 points and made  eight of eight free throws. "We had played hard against Cal State L. A., but  lost both games"  </P> <P> McDaniels had a game-high 15 points for Northridge (10-12, 5-4 in conference  play); Bennett scored 15 for Dominguez Hills (8-14, 4-5).  </P> <P> Trailing, 46-43, with 8:02 left, Northridge went on a 6-0 run.  </P> <P> McDaniels started the rally with a 14-foot jump shot, and, after two missed  shots on consecutive possessions, Gathers scored on a layup off a fast break,  and McDaniels followed with a steal and a two-handed dunk.  </P> <P> For the first time in four games, Northridge shot better than 50% from the  field (10 of 18) in the first half, but trailed, 24-23, at halftime as Robert  Barksdale hit an 18-foot jump shot at the buzzer.  </P> <P> The Matadors took a 21-16 lead on Brodowski's basket with four minutes left in  the half, but Dominguez Hills went on an 8-2 spurt before intermission.  </P> <P> Vincent Washington scored the first six points of the run and Barksdale capped  it off with his jump shot.  </P> <P> Washington scored 10 points (four of five from the field) in the first half and  Bennett had five.  </P> <P> Seven players scored for Northridge, led by McDaniels with seven.  </P></p>

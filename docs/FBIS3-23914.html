In his opinion, the idea--great by itself--could  be successfully implemented in our city, and in the form of not  one but 22 subzones, the projects for which the mayoralty  already has.    The potential major subzones are: Kronshtadt, Lomonosov, the  airport, and the sea port. Foreign experience shows that a free  economic zone should be separated from the rest of the territory  of the country, and since it is doubtful that a fence could be  put around all of Petersburg, the most appropriate place for it  would be Kronshtadt because of its natural stand-alone position.  However, as is known, Kronshtadt currently is home to a naval  base, and the navy is not happy about having commerce for a  neighbor.    Vatanyar Yagya believes that the military will not give up  Kronshtadt, but we will not have other subzones either until the  new State Duma passes a law defining the status of a free  economic zone. True, there are already two such zones in  Russia--Nakhodka Harbor and Kaliningrad Oblast; however, their  legality remains very questionable.    At the press conference Vatanyar Saidovich also outlined  priority directions along which our city authorities are trying  to develop international cooperation. The main directions are  the pharmaceutical and food processing industry, as well as  transportation support. At this point, for instance,  implementation is beginning on an agreement between Petersburg  and Cuba for shipment of medicines to the city, of which we  currently have only half of the needed quantities.    International projects in the area of the food processing  industry envisage first and foremost reconstruction of the  meat-packing plant, whose equipment already had become obsolete  in the beginning of the 1930's. There is also a plan to attract  foreign investment into setting up privately-owned bakeries in  Petersburg.    The main problem in our transportation support, in the  opinion of city authorities, may be resolved with the help of  foreign partners--setting up our own bus manufacturing. So far,  there are two ideas for its implementation: at the Kirov Plant  as part of the complex of consumer goods production, and in the  Severnyy Plant, which as a result of conversion has now began to  manufacture mopeds.</p>

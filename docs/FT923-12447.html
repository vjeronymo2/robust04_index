			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Travel: Old descriptions still fit Saigon - Mark Hodson still finds elegance and vigour in the 'Paris of the East' FROM the roof terrace of the Rex Hotel in Saigon, you can see the twin spires of Notre Dame. The red-brick cathedral is almost an identical twin of its sister in Paris except that it stands in the centre of a huge roundabout. Hundreds of bicycles, mopeds and trishaws swarm around it and down Dong Khoi Street towards the Hotel de Ville, a grand reminder of the city's colonial past with its ornate, pastel yellow facade and green shutters. Saigon seems to have changed little in the last 40 years. The elegance and vigour described in Graham Greene's 1950s novel, The Quiet American, are still there. Two wars, a US trade embargo and 17 years of failed communism have left it almost untouched by the horrors of modern city life. The old descriptions - Paris of the East, Vienna of the Orient - still ring true: women cycle to work in white hats and elbow-length lace gloves; old men with slicked-back hair, three-button suits and berets drink gritty coffee at makeshift pavement cafes. Young girls wash dishes in the gutters while their mothers sell Russian vodka and American cigarettes under the shade of old parachutes. Overcrowded buses, some built in the 1940s and converted to run on charcoal-burning stoves, clatter down wide boulevards past faded French courtyards. Ironically, it is the very lack of western investment that has made Saigon such a delight for tourists fed up with the pollution and filth of many Asian cities. In spite of a population of 4m, Saigon does not have Bangkok's fumes or Manila's street crime. Nor is it piled high with ugly office buildings like Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur. When the French film director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, was searching for locations for The Lover, he wanted to recreate the Saigon of the 1920s. He could find only one city that still retained the atmosphere of that era - Saigon itself. Now, as foreign investors move in, the socialist republic is opening its doors to a new wave of tourists. For several years, westerners have been allowed to visit Vietnam only in well-organised parties chaperoned by heavy-handed guides and translators. Last November, it was announced that with a 28-day visa they could explore the country virtually at will. Most who paid the Pounds 40 for a visa passed through Saigon. In spite of Hanoi's position as the political capital, Saigon is the undisputed centre of commerce and tourism. Although the north is cold and austere, Saigon is colourful, full of enterprise and vitality. Its people are too busy for dogma, refusing even to call it by its official name, Ho Chi Minh City. Outside the Museum of American War Crimes, a man in faded denims peddles Viet Cong medals and battered Zippo lighters engraved by homesick GIs. Every few yards along the streets, women have set up tiny stalls selling litre bottles of petrol siphoned from government cars. Each vehicle is piled high with passengers. Three to a bicycle is typical; I once spotted a 90cc Honda groaning under the weight of six people: mum, dad and four children. There are almost no cars in Saigon except for a row of ancient Renault taxis painted pastel blue and, it seems, parked permanently outside the Rex. The Saigonese are charming and exuberant, and they are everywhere: laughing, shouting, waving, hustling, buying and selling. Many will invite tourists into their homes to share bowls of pho, the meat and noodle soup eaten at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Vietnam is said to have hundreds of different dishes, many of which are served with a French accent. On the streets it is possible to dine on fresh baguettes filled with chicken pate and vegetables for less than 20p. All of Vietnam is cheap. Change a US dollar and you walk away with 10,000-12,000 dong, depending on the fluctuating exchange rate. Change Dollars 100 and you need a small rucksack to carry the notes. Two hours' drive from Saigon, at Cu Chi, a one-armed war veteran guided me, for a small fee, along a stretch of the Viet Cong tunnels, an unforgettable experience but not for the claustrophobic. Cu Chi can be combined with a trip to the Holy See of the Cao Dai at Tay Ninh, a magnificently garish church whose pillars are entwined with huge painted snakes and where men and women enter through different doors and walk up and down the aisles in opposite directions. At noon, hundreds of priests in white smocks and black skullcaps file into the great temple to sing prayers. Visitors can watch from a balcony where a group of musicians scratch out haunting harmonies on ancient two-string instruments clenched between their feet. Caodaism, founded in the 1920s, is a colourful fusion of buddhism, catholicism and confucianism but its members also worship Victor Hugo, Shakespeare and Lenin. At one point, Graham Greene was so enchanted with it that he considered joining. But then maybe he went back to the Rex, sat on the roof terrace with a g&amp;t, and had second thoughts. There are no direct flights from the UK to Saigon. Air France, Thai and Vietnam Airlines fly from Bangkok where travel agents can arrange a 28-day visa in about three days. Air France also flies direct from Paris. The best time to visit is December-April, although spring can be very hot. Ideally, go during Tet (Chinese New Year) in early February.</p>

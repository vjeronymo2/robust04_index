			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Several hundred residents of a drug-torn San Francisco neighborhood marched  through the streets in a protest against crack cocaine and weekend shootings  that left two dead and several injured in another part of the city. "We are  going to march and shout and sing and pray till this crack cocaine is  completely eradicated from our community," said the Rev. Cecil Williams, who  led the march through the Ocean View area. Although the march and rally in the  southern part of the city had been planned for several weeks, a drive-by ambush  and another shooting less than two miles away in the Bayview-Hunters Point  district gave people another reason to participate, said Williams, pastor of  Glide Memorial United Methodist Church. Two gunmen got out of a car and fired  more than 40 shots into a crowd, killing two people and injuring nine in the  worst mass shooting in San Francisco since five people were killed and 11  wounded in the 1975 Golden Dragon Massacre in Chinatown.  </P></p>

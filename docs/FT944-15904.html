			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: The Sitwells' influence The chief aim of the three Sitwell siblings - Edith, Sacheverell and Osbert  -was, according to Aldous Huxley, 'to REBEL'. But, he added, 'though a charming idea, the steps which they are prepared to take are so small as to be hardly perceptible.' The National Portrait Gallery's new exhibition and accompanying catalogue (Pounds 14.95 pbk, Pounds 19.95 hbk, 240 pages) chronicles in paintings, photographs, music, literature and letters the Sitwell's influence in the arts of the early 20th century and leaves us lamenting the decline of the Great English Eccentric.</p>

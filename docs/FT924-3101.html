			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (8): Free trade is no longer such a hot potato - Commercial ties with the US THE US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA), now nearing its fourth anniversary, has already had a profound impact on commercial ties between the world's two largest trading partners. Measuring that impact with any degree of precision is impossible. The first three years of the FTA have coincided with a recession, volatile exchange rates and low commodity prices, all of which have also helped alter trade flows and investment strategies. But a recent study by Toronto's CD Howe Institute concluded that 'the facts so far are more consistent with the optimistic scenario of free trade supporters than with the views of detractors.' The supporters have taken heart from rising two-way trade, especially in products liberalised by the agreement, as well as many examples of new US investment in Canada. Evidence of the FTA's popularity in the business community is the mountain of applications which have poured into Ottawa and Washington for two rounds of accelerated tariff cuts which have been negotiated since 1989 on two-way trade of some CDollars 8bn a year. A third - and final - round will come into force early in 1993. Critics of the FTA, chiefly the labour movement, point to hard-pressed Canadian industries, such as furniture, carpets, textiles and processed foods, which are struggling to compete against rising US imports. The FTA has been blamed for a rash of plant closures in Canada. Some US companies have discovered that, without customs tariffs to consider, they can service the Canadian market more efficiently from plants south of the border. Some Canadian manufacturers, especially in the automotive parts industry, have also moved to the US. One undisputed benefit of the 1989 pact, however, is its innovative dispute settlement mechanism. The new system of referring disagreements to binational review panels has taken much of the political heat out of anti-dumping and countervailing duty issues. Canadian trade officials are also convinced that the binding arbitration system has made the US Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission more careful in applying trade-remedy laws. A total of 33 panels has been set up over the past three years, the bulk of them to review anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases involving products as diverse as softwood lumber, magnesium, pigs and paving machinery. Five of the panels, set up under Chapter 18 of the FTA, have dealt with intractable government-to-government disputes. They have included a Canadian challenge on the US interpretation of rules of origin for cars assembled in Canada, and a US complaint against Canadian landing rules for west coast salmon and herring. Two Chapter 18 cases, involving farm subsidies and UHT milk standards, are pending. The next big step in US-Canada trade relations will be the expansion of free trade to Mexico under the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which is due to come into force on January 1 1994. The Mulroney government expects to present enabling legislation to parliament in early 1993. While public opinion in Canada remains lukewarm on free trade, the Nafta agreement is not as hot a political potato as the FTA was four years ago. The opposition Liberal party, which strongly opposed the FTA, has come around to much the same view as US President-elect Bill Clinton - that Nafta has flaws, but they are not so serious that the whole agreement should be ditched. Canada's goals in the Nafta negotiations were largely defensive. Only a relatively small number of Canadian exporters and investors will benefit from improved access to Mexico. Ottawa was more anxious to preserve (and if possible, improve on) gains made in the FTA, and to ensure that Canada would remain attractive as a springboard for investors into the North American market. Canadian officials identify five key areas where Nafta differs from the FTA: clearer rules of origin, which the Canadians expect will avoid a repetition of the dispute earlier this year over the North American content of Honda Civic cars made in Canada. the extension for two years, to 1996, of duty drawbacks on inputs for motor vehicles made in Canada and then shipped to the US. Permanent duty drawback concessions will apply to products which are shipped from one Nafta country to another but do not meet North American rules of origin. Under Nafta, companies will be entitled to a refund of the customs duty on either the input or the finished product, whichever is lower. liberalisation of cross-border transport. Under Nafta, trucks will be allowed to pick up loads in all three countries. looser government procurement rules. Among the US business which will be opened to Canadian companies are services, construction and para-statals such as the US Army Corps of Engineers. Canadian officials estimate that Nafta opens as much as CDollars 50bn of new US government business to Canadian bidders. Expanded intellectual property rights, notably protection of patents and copyright in Mexico. Despite the improvements, Nafta still leaves numerous gaps in commercial ties between the three countries. Subsidies and anti-dumping rules, which the FTA negotiators hoped would be resolved in the multilateral Uruguay Round, will remain contentious issues. The Canadians are also nervous that many Mexican officials will find it difficult to adjust to the disciplines required by a detailed international trade agreement, especially one which overrides domestic laws. Within Canada, pressure is likely to grow on Ottawa to provide more generous assistance to industries and workers hit by intensifying competition from US and now Mexican suppliers. The CD Howe Institute concluded that 'the painful restructuring that has occurred in certain sectors under the FTA suggests that the issue of adjustment programmes should be revisited'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    TRADE WITH THE US (CDollars bn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          1988      1989      1990      1991      1992*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MERCHANDISE Total Exports           102.6     105.7     110.5     107.6       59.7 Total Imports            88.8      94.0      93.7      93.7       51.9 Balance                  13.8      11.7      16.8      13.9        7.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-MERCHANDISE Receipts                 21.7      19.9      19.6      20.2        9.4 Payments                 34.5      35.0      39.0      38.9       20.3 Balance                 -12.8     -15.1     -19.4     -18.7      -10.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- T O T A L               247.6     254.6     262.8     260.4      141.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *To June                                      Source: STATISTICS CANADA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: Import change for Mercedes Mitsubishi Motors is taking over from this month the import and sales of Mercedes Benz trucks in Japan previously handled by Stuttgart Truck and Bus Sales, a joint venture with Daimler Benz, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo. The aim was to raise the efficiency of operations, Mitsubishi said. However, a minimum level of staffing would be kept in the joint venture, which would continue to operate for some time. Stuttgart Truck and Bus Sales is 60 per cent owned by Mitsubishi and 40 per cent by Daimler Benz. Since 1989 a total of 1,000 Mercedes Benz trucks have been sold in Japan.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Some enchanted evening This winter, the fashion wheel has turned - decisively. From the glossy pages of the world's most authoritative fashion bibles to the windows of the smallest high street store, a new sort of woman is being celebrated. Out go shapeless shrouds and dreary shifts. Out go combat boots and pale faced waifs. In come shapely curves and clothes that flatter, high-gloss make-up and well-groomed tresses. Womanly fashion is here again. It is quite all right - essential even - to be grown-up. The best, the most creative, of its designers have perceived, almost before it happened, a shift in the zeitgeist. Fashion, as sensitive a barometer of social change as any mainstream art, is functioning as it should. A society grown tired of the swankiness of the 1980s, exhausted by the confusing images of the early 1990s and weary of the drabness of grunge is more than ready for something new. With the worst of the recession behind us and a renewed sense of optimism in the air, it is time to dress up again, time for artifice, time to practise the age-old arts of seduction and, above all, time to have a little light-hearted fun. Nowhere is the new-style glamour more evident than after dark, and then it comes in many guises. Sometimes it emerges tongue-in-cheek, sometimes it is straight parody and sometimes just sheer knock-out beautiful. Everywhere there are references to glamour's golden age, the heyday of Hollywood and the celluloid sirens with their permanent waves, painted nails and faces. At other times, it plays with covering up beautiful women in traditional men's clothing, reminding us irresistibly of Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, or Katharine Hepburn in Sylvia Scarlett, or Yves Saint Laurent's hard-edged tuxedos of the 1970s. For dedicated followers of the fashion scene the old glamour standbys are there: the sheer stockings with short, short skirts, the stiletto heels with mannish trouser suits, the careful grooming, the deliberate air of artifice. Most importantly, the look this winter is one that each can adapt to her own. Here, on these pages, are some of the many ways to get all dressed up when you have somewhere to go.</p>

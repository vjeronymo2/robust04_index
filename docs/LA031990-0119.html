			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DRIVER STIRLING MOSS HIT BY CAR  </P> <P> Former auto racing champion Stirling Moss suffered a broken thigh when he was  hit by a car today while driving a motor scooter in central London.  </P> <P> Doctors inserted three metal pins in the 60-year-old former Grand Prix driver's  thigh bone, publicist Linda Patterson said.  </P> <P> The car allegedly ran a yield sign and hit Moss, who was going 20 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "I have been told the recovery process will be a slow one -- about six months,"  Moss said in a statement.  </P> <P> Moss crashed at 90 m.p.h. during a race at Britain's Goodwood track in 1962. He  was dragged unconscious from his car, remained in a coma for three days and was  paralyzed for six months.  </P></p>

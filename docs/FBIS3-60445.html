The  memorandum relates to medical emergencies and high-complexity  illnesses.    The memorandum was signed at the start of a meeting of  health  officials from Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. The memorandum  states that the general hospital in Chetumal, Quintana Roo,  Mexico will be made available to Belizeans who need emergency  medical care.    Under the agreement, the health care for medical emegencies  and high complexity pathologies to persons referred by the  Belize Ministry of Health will be delivered according to the  physical capacity of the general hospital.    Belizean patients, the memorandum stated, will be charged  according to their socioeconomic capacity and will be  responsible for costs and expenses incurred for lodging and  boarding while being treated in Chetumal. Persons unable to pay  for the medical attention would still have access to the  treatment and the Mexican Governmnt would take on full  responsibility for the payment of the treatment.    The Belizean and Mexican health officials agreed that if a  Belizean patient cannot be attended at Chetumal's general  hospital, he will be referred to other health facilities in the  state of Quintana Roo or other hospitals in Mexico.    Speaking at the start of the meeting, Belize's prime  minister, Manuel Esquivel, said his government's health policy  recognises health as a basic human right and a fundamental part  of the development process.    "The policy accepts that it is government's responsibility  to  ensure that every Belizean has access to the best level of  health care available, appropriate for his or her health needs,  regardless of ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status. and  political or geographic distinctions," Esquivel said.</p>

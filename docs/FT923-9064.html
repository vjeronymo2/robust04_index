			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Guinness takes advantage of Bundesbank rule changes GUINNESS, the UK drinks company, yesterday became the first issuer in the D-Mark Eurobond market to benefit from the Bundesbank's new rules on D-Mark issuance, which came into force on Monday. Guinness Finance launched a DM200m three-year issue, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks, and will be used to fund the company's German operations. The company decided not to take advantage of all the Bundesbank rule changes, according to Mr Ian Scott, director of treasury at Guinness. The firm chose a non-German paying agent, US bank JP Morgan (which also arranged the deal through its German subsidiary); but Guinness decided to list the deal on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to ensure easy access of information for German retail investors, although a German stock exchange listing is no longer required. The dropping of compulsory German listing under the new rules was expected to pull business to other exchanges with cheaper listing fees. However, the continuing importance of the German retail investor base to the market appears likely to encourage continued use of the German exchanges. The Guinness deal is governed by German law and can be cleared through the Kasseverein, the German clearing system, even though these requirements have also been dropped. The lead-manager reported demand from both German retail investors and international institutions, but dealers said the issue appeared aggressively priced. Meanwhile, Halifax Building Society issued DM20m of three-year medium-term notes via JP Morgan, using the newly-incorporated D-Mark option on its multi-currency programme. Abbey National was the first borrower to issue medium-term notes under the new rules, when it place DM50m of two-year notes via Merrill Lynch earlier this week. Elsewhere, the flow of floating-rate note issues with minimum and maximum coupon levels was unabated. Three German banks yesterday launched a total of Dollars 250m of so-called 'mini-max' floating rate notes. Commerzbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank each launched Dollars 100m of subordinated debt, while Bayerische Hypotheken raised Dollars 50m of senior debt through a Dollars 1.5bn medium-term note programme.</p>

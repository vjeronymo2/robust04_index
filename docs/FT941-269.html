			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (7): Welcome to the big battalions - Foreign financial services are sprouting in Bombay Foreign financial services companies are rushing to open up shop in Bombay. The caution which characterises the approach of companies in other industries to India is largely absent, as investment bankers, brokers and others hurry to find the best local partners and staff. Major overseas investment banks are anxious for gain a foothold in India. Tiny by international standards, local merchant banks have opted for joint ventures with their foreign counterparts. JP Morgan of the US took the plunge late last year with a 40 per cent purchase of ISEC, an investment bank floated by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a diversified development bank. General Electric and Housing Development and Finance Corporation are floating a joint venture for hire purchase credit and other financial services. The latest to arrive are Peregrine of Hong Kong and Daewoo of Korea. Peregrine and ITC Classic, a subsidiary of ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT Industries, have formed a 50:50 joint venture. Daewoo and CRB Capital Markets, a Bombay securities company, have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate and are yet to work out details. The oldest informal association is a decade old - between DSP Financial Services, an offshoot of an old-established Bombay brokerage, and Merrill Lynch of the US. They now urgently need a formal arrangement to transfer new skills and technology and compete with the new investment banks coming up in India. Another well-established relationship - between Lazard Brothers of the UK and Creditcapital Finance Corporation, an investment bank, has also recently been strengthened with the British merchant bank lifting its stake at CFC to 40 per cent. Ind Global Financial Trust, promoted by Mr R. Sankaran, a former Standard Chartered executive, is associated with Salomon Brothers. Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, after a brief honeymoon with Bear Sterns, decided to join hands with Orix, the most active Japanese financial company in India. Kotak Mahindra Finance of Bombay and Goldman Sachs are currently in discussions on whether to finalise a formal arrangement. The focus now is on insurance. World insurance majors, Eagle Star, Sun Life, New York Life, AIG and Cigna have sent representatives to India to scout for local collaborators. Sun Life has announced a tie-up with State-owned Life Insurance Corporation. Eagle Star, a BAT Industries subsidiary, will form a joint venture with ITC, once the guidelines are announced. New York Life is talking to HDFC to form a joint venture. The most visible impact is on the stock market. Nearly 150 foreign institutional investors, registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog, have bought corporate stock on Indian bourses worth nearly Dollars l5bn since the beginning of this year. The inflow boosted the foreign exchange reserves, which hit a peak of Dollars 14bn. The capital flows were halted abruptly as custodial and depository services were unable to cope with the rush. The inflow will get a new fillip after these services are back to normal. Institutions can now either buy on the bourses or negotiate directly private placement of capital by companies. India opened its doors to for eign brokers late last year. Australian-owned Marlin Partners, Kleinwort Benson, Credit Lyonnais Securities and James Capel, a Hongkong and Shanghai Bank subsidiary, were the first allowed to handle foreign portfolio investment into Indian stocks through local brokers. Five others, including Jardine Fleming, have since won regulatory approval. The mutual funds market was opened to the private sector late last year. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank launched the first first domestic foreign-managed fund and attracted record subscriptions of more than Rs. 10bn. Tata, the largest Indian business group, is to offer a 20 per cent stake to Kleinwort Benson of the UK in an asset management company to be promoted by Tata. Merrill Lynch is planning to float an asset management company with Indian partner DSP Financial Services.</p>

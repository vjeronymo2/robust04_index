Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz had said the negotiations  would be held in mid-January in New York. But the UN official  said they would now open at the end of the month or in early  February.    "The two sides are busy compiling the necessary documents  before the next round of negotiations," the official told AFP,  asking not to be named. "They need two weeks to prepare for the  meeting."    He also said that long-term monitoring of Iraq's post-war  weapons programmes "has in effect started."    Aziz informed the United Nations on November 27 that Baghdad  accepted long-term monitoring, under the terms of the ceasefire  to the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.    Iraq is expected to argue at the New York talks that it has  met the conditions for the lifting of the embargo, which was  imposed after its August 1990 invasion of the emirate.    But Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN disarmament commission, has  proposed a six-month trial period for long-term monitoring  before an end to the embargo.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Torn safety net, shaky ladder The UK tax increases which come into effect in 1994-95 are under fire for their possible effect on the pace of economic recovery. But whatever one thinks of their timing, their ultimate cause is the growth in public spending. This growth is international. Total general government outlays among European countries have risen from 35 per cent of gross domestic product in 1970 to more than 50 per cent in the early 1990s, much larger than in the UK. Pressures have arisen both from the numerator (public expenditure) and the denominator (GDP). The latter has been hit by the long-term international slowdown in growth. But there has been at least as much pressure from the numerator, which is mainly welfare expenditure. The influences have included expensive advances in medical technology and growing proportions in further education. On the social security side there have been improved benefits (although not very recently), demographic shifts and changed social attitudes to take-up. Indeed the line between being less inhibited about exercising citizen rights and scrounging on the state is notoriously difficult to draw. One popular view is that the rise in welfare spending has been due to unemployment. This is not so, at least in the UK, if unemployment is conventionally defined - an important qualification. The biggest increases have been in expenditure on pensions, the sick, the disabled and families. Another favourite culprit is the ageing of the population. Again this is much exaggerated. Look at the age-dependency ratio - the proportion of the population over 65 to those of working age. In the European Union this ratio did not change at all in the 1980s and is expected to rise by a couple of percentage points to 23.6 per cent in the course of the 1990s. The big increases are expected next century. By 2040 the EC dependency ratio is expected to be about 43 per cent. These pressures will not really hit the UK until after 2010. A superficial case can be made that the welfare state is not a problem for Britain this decade. Looking ahead to 2000, the Department of Social Security has made a central assumption that benefits will rise by just over 2 1/2 per cent a year - within a hair's breadth of the government's projection for economic growth. A much more immediate threat than the projected ageing of the population later in the 21st century is the fall already taking place in the proportion of people, and especially men, still at work in the 55-64 age range. It has been stark enough in the UK but even more pronounced in many other countries. Workers in that age group are being nudged into early retirement during periods of recession, never to return to work during the upturn. David Willetts, who has drawn attention to this and many other problems in a Social Market Foundation booklet, The Age of Entitlement, expects the proportion at work in this age group to fall below 60 per cent. The problem is aggravated by the trend towards starting work later under the name of education and training. Within the space of two decades, says Willetts, the normal span of a man's working life will have dropped by nearly a third. Survey evidence suggests that most of those concerned do not regard themselves as either retired or conventionally unemployed. The problem has been aggravated by the convention that workers should retire at top pay rates and the provision in so many occupational schemes for pensions to be based on the last few years of working life. This makes workers themselves reluctant to stay in their posts when they may be earning somewhat less than at their peak. For employers, early retirement or voluntary redundancy seems a painless way of dealing with overmanning and reducing their average salary bill. But in both human and economic terms it is a colossal waste; and the increase in the proportion of women at work is but a mitigating factor. In an otherwise illuminating Rowntree Foundation study, The Future of the Welfare State, John Hills plays down the expenditure pressures. He looks at the prospective ageing of the population in the next century, the maturing of the much-reduced state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), and the switch, advocated by Labour, to restoring the link between benefit levels and incomes, and not just prices. If all these things were done, Hills argues that the pressure on public finances would still only rise by 5 percentage points of GDP by 2040. This argument has become much less convincing on its own terms since the outcry over the plans in the Lamont and Clarke Budgets to take an extra 3 percentage points of household incomes in tax over 1994-95. Hills argues that voters will not feel the pain of his 5 percentage-point increment if it is imposed in small annual steps. This is specious. He might equally argue that it would not matter if the state taxed away all original income so long as the 100 per cent point was reached in very gradual steps. The welfare state was once described by Winston Churchill as a ladder and a safety net. The ladder represented opportunity and the safety net security. Now, in too many countries, the safety net looks ripped and the ladder shaky. As for the leakages, you only have to take a walk in the great cities of Europe and North America. While some of the homeless and the hopeless represent problems of drug addiction or mental disturbance not easily cured by overall financial action, there are plenty of signs of benefits of a minimum subsistence kind not getting through to those who obviously need them. The British government cut benefits for the under-25s in order to discourage them from leaving home without proper job or training prospects. Many still leave home for understandable reasons and live on the margins of society. The shakiness of the ladder has been much discussed in the shape of the unemployment and poverty traps. Many of the aims of welfare state reformers get in each other's way. If governments try to make benefits more selective, this means that there will be a high rate of cut-off and the gain from taking a job or moving to a better one will be exiguous. If, on the other hand, governments concentrate on reducing the high 'poverty tax' rates at the bottom of the income scale, then much of the benefit will spill over to those who do not need it. The balance to be struck will vary from one benefit to another. In the UK high priority should be given to extending Family Benefit - now available to low-earning families with children - to those without children. This would on paper mean that it was always worthwhile to take a job. But in practice it will also be necessary to reduce the withdrawal rate for Income Support from its present anachronistic 100 per cent. When it comes to pensioners, the balance of argument is overwhelmingly on the side of selectivity, as the careful balancing of different incentive effects no longer applies. As Willetts remarks, several hundred million pounds to improve the Income Support that tops up the pensions for the minority of the elderly who need it will do far more good than billions spent in a wasteful, across-the-board increase in the basic pension rate. Yet Labour still persists in this primitive error. John Major himself has made a similar error in relation to Child Benefit, which is a wasteful form of churning between families. The sums would be much better used in improving income-related benefits and increasing their take-up. Different benefits and systems of payment have their embattled supporters. Instead, we should concentrate on what is transferred to whom and on what terms. Then at least we will be posing the right questions, even if there are no uniquely right answers to find.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Premature retirement  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Activity rates* (%)             Retirement age               50-54  55-59  60-64  65-69  70+     Actual   Statutory  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium       53.4   32.5   11.2    2.2   0.5      59.3      65/60 Denmark       85.6   74.4   39.3   17.4   3.0      62.7         67 France        74.5   50.4   14.3    3.8   1.0      59.6         60 Germany       75.7   61.4   22.7    5.6   1.8      61.0         65 Greece        62.0   49.7   32.7   15.1   4.2      63.0      65/60 Ireland       59.3   51.2   34.0   15.3   6.2      63.7         66 Italy         59.5   42.8   21.8    7.9   2.5      61.2         65 Luxembourg    58.7   40.4   16.2    3.5   0.0      60.1         65 Netherlands   61.4   44.8   15.0    5.5   2.7      60.4         65 Portugal      66.8   55.9   38.2   22.3   7.6      63.9      65/62 Spain         57.9   49.0   30.3    5.4   1.0      62.3         65 UK            78.7   68.0   38.0   10.8   3.0      62.5      65/60 EC average    69.1   53.4   25.1    7.6   2.2      61.3         65  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Proportion of age groups either in employment or registered unemployed Source: The Financing of Pensions in Europe: Challenges and Opportunities.

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELERS IRKED BY SURPRISE TAX ON FOREIGN BUYS  </P> <P> When Rita Carton visited Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand last summer she  thought she was getting a bargain when she purchased handsome custom-made  clothing, delicate silks and a watch.  </P> <P> But then she opened her mailbox last week to find the state of California had  the last word -- a bill for $110.16 in taxes.  </P> <P> "I was livid," said Carton, a buyer for a women's specialty store in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> It wasn't the amount of the tax that made her so angry, she said, but the fact  that when she left American soil last May she had no inkling that she would be  expected to pay a 6.5% tax on any goods she purchased and brought home with  her. Had she known about the tax, Carton said, she might have kept her spending  to a minimum.  </P> <P> "I've gone out of the country two or three times a year for the past five years  and never had to pay this tax before," she fumed. "Everybody knows they have to  pay (federal) duty when they bring more than a certain amount back, but this  state tax was totally out of the blue."  </P> <P> Carton is not alone. The State Board of Equalization has billed 4,000  California residents for "use taxes" owed on purchases made abroad last year.  </P> <P> By the end of 1990, board officials estimate that as many as 58,000 California  residents will have received the unwelcome notice to pay the state use tax,  which generally applies to any goods purchased out of state for use in  California.  </P> <P> They estimate the average foreign traveler will pay a tax of $160, which will  add a total of about $9.4 million in revenue to the state treasury each year.  </P> <P> Carton and others included in the first wave of billings called the agency last  week to protest.  </P> <P> "There was absolutely no notice of this. It was a total surprise. No one had  ever heard of it," said John Myers, the president of a small mining company in  King City who got a bill for $83.44 after a European trip.  </P> <P> Most states have a use tax, but California and North Dakota are the only ones  to attempt to apply it to all residents traveling overseas. Although residents  are supposed to pay a use tax on all goods purchased in other states as well,  the board has not found a way to enforce such a levy across the board.  </P> <P> However, officials said the new enforcement effort in California and North  Dakota is being watched closely by other states that might copy it if it is  successful.  </P> <P> The California tax bills will be sent to any state resident who traveled abroad  in 1989 and made a declaration with the U.S. Customs Service of goods purchased  in foreign countries. Taxpayers are given a four- to eight-week deadline to pay  the bill. If they fail to make the payment on time, they become subject to  penalties and interest charges.  </P> <P> Charles Cordell, the state board's assistant deputy director for business  taxes, said the tax has been on the books since 1935, but until recent months  it was rarely possible to enforce it on overseas purchases.  </P> <P> As it turns out, he said, California taxpayers have the Customs Service to  thank for this new opportunity to pay more taxes.  </P> <P> Cordell said state officials decided to begin enforcing the tax when they  learned that the customs agency had automated its files to such an extent that  it would be a relatively simple procedure to pull out documents filed by  California residents and turn them over to the state board for perusal.  </P> <P> "These declarations used to be kept in millions of files. We would have had to  send our whole staff out to paw through them if we wanted to enforce this tax,"  he said. "But as things were automated the information became easily available.  Then all we had to do was work out an arrangement with customs."  </P> <P> Once an agreement was reached with customs, the agency decided it would begin  to enforce the tax on all purchases made in 1989.  </P> <P> But officials acknowledge that when they made that decision they failed to  consider that most California residents who stepped onto a ship or airplane  destined for foreign lands would have no knowledge of the tax.  </P> <P> Delena Bratton, tax service specialist for the board, said in December the  agency distributed press releases and included notices about the new  enforcement of the tax in bulletins it sends to 900,000 businesses, but by then  most taxpayers had already taken their trips.  </P> <P> "Typically, when there is a new tax there is a lot of discussion about it  before it goes into effect. We lost the opportunity for information to get out  that way on this tax because it was a tax started in 1935. However, all of that  is not to say we shouldn't have done a better job of getting the word out," she  said.  </P> <P> The board is now trying to make up for its oversight, she said, by notifying  travel agents and accountants of the tax and posting notices at ports of entry.  </P> <P> Conway Collis, the new chairman of the Board of Equalization, said he has  received so many complaints about the tax that he may propose that the board  delay the enforcement until "proper notification can be made."  </P> <P> "It's outrageous that we didn't let anyone know about this before we enforced  it," he said. "The Board of Equalization is not out to get taxpayers as we have  shown by recent changes like the addition of a taxpayers' rights advocate to  our staff. (But) we obviously need to make sure that there is a standard  procedure for notifying taxpayers when a tax is being enforced. "  </P> <P> However, for Carton and Myers, notification is only part of the problem. To add  insult to injury, both said they were overcharged on their tax bills.  </P> <P> They said they should have been taxed at a rate that was in effect last summer  when they took their trips but instead they were taxed at a rate that was in  effect in December, when taxpayers were being charged an extra quarter of a  percent to help pay for earthquake relief.  </P> <P> Bratton acknowledged that the additional charge was a "mistake" and that a  similar error had been made on nearly all the tax bills that were distributed.  She said the agency would refund any amount over $10 that was due a taxpayer.  </P> <P> Myers, who traveled to Europe and purchased leather goods, jewelry and gifts  for family and friends, said the tax enforcement also appeared to be  "discriminatory" because travelers who purchased less than $400 worth of goods  do not have to make a customs declaration. The federal government only charges  a 10% duty tax when the total amount of a travelers' purchases exceeds $400.  </P> <P> "It (the state tax) should be paid by everyone not just those who exceed the  limit and file a declaration," Myers said.  </P> <P> Cordell acknowledged that there is no way the state can bill people who aren't  required to declare their purchases with customs.  </P> <P> "Technically they still owe us, and we would appreciate it if they would  contact us voluntarily and (pay the tax). The state needs the money," he said.  </P> <P> The California use tax was originally passed to protect state businesses who  were hurt by residents purchasing high-priced items out of state to avoid sales  taxes.  </P> <P> Cordell said the Board of Equalization already taxes automobiles, boats and  airplanes purchased out of state. But until the agreement with the Customs  Service, it was not cost-effective to collect the tax on most consumer goods  purchased overseas.  </P> <P> On her next trip, Carton, for one, plans to test how effective the board's new  program really is. She intends to re-enter the United States in Washington  state -- not California.  </P></p>

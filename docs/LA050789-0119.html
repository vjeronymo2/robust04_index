			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MARSHALL ISLANDS HOPE TO PROFIT ON IMPORTED GARBAGE;  </P> <P> U.S. TRASH MAY BE THEIR TREASURE  </P> <P> Bucking the global trend, a chain of Pacific islands is eyeing a  multimillion-dollar plan to import American garbage.  </P> <P> While countries around the world are giving a thumbs down to the international  trade in waste, the Marshall Islands sees profit and possible salvation from a  plan to import up to one-tenth of the nontoxic waste produced on the West  Coast.  </P> <P> The waste would be used as landfill to enlarge the chain of remote, low-lying  atolls. In return, the Marshall Islands would also get millions of dollars in  fees for the trash.  </P> <P> The nation's parliament passed a resolution in March authorizing President  Amata Kabua to negotiate a deal with a California-based company to ship  millions of tons of rubbish.  </P> <P> Several other Pacific islands have recently turned down similar deals offered  by U.S. firms to dispose of trash.  </P> <P> Admiralty Pacific Inc., a waste disposal company, hopes to begin transporting  garbage to the Marshalls, 4,200 miles southwest of the United States, by June,  1990, and eventually ship tens of millions of tons a year.  </P> <P> Kabua, who first endorsed the scheme last October after meeting with Admiralty  officials, says he wants the garbage for the money and for badly needed  landfill in the archipelago.  </P> <P> The atolls cover a 70-square-mile area and few of its islands rise more than 5  feet above the sea.  </P> <P> But the environmentalist group Greenpeace is accusing the company, which says  it wants to ship 10% of household waste produced on the U.S. West Coast, of  trying to evade American regulations on waste disposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> International Treaty  </P> <P> Most of the world's nations reached agreement on March 22 in Basel,  Switzerland, on an international treaty to control the export of hazardous  waste.  </P> <P> The convention aimed to curb what African countries called "garbage  imperialism," dumping of waste by the West in the Third World.  </P> <P> Admiralty's owner, Dan Fleming, says the company will respect Majuro and  Washington safety laws in shipping the waste to the Pacific nation, an  operation he says will be cheaper than transporting it by land to other parts  of the United States.  </P> <P> Imported waste is not a new concept to the 43,000 inhabitants of the Marshall  Islands, a double chain of low-lying coral atolls that Washington used as a  nuclear testing site in the 1950s.  </P> <P> Some 66 nuclear weapons were exploded on Bikini and Enewetak atolls at that  time, and some areas are still uninhabitable due to radiation contamination.  </P> <P> The islands were a former United Nations Trust Territory administered by  Washington until gaining semi-independence in 1986. They depend on U.S. aid for  90% of their government budget.  </P> <P> Members of Majuro's Parliament hotly debated the resolution on the garbage plan  before passing it on March 10 by a 20-3 majority. Critics raised fears that the  Marshalls might unknowingly end up importing toxic waste.  </P> <P> Sen. Hiroshi Yamamura, who represents an island contaminated by radioactive  fallout from the 1950s testing, said Majuro had no way to be sure that the  waste was safe.  </P> <P> "Do we really trust the Americans?" he asked in Parliament. "How can we know  that the so-called household garbage is nontoxic waste?"  </P> <P> "Admiralty Pacific may hide the toxic waste in order to get the money," said  Senator Tony de Brum. "More than 40 nations have turned down the U.S. offer  regarding the dumping proposal. Why should the Marshall Islands accept it?"  </P> <P> In the last year, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, the Solomon Islands and  Tonga have turned down a variety of waste disposal and incineration schemes  proposed by American firms.  </P> <P> Greenpeace estimates that a ton of American household garbage contains 20  pounds of toxic material, such as cleaning fluids, lead-based paints and  pesticides, and that their removal would make a deal like the one proposed by  Admiralty unprofitable.  </P> <P> President Kabua, who hopes to bring in as much as $56 million a year importing  the trash, and his cousin and sponsor of the resolution, Sen. Imata Kabua, said  Majuro could hire scientists to evaluate the safety of the plan.  </P> <P> The Majuro government says the plan still depends on the completion of  environmental, landfill and other studies to see if it will benefit the  Marshall Islands.  </P> <P> Admiralty is expected to complete an engineering feasibility study, which it  began in January, this month.  </P> <P> The British pressure group Ark said last month that global warming because of  the pollution-induced "greenhouse effect" could raise the world's sea levels by  more than 15 feet over the next 60 years.  </P> <P> If such studies prove true, the Marshalls could be totally submerged.  </P></p>

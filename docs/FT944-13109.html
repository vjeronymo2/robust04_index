			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers in advance of economic data Wall Street US share prices rallied yesterday morning after five losing sessions in a row, with a firmer bond market encouraging buying ahead of today's important economic data, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 26.92 higher at 3,875.15, its best level of the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 3.23 at 465.84. Volume was heavy, with 329m shares traded on the Big Board. In the other leading markets, the American SE composite was 1.56 better at 455.09, and the Nasdaq composite was up 4.23 at 767.47. Bargain hunters were finally lured back into the market after five days in which the Dow industrials retreated by about 88 points. Early on, the advance was modest. Many investors were waiting until after today's initial estimate of third-quarter economic growth before making fresh commitments. Most were resigned in the expectation that gross domestic product would come in at 3 per cent, stronger than forecast a few weeks ago. Expectations of a mid-November move by the Federal Reserve to lift rates again restrained any genuine enthusiasm. On a positive note, the Treasury market was showing half-hearted signs of life, with traders squaring their positions ahead of the GDP data. The gains, supported by slight improvement by the dollar against the yen and D-Mark, were modest at best, but enough to provide a neutral backdrop for stocks. The day's only economic news was a dip in last week's initial claims for unemployment benefit. Despite its inflationary implications, the announcement was not particularly compelling when viewed in isolation. In this vacuum, a fresh batch of earnings news provided some grist for the mill, allowing most stocks to grind higher as the afternoon progressed. By the end of the session, indices were showing impressive gains in a rebound which was largely driven by technical factors. Airline stocks were in demand, amid more signs that the US industry may have turned a corner in the third quarter in its quest for financial stability. UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 89, while Delta Air Lines was marked up Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 49 1/4 , both on better-than-expected performances. AMR, parent of American, added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 52 3/4, having posted strong results earlier in the reporting season. By contrast, Dow Chemical added just Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 73 5/8, despite third-quarter sales climbing to their second highest level in the company's history, and net income of Dollars 1.04 a share being 25 per cent better than Wall Street had anticipated. Allied-Signal, a diversified industrial group, receded Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 after matching the consensus forecast of 67 cents a share. Xerox, down Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 102, suffered a setback even though its results were much better than analysts had expected. Pitney Bowes, the world's largest manufacturer of postal meters, dropped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 . Its results statement included details of a restructuring plan which would eliminate 2,000 jobs. In banking, Citicorp gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 on a published report which commented favourably on the stock's growth potential.</p>

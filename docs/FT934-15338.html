			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Strong PC demand helps lift Intel to record quarter INTEL, the world's largest computer chip maker, yesterday reported record revenue and earnings for the third quarter. Net income increased 143 per cent over last year's corresponding quarter, while revenues advanced 57 per cent. Intel, the dominant supplier of microprocessor 'brain' chips for personal computers, is riding on a wave of strong demand for PCs. The company's 486 DX2 microprocessor has become the 'workhorse of business computing', said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive. Net income was Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with Dollars 241m, or 56 cents, in last year's third quarter. Revenue for the quarter rose to Dollars 2.24bn, up from Dollars 1.43bn last time. The company said its nine-month revenue and net income exceeded the corresponding totals for all 1992. For the first nine months of 1993, net income advanced to Dollars 1.7bn, or Dollars 3.86 a share, from Dollars 638m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue was Dollars 6.39bn, up 60 per cent. Earnings were in line with Wall Street's expectations, but failed to match the most optimistic projections. Intel's stock price closed at Dollars 65 1/2 , down Dollars 4 3/4 from a Friday close of Dollars 70 1/4 , in heavy trading. Intel said it expected to ship 'hundreds of thousands' of its latest microprocessors, called Pentium, this year and millions next year. It added that about 100 Pentium-based computers will be launched by computer manufacturers later this year. The company said strong demand for other semiconductor products, including flash memory chips and microcontrollers, contributed to its strong third-quarter revenues. During the quarter two other chip manufacturers announced plans to compete with Intel in the PC microprocessor market. Texas Instruments of the US and United Microelectronics of Taiwan are the latest entrants into a growing field of Intel 'clone' chip makers. Sun Microsystems announced yesterday that it had set up a sales and distribution organisation for Sparc microprocessors and supporting chips, manufactured by Texas Instruments and other licensees. Sparc chips are used in Sun's computer workstations. The move represents Sun's latest effort to establish Sparc as an alternative standard to Intel's microprocessors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Attorney General's office (PGR) has denied it  wrote a confidential report that was published yesterday by EL  FINANCIERO. The document makes various comments on the last six  presidential terms and issues some statements, which the PGR  called undignified and groundless. A PGR communique said the  contents of the confidential report, which was signed by two of  the newspaper's reporters, was not prepared by any of its  agencies because its functions "have nothing to do with the  analyses the reporters make in the document." In turn, the PGR  claims it is not responsible for the document.</p>

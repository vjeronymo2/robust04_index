			<p>BFN     [Text] Communist Party [PC] Secretary General Alejandro  Mosquera denied yesterday that the party would be dissolved.  Mosquera said the reports were "journalistic interpretations,"  stressing that "the PC will help the Grand Front to develop,  working with others as a group."    The press report saying that the PC would be dissolved and  later reappear as a new force within the Grand Front provoked  "surprise and indignation" among the party ranks. Mosquera  admitted, however, that "an internal proposal was made before 10  April" which sought "to give new life to the party." The bitter  infighting within the PC increased following the Grand Front's  spectacular growth. The old guard that makes up the current PC  leadership has suggested few, very few, figures for the  alliance: One example is Attorney Eduardo Barcesat. The  candidacy of Patricio Echegaray for the position of secretary  general, for instance, was rejected by the other front members.    "The key to the success of the front was to appeal to  different political groups. The Grand Front ticket included  Communist as well as other party leaders. This plurality was  the key to the 10 April election success," Mosquera said. PC  leader Horacio Lopez denied they ever considered dissolving the  historic PC. He said: "We are witnessing a new maneuver to  derail the left at a time the party is consolidating its  position as a valid alternative to the social and economic  model. The intention is to create uncertainty and confusion  among authentic progressive forces, seeking to reduce their real  electoral possibilities in 1995." Communist leaders Eduardo  Barcesat and Maria Ines Brasesco were elected as constituent  members in the recent election. Their importance within the  alliance, however, is minimum.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edward Chan and Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, May 21 (CNA) -- An Argentine Navy  corvette shot at a Taiwan fishing vessel on Friday [20 May],  damaging it with machine-gun and cannon fire after the vessel  refused to halt after being caught poaching in Argentine waters,  an Argentine Navy news release said Friday.    The communique said the vessel, which was sighted fishing  160  miles off the coast of San Julian Friday morning, was initially  identified as the Hin Van Sing, but on closer inspection the  Navy noticed that the ship's name was different from the one  painted on its lifeboats. Suspecting that the boat was poaching,  the corvette ordered it to stop so it could be inspected.    The fishing boat ignored the command and took off in a  northeasterly direction toward the Falkland Islands, with the  corvette in hot pursuit, prompting the gunfire. The fishing boat  was reportedly hit in the hull, and was losing fuel as the  Argentine Navy continued to trail it.    The vessel was expected to be forcibly intercepted and  boarded Saturday.    An agency for several fishing vessels from Taiwan in  Argentina, however, said Saturday that, based on information it  received from an Argentina naval base in the southern part of  Argentina, it had determined the fishing boat was Korean.    The Taiwan Tuna Fishery Association also said that no  fishing  boat registered with the association is operating off the  Argentine coast, nor is any boat named the Hin Van Sing  registered with it.    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry in Taipei said ROC [Republic  of China] officials stationed near San Julian would investigate  the incident.    The government will offer necessary legal assistance and  medical care for boat crew members, ministry officials said.  They also called on Taiwan fishing boats to adhere to  international laws when fishing away from Taiwan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bill To Allow Fascist Party </F> Withdrawn"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 20 -- The bill proposal to modify  articles of the Constitution which ban the re-organization of  the Fascist Party and the return of male members of the House of  Savoy, Italy's former royal family, has been withdrawn.    The bill had been presented at the start of the new  legislature by the National Alliance, born form the neo-fascist  MSI [Italian Social Movement]. The MSI traditionally presented  such a proposal at the start of each legislature, but its  presentation by the National Alliance [AN] raised an outcry  given that the National Alliance had promised that it was  "post-fascist" when entering the government coalition.    The withdrawal of the request had been pre-announced by  National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini and was presented by  Vincenzo Trantino, of the National Alliance, also on behalf of  the bill's original sponsors.    The government of Premier Silvio Berlusconi has been under  pressure from both the Left opposition at home and its European  partners for the presence in the executive of five ministers  from the National Alliance branded as neo-fascist. Repeated  calls had been made, in fact, for members of the National  Alliance to repudiate fascist ideology.    The MSI, Italian Social Movement, was formed by members of  Mussolini's end-of-the-war Italian Social Republic.</p>

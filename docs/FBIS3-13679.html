			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent Nahum Barne'a: "The </F> Goldstein Tax"]    [Text] Yesterday Rabin promised to give the PLO an advance  payment for the massacre in Hebron. At this stage, we are  talking about a symbolic payment, about gestures, about Israeli  measures which will somewhat ease the life of the Arabs in  Hebron.    We are not talking about reopening the Oslo and Cairo  agreements, pulling the settlers out of Hebron, or deploying an  international force, as 'Arafat demanded.    Perhaps we are talking about lifting the curfew, handing the  central bus station in Hebron back to the Arabs, giving more  authority to the qadi in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a plan for  a Palestinian policing force which would be controlled by Israel  but would get its authority from the PLO.    Of course, this is only the beginning. Rabin promised to  pay, and Rabin keeps his promises: He will pay. This will be  the Goldstein tax.    The ideas Israel raised to date about the form of payment  have been rejected by Tunis. They were "nonstarters," just as  'Arafat's demands were "nonstarters" as far as Rabin was  concerned. However, the principle was established. The  Americans will be the ones who will set the final price tag.    Half a year ago, on a hot and steamy day, Rabin and 'Arafat  shook hands on the White House lawn. Then they said the  Gaza-Jericho agreement would be signed on 13 December. Then  they put it off to 13 January, and later to 13 April.    Yesterday, on a bone-chilling day, Rabin spoke for the first  time about early summer as the new date for the signing of the  agreement.    When the date of Rabin's visit was set, Israel thought it  would be the opening shot for practical talks with Syria.  However, this was not the case, which is also part of the  Goldstein tax. Last night Rabin confirmed that Israel cannot  wave the threat of reaching a separate agreement with Syria in  'Arafat's face. "It would boomerang against us," he said, "the  Syrians will not show up before the Palestinians return to the  negotiating table."    It was a melancholic visit.    The President, who had just returned from an exhausting  political campaign in New Hampshire, almost fell asleep at the  podium. Secretary of State Christopher, just back from Asia,  listened to Rabin's remarks amid a deep slumber. Everybody has  been through a lot since September, and none of it has been  good. Rabin said Israeli prime ministers used to come to  Washington with shopping bags. "The only item in my bag is  promoting peace," he asserted.    Rabin could not say whether he was leaving Washington with a  full bag. He will have to fill up his bag with goods when he  gets back home.</p>

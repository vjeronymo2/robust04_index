			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Cambodia' -- The Unending Problem"] </F>   [Text] The Cambodian problem remains unsolved as the  negotiations between the Cambodian Government and the Khmer  Rouge, which continues to cling to its long-held territory, have  become an exercise in bargaining for power. The negotiations in  Pyongyang and Phnom Penh have failed, and therefore, national  reconciliation have not materialized. Both sides will continue  to wage a war. The government side will try to suppress and  seize the Khmer Rouge-held territory, while the Khmer Rouge will  try to keep what it has.    The situation after the latest round of negotiation appears  to be increasingly tense, as the Cambodian Government ordered  the closure of the Khmer Rouge liaison office in Phnom Penh and  eviction of the office personnel. The government said the  safety of the personnel is at risk from possible attacks by  indignant Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge's Khieu Samphan was once  physically attacked by an angry mob in Phnom Penh.    The fact is that a majority of the Cambodian people despise  the Khmer Rouge for the murders it committed and troubles it  caused them during its 1975-1979 rule. The Khmer Rouge and its  foreign allies must accept this fact and understand the feelings  of the Cambodian people. It is not unusual that a majority of  the international community have determinedly refused to accept  the Khmer Rouge apology.    Moreover, the U.S. support is a factor that contributes to  the Cambodian Government's increasingly aggressive position  toward the Khmer Rouge. The United States has sent military  advisers to train Cambodian Government soldiers. Certainly,  military hardware is also given to the Phnom Penh government.  The U.S. assistance has strengthened the Phnom Penh  government's military position. In the meantime, the Khmer  Rouge's military position is likely to weaken as time passes due  to the absence of support of the majority of the population.    In such a situation, the tendency is that there will be  intense fighting as the Phnom Penh government steps up its  drastic suppression of the Khmer Rouge to seize its territory  with the aid of the United States and its Western allies. For  Thailand, there will be repercussions from the war in the forms  of stray shells and influx of fleeing Cambodians. The Thai  Government will have to formulate measures to prevent suspicion  of the international community about its support of the Khmer  Rouge. There are people who continue to refuse to understand  Thailand, as evidenced by the imagination of the former U.S.  ambassador to Thailand regarding Thai support of the Khmer Rouge.</p>

In reply to a question as to whether  the pardons have anything to do with the visit of the Council of  Europe rapporteurs, Chebeleu answered in the affirmative, to the  extent that some of the rapporteurs have brought up the issue of  certain interventions made by the Democratic Union of Hungarians  in Romania [UDMR] in this respect.    In connection with President Iliescu's meeting with the  chief  editors of the main dailies on 21 March, Traian Chebeleu said  that two letters are now being drafted to be sent to Petre Mihai  Bacanu [chief editor of ROMANIA LIBERA] and Ion Cristoiu [chief  editor of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI], explaining the exact purpose of  the meeting.    The spokesman denied rumors that the government has revised  its decision to appoint General Niculae Spiroiu as our country's  representative at NATO headquarters in Brussels.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Shake-up limits Xerox A change in the organisation of Xerox's US salesforce disrupted first-quarter sales and helped hold back revenue growth and profits, the document processing company reported yesterday. Xerox reported net income of Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.77 a share, against a loss of Dollars 529m, or Dollars 5.68, in the same period of last year when it took accounting charges. Income from the core document processing business was Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.12, against Dollars 103m, or 91 cents, last year, while revenues were unchanged at Dollars 3.3bn. The results were helped by a one-time Dollars 17m Brazilian tax benefit, and pre-tax profits on the document processing side were essentially unchanged. The company said lower equipment sales and weakness in the Japanese economy, which hit profits of Fuji Xerox, had been offset by continued expense control, including 800 job cuts in the first quarter. Document processing revenues grew 2 per cent, excluding currency factors, with new digital products showing growth of 34 per cent. But revenues from black and white copiers were down 2 per cent.</p>

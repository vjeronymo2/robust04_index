			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on a news agency report on an intiative  by the Political Bureau of the Socialist Party to halt the  fighting, a responsible official source said this proposal is  only one of a host of false statements designed to mislead world  public opinion, just as the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] has  been doing since the fabrication of the crisis on 19 August  1993. It began the crisis with its dialogue among the  government coalition leadership, down to the points declared by  the Socialist Party as a condition for the termination of the  fabricated crisis. It continued its policy after the issue was  referred to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and after  the pledge and accord document was prepared as it tried to foil  the efforts put into this document by igniting the military  situation in Abyan Governorate on the eve of its signing, 20  February.    The latest [as heard] Socialist Party lie was its disavowal  of what was stated in the first part of the military section of  the pledge and accord document. That exposed disavowal was  accompanied by a serious escalation in the military situation  and the kindling of war on Wednesday, 4 May. The source said  the secessionist gang in the Socialist Party is responsible for  starting and continuing the fighting and that the proper way out  of the present situation is the Socialist Party's abidance by  the following:    1. Acceptance of constitutional legitimacy and its  legislative and executive institutions.    2. Prevention of the gang of rebellion and secession in the  Socialist Party leadership from issuing orders to the units  under its control.    3. Subjection of these units to the constitutional  institutions and legitimate leadership elected by them.    The source said he hoped that the Socialist Party leaders  who  were not dragged into the schemes of the gang of rebellion and  secession will shoulder their responsibility and deter this  gang, which lost its party legitimacy after igniting the  military situation and insisting on the continuation of fighting  in implementation of its secessionist plan, which seeks to  fragment the homeland.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean economic  cooperation will be limited to tourism and joint investment in  such export-oriented industries as textiles and footwear even  after the ongoing nuclear dispute, the biggest hurdle to  bilateral economic links, is solved peacefully, an Economic  Planning Board (EPB) official said Friday.    Speaking at a meeting of lawmakers on the outlook for  South-North economic cooperation, Pae Yong-sik, the deputy  director general of the EPB's International Economic Policy  Bureau, also said the North would likely open very limited parts  of its territory such as the Rajin and Sonbong special economic  district along the Tuman River in order to cut off the North  Korean community from South Koreans.    Stressing the need to proceed slowly on Seoul-Pyongyang  economic cooperation, Pae said, "a lot of things have to be  considered for the Tuman River area development program, which  needs more than 30 billion dollars in funding and coordination  of the interests of concerned countries."    The EPB official noted that the Tuman River program should  be  treated as a multilateral project, not as one between Seoul and  Pyongyang.    "It is desirable for the government to act as the sole agent  for economic cooperation with the North in the initial stage to  establish order," the official said, adding that private  companies could later do business with the North on their own.</p>

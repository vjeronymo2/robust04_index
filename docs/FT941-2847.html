			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods falls to Pounds 9m asGerman recession bites Attwoods, the UK waste man-agement company, yesterday announced a sharper than expected 53 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 8.98m as the effects of severe recession in Germany began to bite. The company also said it was planning to strengthen its board with three non-executive appointments. The first would be Mr Mark Radcliffe, a director of the London Stock Exchange. The others would be named soon, Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said. Laidlaw, the Canadian group which owns 35 per cent of Attwoods and has three directors on the board, yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to the UK company. Mr Jim Bullock, Laidlaw's chief executive, said he did not intend to maintain the status quo with Attwoods in the long term. But, 'we are not in any way poised to sell our position,' he added. Attwoods, meanwhile, stressed the rest of the year would be difficult. Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said full-year profits were expected to be lower after a series of one-off charges. Mr Foreman was more optimistic about 1995 however. 'I believe real growth will show through then,' he said. There were signs of an improvement in the UK, with landfill prices expected to firm after the introduction of environmental legislation in May. Pre-tax profits for the six months to January 31 were hit by the final Pounds 2.7m exceptional costs of settling protracted litigation in the US. The previous year had also been flattered by some Pounds 5m in currency gains. At the operating level, excluding litigation costs, profits were 12 per cent lower at Pounds 16.26m. Sales were 9 per cent higher at Pounds 178.49m. The UK returned the best performance, with a 39 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 2m on sales 17 per cent ahead to Pounds 30.4m. Mainland Europe suffered from the sharp downturn in Germany, and operating profits fell by 40 per cent from DM13.2m to DM7.9m (Pounds 3.07m) on sales 4 per cent lower at DM81.4m. US profits, which suffered from losses in the medical waste operation as a result of price pressure, fell from Dollars 21.2m to Dollars 13.8m (Pounds 9.4m) on sales Dollars 2m lower at Dollars 171.6m. The dividend is held at 1.75p. Earnings fell from 5.27p to 1.97p per share. COMMENT Attwoods shares are likely to be overshadowed by Laidlaw's future intentions, the problems in Germany and exposure to very mature markets. While the good news is that significant progress has been made on improving the balance sheet, and prices are firming in the UK, doubts remain about margins in other parts of the world. Forecasts were downgraded from about Pounds 30m to about Pounds 23m after a disappointing second quarter. This puts the shares on a prospective p/e of about 22, which looks fully valued.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CEGB: unlikely origins of readiness for a crisis Sir, The inside story of the CEGB's role during the miners' strike of 1984-85 ('We kept the home fires burning', April 23/24) is a hair-raising thriller. As a former board member for engineering of the CEGB, I am able to add an ironical footnote about the oil-burning stations which played a vital part in maintaining the nation's electricity supply. The new plant programmes which gave us Fawley, Grain, Ince B, Kingsworth, Littlebrook C and Pembroke were embarked upon during the 1960s as a direct result of the CEGB's fear of a coal crisis. This was not an example of outstanding prescience on our part; we had heard neither of Arthur Scargill nor Margaret Thatcher, and Walter Marshall was the name of a bright young physicist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Our fear was not directly of the National Union of Mineworkers but of the National Coal Board, which seemed unable to manage its labour relations and had shown itself willing to take more than reasonable advantage of its captive customer, the CEGB. We feared worse to come and decided to increase our heavy fuel oil buying capability. The crisis which broke roughly 23 years later was not the one we had envisaged. The CEGB's response had two main features: equipment which proved more than equal to the task (oil burning, nuclear and other generating stations); and a group of men who recognised their statutory duty to provide the nation with a power supply and had the determination and ingenuity to carry it out.

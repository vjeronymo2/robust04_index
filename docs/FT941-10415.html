			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines returns to the black Northwest Airlines, the US carrier planning a flotation on the US stock market by the end of next month, scraped into profitability in the fourth quarter with net income of Dollars 10.5m compared with net losses of Dollars 695.2m last time. The company said yesterday that the figure would have been higher without the impact of an Dollars 85m accounting charge relating to new labour contracts. Operating profits were Dollars 74.8m compared with operating losses of Dollars 185.4m last time, it said. For the full year, the airline reported a turnround from operating losses of Dollars 376.2m to operating profits of Dollars 292.4m. But it was still in the red after tax, showing net losses of Dollars 115.3m compared with losses of Dollars 1.08bn last time. The previous year's figures included non-recurring pre-tax charges of Dollars 792.7m. Northwest Airlines left the stock market in 1989 when it underwent a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out. It narrowly escaped bankruptcy last year by persuading employees to accept a 37.5 per cent equity stake in the company in return for labour concessions valued at Dollars 886m over three years. USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority stake, yesterday intensified airline competition in the US domestic market by announcing widespread fare cuts on services departing from 96 of the 213 cities it serves. The cuts are more radical than the special offers announced by several other US airlines in the last few weeks because they have no special conditions attached and will stay in force indefinitely. USAir, which serves mainly the eastern half of the US, said some of the cuts had been made in response to fares being offered by low-cost competitors like Continental Airways and Southwest Airlines, and others had been made to discourage low-cost operators from entering its markets.</p>

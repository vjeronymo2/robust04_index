			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by WEN WEI PO Washington special </F> correspondent Chu Hsing-fu (2612 6580 4395): "United States  Should Not Apply MFN as a Weapon"]    [Text] Washington, 30 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- The American  Enterprise Institute, an important U.S. Republican think tank,  held a luncheon in Washington today to mark the publication of a  new book on China. Entitled "Transcend MFN [Most Favored  Nation] Status -- Trade With China and U.S. Interest," the book  is co-edited by James Roderick Lilley, former U.S. assistant  secretary of defense and former U.S. ambassador to China, and  Wendell L. Willkie II, former acting deputy secretary of  commerce. Its chief authors include Dave Lampton, president of  the All-American Committee for U.S.-Chinese Relations.    The book reviews the complicated economic, strategic, and  human rights issues facing U.S. decision-makers today. In  addition to their speeches today, the editors and authors  stressed in the book that the United States should see further  in handling U.S.-Chinese relations. The resolution of human  rights and trade issues should be separated. They indicated  that almost all countries in the world, regardless of their  human rights conditions, enjoy MFN status granted by the United  States. If the the United States were to apply MFN status as a  weapon with which to threaten China, this would run counter to  U.S. interests.  <H5>  It Does Not Pay for the United States To Upset China </H5>   Democrat Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, wrote a preface to the book in which he discusses the  importance of U.S.-Chinese relations from four angles. In the  preface, Hamilton indicates that political stability in China is  in line with U.S. interests, whereas upsetting the Chinese  Government or dividing China is not in U.S. interests. A  Chinese Government that has rallying force, is highly efficient,  and is concerned with the well-being of its people is in line  with U.S. interests because in this case the international  community does not have to provide the 1.2 billion Chinese  people with clothing, food, housing, transportation, employment,  and medical services and care.    Economically, China's economic development has improved the  people's material life, and at the same time has promoted  gradual political democratization. All these changes are in  line with U.S. interests. The United States should offer a  helping hand to China in its economic modernization and reform;  in turn, the United States will benefit. The Memorandum of  Understanding on Market Access signed between the United States  and China, the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights  Protection, and the consideration in accepting China's  application to restore its GATT membership, are all useful  apparatuses to guarantee mutual benefit and interest in  U.S.-Chinese economic relations.    From the angle of security, a militarily powerful China that  does not pose a threat to regional peace is in line with U.S.  interests. The best way to prevent a tense situation in the  region and to control the arms race is to unfold multilateral  regional security talks aimed at increasing transparency,  establishing mutual trust, and encouraging military restraint.  In addition, the United States needs to adopt a cooperative  attitude with China in controling the proliferation of  biochemical and guided-missile weapons and in limiting nuclear  tests.    From a diplomatic angle, a China that continues to work hard  with the United States and other countries to resolve  complicated world issues in the wake of the Cold War is in line  with U.S. interests. China is one of the five permanent members  of the UN Security Council. That China should make positive  contributions to the resolution of international problems is far  better than otherwise, and better still than creating additional  trouble for the international community. To promote global  peace and stability, to prevent the further worsening of  nature's ecological environment, and to crack down on drug  production and trafficking, the United States should win China's  support as best it can.  <H5>  The Old, Amended Act Is Out of Date </H5>   In the preface, Hamilton also indicates: From a long-range  view, U.S. decision-makers should not cancel China's MFN status.  The Jackson-Vanek amendment, which sets out guidance on  granting MFN status, and the practice of extending MFN status  conditionally, were policies and measures formulated in  different times which aimed to achieve different policy goals.  Time has passed and circumstances have changed. What U.S.  political leaders should consider today is transcending China's  MFN status and formulating a sound policy capable of protecting  and promoting U.S. national interests.    In the book, Lampton, president of the All-American  Committee  for U.S.-Chinese Relations, reviews the importance of  U.S.-Chinese relations, and indicates the reasons for the  difficult situation the U.S. Government faces on the issue of  human rights. He said: The United States must acknowledge the  tremendous social and political changes underway in China. If  the United States hopes to promote its value concepts  effectively, it should add fuel to China's engine, not try to  shut off the fuel pump. However, should the United States  regard China's MFN status as some kind of hostage, it will never  control the direction of development in the situation. This  being the case, the United States should formulate a realistic,  sustained, and constructive policy toward China.    Directing his remarks at some people in the U.S. Government  and Congress who say there is need to selectively sanction  China's state-owned enterprises, Lampton indicates that the  practice of sanctioning or selectively sanctioning China's  state- owned enterprises would be wrong and would not work  because the U.S. Customs would find it very difficult to tell  which products are those of state-owned enterprises and which  are not. Furthermore, the raw materials and semifinished goods  of many of China's state- owned enterprises are supplied by  enterprises in the private sector of the economy or by  foreign-funded enterprises. If the United States were to  partially cancel China's MFN status, this would lead inevitably  to the Chinese side's taking retaliatory action in trade. Then  where would the United States find new markets for its wheat,  aircraft, electronics, telecommunications, and power-generating  equipment?!  <H5>  It Is Wise To Talk Less About Human Rights From Now On </H5>   In the book, James Roderick Lilley, former assistant  secretary of defense and currently director of Chinese Studies  at the American Enterprise Institute, indicates that the United  States has been deeply involved in Asian affairs for a long  time, thus guaranteeing peace and security in Asia. The greater  the pressure the Clinton administration places on China  concerning the human rights issue, the tougher will be the  Chinese stance and the smaller the concessions it will make.  Should China's MFN status be cancelled, the United States will  pay a very high price in international issues, and the  foundation for peaceful cooperation and competition between the  United States and China will be jeopardized.    Ambassador Lilley indicates that in the Asian Conference on  Human Rights held in Bangkok in March 1993, 38 out of 39  countries were for the human rights position of China and  Indonesia. If the United Sates were to cancel China's MFN  status, this move would compel the Asian countries to lean  toward China and to keep their distance from the United States;  consequently, U.S. influence in Asia would be reduced and the  fruits of U.S. diplomatic efforts over the years would go down  the drain. Should such a scenario surface, it would be tragic.  This being the case, if the Clinton administration does not  want to cancel China's MFN status, it should stop its all-too-  frequent verbal condemnation of China. Furthermore, it should  not overemphasize the human rights issue from now on.</p>

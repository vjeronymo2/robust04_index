			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Milhaud and Honegger - Record Review TWO of the century's leading composers, Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger, celebrate their centenary this year. About the least important thing about them is their belonging to the short-lived group Les Six. Even during the early Twenties Milhaud and Honegger wrote much music that had nothing to do with that remarkably successful PR operation. None the less they were regarded as pillars of the avant-garde, surviving that precarious status to become respected figures. Honegger died in his sixties, Milhaud outlived him by 20 years. He wrote such a quantity of music that it is hard to find one's bearings. The shoal of recordings published for the centenary, some new, many transfers to CD, give a fair idea of his range and versatility. So many works are involved that one cannot name them all, let alone give a complete list of performers. The two single-disc 'volumes' The Darius Milhaud centenary on the Praga label are live performances recorded in Prague over the past two decades - Milhaud's music has long appealed to Central Europeans. Two distinguished visitors are included among the Czech performers. Many of the recordings, like the fine Violin Sonata no. 2 of 1918, were made at a time when technical means were limited. Rough surface does not dull the passionate playing of the Belgian violinist, Andre Gertler. This first 'volume' (PR 250 007) is titled, not quite accurately, 'Musician of the twenties'. The only work from the ambiance of Les Six is the inescapable Le Boeuf sur le toit. In this, and in the Carnaval d'Aix for piano and orchestra, rhythms are a shade stiff - a reminder that Bohemia is a long, long way from Brazil. The second 'volume' (PR 250 008), is all chamber music. It includes the familiar Suite d'apres Corrette for three winds and the irresistible Chansons de negresse sung by Brigitte Fassbaender. Most valuable, because it is becoming clear that his choral music is among his finest, are the Two Poems by Blaise Cendrars for unaccompanied voices. There are two striking choral works among Chant du Monde's Darius Milhaud (LDC 278 1069). La Mort du tyran ('The death of the tyrant') is a setting of an extraordinary piece of rhythmic prose by Diderot, from the Latin, describing the Roman mob furiously clamouring for a successor to an unpopular emperor. Le Chateau du feu ('The castle of fire') was written later, after the holocaust, for a big manifestation in honour of the French Resistance. Small orchestra, antiphonal chorus, grinding dissonance. A disturbing, harrowing work. The ever-welcome Suite provencale brings balm, likewise the miniature song-cycle Catalogue de fleurs, limpidly sung by Irene Joachim, a famous Melisande whose name is not given. Nor does one find the names of the bodies who, under the composer's direction, sing and speak the two choral works so ferociously. Also new is DG's record (435 437-2) of the Symphonies Nos 1 and 2 with the invaluable Michel Plasson conducting the Capitole Orchestra of Toulouse. These symphonies come from the series for large orchestra begun in 1939 with a commission from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. They are distinct from the earlier 'chamber' symphonies, one of which is included in the first Praga volume. Textures tend to be thick and busy (it may be relevant that Milhaud admired the paintings of Kokoschka) but there is plenty to enjoy once you accept that he wasn't writing in the Viennese classical tradition. The purely Mediterranean side of Milhaud can be heard in his piano music, much of it simple, presumably intended for private use. In the solo disc from Arcobaleno (Darius Milhaud 1892-1974, SBCD-5400) there is an engaging, lyrical melancholy about the two Printemps suites and Automne, the latter written after a visit to Portugal. Automne ends with an 'Adieu' as haunting as a distant fado. The sympathetic pianist is Billy Eidi. The other centenarian, Honegger, makes his appearance on a Pearl disc (Honegger and Milhaud conduct their own music, GEMM CD 9459) which revives some very old memories. Honegger's once celebrated picture of a steam locomotive, Pacific 231 remains a successful genre piece. The companion piece Rugby is less convincing. The main attraction is Milhaud's La Creation du monde, a smoky masterpiece made out of blues and Bach. It was this performance by crack French wind players that won me for Milhaud's music years ago. Honegger takes the stage by himself in the Erato transfer to a single CD (2292-45800-2) of the 1971 recording of the once widely popular 'symphonic psalm' Le Roi David. Charles Dutoit conducts, with Eda-Pierre and Eric Tappy among the soloists. This is Honegger at his most Swiss - skilled, solid, wood-smelling craftmanship and fresh if not blazingly vital ideas. The original scoring for chamber orchestra is used. It proves surprisingly effective, especially in dramatic moments where one might expect the contrary (the scene with the Witch of Endor is one example). Even with Jean Desailly to speak them, the narrations somehow suggest a grown-up Peter and the Wolf (recitative was right out of fashion). But for much of the time King David still makes good and grateful listening. The transfer is admirably done.</p>

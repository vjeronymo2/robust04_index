			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Israel and PLO draft protocols Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday began drafting a protocol for withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho, Julian Ozanne reports from Taba. Both sides started drafting paragraphs on agreed issues such as the role and deployment of Palestinian policemen ahead of talks on unresolved matters such as the size of the Jericho enclave and border crossings control. PLO officials insisted the Taba talks were not limited to what Israel calls the 'Cairo understandings' that emerged last month. The PLO delegation, headed by Mr Nabil Shaath, appeared to have changed negotiating strategy on the size of Jericho, focusing on specific geographical demands rather than a specific area of square kilometres.</p>

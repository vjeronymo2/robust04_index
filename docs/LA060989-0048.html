			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Barbara Kruger is shaping up to be one of the most important artists to emerge  from New York in the '80s. Combining the unabashed emotionality of  Neo-Expressionism, the media savvy of Appropriationism, and the rigorous  austerity of Conceptualism, her work conducts an aggressive inquiry into  exactly what transpires in the countless social, sexual and political contracts  that define our lives. With a background in graphic design, Kruger has a keen  understanding of the ways we're effected by the subtle interplay of words and  images, and much of her work deals with the power of mass media and the  advertising industry.  </P> <P> Like that of Jenny Holzer, Kruger's work has the look of propaganda, and in  fact that's exactly what it is: propaganda for the idea that one should be  aware that things are rarely as they appear to be and one has a responsibility  to look beyond surfaces. In this body of work, she raises such questions as who  is bought and sold? Who is beyond the law? Who is free to choose? The artist  provides a hint of an answer to these questions with her provocative  juxtaposition of image and text. "Who is Beyond the Law" is illustrated with a  fistful of money, while "Who Is Free To Choose" is paired with an image of two  little girls playing with a puppet. A Kruger work dealing with the Pledge of  Allegiance is also currently on view as part of the "Forest of Signs" show at  MOCA. (Fred Hoffman Gallery, 912 Colorado Ave., to July 1.)

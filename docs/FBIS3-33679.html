			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Mashhur, deputy leader of the Muslim </F> Brotherhood: "The Bats Wouldn't Survive in this Light"]    [Text] The world today is witnessing a growing Islamic  awakening fashioned by God and carried out by Islamic movements  all over the world. This Islamic awakening is growing and  surging, thanks to our Lord and His care, despite the attempts  of the enemies of Islam, here and abroad, to harm and wipe it  out.    Even after their war against Russia and the collapse of  communism, the enemies in the West consider Islam and the  Muslims the enemies that must be fought with all efforts. They  have kept NATO and are currently trying to bolster it and  increase its members.    Several regimes in our Arab and Islamic countries responded  to this tendency by world enemies. Those regimes persecuted and  subdued the Islamic trend and tortured and intimidated its  members in a bid to terrorize this trend and prevent the public  from cooperating with it.    But the Islamic nations, which adhere to their religion,  have  discovered that the sincere Islamic trend is rallying those who  are most devoted to their homelands. It has been proven that  the Islamic nations are making sacrifices, shouldering burdens,  and enduring afflictions without entertaining any covetous  designs. But they are doing so for the sake of God and their  countries. At the same time, the Islamic nations are seeing how  some of those in power are benefit-seekers and how they are  plundering public funds and receiving bribes from big-time  thieves.    We read about these grotesque crimes in the press every day.  But all these crimes are forgotten with the passage of time and  the criminals never stood trial or were punished, to avoid  scandal. Those who reveal the crimes are tried and condemned,  while the real criminal is acquitted.    At a time when the widely popular Islamic trend is harassed  and prevented from performing its public function on the grounds  that its activities are illegal, we see that some parties that  are not popular among the people are allowed to perform  activities through papers and magazines. Those parties even  receive funds and are presented as the representatives of the  people.    All this is taking place on the basis of a wrong premise.  Some ruling regimes resort to this premise to create a balance  between the existing powers. Those regimes try to harass the  strong Islamic trend to allow antifreedom forces to perform  activities in a bid to minimize the people's cooperation with  this strong Islamic trend. But no matter how the defeated  secular forces and remnants of communism try, they would not be  able to influence this religious Muslim people.    Perhaps it is useful for the younger generations to know  some  historical facts about the past: In 1964, Russian Prime Minister  Khrushchev came to Egypt to inaugurate the second phase of the  High Dam. He insisted that all communist prisoners be released  before he arrived in Egypt. He also said that the communists  should be allowed to work in the entire Egyptian media service.  This is what indeed happened. The communists, who were with us  in the same al- Wahat prison, took control of the media and  exploited the whole service to spread their ideas and cast  doubts in Islam.    When al-Sadat assumed power and jumped from the Russian bed  to the U.S. bed, he tried to lessen the leftist presence in the  media. But the leftist remnants continued their activities. The  rulers, however, thought that it would be in their interest to  keep the leftists to confront the growing Islamic trend.    We now see that the present regime is giving those writers  whose hearts are imbued with hatred and rancor against Islam and  the Islamic movements free access to the national papers to  inject their poison against Islam and describe it with violence  and terrorism, using some acts of violence and the killings and  counter-killings between some youth and security and police  force as their pretext. These acts did not exist before, but  came as a result of the policy of suppression and intimidation,  economic crises, unemployment, increase in prices. These acts,  in addition to the government's policy of meeting violence with  violence, add fuel to the fire. The government's tolerance of  sinful practices such as drinking alcohol, gambling, usury,  prostitution, immoral media, and drugs seems to be an  intentional policy to create a balance between religiousness and  moral decadence.    We have been reading for some time now about planned  campaigns against some parties that are trying to protect  society from those who seek to spread corruption, cause  disintegration, and cast doubt on the faith. We notice that the  campaign harms the holy al-Azhar and its ulema, who over the  ages stood up against malicious campaigns against Islam, the  Egyptian nation's official religion according to the  Constitution.    Have the remnants of communism forgotten that Russia  considered religion the opiate of the people and that it  punished anyone in possession of a Koran or anyone who advocated  any religion other than communism? Where was the freedom of  opinion? Why didn't they object to this kind of suppression?    Islam, the righteous religion that God has chosen for his  people, is a religion of peace, freedom, justice, security, and  safety. Islam does not approve of any injustice by any party  against another and is unique in the sense that it promotes  virtue and suppresses vice. It is the duty of the nation's  ulema to balance things according to Islam's accurate scales and  to caution about what is good and what is bad. If a controversy  arises over an issue, it should be referred to God's book and to  the tradition of his Prophet, may God's prayer and salutation be  upon him. There is no human being who knows more about what is  good and what is bad for us than God and his messenger.    These malicious campaigns are launched by those who are  called the vanguard in enlightening public opinion about Islam's  darkness and shackles and who claim that religion has no  authority over art and literature. We should stand up to these  campaigns and refute them with unequivocal arguments. In the  first place, reality requires these bats to hide in their holes  and in the places of darkness and suppression where communism  lived, now that they cannot survive in the age of light in which  nations demand freedom and true representation. The people  should listen to each party's propaganda and then decide what is  right and what is wrong and what is beneficial and what is  corrupt.    We accept what society decides in genuine, fair elections.  But to devise laws marginalizing the Islamic trend and barring  this trend from actual participation in legislative elections or  to intervene by committing forgery and so forth contradicts the  creed of the much-abused democracy.    Had the ruling regime not encouraged this approach, no  magazine would have dared to publish this stuff, defying the  authority of law and the Constitution and even practically  annulling them and denigrating al-Azhar's role in protecting  society against any attempt to harm it. A society's value  depends on its adherence to virtuous principles and keeping away  from depraved morals. God, our creator, has laid down these  limits for us and explained what is good and what is bad; but to  confuse these limits is corruption itself, and we do not trust  the intentions of those who advocate such behavior.    We know that the enemies of Islam promote such ideas and  find  people among us who will cooperate with them in the name of  freedom.    This magazine's challenge, by publishing material  unanimously  deemed corrupt and mean by the judicial authorities, should not  be tolerated in silence by the holy al-Azhar and the Government  if they truly mean good for this country. The magazine's  publication of excerpts from the book "The Satanic Verses"  despite the proven fact that the book attacks Islam and Islam's  prophet, is a flagrant declaration of war against Islam, the  faith of this Muslim nation.    Demonstrations and sacrifices were made in some countries  where parts of this book were published. Does the Government  realize the danger it poses when at a time when we need help to  stop acts of violence, the magazine is fueling the fire?    The government should have taken the necessary measures to  help create calm and stability by lifting restrictions on  liberties and releasing those who have not been incriminated.  The government should also stop the sinful practices such as  drinking alcohol, prostitution, and usury. It should rectify  the government media, which are full of corruption. The  government should be firm with both large-scale and small-time  thieves and should bring up generations on educational and  ethical methods.    The Cairo international book fair is approaching. We hope it  will be utilized to reform those with corrupt ideas, and not to  draw up a plan to harm values and ethics or give an opportunity  to those hiding behind the facade of the so-called enlightenment.    Let's review the scenes of struggle between the Muslims and  others so that we can see who is responsible for the acts of  violence and terrorism. Are they Muslims or others? Who are  the terrorists in Palestine? Is it the Zionists or the  stone-throwers who are defending their land, which the enemy has  usurped by means of force, killings, deportations, and  displacement? Who are the terrorists in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is  it the Muslims, who are defending their land and who are  deprived of weapons, or the Serbs and Croatians, who have killed  hundreds of thousands, raped tens of thousands of women, and  evicted hundreds of thousands?    Who are the terrorists in Kashmir? Are they the Muslims, who  have been defending their usurped freedom over the past 40  years, or the Hindu soldiers, who are committing atrocities  similar to those being committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina? In  Cambodia, the Buddhists are killing hundreds of thousands of  Muslims and no one is doing anything to protect the oppressed  there. These tragedies are a lasting disgrace for the whole  world, which remains silent about these acts. It is also a  lasting disgrace in the history of the Arab and Islamic world,  which has not taken the appropriate stand dictated by the creed  of their peoples--a creed that calls for unity.    If we look at the international situation, we will find that  the oppressed Muslims are standing fast, enduring, and remaining  firm; they have not relinquished their creed or their land.  Those Muslims are hopeful that God will support them and will  grant them victory ?one day.    Here in Egypt we see that despite the harassment of the  Islamic trend, the Islamists won victories in the elections in  the professional associations and various university faculty  clubs. The Islamists scored victories despite the government's  unified trade union law, which is difficult to surmount. But  the Islamists were prepared for the elections and managed to  surmount the obstacles. Perhaps the government is thinking of  another solution or of placing more difficult obstacles. But we  tell all these people [not further specified] not to swim  against the current. We are full of hope that God will not  abandon his faithful people and will support righteousness and  will destroy falsehood and its advocates. And God hath full  power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know  it not [Koranic verse].    Out of sympathy, I advise them to reconsider their position  because they will not be able to impede this Islamic awakening.  Nor will they be able to dissuade the Egyptian people from  demanding the adoption of God's law. God will uphold  righteousness and will destroy falsehood. This is God's way and  it will not be thwarted. It is better for them and for the  country to save their efforts and not to stir up tension,  because we need calm and cooperation. I only desire your  betterment to the best of my power; and my success in my task  can only come from God. [Koranic verse]</p>

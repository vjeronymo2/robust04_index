			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (16): Why the institutions are reluctant - Property Industry PENSION FUNDS rescued the property industry from the crash of the early 1970s. But this time round, they are being viewed more as scapegoats than potential saviours. The evaporation of institutional demand for property, however justified, has been a source of dismay for the overbuilt and often overborrowed property industry. 'The British property industry has to some extent been abandoned by its traditional investor base, namely the institutions,' said Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, at a recent dinner for the British Council for Offices. From the viewpoint of the property industry, it seemed as though the funds have been looking for any excuse to limit their investments (with a few notable exceptions, part- icularly among Scottish funds). In the early 1980s, they were deterred from property invest- ment by the strong perform- ance of equities. After the equity market crashed in 1987, funds were unwilling to invest in property because the proportion of property had already risen in their shrunken portfolios. Property's share of pension fund portfolios fell from 20 per cent at the start of the 1980s to 8 per cent today, according to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors. The pension funds' cash flow into property has been falling from Pounds 509m in 1985 to an outflow of Pounds 118m in the nine months to September 1990, according to Debenham Tewson Research. The meagre inflow of pension fund cash going to property is nowhere near enough to mop up the new developments coming onto the market - particularly as some of the most prominent investors such as Friends Provident, Norwich Union and the Prudential have their own development programmes to mop up cash flow. Some estimate that it will take 15 years for the institutions to absorb the speculative property financed by the Pounds 40bn of debt outstanding to the property industry. If this overhang of property was not a sufficient deterrent to investment, property's traditional virtues of stability and counter-cyclicality have been dented by the current downturn, when its volatility and timing have matched the equity market. 'Historically  .. property could be regarded as stable, and to some extent counter-cyclical but this seems no longer to be the case,' says Sir Brian Corby, the Prudential's chief executive. Some funds, such as the Norwich Union, have also been influenced by historical performance figures. Looking at statistics going back to the last century, it reckons that equities have performed better than property. The issue is not, however, cut and dried. Property, like UK equities, has been the best-performing asset class for four years since 1973. Property has performed better than UK equities over the short term, although worse over the medium term of five to 15 years. The pension funds' attitude towards property is partly a result of changes in their circumstances since the early 1970s, when they were looking for a hedge against inflation and, in addition, they were underweight in property after a period of rapid growth. Their policy towards property has also been affected by the shift in the nature of pension funds. The large funds which have traditionally been big investors in property have had to make earlier-than- anticipated payouts as a result of workers taking early retirement. This has sometimes led to a shorter-term perspective, which has discouraged investment in a rela- tively illiquid medium like property. At the same time, market share has been won by smaller funds, which are less likely to invest in property because of high management costs and the difficulties of creating a sufficiently diversified portfolio. But perhaps the most important change for the pension funds' property holdings was the inroads made by overseas equities, following the abolition of exchange controls. 'Property was in the 1960s and 1970s the 'third asset' in institutional portfolios, providing long-term security and inflation hedging to complement holdings in equities and gilts  .. Deregulation has introduced overseas investment, principally in equities as a contender for third place,' argues the Investment Property Databank, a research body. These factors have contributed to an unprec- edented rise in yields, the yardstick which measures the risks and prospects attached to an investment. After a slow increase for most of the 1980s, yields shot up from 7.7 per cent in December 1988 to 9.6 per cent today, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research body. Many investors and their advisers now believe that yields have moved out sufficiently to take account of bearish factors, although the recovery is expected to be slow because of the amount of property overhanging the market and pressure on rents. Some of the Scottish funds, which have maintained an interest in property during the slump, are particularly prominent. 'I would like to think that yields have gone as far as they will go, particularly looking at retail warehousing which at yields of 12 per cent is basically self-financing. 'With a sensible tenant and a good location, there is only upside to come,' says Mr Mike Perkins, a director of Commercial Union. These arguments will not sway every institution. For instance, Norwich Union, one of the most prominent institutional investors in property, has decided to bring the proportion of property in its portfolio down to the average in its industry. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been an increase in allocations to property - and not just because the recent outperformance of equities has left funds underweight in property. 'We have seen in the last three months a significant increase of buying requirements from the pension funds and insurance companies and estimate that it has virtually doubled since the start of the year,' says Mr Robert Farnes, investment partner of Hillier Parker. The problem is that, despite the quantity of property overhanging the market, there is not much available that the institutions want to buy. Partly, this is a matter of size - most new office projects and shopping centres are too large for all but a handful of pension funds. It is also because little good quality property is coming onto the market at these yields. Even banks have delayed putting companies into receivership until the market improves. 'Leaving aside obvious areas of over-supply such as central London offices, the availability of income producing stock of suitable value size, securely let to stable tenants, is likely to remain restricted,' says Mr Andrew Hearn, a partner at Richard Ellis. He cites, as examples, industrial and shop units where many pension funds have relatively low weightings and there are very few forced sellers. That leaves a 'black hole' of property where sellers' aspirations and buyers' requirements are funda- mentally mismatched. Even if institutions do start to buy more real estate, the property industry may have to find the bulk of its funds elsewhere.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PROPERTY'S SHARE OF INVESTMENT FUNDS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Pension funds            Insurance companies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1980               14.3 per cent                  15.1 per cent 1981               11.4 per cent                  14.7 per cent 1982               10.9 per cent                  16.1 per cent 1983                7.4 per cent                  11.5 per cent 1984                9.1 per cent                   9.3 per cent 1985                5.1 per cent                   8.6 per cent 1986                3.7 per cent                   6.5 per cent 1987                1.5 per cent                   6.3 per cent 1988                2.8 per cent                   9.3 per cent 1989                1.3 per cent                  10.4 per cent 1990               -1.7 per cent                   9.0 per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Trade  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

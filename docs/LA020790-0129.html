			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOBY SHARK LOOKS STARTLING, PROVES HARMLESS;  </P> <P> FISHING: A 30-FOOT PLANKTON-EATER SUFFOCATES IN A GILL NET OFF THE NEWPORT  PIER. IT'S THE SECOND UNUSUAL CREATURE TO DIE RECENTLY IN SUCH A NET.  </P> <P> When Larry Capune went for his afternoon paddle aboard a 12-foot surfboard, he  wasn't ready for what he saw being towed by a fishing boat.  </P> <P> "I sort of looked behind this boat as it floated by me, and a huge fin popped  up from the water," said Capune, who nearly fell off his board when a giant,  30-foot basking shark passed by, suffocated from being trapped in a gill net.  </P> <P> Fish experts said Monday's capture of a basking shark, especially by a gill  net, is highly unusual for Southern California coastal waters.  </P> <P> Marine biologist Jeffrey Landesman said the giant fish, which weighed about  4,500 pounds and was harmless to people, was caught about a quarter-mile off  the Newport Pier by fishermen who were gill-netting for halibut. Narrow-weave  gill nets catch fish by entangling their gills in the mesh.  </P> <P> The shark's dying in a gill net "really bothered me," Capune said. "Here  they're catching everything in those gill nets and ruining it. It's very  depressing."  </P> <P> Landesman, who works at Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, said: "The shark  was probably close to shore, which is atypical but not totally uncommon for  basking sharks."  </P> <P> Basking sharks are the second-largest fish in the ocean, next to the whale  shark, and sometimes grow 45 feet long and weigh 8,000 pounds. They are usually  found in schools, swimming dozens of miles offshore, Landesman said.  </P> <P> "I've never seen one in the water myself," he said. "Usually only professional  underwater photographers and fishing boats spot these sharks, which swim near  the surface of the water."  </P> <P> Although they are members of the fish family that includes man-eating great  whites, the basking shark is a gentle creature that feeds only on plankton or  microscopic organisms.  </P> <P> The giant shark has a mouth big enough for an average-size man to stand up in,  Landesman said. The mouth is used to gather in food and also helps the fish get  oxygen through its gill system, he said.  </P> <P> "They can strain about 2,000 tons of water an hour through their giant mouths,"  Landesman said. "But they need to swim about two to three miles per hour to get  enough oxygen and feed. This one died because he got caught in the gill net and  could no longer travel forward."  </P> <P> Capune, a world-class paddler, said he followed the San Pedro-based fishing  boat, Cam Ranh, as it was helped into Newport Harbor, thanks to a tow line from  another vessel, the Maria Fatima. However, the Cam Ranh's skipper could not  find a truck big enough to haul out the fish. The Harbor Patrol eventually  escorted the Cam Ranh with its catch out to sea about 6 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear what became of the giant shark. Landesman, who was  part of a Cabrillo team that examined the shark at Newport Harbor, said that  although the shark's flesh is edible, fisheries do not use or want them.  </P> <P> "There's no market for basking sharks, but I'm sure in some parts of the world  they may be eaten," he said.  </P> <P> The Cabrillo team was given permission to sever the fish's tail for study and  eventual display, a task that took five volunteers several hours, Landesman  said. The tail section alone was seven feet wide and weighed 150 pounds.  </P> <P> "The shark's skin was extremely tough," Landesman said. "We tried to puncture  the tail to run a rope through it and secure it, but it was so hard we couldn't  do it."  </P> <P> He said the skin was very abrasive, with "small spikes" that acted like small  grappling hooks and cut into the biologists' arms as they worked.  </P> <P> "With most sharks, you can run your hand in one direction and the skin is  smooth, but abrasive if you run it in the opposite direction," he said.  </P> <P> "With this basking shark, it was extremely abrasive in both directions. Just  carrying the 150-pound tail into the truck left our arms bloodied."  </P> <P> The shark was male and 9 to 18 years old, he said. Age is estimated by counting  the number of rings of meat around the fish's vertebrae.  </P> <P> It was the second unusual capture in recent months by gill-netters, he said. In  November, an 18-inch, extremely rare angler fish was caught 20 miles south of  San Clemente Island.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) is the principal sponsor of a statewide  initiative that would extend a ban on gill-net fishing along the coast from  Point Conception to the Mexican border. Dolphins and fish in addition to the  species that gill-netters are targeting routinely die in the nets.  </P> <P> The thought of losing a magnificent creature such as a basking shark to a gill  net was disturbing to both biologists and Capune, the startled surfer.  </P> <P> "After all," Capune said about the basking shark, "what's left of him? Some  piece of his tail in a museum so kids can touch it?"  </P></p>

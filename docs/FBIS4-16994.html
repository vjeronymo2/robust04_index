			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Murmansk Oblast is on the brink of a power crisis.  Two power units of the Kola nuclear power station have already  been shut down. The nuclear power station accounts for 60  percent of the electricity generated in the region. Engineers  will have to shut down yet another power unit of the nuclear  power station in June. The situation in the region may have an  effect at an all-Russian level, too, because a failure to  restart all the power units of Kola nuclear power station, which  supplies power to the Northern Fleet's rear bases and garrisons,  will adversely affect the fleet's combat readiness.</p>

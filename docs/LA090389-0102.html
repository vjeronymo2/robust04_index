			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI HAS A SURPRISE PARTY AT FLORIDA STATE, 30-26  </P> <P> Southern Mississippi may have surprised Florida State Saturday, but the Golden  Eagles didn't surprise Coach Curley Hallman.  </P> <P> "We've got a bunch of doers," Hallman said after Brett Favre's two-yard  touchdown pass to Anthony Harris in the final minute gave Southern Mississippi  a 30-26 victory over the sixth-ranked Seminoles. "We knew it before we came  down here."  </P> <P> Florida State took a 26-24 lead midway through the final quarter on Bill  Mason's 27-yard field goal before Southern Mississippi put together a 6:34  drive to set up Favre's winning pass with 23 seconds left in the game.  </P> <P> "The coach told us, 'If you have them in the fourth quarter, you will win it,'  " Favre said after completing 21 of 39 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns.  "We knew they were scared."  </P> <P> Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said he knew beforehand that Favre would be a  handful for his young secondary.  </P> <P> "He could make big plays and keep drives going," Bowden said. "Favre was good  enough that he took advantage of mistakes we made."  </P> <P> Actually, Southern Mississippi could have won the game in a runaway, but the  Golden Eagles made three turnovers inside the Florida State 15.  </P> <P> The Seminoles took advantage of the first two Southern Mississippi turnovers to  take a 10-0 lead on their first two possessions.  </P> <P> However, the Golden Eagles came back, capitalizing on fumbles by Florida  State's Shannon Baker and Dexter Carter to take a 17-10 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "We couldn't knock them out when we had them down the first half," Bowden said.  "We couldn't make the big plays."  </P> <P> Southern Mississippi took its first lead with 11 seconds left in the first half  when Favre lobbed a four-yard scoring pass to Alfred Williams.  </P> <P> Eddie Ray Jackson's three-yard run tied the game, 10-10, early in the second  quarter.  </P> <P> The Seminoles rebounded from the 17-10 halftime deficit with a pair of  touchdowns in the third quarter to take a 23-17 lead.  </P> <P> Lawrence Dawsey caught a 23-yard scoring pass from Peter Tom Willis, and Dexter  Carter added a nine-yard touchdown run. But a bad snap prevented Mason from  making the extra point. Carter, who rushed for 118 yards, also scored the  game's first touchdown on an 11-yard run.  </P> <P> Willis completed 25 of 40 passes for 269 yards for the Seminoles, who have lost  their opener two straight seasons. Miami defeated Florida State, 31-0, a year  ago.  </P> <P> The Seminoles were 10-2 each of the last two seasons, losing both years to  Miami.  </P></p>

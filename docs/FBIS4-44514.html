			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Leaders Speak -- Optimize Capital Structure, </F> Increase Enterprise Strength, Strive To Do a Good Job With Large  and Medium-sized State Enterprises -- Speech Given by State  Economic and Trade Commission Director Wang Zhongyu (3769 1813  4416) at the Working Conference on Experimental Cities"]    [Text] Today in Beijing we are convening the First National  "Optimize Capital Structure, Increase Enterprise Strength"  Experimental City Working Conference. The central theme of this  conference is clarifying the guiding thought and studying how to  formulate an experimental implementation plan for the  experiment. Since the idea to conduct the experiment to  "optimize the capital structure and increase enterprise  strength" in some cities was proposed, it has received serious  consideration from several provinces and municipalities.  Moreover, the concerted effort of our nine ministries and  commissions has acquired the support of State Council leaders.  <H5>  I. The Current Enterprise Reform Situation and Our Task </H5>   The enterprise reform situation is very good. First, the  orientation of enterprise reform has already been clearly shown.  The Decision of the Third Plenary Session indicates that  establishing a modern enterprise system with "clear property  rights, explicit rights and responsibilities, division between  government and enterprises, and scientific management is a  definite requirement for developing a socialist large production  and market economy and is the orientation of China's state  enterprise reform." For a period in the future, it will be an  important task of enterprise reform to cause large- and  medium-sized enterprises that are prepared to essentially  accomplish conversion of mechanisms and establish a modern  enterprise system that meets the demands of the socialist market  economy system to make full use of the main force function of  large and medium-sized state enterprises in the socialist market  economy, and spur the entire national economy to sustained,  rapid, and sound forward progress. Secondly, reforms of the five  major systems of treasury and taxes, finance, investment,  foreign trade, and planning have been implemented one after the  other. With reform of the tax system having been implemented for  a month and a half, it has generally gone smoothly and no major  problems have occurred. The transition to a tax system dividing  responsibility with local treasuries and the transition to a  unified tax system for the enterprise contract system is an  extraordinary thing. Although some problems have been exposed in  the implementation, the party Central Committee and the State  Council are adopting measures to resolve the problems and  improve the situation. We have investigated the situation of the  new tax system in eleven industries. All reflected that quite a  few problems with increased value added tax burdens in such  industries as coal, small chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and  small water and electricity have already been resolved and the  independent mine resource tax problem is being negotiated.  Leading comrades in the State Council have pointed out several  times that they will account for the tax reduction and tax  exemption policy approved by governments at the provincial level  and above before the end of June 1993 and within two years they  will adopt methods for late return of previously levied taxes.  The Ministry of Finance and the State General Bureau of Taxation  are formulating concrete suggestions. The general spirit is not  to lightly change the policy that is in effect and to focus on  smoothly establishing new mechanisms. The implementation of  these macroeconomic measures has changed the situation of  enterprise reform's being an isolated force penetrating deep  into enemy territory and has caused enterprise reform from being  alone to enter a new stage generally coordinated with other  reforms and has provided state enterprises with a new  development opportunity to move toward the market and  participate in competition. Third, there is a series of laws and  regulations regarding enterprise reform. For example, such laws  and regulations as the Enterprise Law, Mechanism Conversion  Regulations, Supervision and Management Regulations (to be  implemented), Accounting Standards, and the General Rule on  Financial Affairs, along with the Company Law have been  promulgated and implemented, creating a rather good legal  atmosphere for enterprise reform.    Based on the orientation and tasks of enterprise reform and  this year's situation, in accordance with the principle of  "combining overall progress with key breakthroughs" proposed in  the Decision of the Third Plenary Session, we have proposed a  plan "for converting mechanisms and establishing the system and  ten thousand, thousand, hundred, and ten" plans based on  thorough investigation and analysis and repeated solicitation of  the suggestions of provinces, municipalities, and enterprises.  "Converting mechanisms and establishing the system" is the  abbreviation of the theme of the second part of the Decision. It  speaks of promoting overall enterprise reform. That is, all  state enterprises should do a good job of implementing the  Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and the Supervision and  Management Regulations to be implemented concentrating their  efforts on converting mechanisms to create the conditions for  laying a good base to establish a modern enterprise system. The  "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten" is a concretization of  the key breakthroughs in current enterprise reform,. That is, by  some enterprises (indicating 10,000, 1,000, and 100 enterprises)  advancing a step and coordinating their reforms with some cities  (indicating some ten cities), a breakthrough is achieved in an  important link to act as a model to effectively spur on overall  enterprise reform, and "converting mechanisms and establishing  the system" and "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten" are an  organic whole.    To promote overall "conversion of mechanisms and  establishment of the system" requires that all regions and  departments and all enterprises do a good job in the following  three efforts:    1. Unremittingly persist in thoroughly implementing the  Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. The  Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms are the cornerstone  for establishing the socialist market economy system. We should  implement to the letter the rights and responsibilities  conferred on enterprises by the Regulations on the Conversion of  Mechanisms. First, we should implement the base of the fourteen  autonomies, leading to enterprises' using autonomy well,  sufficiently, and actively. Second, every department should  formulate and implement accompanying regulations to the  Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. Third, we should  continue to increase publicity and in cooperation with the  procurator's department, we should investigate and prosecute  cases of attacks and reprisals toward enterprises in violation  of the Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms and expose  them in the news to the point of pursuing legal responsibility.  Fourth, seize the opportune time for government reform and  promote conversion of government functions. This year we should  make a breakthrough in handling self-management of foreign trade  import and export rights and refuse to apportion rights, and  improve methods of approval, simplify procedures, and improve  efficiency of foreign trade import and export rights. We should  let enterprises that have already been given the rights to  manage imports and exports themselves enjoy the same rights as  foreign trade enterprises in such aspects as export licenses and  allotment of quotas. We should curb arbitrary apportionment as  an important way of coming to grips with anti-corruption.  Regions and industries should combine their actual situations  and formulate specific methods to curb arbitrary apportionment  and announce them to the masses and enterprises to be monitored  and enforced.    2. Organize the implementation of the Supervision and  Management Regulations and establish a system for supervision  and management of state assets. The Supervision and  Management Regulations are the completion and development of the  Regulations on Converting Mechanisms. The Supervision and  Management Regulations are mainly aimed at the current situation  of mismanagement and serious erosion of state assets. On the one  hand, relevant departments should take responsibility for  supervising the state assets of enterprises that they are  assigned to supervise and as needed conscientiously assign  supervisory board tasks. On the other hand, we should determine  enterprise legal person property rights and establish a system  of asset management responsibilities linked to the managers' own  interests, increasing their value based on ensuring that state  assets are not eroded.    3. Actively and safely establish a modern enterprise  system. Assisted by the Central Committee financial and  economic leading group, with our commission taking the lead  together with more than ten departments, we have investigated  and studied the subject of a modern enterprise system and at the  demand of the financial and economic leading group, we have  taken steps to establish a modern enterprise system. We believe  that in establishing a modern enterprise system, we should  especially pay attention to doing a good job of handling the  relations between experimental enterprises and other  enterprises. All enterprises should conscientiously implement  the Regulations on Conversion of Mechanisms and the Regulations  on Supervision and Management and carry out the Accounting  Standards and the General Rule on Financial Affairs and reform  enterprise labor, personnel, and wage allocation systems,  lighten the social burdens that enterprises handle, clear up  credits and liabilities, reappraise stocks and assets, and  demarcate property rights. This is the main content of the  current enterprise reform and creates the necessary conditions  for establishing a modern enterprise system. This means that in  carrying out the reforms described above we are giving impetus  to state enterprises' moving in the direction of a modern  enterprise system. This is a reform that all enterprises should  now conduct. At the same time, we should recognize that  establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous and  complicated task, especially for a state enterprise to become a  company requires trials. We should guard against all enterprises  rushing to reorganize as companies, watering down or overlooking  the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and the Regulations on  Supervision and Management.    While generally steadily promoting "conversion of mechanisms  and establishment of the system," we should use the "ten  thousand, thousand, hundred, and ten" form to realize key  breakthroughs. "Ten thousand" means to thoroughly implement the  Enterprise Law and the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and  do a good job of carrying out the Two Standards in 10,000 large  and medium-sized state enterprises and accomplish the task of  reappraising stocks and assets and essentially accomplish  conversion of mechanisms. "Thousand" means that in implementing  the Regulations on Supervision and Management, the state by  stages and in groups should assign supervisory boards to 1,000  key mainstay enterprises related to the national economy and the  people's livelihood and inspect the state assets of the  enterprises. This task is beginning. "Hundred" means with the  unified leadership and planning of the State Council, to select  100 large and medium-sized state enterprises of different types  to establish an experimental modern enterprise system and  explore ways for state enterprises to become companies. "Ten"  means in some ten cities to conduct experiments with the  complete reform of "optimizing the capital structure and  increasing enterprise strength" and strive to achieve  breakthrough progress on the key and difficult problems of  getting large and medium-sized state enterprises into the market  and taking part in competition.    II. The Object and the Main Content of Selecting Some  Cities to Conduct Complete Experimental Reform    After the suggestion to select ten cities to conduct  experiments to "optimize capital structure and increase  enterprise strength" was proposed at the national economic and  trade working conference, it aroused the general interest of  provinces and cities throughout the country. Altogether official  letters have come from 27 provincial and municipal governments  throughout the country requesting that 39 cities conduct the  experiment. To do a good job of conducting the experiment  together, nine ministries and commissions, our commission  together with the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of  Finance, the Ministry of Labor, the People's Bank, the Auditing  Administration, the General Bureau of Taxation, the State Assets  Bureau, and the Bank of Industry and Commerce, formed the "city  experiment cooperative working group" and, dividing forces in  all directions, we conducted on the spot investigation and  research. On this basis, the document put out jointly by the  nine ministries and commissions determined the sixteen cities of  Tianjin, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Changchun, Qiqihar,  Shanghai, Changzhou, Bengbu, Qingdao, Zibo, Wuhan, Zhuzhou,  Liuzhou, Chengdu, and Baoji would conduct the experiment in  "optimizing capital structure and increasing enterprise  strength," and reported it to the State Council. Cities such as  Chongqing and Harbin, formerly designated as the six old  industrial bases, were not listed among the sixteen cities.  Based on the strong demands of the two cities and the proposal  of the provincial governments, consideration was given to the  reform and development needs of the old industrial bases, and  with the consultation of the nine ministries and commissions,  Chongqing and Harbin were listed as associates and based on  their situation they will conduct comparable experiments and  attend working conferences related to the experiment.    According to the data from this investigation and research,  the sixteen cities together have 3,199 large and medium-sized  state industrial enterprises, 21.3 percent of the large and  medium-sized state industrial enterprises in the country, and  8.3516 million workers, 23.20 percent of the workers in state  industrial enterprises in the national budget. These enterprises  together have gross assets of 467.26 billion yuan and net assets  of 139.4 billion yuan, respectively making up 18.2 percent and  17.9 percent of the state industrial enterprises in the national  budget. The 1993 principal indicators and their share of state  industrial enterprises in the national budget were: gross value  of industrial output 321.726 billion [yuan], 23.2 percent; sales  receipts 358.73 billion, 19.8 percent; profits and taxes  achieved 53 billion, 24 percent, within which profits were  27.401 billion, 44.20 percent. That is less than one-fifth of  the large and medium-sized state enterprises with one-sixth of  the net assets created more than one-fourth of the profits,  indicating that these new and old industrial bases still have  potential, but current problems are not small.    In selecting the cities described above to conduct the  "optimize capital structure and increase enterprise strength"  experiment, the three main considerations were:    1. The base for establishing the socialist market  economy is large and medium-sized state enterprises. In the  crucial period for converting from the old to the new system, we  should seize the opportunity and realistically increase the  strength of state enterprises. This year, with the  implementation of macroeconomic system reforms, the external  environment of enterprises is greatly changing and a fair  competition environment is gradually forming and large and  medium-sized state enterprises are facing development  opportunities and serious challenges. So, on the one hand, we  should direct enterprises' gazes inward and painstakingly  develop inner skills, and especially by strengthened  implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, we should weed out  enterprises that there is no way to save and increase  enterprises' sense of urgency and sense of crisis and promote  the conversion of enterprise operating mechanisms. At the same  time, we must face up to the situation with state enterprises  and by feeling out the situation and what the financial strength  of each sector will allow, grasp the precious opportunity to  transition from the old to the new system and, seeking truth  from facts, determine the residual problems that the old system  gives enterprises and create favorable conditions for large and  medium-sized state enterprises to go into battle with a light  pack and make great strides in entering the market.    2. Enterprise reform still is a key and a difficulty in  current reforms and we must obtain experience through  experimentation. Enterprises still are the greatest  difficulty in the current establishment of the socialist market  economy and intensification of reforms. Despite the fact that  other aspects of reform also are rather difficult, we generally  can learn from foreign experience. For example, in the  differentiated tax system, most Western countries have  implemented this type of financial and tax system and in  banking, most countries in the world have established different  types of banks. But there still is no foreign precedent for how  we can make these vast state enterprises smoothly enter the  market and participate in equal competition. We can only look to  privatization and this does not conform to China's national  characteristics. We definitely cannot take this road. State  enterprises are the mainstay of the market economy and the  ultimate undertaking of reforms. If complete reforms do not  arrive, there is no way for state enterprise reform to be  intensified. But if reform of state enterprises is not  effectively advanced, it will be difficult for other reforms  ultimately to be accomplished. So, reform of state enterprises  has a widespread involvement and numerous problems, and the  situation is complicated. We must painstakingly organize  experiments and in practice explore and review experience to  advance the task that we are faced with.    3. One possible way to do a good job with state  enterprises is to rely on the cities to accomplish comprehensive  rectification. Reform already has penetrated to today.  Resolving deep-seated key and difficult enterprise problems can  no longer go the old way of reducing taxes and conceding  profits. It is necessary to optimize enterprise organizational  structure and capital structure with adjustments; establish  property rights exchange markets with reform of the property  rights system; and establish an integrated labor force market  with an improved social insurance system. In these respects,  fully utilizing city functions and regional advantages is well  worth doing.    In sum, the objective of conducting urban experiments is to  seek a new line of thinking and new methods to do a good job on  large and medium-sized state enterprises through these  experiments. That is, taking large and medium-sized state  enterprises as the key and using cities as the basis, closely  focus on current key and difficult problems and by complete  reforms and comprehensive rectification, strive to obtain  breakthrough progress and strengthen large and medium-sized  state enterprises to effectively combine the public ownership  system and the market economy to lay a firm foundation for  establishing the socialist market economy.    To accomplish the goals described above, the main content of  the urban experiment can be simply summarized with eight  characters: bankruptcy [pochan (4275 3934)], replenishment  [buchong (5943 0339)], stripping [boli (0475 4418)], and  lightening the load [qingzhuang (6535 5944)]. The first thing is  to strengthen the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law and step  up organizational restructuring of enterprises. Those  enterprises that do not have the resources to pay off their  debts in kind and have no hope of turning around their losses  and cannot clear the debts that are due should be declared  bankrupt and, by means of the experimental norms, we should  proceed with legislation to promote the conversion of operating  mechanisms. The Bankruptcy Law has been officially implemented  since 1988. It has already been six years. Although the number  of enterprises that have relied on the law through the courts to  declare bankruptcy has increased from year to year, for various  reasons, such as the systems, the concepts, and the overall  situation, mechanisms to select the superior and weed out the  inferior still have not been completely established. This time  we should use the cities as a basis and truly establish a  weeding out mechanism external to the enterprises and  self-restraint mechanisms within the enterprises and bring along  and advance the establishment and improvement of a social  insurance system. We should rely on cities to establish a  property rights exchange market and by property rights exchanges  optimize asset accumulations and enhance the basic function of  the market in asset distribution. Secondly, we should adopt  various measures and multiple channels to replenish enterprise  self-circulating funds. First, enterprises should fully utilize  policies already in effect such as income tax rate cuts, the  abolition of adjusted taxes and "two funds," and not submitting  after tax profits in the near term, and implement the Two  Standards to accelerate depreciation and conscientiously  replenish circulating funds. Half in principle, enterprises  should use exemption from submitting "two funds" and after-tax  profits to replenish circulating funds. At the same time, the  central government, departments, and localities also should  strive together to replenish enterprise capital by multiple  channels and resolve the problem of a serious inadequacy of  enterprise production and operating funds and realistically  strengthen enterprises. The third thing is to establish labor  force markets, strip enterprise social functions, and improve  the social insurance systems with cities as the center. The test  cities should gradually take on various functions for society.  For example, arrange for such functions as enterprises'  surplusing by various channels to create the conditions for  intensifying the reform of three internal enterprise systems.  The fourth thing is to feel out situations, structures, and  contributing factors to the unreasonable burdens that the old  system has formed for test city large and medium-sized state  enterprises, and by stages and in groups resolve the problems  described above. We should review our experiences while  experimenting, and give impetus to the task that confronts us  and strive by the end of the Eighth 5-Year Plan to be able to  completely implement the regulations to convert the enterprise  operating mechanisms of large and medium-sized state  enterprises, the mainstay of the national economy, and get them  into the market and participating in competition.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Digging starts at Tokyo Bay A gigantic digging machine (above) yesterday began work on the tunnel section of the Y1,440bn (Dollars 14.4bn) Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway, which will include the widest undersea tunnels in the world, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The 15.1km toll highway, including two 9.4km undersea tunnels, a 4.4km bridge over the water and two man-made islands, will run across the centre of the bay, connecting Kawasaki City on the west coast and Kisarazu City to the east and reducing the trip between the two from 110km to 30km. The large cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Chiba are also on the bay, as well as the industrial districts of Keihin and Keiyo. The cylindrical tunneling machines, at 14.14 metres each, are the same width as the tunnels they dig, with cutters mounted on their forward surfaces. The Channel Tunnel has a width of 8.6 metres. A TTB official said the work would be difficult because the bottom of the bay is very soft. In addition, the tunnels will be built 60 metres below sea level where water pressure would be strong. The Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway is scheduled to begin operating by March 31, 1997. The construction of the man-made islands and the bridge started in 1989 and about half of the total construction work had been finished at the end of July. Traffic on the highway is expected to be about 33,000 vehicles a day initially, increasing to 64,000 eventually.</p>

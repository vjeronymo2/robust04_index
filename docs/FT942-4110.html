			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Devastated Tories fear an even heavier blow The Conservatives were devastated yesterday by the party's by-election defeats, and fearful of an even heavier blow when the European election results are declared tomorrow night. Cabinet ministers tried to put a brave face on the party's third-place results in Eastleigh, Bradford South and Barking, and its second-place performance in Dagenham and Newham North East. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said he was 'extremely optimistic' that the Conservatives would recover from the 'short-term blip' in the party's electoral fortunes to win the next general election. Conservatives MPs drew comfort from the low turnout in all five polls, which was interpreted as a sign that core supporters had abstained rather than switching support to opposition parties. Mr David Willetts, Conservative MP for Havant, said: 'We have to win back our supporters, but winning them back from abstention is an easier task than winning them back from voting for another party.' But few Tories expect anything other than a crushing defeat in the European elections. At worst, experts say they could be left without a single seat in the parliament. Mr David Butler, the psephologist, said the safest Conservative seat - Buckinghamshire and East Oxfordshire - would fall to the Liberal Democrats by a 7 per cent margin if the Eastleigh result were repeated in the 84 British mainland seats. Such a result would give the Liberal Democrats between 12 and 14 seats, compared with none in the last parliament; Labour 68 to 70 seats, compared with 45; and the Scottish National party two seats, up from one. In a general election, the 21 per cent swing at Eastleigh would reduce the Conservatives to a handful of seats. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs were buoyed by the by-election results, but strategists disagreed sharply about which party was the principal challenger to the Tories in the south of England. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, said its second-place position in Eastleigh showed that confidence in the Tory party had collapsed. 'By forcing the Conservatives into third place, and achieving a significant improvement in our share of the vote, it was Labour in Eastleigh that inflicted the truly devastating blow to John Major and his government,' he said. 'There has not been a result like Eastleigh, where the Tories have gone from a strong first to a poor third place, in modern British politics.' However, the Liberal Democrats pointed to a fall of about 500 votes in Labour's total vote since the 1992 general election as evidence that Labour had failed to win over Conservative supporters. Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat campaign organiser, said Labour's vote had fallen 'despite the biggest effort by Labour in a by-election for many years'. He added: 'Where the Labour party tries to attract new voters, they fail and we succeed. 'The hardest elections of all for Liberal Democrats to win are the European elections. We have not done it before. We believe we now have. We are in a buoyant mood,' he said. 'If the government does not learn the lessons of these elections, they are going to face further humiliations, culminating in their defeat at the general election.' In the Liberal Democrats' first official forecast of the European campaign, Mr Charles Kennedy, president, said the party was certain to win its first seats: 'We should win two or three for sure.' William Hill, the bookmaker, shortened its odds on a Labour victory at the next general election from 4-6 to 4-7, with the Tories lengthening from 11-10 to 5-4 and the Liberal Democrats at 25-1.</p>

Mr. Selami acquainted the French guests with the  composition and the activity of this commission, which aims at  the consolidation and expansion of the relations of cooperation  with other countries.    The French parliamentarians took interest in the main  directions of the foreign policy of Albania. Mr. Selami and  other deputies stressed that the main direction of the foreign  policy is Albania's integration in the European democratic  structures and the guarantee of the peace and stability in the  Balkan region.    A special place in the meeting was devoted to the relations  of Albania with Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM]. Albanian parliamentarians pointed out that  the Greek party continues to manifest archaic concepts and  stands and to make groundless and absurd accusations for  allegedly the abuse of the rights of the Greek minority in  Albania. Participants in the meeting said that relations with  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are generally good and  that Albania has been continuously tolerant and has created many  facilitation to the Macedonian state, holding that this stand  serves the peace and stability in the region. Nevertheless,  Albania has reserves as far as the observation of the rights of  the Albanians in that republic is concerned and it is for the  solution of the existing problems through dialogue and  understanding between parties. The Macedonian party lacks the  necessary predisposition for the promotion of the relations  between the two countries, participants in the meeting said.    After highlighting the contribution of France to the  democratic developments in Albania, the Democratic Party deputy,  Petrika Minga, suggested to the French parliamentarians the  reopening of the French Lyceum in Korce. It is a tradition that  should be renewed and this is also a desire of the people of  Korce.  <H5>  Meeting With the Albanian Foreign Minister </H5>   In the meeting held on the same day with the French  parliamentarians, Alfred Serreqi, Albanian foreign minister,  stressed the importance that Albania attaches to the relations  with France in the moments of transition and its integration  into Europe. Minister Serreqi made a panorama of the situation  in the country and concentrated on the situation in the region,  mainly on the relations of Albania with its neighbours.    Leader of the French parliamentary delegation, Mr. Denion  [name as received], expressed the conviction that the relations  of France with Albania will develop further. He expressed the  opinion that Europe should play and active role to help the  countries in the transition period and to make its contribution  to the solution of their complex problems. Albania also merits  the attention of Europe, he underlined. The French  parliamentarians also took interest in the situation in Kosova  and the perspective solution of the problem there.</p>

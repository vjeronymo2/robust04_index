Jacques Friedmann, a close associate of Balladur, reportedly  discussed the plan with representatives of the Chinese  government. France recognized China in January 27, 1964.  According to well- informed sources in Beijing, the head of the  French government would visit China with Foreign Affairs  Minister Alain Juppe and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet from  January 27 to 30.    Friedmann initially visited Beijing in July to revive the  dialogue between the two countries, which had halted with the  sale one year ago of French Mirage 2000-5 aircraft to Taiwan,  the Nationalist island claimed by China.    The high-level visit would open a new chapter in Sino-French  relations. The sale of warplanes to Taiwan had led to the  closure of the French consulate in the southern Chinese city of  Guangzhou and the exclusion of French companies from major  economic projects.</p>

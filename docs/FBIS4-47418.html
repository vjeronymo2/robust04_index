Kulikov, </F> Institute of Plant and Animal at Russian Academy of Sciences,  Urals Department; UDC 577.391.57.02]    [Abstract] Following the Chernobyl accident in April 1986,  during the remainder of this year there were recorded no  morphological changes in leaf trees but was recorded a high  mortality of needle trees within the zone of heavy fallout and  thus within a 30 km radius from the site of the nuclear power  plant. Experiments have meanwhile indicated that symptoms of  radiative damage including lethal one in trees may become  evident not immediately after such an event but somewhat later.  More than a year later, therefore, a study was made concerning  the delayed effect of higher-level ionizing gamma background  radiation on the generative and vegetative organs. Tests were  performed in July-August 1987 on birch trees (Betula verrucosa  Ehrh.) in three pine-birch woods located one 18 km south of, 6  km south-east of, and 1.5 km west of the accident site.  Irradiation with 100-150 gR doses of gamma rays was found not to  have lowered the germinating capacity of birch seeds but to have  reduced the viability of seedlings, parts of the latter grown  from irradiated seeds having fallen off by the end of a 25 days  long test. Most immune were found to be seedlings farthest from  and south of the nuclear power plant. Based on a statistical  analysis of germination energy and and seedling viability data,  the reaction of this tree species to irradiation has been  classified into three grades: 1) treetop, leaves, and aments not  revealing any significant signs of damage after a 3.0 mR/h dose,  2) entire treetops remaining alive and no loss of reproductive  capability, but teratological changes such as bifurcation or  contraction of some aments after a 20-40 mR/h dose; 3) loss of  reproductive capability, partial or complete defoliation of  branches, loss of chlorophyll at the edges of leaf blades after  a 250 mR/h or larger dose. The larger than expected mass, i.e.,  number of seeds on trees exposed to higher-level background  radiation is partly attributable to a smaller fraction among  them of ``empty'' parthenocarpic ones, while stimulated action  of small radiation doses coming from external sources and from  radionuclides embedded in aments may be partly responsible for  the higher germination energy. The higher resistance of such  seeds to damaging gamma radiation indicates that may they have  acquired some immunity during buildup and storage of small  radiation doses, their large size possibly being another  contributing factor.

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Prescription for a smooth handover - The retirement of Bill Pybus after 25 years at AAH MR BILL PYBUS will celebrate his 25th anniversary at AAH Holdings by quitting the healthcare and distribution group. The group will announce today that he is retiring as chairman some five months earlier than planned. Mr John Padovan, a former merchant banker and at present deputy chairman, will become chairman from January 1. Mr Pybus, a large friendly figure just shy of 70, has won considerable respect in the City during his time with the company. Under his stewardship, AAH has been transformed from an unassuming coal distribution company with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 4m, to the UK's leading wholesale pharmaceutical distributor with a value of about Pounds 450m. The company now ranks in the top 200 quoted companies by market value. Last month it announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m on sales of Pounds 679.7m. Mr Padovan's elevation had been widely expected following his arrival on the board in March. However, it had been assumed that the handover would be made at the end of the financial year in April. Mr Pybus said he had decided to retire early, 'to get John in the driving seat as soon as possible'. Company observers are not expecting a great shake-up. A former deputy chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Mr Padovan has much in common with his long-time acquaintance Mr Pybus and both se that AAH's future lies in specialist distribution. 'This is not a radical change,' said Mr John Aldersley, analyst with Smith New Court. 'It is more of an evolutionary change.' Mr Padovan said his greatest challenge would be to build on Mr Pybus's achievements. When Mr Pybus joined the board in 1968, Amalgamated Anthracite Holdings, was heavily dependent on a solid fuels market, where turnover was estimated to be declining at about 10 per cent a year. AAH also owned a ragbag of other businesses. Forced by the nationalisation of the coal industry in 1947 to give up control of its mines, the company had moved into such diverse areas as heavy engineering and even a chicken hatchery. However, shareholders might have guessed as early as 1968 that Mr Pybus's ambitions lay in a different direction. In his first chairman's statement, Mr Pybus made his intentions quite clear: 'The future should offer scope for a well-run transport business to earn a fair profit and this is a field in which the skills required are those which we have in the group.' His early ambitions have since been realised, largely through the group's strength in the pharmaceuticals sector. The big break came in 1985, with the purchase of Vestric, Glaxo's distribution arm, for Pounds 15m. In a single bound, AAH jumped from fourth to first place in the UK wholesale pharmaceuticals distribution league. The company now provides some 70 per cent of wholesale drugs to hospitals in the UK and claims 29 per cent of the total UK wholesale drugs distribution market worth Pounds 3.2bn a year. Vestric not only brought AAH a national distribution network, but also radically altered the composition of the group's profits. The purchase allowed Mr Pybus to edge out the solid fuels business, which was sold in 1987. With hindsight, the exit from solid fuels was neatly timed: 'They have had desperately warm winters ever since, so we are extremely relieved,' said Mr Pybus. It is the pharmaceuticals arm which will provide the group with its bread and butter profits for the next few years. In the short term, the withdrawal last year of major rival, Medicopharma, has helped AAH substantially to increase its market share. Further out, the opportunities abroad are also tempting and the company has taken its first tentative steps with the proposed acquisition of Ireland's Cahill May Roberts group. However, the tightly-held nature of pharmaceutical businesses in continental Europe means such expansion is likely to be lower on the list of priorities. Analysts point to the opportunities for the group's other divisions, such as environmental services and building supplies. 'There are many more contracts to be won from local authorities' under the new competitive contract tendering regulations, according to Mr Tony Dew, analyst at Kleinwort Benson. Only about half have been tendered so far. Building services, which reported interim profits of Pounds 1.5m, is also an obvious candidate for expansion. The smaller retail pharmacy division will continue to grow through acquisitions. The caveat to such opportunities would have to be economic recovery. With about 80 per cent of profits dependent on pharmaceuticals, the group's defensive qualities appear to outweigh its cyclical exposure. Nevertheless, analysts are forecasting about Pounds 37m for the current year, against Pounds 32.2m last time. Mr Padovan is confident the foundations laid by Mr Pybus are solid enough to achieve those profits and eventually more.</p>

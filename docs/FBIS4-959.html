			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Liberian Peace Council, LPC, which has been  fighting Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] in the region south of Buchanan since the Cotonou peace  accord last year, came out yesterday to demand a place on the  National Transitional Council. LPC leader Octavius Walker  claimed that he controlled six counties and should be allowed to  represent them in the Council, but the demand has been rejected.  On the line to Monrovia, Robin White asked the acting minister  of information, Milton T. Jay, why they were turning down the  LPC:    [Begin recording] [Jay] Well, basically, Robin, we have to  put this whole thing in perspective. The configuration of the  Liberian National State Council was not done as a result of  territorial gains that the factions have made, and so if Mr.  Walker is making a claim on the basis of territories, I think he  has missed the point. And you see we want to make sure that we  are not sending any message out there to any warring faction  that as soon as you can claim a territory then you should come  and claim on the State Council to have a seat.    [White] So, there is absolutely no chance of renegotiating  the Cotonou accord to let in the Peace Council you are saying?    [Jay] Absolutely, the National Transitional Government of  Liberia is not going to accommodate another warring faction on  the State Council, because to do that will be to create an  opportunity for other warring factions to begin to spark off  around here. You have the Lofa Defense Force, which is a  warring faction that is fighting the NPFL. You have the Bong  Defense Force, which is also a warring faction. If you begin to  allot seats on the Council for every warring faction we are not  going to go anywhere, and we can be sitting down here,  accommodating every warring faction, because they claim one or  two territories around here.    [White] But what happens if the Peace Council carries on  fighting? How will you deal with them?    [Jay] Well, basically if they carry on fighting, that will  be  the modus operandi of most of the warring factions around here.  The Council of State is prepared to accommodate the Peace  Council in some nominal area just to make sure that they have a  political voice. And what do I mean by that? For instance,  there are some subcabinet positions here; there are advisory  positions in which they can be accommodated.    [White] So, you are prepared to make some concessions toward  them?    [Jay] Well, indeed we are prepared to politically  accommodate  the factions in the Liberian crisis who have the potential to  delay the process, and we want to do that so the that Liberian  people have the opportunity to have a free country.    [White] In fact, how is this new Interim Council working out  in your view?    [Jay] Well I think, Robin, the Council is working out very  well. Over the last few days, the Council was able to  inaugurate the cabinet. The cabinet has been inducted into  office. We have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now under the  leadership of the coordinator. You have the Ministry of Justice  also under coordinator, the Ministry of Finance. Everything is  going well. The Council is on track. We are looking forward to  having elections in September this year if everything goes well.    [White] But as I understand it, not everybody is taking up  their ministerial post.    [Jay] No, I mean almost everybody has done that except for  those on the NPFL side. The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement  for Democracy in Liberia] nominees have all gone through the  confirmation process. They have been confirmed by the  Transitional Legislative Assembly and they have all taken their  offices. Those on the side of the Interim Government, including  myself, have also taken their offices. The only presence in the  Liberian peace construct who have not taken their offices are  those from the National Patriotic Front, and again I want to  send out this message, Robin, it is important for institutions  like the BBC to help us to try to have these people understand  they cannot go about keeping the people of this country hostage  only because of political reasons, especially when all of the  concessions that could be made have made. [end recording]    [The "African News" segment of the same cast adds: "A leader  of the former Liberian Army whose members are now grouped in the  Armed Forces of Liberia, the AFL, says he would not disarm all  his fighters. The chief of staff said the AFL could not be  considered one of Liberia's factions and would maintain his  forces at what he called peacetime levels. The AFL began  disarming earlier this year under a peace agreement reached with  other factions, but clashes have continued."]</p>

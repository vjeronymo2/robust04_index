			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Shake-up planned for laws on secrecy A REVIEW of secrecy laws, which might eventually open to public scrutiny inspectors' reports on health and safety, drug and other companies, will be set today as the next extension of the government's Citizen's Charter programme. Mr William Waldegrave, the cabinet minister responsible for seeing the charter into action, will tell MPs that he sees a greater openness by officials as an essential part of moves towards reducing central government's role. In accordance with the Tory election manifesto, he wants slimmer Whitehall departments acting as policymakers and representing consumers, with other government operations transferred increasingly to executive agencies. Greater access to information would increase the power of consumers, he will say in the Commons debate on last week's Queen's Speech. An interdepartmental committee, chaired by Mr Andrew Wettnall, a senior civil servant from the Cabinet Office, has been set up to trawl government departments for areas where secrecy restrictions can be lifted. Mr Waldegrave hopes legislation will be introduced next year. However, ministers have disappointed consumer groups and opposition politicians by ruling out a Freedom of Information Bill. Ministers argue that such a bill would not guarantee that existing restrictions were lifted. No decisions have been taken about what secrecy laws may be repealed but Mr Waldegrave is believed to have told officials that he wants to consider all sources of information received by the government to see whether more could be released. That could include reports of health and safety inspectors and possibly even by company inspectors. Speaking yesterday on BBC Radio, Mr Waldegrave said he wanted to 'root out' the 'Yes, Minister' culture of Whitehall, where it was assumed that members of the public were unable to interpret information correctly. 'The answer from the bureaucracy is always, 'Don't give them the information, they will misinterpret it',' he said. 'That must be the wrong way around. Give out the information - and then explain what it means.'</p>

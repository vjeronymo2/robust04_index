			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The APEC Summit: Australia bent on free trade goal The summit meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders at Bogor near Jakarta next week must agree a target date for trade liberalisation if it is to be perceived as a success, Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, said in Jakarta yesterday. As an immediate sign that the 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum are serious, they should agree an immediate ban on introducing new trade barriers such as tariff increases and quota reductions, he said. Reinforcing Australia's position yesterday in Sydney, prime minister Paul Keating said that a free trade agreement among Apec countries could lead to a tripling of the economic benefit they would receive from the Uruguay Round trade agreement. Australian projections, he said, suggest that the annual gain to Apec's aggregate national income from the Uruguay Round agreement would be around USDollars 112bn by the year 2002 and that, if free trade was established among Apec members by 2010, this could rise to Dollars 366bn (Pounds 223bn). While Australia has much riding on next week - its desire for trade liberalisation in the region stems from its urgent need to increase its export performance - its position is a long way from that of countries such as China, Malaysia and Thailand, which want to focus on the multilateral efforts in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Many ministers are increasingly convinced that the contentious issue of setting Apec's future agenda will have to be left to heads of state next week. Even so, according to one senior Thai official, there is a risk that the leaders will commit themselves to a process for which inadequate groundwork has been laid. Sharp differences remain over whether Apec has taken on a formal institutional role, or whether it is what Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister, yesterday called 'a loose, consultative forum' whose decisions are non-binding. Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, said Apec had undergone a rapid and inexorable process of institutionalisation with regular ministerial meetings on a range of issues. Australia's Mr Evans said Apec had already taken on the role of a negotiating forum in Seattle last year when it adopted an agenda for facilitating trade and investment. Mr MacLaren said he was somewhat unenthusiastic about Apec becoming bogged down in a debate about target dates for free trade: 'It's the starting date rather than the completion date that's important.' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the target date of 2020 was 'a goal and a vision for free trade'. Much depends, however on whether the US can resolve differences with China. Mr Kantor has scheduled a meeting with Ms Wu Yi, his Chinese counterpart, tomorrow, while President Bill Clinton is to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Jakarta on Monday.</p>

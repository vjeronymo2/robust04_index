			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Protest held at printing plant A MASS demonstration was held outside the Bristol printing plant of JW Arrowsmith yesterday to mark three months since the dismissal of most of its workforce, Roland Adburgham writes. Police estimated that about 450 people took part. The company, which specialises in printing technical journals, sacked 120 printers after they took industrial action over a pay claim. They were offered reinstatement at their previous pay levels but were told the company would no longer recognise their union, the Graphical, Paper &amp; Media Union. The plant has since been picketed and on July 9 the company obtained a High Court injunction against the union, restricting the number of pickets to six. The area branch of the GPMU said yesterday that its officials had not taken part in the demonstration outside the works but had held a separate meeting in the city centre. JW Arrowsmith has been advertising jobs to replace the sacked workers. Miss Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown, chairman and managing director, said staff were being hired at the rate of one or two a week.</p>

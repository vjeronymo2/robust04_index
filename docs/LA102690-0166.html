			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: PAYING FOR CAMPAIGNS;  </P> <P> NEUGEBAUER RAISES $25,055 IN RACE WITH WIEDER;  </P> <P> THE INCUMBENT SUPERVISOR'S LATEST FINANCIAL STATEMENT WAS NOT AVAILABLE;  EARLIER SHE SHOWED CONTRIBUTIONS OF $259,952. IN THE 72ND RACE, UMBERG IS  NEARING $500,000, BUT PRINGLE HAS MORE CASH ON HAND.  </P> <P> With less than two weeks to go in her bid to upset County Supervisor Harriett  M. Wieder, Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer has raised just $25,055,  according to a campaign finance statement filed Thursday.  </P> <P> Of that amount, Neugebauer has just over $7,000 to carry her through the final  week of the campaign. Still, Neugebauer, who has won most of her local  political races with meager amounts of money, said she is not dismayed.  </P> <P> "I'm optimistic," she said. "I haven't even sent out my one flyer, and my  support is snowballing. I do not intend to win this election on developer  dollars. I will win it on my qualifications and grass-roots support."  </P> <P> Wieder's latest campaign finance statement was not available. Her previous  campaign statement, which included contributions and expenditures through Sept.  30, showed total contributions of $259,952, and available cash of $62,380.  </P> <P> "It's an incentive to work harder when . . . the incumbent will exceed a half  million dollars," Neugebauer said.  </P> <P> In the 72nd Assembly District race, Democratic candidate Tom Umberg is fast  approaching the $500,000 mark. His latest report shows total contributions of  $433,478, with cash on hand of $11,944.  </P> <P> Umberg's overall fund raising is outpacing that of his opponent, Assemblyman  Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who has raised $315,719 and has $24,092 on hand.  </P> <P> But Pringle, who had a fund-raiser Thursday morning featuring former White  House security adviser Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, pointed out that Umberg had to  raise and spend a sizable portion of his war chest during a tough primary  battle and that the candidates are spending roughly equal amounts during the  fall campaign.  </P> <P> "The whole issue is what's left -- cash on hand -- and I'm glad I've got more  than he does," Pringle said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, supporters of Measure M, the proposed countywide half-cent sales tax  for transportation projects, said their report would not be available until  Friday. They had raised $220,000 through Sept. 30 and are hoping to finish with  about $600,000. Opponents of the measure have not raised any money so far and  have not filed any finance reports.  </P> <P> In the race for county superintendent of schools, incumbent Robert Peterson cut  into challenger John Dean's lead in available cash by loaning himself about  $15,000 during October.  </P> <P> Peterson has now raised $67,950 and has $6,797 remaining; Dean has raised  $86,783 and has $7,585 left.  </P> <P> In the district attorney's race, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright has  raised $80,312 in his effort to unseat the appointed incumbent Michael R.  Capizzi. Capizzi's campaign would not make available his figures Thursday, but  he had raised more than $222,000 through Sept. 30.  </P> <P> The bulk of Capizzi's contributions, however, were received before the June  primary, while Enright has received most of his money during the current  campaign.  </P></p>

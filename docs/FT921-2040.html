			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Guinness Yesterday's fall of more than 2 per cent in Guinness shares suggests that the equity market has still not fully adapted to low inflation. On its own admission, Guinness will find it harder to raise prices in a non-inflationary environment. In nominal terms its profits, which have more than doubled since 1987, will grow more slowly even if they still show a real increase. That might necessitate some adjustment to the rating, especially relative to depressed manufacturing companies with recovery potential. But in its haste to take the point on board, the market appears to have overdone the gloom. Admittedly, acquisitions in beer and other spirits will gradually reduce the share of high-margin Scotch in the overall business. Margins on spirits rose an underlying 2 percentage points to 33 per cent last year. They cannot continue to widen indefinitely, but there is still room for improvement as consumers move up-market after the recession. Nor does lower inflation mean volume growth has stopped dead in its tracks. There seems no reason why earnings should not advance by, say, 10 per cent in 1992 from last year's 33.6p. The forward multiple of around 15 is not demanding.</p>

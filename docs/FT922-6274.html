			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Mercedes breaks production mould in race to beat Japanese MERCEDES-BENZ yesterday launched its response to encroaching Japanese quality car makers, unveiling its third - and possibly its last - car factory on German soil. It did so with an unashamed display of self-esteem and claims that those who charge that Germany is losing its ability to compete should think again. The Rastatt works, situated close to the border with Alsace, is 'surely and simply the most up-to-date automotive factory in the world,' said Mr Werner Niefer, chief executive of the Daimler-Benz vehicles subsidiary. Its hallmarks were lean production and lean management. Not copied from the Japanese or the Scandinavians, Mr Niefer said, but entirely 'made in Germany'. Flexible team working is the key element in the new manufacturing process. Groups of 10 to 15 people plan their working schedules, mend their tools and equipment, swap jobs when they choose and take collective responsibility for the end product. Rastatt has no conventional assembly line. Nor does it have a car park by the loading bay, common in German car plants, where quality defects are corrected. 'Quality is not brought about by subsequent inspection,' Mr Niefer said. 'Quality is produced.' The aim is to reduce production costs by up to 25 per cent, and to introduce the lessons learnt, techniques tested and savings made at Rastatt into the group's other factories in nearby Sindelfingen and Bremen in the north. However, according to Mr Niefer, the company's cars are unlikely to become cheaper. 'We will try to make sure they do not become more expensive,' was the most he could offer. In the long term, he believed the company could outstrip the performance of its Japanese competitors. He added, however, they had access to cheaper capital and benefited from longer working hours. These factors accounted for an estimated 10 per cent of their cost advantage, and German companies could do nothing to counter them. The Rastatt plant, opening after eight years' planning and battles with environmentalists, will be steadily extended over the next two years. Output will rise from this year's target of 80 mid-range Mercedes a day to 360 by the end of 1996. Investment will climb from the DM500m (Pounds 170m) spent so far to more than DM2bn.</p>

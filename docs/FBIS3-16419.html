The plan provides for 19 bills to be drafted and  submitted for the consideration of the state duma, the  parliament's lower house.    The bills on the list include several draft laws worked out  on the basis of provisions of the presidential message to the  Federal Assembly. These are a draft law "On Russia's Free  Economic Zones", "On Participation of Russian Military  Contingents in Peacekeeping Missions, Including Within the CIS,  CSCE and UN Framework", "On International Treaties of the  Russian Federation", On the Status of Foreigners in Russia, and  "On Higher and Post-Graduate Professional Education".    The Federation Council also suggests drafting laws "on  Federal Bodies of State Power", "On a Procedure for  Implementation of the Federative Treaty and Delimitation of  Powers", "Basic Principles of Legislation on Veterans", "On  Federated Arrangement of the Russian Federation", and "On the  Status of a Subject of the Russian Federation".    Addressing the gathering with a report, the House's First  Deputy Speaker Ramazan Abdulatipov proposed setting up a  scientific coordinating body to coordinate legislative  activities by both chambers of the Russian Parliament.    The Federation Council passed a resolution saying it would  resume discussing the plan of legislative initiatives after the  state duma approved an analogous document.</p>

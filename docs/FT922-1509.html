			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Zoo may gain lifeline A CONSORTIUM of companies is to put proposals to the Zoological Society of London in the next few days to inject Pounds 61m into redeveloping its 36-acre Regent's Park site and creating a conservation centre. The consortium said: 'Anyone who thinks the zoo can stay the same is foolhardy. There will have to be changes. This is the only alternative they have.' London Zoo, which was founded 166 years ago, announced last week that it would be forced to close on September 30 as a result of falling attendances. Mr David Laing, the leisure entrepreneur and a member of the Zoological Society, has spent more than Pounds 100,000 drawing up the proposals. He is backed by the John Laing construction company, the Samuel Montagu finance house, and Cambridge Seven Associates, a design firm. The consortium, called New Zoo Developments, is also seeking a meeting with government representatives as 'a matter of urgency'. London Zoo yesterday welcomed the consortium's outline proposals and said it would be interested in receiving further details. The consortium said it would need a binding agreement from the Zoological Society before it entered into further feasibility studies costing more than Pounds 500,000. The proposals, which would be introduced over an eight-year period, envisage the building of a conservation centre to recreate three varieties of rainforest environment. An aquarium and film theatre would also be built, as well as new habitats for many of the zoo's animals.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Union Jacques that Eurosceptics fear: As Europe's leaders meet in Corfu this weekend, Charles Grant assesses Delors' impact on western Europe and how his contribution has defined the debate on its future for decades to come This weekend on the island of Corfu, Europe's leaders hope to name the man who will implement - or abandon - the vision of Jacques Delors for a grand political union on the eastern side of the Atlantic. After 10 years as President of the European Commission, Delors has come to symbolise the ideals of a generation of European federalists - and everything that Eurosceptics dislike and fear. After the great battle in Rome in October 1990, between Margaret Thatcher and Delors about his plan for a single European currency, Britain's The Sun newspaper filled its front page with the three words: 'Up yours Delors'. If this expressed only the inchoate fears of little Englanders, there has since emerged a widespread anxiety in many European countries about Delors' vision of a federal future. Yet no politician since the second world war has made a greater impact on western Europe. General De Gaulle and Margaret Thatcher made profound changes in their own countries, it is true. But Delors leaves an indelible mark on half a continent. He transformed the feeble and ineffective bureaucracy of the European Commission, and the European Union it serves, into influential and intrusive organisations. It is precisely because of this that they have attracted a wave of popular hostility. How did this workaholic, with the fiery temper and a strong sense of Roman Catholic morality, achieve such a position? And why is it that he is one of the most popular politicians in France, where he is likely to be the Left's candidate for the presidency in May? Delors' absence from the fray of party and factional struggle - as a deus ex machina in Brussels - has given him the image of someone who is above politics. He has nurtured this myth, often claiming that he is too naive, too lacking in self confidence and too unambitious to succeed in politics. And indeed he has never been at ease in any political party. In the 1950s and 1960s he worked with a series of left-wing Roman Catholic clubs rather than the socialist party. He has never been elected to an assembly, with the exception of the European Parliament in 1979. However, the story of Delors' European presidency reveals him to be a master of tactical skill, strategic sense and political cunning. When he became president of the European Economic Community (which later became the European Community, or EC, and later still the European Union, or EU) use of the national veto had ensured that the commission's draft laws seldom passed the Council of Ministers. From his first month in office, Delors began to transform the Community. He had huge influence on: the programme to create a single market by the end of 1992; the Single European Act; the budgetary packages of 1988 and 1992; the European Economic Area; the Social Charter and the Social Chapter; the Delors Report on Economic and Monetary Union (Emu); and the subsequent moves to 'political union'. The EU became such a success during the Delors years that nine countries applied to join. These were remarkable achievements, for it is much more difficult for a politician to make a mark on European institutions than on his own government. The constitutions of nation-states are hierarchical, and allow a prime minister or president with a parliamentary majority huge scope for making changes. The EU, however, is a complex network of supra-national bodies (the commission, European Parliament and Court of Justice), inter-governmental bodies (the Council of Ministers) and national governments, which all contribute to the legislative and executive processes. The EU's constitution allows no role for a leader with a strong executive authority. Ultimately, the Council of Ministers takes the most important decisions, but only after officials from the commission, the Council of Ministers' secretariat, the European Parliament and national ministries have been consulted. Euro-MPs, commissioners, junior ministers, national ambassadors and hundreds of lobbyists all have a say. Committees, working groups and all-night meetings - rather than powerful individuals - are the cogs which drive this machinery forward. Decision-making is so slow and consensual that decisive leadership from the centre is almost impossible, as Delors' predecessors discovered. How, then, did Delors set about the task? Luck played its part. The Community began to regain momentum just before his arrival. The Fontainebleau summit, which appointed him in 1984, settled five years of arguments over Britain's budget contribution. In an increasingly liberal climate, most governments thought the best treatment for Eurosclerosis would be deregulation. Delors exploited these opportunities with great tactical skill. When he chose to relaunch Europe around the theme of the single market, he understood - better than many British politicians - that there would be political consequences. The commission's white paper of 300 barrier-busting proposals put pressure on governments to provide the means for implementing them. The result was the Single European Act, which ended the national veto on single market laws. Delors' next key initiative, in 1988, was to push the EC towards European monetary union. He knew that would provoke a debate on the reform of the EC's institutions - which became known as political union. Delors always had a clear idea of where he wanted Europe to go, which gave him an advantage over political opponents who lacked his long-term vision. A commission president has few formal means of influencing European politics, other than the right of proposal. Much of Delors' clout has depended on the friendships he cultivated with EC prime ministers and foreign ministers. Helmut Kohl has proved by far the most useful of these allies. The pair enjoy each other's company, sharing a strong Roman Catholic faith and an earthy sense of humour. In 1988 Delors persuaded Kohl to back Emu, and the chancellor made his friend chairman of what became the Delors Committee. In 1989 Delors' warm support for German unity - when Thatcher and Mitterrand had doubts - turned friendship into blutsbruderschaft. During the talks on the Treaty of Maastricht, Delors relied on Kohl to keep the other governments in step with his timetable for Emu. Many of Delors' personal qualities proved well-suited to his job. The president has a chance to set the EU's agenda, so is likely to be more effective if, as in Delors' case, he - there has yet to be a she - is a prodigious generator of ideas. Throughout his career, in articles, speeches and books, Delors has spurted out proposals on industrial relations, labour markets, monetary economics and Europe's constitution. Delors' staff joke that the role of Pascal Lamy, his chef de cabinet until last month, was to tell the president which were the 19 of his 20 ideas that would not work. Delors combines a fertile imagination with a pragmatic bent that makes him a keen compromiser. He spends evenings and weekends reading and annotating documents. At meetings of the Council of Ministers and at summits he is usually better prepared than anyone else. His forte at such occasions is to craft compromises which others fail to find because they lack his knowledge of the detail. Thus at the Edinburgh summit of December 1992, Delors found the formula which settled the EU's budgetary plans to 1999. Delors believes he has a duty to serve God by improving the lot of mankind. That sense of mission justifies, in Delors' own mind, his ambition. 'What drives me is the worry - a sort of panic - that I might not do useful things,' he says. 'I am never satisfied. Evidently, those who are will be happier.' He is uninterested in money and, in spite of a Pounds 140,000 a year salary (after tax), leads a frugal life. He avoids diplomatic soirees and seldom ventures out in the evening - unless one of his favourite jazz musicians, such as Sonny Rollins, happens to be performing. He descended into one of his blackest-ever moods in February 1988, just before a Brussels summit that was supposed to approve his budgetary package. Delors told a meeting of commissioners that if, as he feared, the summit did not pass his package, he would resign and they should too. When none of them offered to do so he accused the commissioners of cowardice and disloyalty. If there was a shipwreck, he said, they were all in it and he would denounce any survivors. He accused Grigoris Varfis, the Greek commissioner, of incompetence and treachery, and said that he and his department were une honte (shameful) and une scandale. Delors four times told his colleagues that they should be ready to resign with him. After two hours of this haranging he stormed out. In the event the summit passed the package and Delors never had to test his colleagues' loyalty. Surprisingly, those who experience Delors' ire are usually ready to forgive him, for they respect his integrity and his ideals. 'Delors' weaknesses, such as his self-questioning, make you want to protect him,' says Max Kohnstamm, formerly chief aide to Jean Monnet (one of the Community's founding fathers), and a friend of Delors. 'If he kicks someone, you don't ask if he's plotting against them, because you know he's doing it for Europe.' He inherited a horizontal power structure in which the president was primus inter pares among the other commissioners. With the aid of Lamy and the other members of his cabinet - who were brilliant, dedicated and capable of ruthlessness - Delors created a pyramidal structure, with himself at the summit. Many of the other commissioners were sidelined, while Delors installed loyal friends - members of the 'Delors network' - in key posts. To win arguments against commissioners such as Sir Leon Brittan, Delors' staff sometimes used dubious methods, such as editing or even rewriting the minutes of commission meetings. In October 1987 Delors told the European Parliament that America would let the dollar fall to DM1.60. The dollar dipped two pfennigs and several finance ministers rebuked Delors for speaking out of turn. Lamy told journalists that the president had been misquoted and sent a member of the cabinet to the parliament's office. The envoy found the official who was editing the report of that day's proceedings and bullied him into deleting the offending words. The report had been printed when Lord Plumb, the parliament's president, discovered the ruse. He had the report pulped and then reprinted with Delors' true words. By the end of Delors' reign, his authoritarian management style had created as many problems as it had solved. His network's huge influence undermined the commission's traditional chains of command, and especially the role of the directors-general, the top tier of officials. The regime's excesses harmed the morale of many officials. Delors and Lamy justified their strong-arm tactics with the argument that, in such a creaking and ramshackle bureaucracy, there was no other way to get things done. However they never attempted a fundamental reform of that bureaucracy's failings. Delors has always found ideas and policy more interesting than administration. His departure at the end of this year, and the inevitable withering of his network, will deprive the commission of its spine - and leave management problems for his successor. Delors' tactical skill began to desert him in the 1990s. He became over-confident and appeared too ambitious on behalf of the commission. By 1991, the year of the inter-governmental conferences, the commission's growing power - and the perception that Delors wanted even more for it - had irked several governments. Delors' draft treaty for political union proved too federalist, particularly in the large role it proposed for the commission in foreign policy, to have any impact other than to annoy governments. Delors had become too wrapped in the logic of the EC's institutional mechanisms. In common with many national politicians, Delors had failed to see that a large part of public opinion understood neither the Community nor what he was trying to achieve. Hence his surprise when, after Denmark's Nej to Maastricht in June 1992, popular sentiment in Britain, France and Germany turned against the EC, the commission and himself. In the coming decades, the debate about the future of Europe will be defined by the opposing ideas of Delors and Thatcher. Her side wants only a confederation of free-trading nation states. Delorists will argue that European countries have enough in common in their history, culture and values to make it worth pooling their economic, diplomatic and military resources into a union that can hold its own with the superpowers. Delors has turned the Community into a powerful entity which threatens national officials, parliamentarians and ministers. It also frightens many citizens. Thanks to Delors, public opinion has become, for the first time, a crucial factor in the shaping of the future of the union - and a brake on his own federalist designs.

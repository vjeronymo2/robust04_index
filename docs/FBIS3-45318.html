Hanna-Rnate Laurien, president of the Berlin City's  parliament, made these remarks at a reception hosted by her in  honor of Qiao Shi, who is here on an eight-day official goodwill  visit to Germany.    She said she was very pleased that Qiao's visit is paid  following the China visits respectively by German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl last year and mayor of Berlin City Eberhatd Diepgen  in 1988.    Laurien hailed the sound growth of bilateral ties in  economy,  science and culture.    She said Germany's investment in China ranks the sixth in  the  world, adding that there is a sign that such position will be  moved forward.    Qiao said Berlin, the largest city in Germany, has great  influence on the world.    With the German Federal Government and parliament to be  moved  to Berlin before the end of this century, the city will play  more important roles in the country's politics, economy and  cultural life, he said.    "We are particularly pleased to note that Berlin and China  have shared very close relationship," he added.    Their links in every aspect are daily increasing and areas  for cooperation become wider, he said.    Qiao hoped that "such relationship will be further developed  with fruitful results," Qiao said.    Among those present were Qiao Shi's wife Yu Wen and Cao Zhi,  secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, who are  accompanying Qiao on the visit.    Before the reception, Qiao met and had a friendly talk with  Laurien here.</p>

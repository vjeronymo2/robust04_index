Andreyev]    [Abstract] Measurements of intense internal waves were  conducted over several years by temperature sensors with spaced  antennae distributed over the shelf zones of the Caspian Sea and  the Sea of Japan.    The author's examination of the measurements showed that the  discrepancy between the dispersive relationship of linear  internal waves of the first mode and the parameters of measured  waves is connected with the non-linearity of the latter. The  waves which were observed showed features which were evidence of  their soliton nature, such as, for example, their greater speed  as compared to linear waves, and the dependence of their speed  on amplitude. Some typical manifestations of soliton  manifestations in internal waves in the shelf zones were  multi-stage tidal bores and precursor waves.    The author concludes that the most reliable means of  identifying solitons in on-the-scene oceanological  investigations is by means of qualitative concurrence. As  regards a quantitative comparison with the equation of Cortevega  de Brisa, there does not appear to be full concurrence in all  parameters, although in some cases the agreement seems to be  very close. This can be explained by the numerous factors which  are not considered in the equation, such as the current, the  proximity of the bottom, etc. Nonetheless the properties of  solitons in shelf zones are sufficiently pronounced so that they  cannot be obscured by external environmental factors and the  variability of these factors.</p>

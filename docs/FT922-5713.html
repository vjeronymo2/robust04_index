			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / France accelerates into the overtaking lane / Examining evidence that London is falling further behind Paris in its transport connections Londoners spend longer commuting further in more late-running, overcrowded trains and buses than their Parisian counterparts, and their relative plight looks set to worsen during the 1990s. Even Paris's notoriously congested motorway system is to be improved by a network of privately financed motorways, while 'no change' is the name of the game for London. Only in buses - where both capitals are progressively privatising their routes - are the two cities on the same road, to evident advantage. Those are the findings of a report* comparing transport in the two cities, to be issued next month. It is the joint work of the London Research Centre, an independent think tank, and Iaurif, planning institute for the Ile-de-France regional council, which embraces Paris. Their conclusion, that London is the poor relation in urban transport, has been reinforced this week by the insolvency of Canary Wharf, the business development in London's Docklands to whose success inadequate rail links were a significant impediment. In both Paris and London, commuting is the grim lot of a similar share of the workforce. The proportion of journeys to work made by public transport is higher in Paris (43 against 37 per cent). But London's more dispersed residential geography means that its commuters typically travel about a tenth again as far their Parisian counterparts - offsetting the relative advantage of London's more far-reaching Underground and suburban Network SouthEast systems. Besides that, the honours are with Paris. Its central area rail network is now far superior to London's: within a comparable central zone the Metro runs across almost twice as many kilometres as the Underground, and the average distance between its stations is half that in London. La Defense, Paris's edge-of-centre business district, has fast suburban-line connections and gained a Metro link last month. Docklands, its London equivalent, has a sub-standard railway. An Underground link, through an extended Jubilee line, has been jeopardised by the failure of Canary Wharf. Paris also benefits from more express cross-city rail routes: it has three through lines, with a fourth partially built and a fifth projected. Thameslink, London's sole equivalent, is infrequent - especially in peak hours, because of capacity constraints. Another (crossrail) is planned, but work has yet to start. Forty years after it opened, Heathrow airport still lacks a fast rail link to the city: a British Rail/British Airports Authority consortium has permission to build one, but is strapped for cash and looking for other partners. It is not just on routes, but on overcrowding, punctuality and frequency, that London scores poorly. Three facts suffice. Almost a third of the Underground's network is judged overcrowded in the central zone, compared with 5 per cent in Paris; 94 per cent of Paris peak hour suburban services arrived within five minutes of schedule in 1989-90, compared with 83 per cent in London; central-zone Metro frequencies in Paris range from 1.5 to 4 minutes in peak hours - in London the range is 2.5 to 8 minutes. 'These differences are crucial,' says Mr Caralampo Focas, editor of the joint study. 'While journey times are not much different, people have to allow far more time to travel by public transport in London.' Behind such contrasts lie crucial differences in investment and organisation. It is not just government largesse: business pays a share of the cost of Paris's public transport and the RATP city transport authority raises capital on the bond markets. Bus and train fares in Paris are only half those in London, and revenue from passengers and commercial activities accounts for less than half the spending of Paris's two main public transport providers - RATP and the SNCF state railways. About half of the rest comes from a payroll tax on enterprises with more than 10 employees, levied at a rate of 2.2 per cent in Paris city and half that in the suburbs. Companies are also obliged to reimburse half the cost of employees' season tickets. By contrast, London's business makes no contribution to transport spending beyond one-off levies in exchange for development consents. Paris is planning similar levies to fund expansion of its roads system for the region. The Ile-de-France region is about to finalise a 25-year development plan for the capital which envisages a fourth ring road and at least five underground motorways which charge tolls. The idea is to copy in Paris the system of toll motorways crossing the rest of France and to keep the cost to the taxpayer down. In London, by contrast, there are few development plans for roads. 'There is a national concern in France to make the Paris transport system shine,' says Mr Focas. 'It is seen as a facilitator to development, while terms such as 'making London into a great city' don't appear anywhere.' The different government structures in the two capitals also help explain their divergent paths. Central government is the principal player in both cities: their main transport providers are nationalised industries with remits set by ministers. In Paris, though, the powerful City government and the Ile-de-France region - neither with a London equivalent - are powerful lobbyists for the city's transport needs. They also put money behind their dreams, footing a large part of the bill for capital spending. More than a third of the region's 1991 budget of FFr10.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) was devoted to transport. The city government spends about FFr2bn on transport, including roads, parking and a contribution to the RATP. The city has equal representation with the state on the Syndicat des Transports Parisiens (STP), the body responsible for public transport planning in the capital. The contrast with London is stark. As the report puts it: 'Overall and comprehensive planning of transport has been abandoned and the operation of the transport system has been increasingly dismembered among private developers, boroughs and counties, different government departments, nationalised industries and quangos.' The result? In London, the past 25 years has seen the construction of 33km of new Underground/suburban track and 250km of new motorway; in the same period Paris has brought 137km of new track and 500km of motorway into service. As to London's long-term plans - there are none. There is a neat symmetry to all this. In the 1950s and 1960s Parisian planners looked to London, its Tubes, red buses and city-wide council, for inspiration. Now the wheel has come full circle, with Paris the model to be followed. Perhaps understanding will be facilitated by the opening of the Channel tunnel link - albeit delayed, and with no fast link to London. * Available from HMSO, Pounds 23.99.

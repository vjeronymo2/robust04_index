			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Observer: On the money Ladbrokes seems to have been remarkably accurate in calling Eddie George in the race for the Bank of England governorship. It has yet to open a book on the timing and content of the next cabinet reshuffle. But for what it's worth the smart money suggests the following: June cabinet reshuffle: Evens; Hurd to quit Foreign Office for the City: 2 to 1 on; Lamont to succeed him at FCO: 3 to 1; outsider for FCO, Tim Renton, former chief whip: 300 to 1. For the Treasury, MacGregor: Evens; Howard: 3 to 1; Portillo: 5 to 1; outsider Shephard: 20 to 1.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai Overseas  Company is helping local companies open businesses in other  countries and regions.    An official of the company said that his company signed  earlier this year an agreement with the Shanghai Traditional  Chinese and Western Medicines Co. Ltd. to jointly establish a  pharmaceutical company in Singapore.    It also signed agreements with the Shanghai Aquatic Products  Group, the Shanghai Marine Shipping Group and the Shanghai  Nonferrous Metals Company to launch eight new firms in Britain,  Germany, Singapore and the United States, the official said.    He said that these overseas firms will handle futures  trading, provide marine shipping services or open supermarkets.    The company has decided to launch a group company later this  year so as to make better use of its marketing network overseas,  managerial expertise and market information, he said.    To date, local businesses have opened 420 firms in 60  countries and regions with the company's help, he said, adding  that most of these businesses are doing well.    For example, a firm opened by the Shanghai Machine Tool  Plant  in the United States has set up 20 outlets to market  Chinese-built machine tools to 100 American customers.    The official said that his company will also help overseas  firms expand into multi-national companies combining production  with trade.    The company has decided to set up such a group company in  Western Europe, and new subsidiaries in Singapore, the Republic  of Korea, Africa and Southeast Asia later this year, he said.    The Shanghai municipal authorities have decided to adopt  internationally accepted practices in managing overseas firms  launched by local enterprises, he said.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Bosnian push 'to prevent a massacre' BOSNIA'S army commander, General Sefir Halilovic, yesterday ordered his forces to launch a counter-offensive against Bosnian Serb troops in the east of the country, 'to prevent the massacre of innocent people' in besieged Moslem enclaves. The lives of thousands of women, children, old, wounded and exhausted people were at risk in the region, following a 10-day assault by the Bosnian Serb army, Gen Halilovic told Sarajevo radio. Moslem leaders fear that the besieged Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and Konjevic Polje in the eastern Bosnian highlands are under imminent threat from Serbian forces, following their occupation of nearby Cerska last week. However, despite the fighting, General Philippe Morillon, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, said after talks with Serb leaders in their administrative headquarters of Pale, near Sarajevo, that the Serbs had agreed to the evacuation of Moslems from the two enclaves this week. They would allow a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy to go to Konjevic Polje today and the trucks could probably return to Srebrenica on Thursday. But officials warned that such deals had often broken down in the past when it came to implementing them. A UNHCR official and a World Health Organisation doctor, who went to Srebrenica last weekend, said some 2,000 people were ill and were dying at the rate of 30 each day. Thousands of people wanted to be evacuated from the area, they said. The announcement of the Moslem offensive marked the end of a unilateral ceasefire declared several weeks ago by government forces. At the same time, Gen Halilovic withdrew from talks in Sarajevo with General Ratko Mladic, the Serb military commander, and Gen Morillon on a truce in eastern Bosnia. President Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, defended the counter-offensive by stressing that 'any measure to protect these people from slaughter is a legitimate measure'. Gen Halilovic said that all available Moslem military units in the region had been ordered to take part in the attack against Vlasenica, which commands a vital road link for Serbs between their administrative headquarters at Pale and Serb-occupied territory in northern Bosnia. Though Serb army headquarters confirmed heavy fighting was taking place in several areas of eastern Bosnia, it claimed that Moslem units had been repulsed and had suffered heavy losses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "`Working Russia' Movement. </F> Wages for the Workers, and the Sack for the Bureaucrats"]    [Text] About 200 delegates from 37 oblasts, 6 republics,  and 2 krays, as well as 175 delegates of the "Working Capital"  congress from Moscow and the Moscow region, participated in the  Second Congress of the "Working Russia" All-Russia  Sociopolitical Movement, which took place 23 April in the city  of Reutovo, Moscow Oblast. Viktor Anpilov's report "On the  Socioeconomic Situation in Russia," the coreports by well-known  scientists Boris Khorev and Aleksey Sergeyev, and the delegates'  speeches noted that further enforced capitalization of the  country will exacerbate the crisis, compound the already  desperate situation in which the workers find themselves, and  turn Russia into a colony of the developed capitalist countries.    The congress expressed an unequivocal view: Only a complete  change of the country's political and economic policy and the  restoration of workers' power from top to bottom in the shape of  soviets will extricate society from the crisis.    "Working Russia" has always been against private property  and  the implementation of the predatory privatization program which  has brought poverty, unemployment, and social inequality to the  majority of the working people. Each increase in the percentage  of the country's unemployed should be matched by an identical  reduction in Russia's administrative apparatus, which has  increased greatly and exceeds the number of administrators in  the whole of the Soviet Union's structures, the delegates said.  Another slogan which was ardently supported was: "Wages for  the workers, the sack for the president and the bureaucrats!"    The congress adopted a package of documents, having  confirmed  its policy to organize a general political strike in Russia.  Advocating peace and stability in society, the delegates  demanded that the powers that be respect existing laws and that  President Yeltsin be dismissed immediately. A public committee  to investigate the tragedy of 3-4 October was formed and Russian  People's Deputy Yuriy Slobodkin will head it.    The congress supported the "Working Capital's" decision to  nominate Viktor Anpilov as a Russian presidential candidate.  Anpilov himself is categorically against the institution of the  presidency which is incompatible with true democracy, and is  joining the battle for the post of president with the sole aim  of abolishing the institution of the presidency which is hateful  to the people and bringing back the soviets of working people as  his very first act if he is elected.    Oleg Shenin, chairman of the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU  Council Political Executive Committee; Timo Lahdenmaeki,  chairman of the Finnish Communist Workers Party; Eric Trevet,  general secretary of the new Communist Party of England;  Yeoryios Mavrikos, member of the Communist Party of Greece  Central Committee, Sergio Rubens, member of the Brazilian "8  October" Revolutionary Movement Coordination Committee; Bill  Doris, member of the U.S. Workers' World Party Central  Committee; and others ardently welcomed "Working Russia's"  heroic struggle to resurrect the Soviet Union, socialism, and  Soviet power.    "Working Russia" called on all working people to hold a May  Day demonstration under the slogans: "Authorities Without  Criminals," "Life Without Speculators," "Stable Prices," and  "Unity of the USSR's Peoples."</p>

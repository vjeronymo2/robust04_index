			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (9): Bafflingly slow recovery - George Bush has presided over the slowest growth of any president since Herbert Hoover / United States THE sluggishness of the US economy is baffling the experts. Most forecasters expected a moderately robust recovery to get under way more than a year ago. With short-term interest rates at the lowest level in a generation, few can understand why the economy is still so lifeless. What little confidence remained was squashed by the August employment report. The figures were almost as shocking as the damage wrought by Hurricane Andrew. Wall Street had been looking for an increase in payroll employment of about 150,000. In the event, non-farm employment plunged 83,000; and the decline would have been close to 200,000 but for the cushioning effect of a federal summer jobs programme. The monthly figures are often erratic: the August drop in employment followed unexpectedly good figures in July. What depresses analysts most is the fact that private sector employment has been flat since April last year, the month that many economists believe marked the formal end of the 1991/92 recession. The jobs figures, moreover, are far from the only recent setback. Retail sales fell more sharply than expected in August. Consumer confidence slipped further last month after a sharp decline in July. Orders for durable goods and new home sales also fell in July. The economy is at best creeping forward. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent between April and June, to register its fifth successive quarterly advance. This was roughly the average pace of growth since the economy began to expand in spring last year. The betting among forecasters is that the abnormally slow recovery will continue, but doubts are growing. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and a veteran forecaster, has been as surprised as anybody by the prolonged semi-recession. He has cut short-term interest rates by two thirds - from almost 10 per cent in mid-1989 (when the boom of the 1980s began to peter out) to just 3 per cent. In most downturns such a decisive easing of monetary policy would have stimulated a robust recovery. It has not done so only because the structural imbalances' that developed during the 1980s have proved more severe and enduring than anybody had expected. The unprecedented accumulation of debt in the past decade, much of which financed speculative investments in real estate and other physical assets, is still exerting a strong downward drag. Parallels for such 'debt deflation', Mr Greenspan believes, can be found only in the frequent booms and busts that afflicted the US economy before the Second World War. The Fed's aggressive easing has prevented the plunges in output and employment associated with 19th Century financial busts, but has not yet spurred a convincing recovery. One of the principal hurdles is the abnormally depressed level of consumer confidence. American households are worried less by the slow recovery than by the fact that living standards have stagnated for four years: George Bush has presided over the slowest growth of any president since Herbert Hoover. Some would say the worries run deeper still: many groups of workers have seen no significant increase in wages since the early 1970s. Economists differ over long-term strategies for reviving growth. Governor Bill Clinton's advisers seek faster productivity growth via higher investment in education, training and infrastructure; Mr Bush's are vainly searching for a way to finance new tax cuts and hence increase incentives for work and saving. But neither side thinks much can be done to improve the immediate outlook. With most other big economies either in or near recession, little stimulus can be expected from exports. And the quadrupling of the national debt under the Republicans appears to rule out a significant fiscal boost - whoever wins the election. The Fed's room for manoeuvre is also limited. The small cut in German interest rates took some pressure off the dollar, but with the US economy so weak the respite could be shortlived. But for exchange market considerations, the Fed almost certainly would have cut the discount rate following the shock of the August employment report. Instead it made do with a quarter point cut in the federal funds rate; it is likely to remain cautious. In the longer-term, there are several chinks of light. Individual and corporate debt ratios have fallen significantly in the past two years, suggesting that the ground is being prepared for an eventual resumption of borrowing and spending. Parts of the US - the south-west in particular - could benefit substantially from the free trade pact recently agreed with Mexico. The lengthy period of stagnation, moreover, has served to reduce inflation to the lowest level for a generation: many forecasters believe 2-3 per cent inflation is now a realistic prospect. If recent opinion polls are to be believed, however, Mr Bush may not remain in office long enough to claim the credit.</p>

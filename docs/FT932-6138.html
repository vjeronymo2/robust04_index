			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK television Mr Peter Brooke's hints of a relaxation of the rules preventing consolidation of the ITV network certainly switched on the stock market. The shares of several TV companies shot ahead after the national heritage secretary's remarks in anticipation of juicy takeovers. The excitement is premature and might be misplaced. There certainly appears to be a need for industry rationalisation if independent television companies are to remain competitive with cable and satellite rivals. As currently structured, the ITV network wastefully duplicates production facilities and corporate structures. Industry executives suggest there may be up to Pounds 200m of 'excess' cost in the system. Some rationalisation may occur next year, when any of the big nine stations can bid for one of their smaller peers. Mr Brooke will now consider whether they should be allowed to bid for each other too. Such a change would provoke fierce opposition from some in the industry. It might also raise problems with the OFT. Would the competition authorities, for example, nod through a merger of Carlton TV and Central if it gave the combined group more than 30 per cent of ITV revenues? ITV companies may argue that the TV advertising market should be more broadly defined. But that sits oddly with their contention that BSkyB is a subscription not an advertising channel.</p>

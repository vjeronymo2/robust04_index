A Captain Kim of the 21st Division of the puppet Army,  chatting with his pals over the situation recently, said the  People's Army of the North under the command of General Kim  Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, is an unrivalled  strong Army.    He said:    "General Kim Chong-il, possessed of outstanding military  strategy as his born gift, has built the People's Army into a  well-disciplined, unrivalled strong Army. Unity between  officers and men, Army-civilian unity, the arming of all the  people and the fortification of the whole country are true looks  of the mighty North."    Listening to him, a second lieutenant surnamed Choe said:    "The way of averting the danger of war, loving peace and  achieving reunification, the ardent aspiration of the nation, is  to hold in high esteem and uphold General Kim Chong-il, the most  famous general in the world produced by our nation, as  commander-in-chief of the national Army. Herein lies the way of  warding off national disaster, the way for us to live, for the  nation to live and the way of achieving reunification."</p>

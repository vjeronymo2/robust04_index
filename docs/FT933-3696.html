			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / US pledges key role in push for wider settlement THE US promised to take a central political, financial and even military role in efforts to sustain the momentum for a wider Middle East peace yesterday on the eve of the accord between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. At 11am today, Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, will stand together on the White House south lawn to witness signature of an outline agreement giving Palestinians limited self-rule in the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. A short text, the fruit of months of secret negotiations in Norway, is intended to mark the end of one of the 20th century's most bitter conflicts. It will be signed by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Abu Mazen, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official, before 2,500 distinguished guests. The hour-long ceremony offers the prospect of Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin, sworn foes for decades, endorsing the peace with a symbolic handshake. Mr Arafat, who flew into Washington last night for his first visit to the US since he brandished both a gun and an olive branch at the United Nations in 1974, is expected to forsake his customary military fatigues and pistol and don a suit. The ceremony will cap an extraordinary two weeks which began when Israel and the PLO surprised the world by announcing they were on the verge of an agreement on mutual recognition and limited Palestinian autonomy. In a series of statements yesterday, the Clinton administration strove to maintain efforts for a wider peace with undertakings designed to accelerate agreement between Israel and its other Arab neighbours - Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. In an interview with the New York Times, President Bill Clinton assured Israel that the peace accord with the PLO would not herald cuts in billions of dollars of aid and military assistance. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, also said that the US was prepared to offer troops to guarantee security in the Golan Heights after any negotiated Israeli withdrawal. But Mr Clinton and Mr Al Gore, his vice-president, also stressed that while the US was prepared to offer financial aid to support peace in the region, it did not see itself as the main provider. 'We stand ready to do our part,' Mr Gore said on NBC television. 'But we're not speaking of anything comparable to previous agreements where the US was the sole guarantor.' Mr Clinton echoed the point when he announced that he had won an undertaking from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler, for a strong Saudi-led aid package from the Gulf states - whose relations with the Palestinians were deeply soured by the PLO's pro-Iraqi stand in the Gulf war. Mr Clinton quoted the king as saying: 'You take the lead in organising it, and tell us what we are supposed to do.' The president also said he had elicited approval for the PLO-Israeli deal from President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, who had hitherto refrained from any direct comment on the agreement. Quoting also from a recent 30-minute conversation with Mr Assad, Mr Clinton said the Syrian leader said: 'It is a positive thing, this agreement, for all of us.' Mr Clinton said Mr Assad explicity called on the US to play a continuing and central role in mediating an agreement between Israel and Syria, which hinges on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for a Syrian declaration of 'full peace' with Tel Aviv.</p>

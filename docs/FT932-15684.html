			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Change of heart by two banks blocked 3i flotation A CHANGE of heart by Barclays and National Westminster banks led to Thursday's abandonment of an autumn share flotation by Investors in Industry (3i), the venture capital group, it was understood yesterday. Both banks, which together own 41 per cent of 3i, are thought to believe that 3i's value is likely to increase sharply over the next two years, so any flotation should be postponed for at least that long. The abandonment of the flotation plan led to the resignation of 3i's chairman, Mr Alan Wheatley, who joined the group last July on the understanding that it would obtain a stock market listing. He will be succeeded by Sir Max Williams, deputy chairman, until the appointment of a permanent replacement. The Bank of England is understood to be particularly disappointed that the share sale has been shelved. 3i, which has net assets of Pounds 1.2bn and is the leading provider of risk capital to small and medium-sized com-panies, is owned by six of the UK's biggest banks and the Bank of England. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, which owns 13 per cent, said there was no 'big split' between the banks on whether to sell. 'You would not have got much of a price for the shares at the moment. Even for those willing to consider selling, it depends on price,' he said. Barings, 3i's merchant bank, had argued that the sale was in the banks' interest. A month ago, Barings recommended to the banks that an autumn flotation should go ahead, according to bankers and a 3i director. The proposal was that the banks should sell a minority stake, leaving them with between 60 and 75 per cent of the company. Even though the depth of the UK recession meant the stock market price of 3i's shares would be less than some banks wanted, Barings believed that the long-term value of their remaining shares would be increased by the flotation for two reasons: As a quoted company, 3i would for the first time have been able to take advantage of its investment trust status. This would have meant that, as the economy recovered, 3i would have been able to sell an increasing number of investments but without paying capital gains tax. 3i would have raised additional capital in the flotation, allowing it to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic growth returned.

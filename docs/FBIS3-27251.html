To this end, the authorities have decided to invest 8  billion  yuan ($920 million) in its post and telecommunication industry  in 1994.    Of the investment, 2.5 billion yuan ($287 million) will be  used to develop mobile telephones. Half of China's 840,000  mobile telephone users live in Guangdong.    By the end of this year, Guangdong will have raised  installed  capacity by 400,000 lines. And the number of customers is  expected to rise to 180,000, bringing the province's total to  600,000.    Guangdong will also add 2.5 million telephone lines,  including 100,000 for international direct dial (IDD) and 50,000  in the countryside. To do this the province is installing 28  cables connecting Guangzhou with Shantou and Macao and  undertaking several digital microwave projects.    Meanwhile, Guangdong will add 110 postal vans and build 200  more post and telecommunication offices to meet growing demand.    Guangdong's post and telecommunications business is expected  to amount to 14 billion yuan ($1.61 billion) this year. In 1993  telecommunications alone earned the province 9.4 billion yuan  ($1.1 billion).    And by 2010 the post and telecommunication industry is  expected to have fixed assets worth 270 billion yuan ($31  billion). By then Guangdong will have enough installed capacity  to provide telephone service to 45 of every 100 residents.    As of l993, 6 percent of Guangdong's residents had a  telephone, compared with the national rate of 2.15 per cent.    It is expected that in the next two decades, Guangdong will  add 2 million telephone users every year. Last year 1 million  customers were added to push the total beyond 5 million, or 20  per cent of the country's total.    To further promote the industry, Guangdong is considering  more imports of advanced equipments this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement issued by Pak Song-chol, member of the WPK </F> Central Committee Political Bureau and vice president, on 3  January; place not given]    [Text] Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the Political  Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee  and vice president of the DPRK, yesterday issued a press  statement supporting the fatherland's reunification formula  expounded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New  Year's address.    The press statement by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the  WPK Central Committee Political Bureau and vice president of the  DPRK says:    Our people--who embrace the historic New Year's address made  by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, the great sun  of the nation and the lodestar of the fatherland's  reunification, ringing in the hopeful New Year, 1994, with  boundless gratitude and excitement--are filled with firm resolve  and confidence to effect a new revolutionary upsurge in  socialist construction and expedite the cause for reunifying the  fatherland independently under the party's wise leadership in  this year.    In his New Year's address, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, summing up last year, noted that the officers and men  of our heroic People's Army and all the people, in hearty  response to the party's militant call, stood up as one man in  the struggle to brilliantly adorn last year's Third Seven-Year  Plan and to defend the country's sovereignty and revolutionary  achievements with an unshakable confidence in victory and in  soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's challenge and aggressive  scheme and honorably safeguarded the dignity and security of  their socialist fatherland.    The great leader, in this year in which socialist  construction enters a new stage of development, expounded the  glorious tasks of consolidating and developing the achievements  already made in the revolution and construction and achieving  new and greater (?achievements) so as to further add luster to  the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style.    In particular, touching on our party and the Republic  government's sincere efforts made in the last year to open a way  for the fatherland's reunification with the nation's united  strength, the great leader clarified our party's principled  position as regards to the fatherland's reunification.    Convinced that our party's principled position regarding the  fatherland's reunification elucidated in the great leader's  historic New Year's address is a programmatic guideline for  breaking the deadlock lying in the way of the reunification and  triumphantly accomplishing the cause for reunifying the  fatherland with the nation's self-reliant force, I fervently  support and welcome this.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: We must  accomplish the cause of national reunification as soon as  possible, so as to meet the unanimous, ardent desire of the  entire nation and hand down the reunified country to our  posterity.    Our nation was not only forced to experience the tragedy of  separation by outside forces but also could not fulfill our  nation's ardent aspiration to reunify the fatherland up until  now due to the outside forces' stubborn maneuvers aimed at  obstruction.    This shows that our country's reunification issue can only  be resolved through our nation's own strength, rejecting the  interference of outside forces, and that holding fast to the  nation's principle of independence is a fundamental issue for  the fatherland's reunification. Proceeding from this, we put  forward a 10-point program of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunification of the fatherland last year and  made all-out efforts to pave the road for reunification by means  of unified strength and our nation's own strength.    The 10-point program set forth by the great leader is an  immortal banner of the national unity to transcend differences  in ideology, ideals, and systems, and a great charter for the  reunification of the fatherland, which embodies the noble desire  of our 70 million compatriots to realize the reunification and  prosperity of our nation with a long history of 5,000 years.    We hoped the South Korean authorities would take the road of  reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point  program of great national unity and, out of aspiration for  national unity and reunification, we also took important steps  for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two  sides. However, the South Korean authorities have clung to  dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and  committed anti-national acts of further aggravating  confrontation between the North and South, not national unity,  by ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the  entire nation for reunification. They have staged successive  large-scale military exercises against our Republic frequently  in collusion with foreign forces and have committed  anti-republic maneuvers more viciously than their predecessors  by clamoring for military countermeasures and an international  cooperation system based on the pretext of our nonexistent  nuclear issue.    Worse still, they suspended the North-South dialogues and  exchanges, which had been pushed ahead even by the Fifth and  Sixth Republics, and brutally suspended the patriotic forces for  reunification. Last year, the new rulers of South Korea came  out with a so-called step-by-step reunification [tangyejok  tongil], which already had been at the nation's center of  criticism, made the North-South relations retreat, and darkened  the prospect for the reunification of the fatherland.    The current South Korean rulers, through their acts, clearly  disclosed that the so-called civilian regime is only a disguise;  in fact it does not differ from the successive military  dictatorial regimes. Even though the current South Korean ruler  loudly advertised civilian politics and reform policies, the  National Security Law, the evil anti-communist fascist laws, and  the Agency for National Security Planning and the Defense of  Security command, which are suppressive agencies, still remain  intact in South Korea. Due to the fascist politics dominated by  public security, none of the desires of the South Korean people  for independence, democracy, and national reunification has been  fulfilled.    It is very natural that the South Korean people and figures  in various classes and strata are waging an antigovernment  struggle today, saying there is no need to further watch the  current regime, and expect nothing from it.    Regarding our nuclear issue that the United States and its  followers are talking about, the great leader taught in his New  Year's address that the issue is a product of the antisocialist,  anti-republic maneuver that the United States pursues  persistently.    As the respected and beloved leader taught, it was the  United  States that raised the suspicion of nonexistent nuclear  development of the North, and it is also the United States that  threatens us after actually drawing nuclear weapons on the  Korean peninsula.    Accordingly, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  should  be resolved peacefully through negotiations between the  offender, who poses the nuclear threat, and its victim, in other  words, between our Republic and the United States.    Any pressure or threat will not work on us. To adhere to  such a method cannot resolve the issue, but will only bring the  grave result of driving the situation into a catastrophe  [paguk]. The United States should take a good look at all the  facts and act discreetly. Under the condition that the  DPRK-U.S. joint declaration has been signed, the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula will be resolved fairly if both sides  abide by and implement the principles agreed upon.    In his New Year's address, the great leader stressed that  our  Republic's principle and line for the fatherland's reunification  never changes, and made it clear that we will make every effort  to achieve the reunification of the country in a way of a  confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems,  and two governments, according to the three principles of  independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national  unity.    This principled position clarified by the great leader  clearly expresses the firm will of our party and the government  of the Republic to hasten the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country in accordance with all the people's  desire and intent, no matter how the situation develops.    As the great leader elucidated in his New Year's address,  the  principled position of our party and the government of the  Republic regarding the fatherland's reunification, a brilliant  road has indeed opened for us to vigorously accelerate the cause  of the fatherland's reunification by overcoming difficulties in  the course of reunification.    Our party and the government of the Republic will make every  effort to realize the cause of fatherland's reunification in the  nineties under the banner of the 10-point program of the great  unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  fatherland presented by the great leader. It is the destiny of  the fatherland, the nation, and all our people at home and  abroad.    I fervently appeal to the 70 million compatriots in the  North, the South, and overseas, who love the country and the  nation, to launch vigorously into the nationwide struggle to  realize the fatherland's reunification based on the confederal  system, firmly united as one under the banner of the 10-point  program of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the fatherland and upholding the policy on the  fatherland's reunification that the great leader elucidated in  his New Year's address.    I also expect the progressive people of the world, who value  justice and peace, to completely support and encourage the  Korean people's struggle for the country's reunification.</p>

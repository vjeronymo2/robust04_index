A set of objects is assumed to be moving in space in a  known manner, some of them having been already observed earlier  and the pertinent data recorded in a special catalog. The  remainder of them has not yet been logged. The observation time  is subdivided into into equally long periods. It is furthermore  assumed that, by a preliminary processing of the readings taken  by one scanner, it is possible to estimate the state vector of a  given object at the beginning of an observation period and  evaluate the covariance matrix of the estimation error. There  arises the problem of identifying the readings, namely of  referring each to objects in the catalog or to one of the new  objects, or to the set of spurious ones. Because an object can  give more than one reading, it is expedient to tackle this  problem by solving the relevant sequence of destinations  problems where the set of readings taken within one observation  period has been broken down into those three subsets and each of  the identification hypotheses defined accordingly. The problem  of identifying the set of readings taken within one observation  period can thus be reduced to the problem of maximizing a  certain functional which is defined on the set of all hypotheses  and is proportional to the probability of the given one. The  exponential dependence of the total number of hypotheses on the  number M of measurements and on the number N of objects already  in the catalog makes the identification problem so unwieldy that  complete sifting through the hypotheses is not always feasible.  A simpler procedure is, therefore, proposed: sifting the  hypotheses in two stages, with fewer hypotheses to be sifted in  each stage. In the first stage the entire set of known objects  is subdivided into groups (``clusters''), namely into components  of connectedness on a bilobate graph where the vertices  represent all known objects and readings. Arcs are drawn to  connect vertices when distances between them are smaller than a  given threshold length. In the second stage the series of  identification problems is solved separately for each cluster.  Because one object can give more than one reading, a heuristic  multistep algorithm is required for this procedure. The cost  matrix in the destinations problems is best evaluated by the  Monte Carlo method. The proposed procedure was tested on the  following practical case: N= 2K[.sup]o[/]K[.sub]s[/],  number of objects detected within one observation period  N[.sup]o[/]  0.1N, number of objects detected by several  scanners N[.sup](ss)[/]  0.1N, one scanner detecting 1-10  objetcs, number of scanners which detect objects during an  observation period K[.sup]d[/]  0.1K, number of new  objects N[.sup]n[/]  N.

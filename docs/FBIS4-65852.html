			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The relations between President Francois  Mitterrand, former Prime Minister Michel Rocard, and Movement of  Leftist Radicals leader Bernard Tapie have been discussed in the  French press.  <H5>  PS Attacks on Rocard Noted </H5>   The new element in the 20-year quarrel between Mitterrand  and  Rocard is Tapie, who has consistently benefited from  presidential favors, Patrick Jarreau writes in the 29 April  Paris daily LE MONDE. At the beginning of the month, Tapie was  received at the presidential office, where polls on voting  intentions are carefully analyzed. Socialist Party (PS)  officials such as Jack Lang and Segolene Royal publicly stated  that if Rocard's European Parliament list gets less than 23  percent of the vote, the former prime minister ought not to  represent the Left in the presidential elections. According to  a commentary by Agathe Logeart in the same issue of LE MONDE,  this demand is likely to trouble Rocard, who had so far been  content that the party which he took over about a year ago  appeared "pacified," with the cantonal elections producing  "rather encouraging" results for the party and with the PS  Euroelections list "headache" over. However, Rocard "does not  take into account the cactuses that spring up almost  spontaneously on the path of the PS secretary general," Logeart  commented. At Mitterrand's instigation, Rocard was prevented  from attending the ceremony commemorating the death of former  Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy after his widow publicly alleged  that the party and its leaders abandoned her after turning their  back on her late husband. Tapie, however, was at Mitterrand's  side. In addition, PS luminary Catherine Lalumiere joined  Tapie's list, probably after discussing it with Mitterrand,  Logeart contends. Finally, on 27 April, a group of PS  supporters of former secretary general Laurent Fabius issued a  statement against the enlargement of the European Union (EU),  which Rocard favors. While these incidents point to a "real  attempt to destabilize Rocard and his team," the secretary  general and his friends have thus far ignored the attacks,  Logeart writes.  <H5>  More on Anti-Rocard Moves </H5>   The anti-Rocard "destabilization" attempt "behind which one  can see Mitterrand's hand" was also discussed in Jacques Patoz's  article in the 29 April Paris daily LE OUOTIDIEN. Contending  that the most dangerous attacks against Rocard come from fellow  socialists, Patoz writes that it would be "naive" on Rocard's  part to be surprised, since he knows that many in the party hold  no affection for him. The Euroelections, Patoz continues, are  only a pretext, the essential issue being that many Socialists  cannot "resign" themselves to a Rocard presidency. They are  therefore counting on a leftist defeat in the 12 June elections,  with blame going to chief campaigner Rocard, who would lose his  position as the PS' "natural candidate" for the presidency.  This "underhanded" fight against Rocard is led by those who  insist that the PS can gather more than 22 percent of the vote  in the Euroelections, despite Socialist luminary Lionel Jospin's  statement that anyone who thinks the PS can get more than 20  percent "either knows nothing or is dishonest." President  Mitterrand himself is engaged in "barring the way" for his  former prime minister by supporting Tapie, "a good way to  succeed given that the Tapie list will obtain most of its  support from the Socialist electorate," Patoz contends. Faced  with Mitterrand's "resentment," he continues, Rocard is  "defenseless," for he cannot accuse Mitterrand of attacking him.  Mitterrand remains the "master of the game," Patoz concludes.  In addition, "it is no secret" that EU Commission President  Jacques Delors' supporters "ardently wish" for a PS defeat in  June, which would allow them to provoke "more or less  spontaneous" calls from the party's grassroots for a Delors  presidential candidacy.  <H5>  Mitterrand Support For Tapie Viewed </H5>   In an article in the 28 April-4 May Paris weekly LE NOUVEL  OBSERVATEUR, Francois Bazin discusses Tapie's rise in politics,  which he terms the "Tapie mystery." Repeatedly questioned on  his activities and expelled from the French soccer association,  Tapie remains popular, Bazin maintains. A billionaire who uses  "brutal" methods, he is encouraged by Mitterrand. Although a  candidate of France's oldest party, he "cultivates the image of  a political sniper." Bazin cites an unconcerned" Mitterrand  replying to a former Socialist minister worried about eventual  presidential support for Tapie that "there are multiple Lefts"  and that "partisan rivalries are not his concern." Bazin  interprets the president's reply to mean that, while Mitterrand  has thus far not granted his "seal of approval" to any  candidate, Tapie benefits from an "authorization to proceed."  The president, he wrote, is experienced in the type of "furtive  campaign where nothing is said but everything is suggested."  Beyond some technical advice, the presidential contribution to  Tapie's "new adventures" is to remind the party that Tapie "is  not an intruder." By "opening the doors of the family,"  Mitterrand is saying that Tapie must not be "demonized" or  become the victim of "ostracism," Bazin contends. Tapie is now  implicated in an electoral adventure that serves Mitterrand's  designs and opposes those of Rocard. However, Bazin argues,  only the Euroelections will determine Tapie's real place in the  Left--whether he will be a "shooting star," a "minor actor," or  a "cumbersome ally."  <H5>  Tapie Personality Analyzed </H5>   Laurent Joffrin comments on Tapie's personality in the 28  April-4 May LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Tapie's real vocation, he  writes, is that of an "actor or producer." Such professionals  know that "taking a strong personality, good or bad, and  confronting him with successive obstacles will lead him to  quickly conquer the public's sympathies." Tapie's is a  "marvelous scenario," Joffrin continues, which dovetails  perfectly with the "concerns of Mitterrandian France." "In a  country where elites are powerless to heal the main diseases of  society, where justice is uncertain and scandals discredit the  political class, where trade unions, parties, and parliament  have been weakened, a handsome sniper benefits from an automatic  bonus. In a country subjected, like all democracies, to the  inexorable progression of individualism, the public figure who  talks about his misfortunes, ostentatiously enjoys his wealth  but returns blow for blow in adversity, who goes from euphoria  to depression, confesses his anguish and spits out his disdain,  is more alive than all the mannequins of the leading class. Of  him the people will say: `He, at least, has lived.'" Of course,  all this is "fake," Joffrin continues. Tapie's struggle against  the powerful is "all eyewash" and his past as an entrepreneur is  a "myth," since he sold most of his companies to turn a quick  profit. According to Joffrin, Tapie, who has created nothing,  saved nothing, solved nothing" is only interested in his own  good for he "knows how to convince, seduce, and dupe by  fascinating the simple-minded."</p>

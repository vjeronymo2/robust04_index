			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: Lessons about property costs Sir, Mr Jack's letter (March 10) on the unlevel playing field between domestic and business property costs such as rent levels does not draw the most important lessons. Business will always drive out residential use. Only planning procedures can prevent this. In central Paris, free residential rents are half office rent levels. There is, too, the vital need for a vigorous free domestic rental sector which British governments have refused to recognise for decades. The Englishman's obsession with ownership of his castle is not shared by other countries' citizens. Renting is often the cheaper option, and promotes labour mobility. Mortgage tax relief is an iniquitous favour to the non-poor, and should be abolished. Subsidies to the poor should be per family, not designated to a particular dwelling. If we want to alter the power balance for property use allocation between business and residential, by all means tax business via VAT on all outgoings for property, plus payroll while we're at it, provided that - very important  -tax on profits is reduced. This would be a leveraged incentive to managers to perform better. Martin Forde, 12 rue Rambuteau, Paris 75003</p>

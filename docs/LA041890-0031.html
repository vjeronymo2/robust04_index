			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVING OLVERA STREET  </P> <P> I am greatly alarmed at what appears to be yet another effort to "write the  Mexican-American/Chicano" out of his rightful place in the history of this  city, state and county.  </P> <P> Again, our people are "expendable."  </P> <P> I have been involved in the Chicano movement for many years and was hanging up  the gloves (due to age). But, I am ready to put them back on and take up the  fight once again.  </P> <P> We will not be "erased" from history. We cannot let you remove us from the  culture and heritage of this city, state and country -- we helped to make it,  to give it form, to give it value.  </P> <P> I send this challenge to our elected officials and to all men and women of  conscience -- no more "erasing" of the history of a people. They all belong in  this mosaic of history -- and each one in his/her place.  </P> <P> MOLLY MEDINA DIP  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

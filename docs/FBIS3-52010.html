In Brasilia today, the executive boards of the two parties  held separate meetings.    The PMDB will adopt a single position for the vote on the  constitutional reform. The decision was made by the party  executive board. Party positions will be studied on a weekly  basis.    As for the presidential succession, the majority believes  there should be an internal survey to choose a candidate. The  new party program will be submitted to the national party  convention in March.    Deputy Luiz Henrique, the PMDB president, will lead the  drive  for unity within the party and for future alliances. He began  by talking with members of the PSDB, whose executive board also  met in Brasilia today.    The two parties consider it possible to form an alliance as  early as in the first electoral round, will continue to  negotiate, but will not give up the designation of their own  candidates for president.

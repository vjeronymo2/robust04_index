Turn the Wall green," the Green  Party and the Green League Assn. said in a statement published by the Berliner  Zeitung.  </P> <P> East Germany opened the Wall, a symbol of Cold War confrontation, on Nov. 9,  allowing its citizens to travel freely to the West for the first time since  1961.  </P></p>

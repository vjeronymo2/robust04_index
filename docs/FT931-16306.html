			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Value of cross-border deals up to Dollars 76.2m THE global value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions rose by one-third in 1992, to Dollars 72.6bn from Dollars 54.4bn, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. This reverses the decline seen in 1991 in value terms, but the volume of transactions fell for the fourth year in succession, to 1,810. The EC reinforced its position as the most popular region for takeovers. In 1992, cross-border sales of EC companies grew to Dollars 41.6bn, accounting for 57 per cent of worldwide cross-border transactions, compared with Dollars 23.1bn and 42 per cent in 1991. Most buying was in the UK, where 233 companies were sold to foreign buyers for Dollars 15.1bn, compared with 269 deals worth Dollars 9.3bn in 1991. The biggest deal worldwide was Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp's purchase of Midland Bank, which KPMG valued at Dollars 7.4bn. Germany and France were the next most popular EC targets for cross-border buyers, each with deals worth Dollars 6.1bn. US companies were the most active buyers of foreign companies, spending Dollars 15.3bn on 342 purchases, compared with Dollars 8.2bn on 333 transactions in 1991. Cross-border sales of US companies fell to 282 deals worth Dollars 9.7bn, from 422 worth Dollars 19.7bn in 1991. KPMG forecasts that EC companies will continue to be active in international mergers and acquisitions. In spite of recent restructuring, many industries in the EC are still relatively fragmented, according to Mr Richard Agutter, the firm's head of mergers and acquisitions. Food and drink manufacturing and distribution, financial services, telecommunications and leisure-related industries are sectors where he expects further activity in 1993. Mr Agutter also expects to see business increasing in the more advanced former eastern bloc countries. 'Apart from east Germany, we see Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic as the prime sources of privatisation opportunities,' he said. KPMG noted that, in spite of the signs of recovery, the value of deals in the second half of 1992 was 30 per cent down on the first six months. While there were more deals over Dollars 1bn in 1992 than in 1991 (10 worth Dollars 25.7bn compared with two worth Dollars 5.8bn), there were no signs of a return to the near hysteria which characterised some transactions in the late 1980s. Among the negative factors holding back the world economy are, says KPMG, the continuing failure to conclude the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks, Germany's move into recession and the fragility of some European currencies following the exchange rate crises late in the year.</p>

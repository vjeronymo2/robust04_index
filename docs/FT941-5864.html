			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Powerhouse holds its ground - Case studty, Barclays / London is the world foreign exchange 'powerhouse' - and the UK's competitive edge is growing sharper In a large open space enclosed by cream-coloured walls and crammed with computers, foreign exchange traders munch bananas, drink mineral water and wait for something to happen. The dealing room of the Barclays banking group next to the Tower of London forms a hub of the world-wide foreign exchange market that transacts Dollars 1,000bn a day. Like seismologists, dealers await the next earthquake. The better-paid may anticipate or even provoke it. 'You go through periods of indescribable boredom,' says Mr Christopher Taylor, head of sales at Barclays' global foreign exchange operations. 'Then things take off, go crazy and become totally calm again.' The size and sophistication of the trading floor are reminders of the City of London's international prowess. This is one economic sector where the UK, unusually, is ahead of the field. London's share of volumes traded on international currency markets, estimated at one-third of the total, is well ahead of competing European centres, and is judged to be growing at the expense of New York and Tokyo. But the brain power and technology focused on managing financial market risks highlight a basic uncertainty in European business. 'The foreign exchanges give the opinion of the world on political events,' says Mr Taylor, a 36-year-old specialist in options and derivatives. Since 1992, European currency relationships have become much more volatile. Mr Taylor does not think Europe's plans for monetary union will be realised. 'Countries' economies cannot be synchronised.' Along with others like Citibank and Union Bank of Switzerland, Barclays is among the half-dozen international banks that dominate the market in foreign exchange. The big market-makers give their customers the chance both to guard against and to profit from currency movements by providing buying and selling prices 24 hours a day. Because of the risk to banks' capital of exposure to large exchange rate changes in a narrow-margin, high-volume business, market-making requires in-depth management expertise. 'A lot of our brain power does not go into trading. It goes into (monitoring) risk.' The Barclays foreign exchange and money market trading room employs 250 to 300 dealers, trading 96 currencies. Mr Taylor says. 'There's a tendency for money dealing to gravitate towards London, to pool liquidity in one centre. The powerhouse is here.' Although markets may go through periods of relative stability, Mr Taylor says, 'market making is not as scientific as in the past, where prices moved smoothly from one level to another. Trade and volume are increasing, but liquidity is becoming less reliable. That's why we see markets moving more suddenly. It's a nightmare for market makers.' None the less, periods of nervousness, giving rise to large price movements and sizeable dealing spreads, are the ones where market-makers earn the biggest profits. The banks hope the next nightmare will not be too long delayed. This is the seventh part of a ten-part series. Next Monday: European markets</p>

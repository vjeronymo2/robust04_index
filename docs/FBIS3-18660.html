			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With the conviction that the measures against Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] have brought  results, at the practical as well as the diplomatic level,  Greece awaits the Geneva meeting between Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias and UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance. In an  interview with ET-1, Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou  repeated that Greece wants dialogue, not concessions.    [Begin recording] [Papandreou] For two years now, the  international community did not deal with this issue as a  serious problem, and there was a de facto acceptance of things  that affected Greece and international law. There was an  offensive propaganda, a big idealism by Skopje that  unfortunately caused instability in the region. Today, with  this movement we hope that a solution can be found. One cannot  be too optimistic. It is a difficult problem, but we see that,  through the initiatives of the European Union and the United  States, a mediation process and a real approach to the problem  has began. We therefore hope that these efforts will bear fruit  so the two countries will be able to live peacefully together.    [Correspondent Fivos Karzis] Papandreou stressed that  adopting Greek measures against Skopje has led to a clear change  in the international diplomatic climate.    [Papandreou] There is substantial inaction by the  international community on the Skopje issue. The problems  raised by Greece regarding the symbols, name, constitution, and  borders--that is, issues that actually have to do with the  meaning of so-called greater Macedonia--are types of  expansionism by this state against Greece. These Greek measures  have succeeded in getting the international community to  intervene and begin a discussion of these problems. In the end,  these discussions should not legitimize the issues that are  against Greece.    [Karzis] The deputy foreign minister believes the attacks  against Greece in the European press will ultimately be proven  groundless.    [Papandreou] I think the attacks against Greece during the  last few days were particularly unfair and unacceptable,  especially since it is the country that has been presiding over  the European Union with particular success these days, during a  very difficult and important case--the expansion of the Union.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Judyth Guevara Santibanez] </F>   [Text] Overall drug consumption rose from three to nine  percent in the country's border zone, where 5.3 percent of the  total population (nearly 200,000 persons) is addicted to some  type of stimulant. This was revealed by a poll taken by the  Health Secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology.    At a press conference, Roberto Tapia, general director for  that field in the department, and Rafael Velasco, coordinator of  the National Council Against Addictions, established the fact  that the sample taken in Monterrey, Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, and  Matamoros indicates higher consumption among the adult  population than the youth, and among males than females.    Of the 200,000 consumers, only 11.4 percent are between ages  12 and 18: in other words, eight adults for each adolescent, and  five males for each female. The drug most consumed is marijuana,  followed by cocaine and, to a lesser extent, heroin, inhalants,  and hallucinogens.    Indicating the figures on overall drug consumption in the  aforementioned towns, the specialists explained that Tijuana,  with a record of 10.1 percent, is the town with the highest  rate; whereas Monterrey, with 2.8 percent, is the one with the  lowest incidence. On the other hand, Ciudad Juarez stands at 8.9  percent; and Matamoros, at 5.8 percent.    Both specialists gave a reminder that, five years ago, a  poll  of this type was taken, and that similar methods were used in  the current survey. This made it possible to learn the trend in  drug consumption during the past five years.    In this connection, they noted that, in Ciudad Juarez, drug  use rose from 3 to 9 percent; in Matamoros, it doubled; in  Tijuana alone it was 20 percent; and in Monterrey, it showed a  constant rate.    The increase observed in Ciudad Juarez is due to consumption  of all drugs, primarily cocaine, the use of which quintupled  during the past five years. In this locality, marijuana use  quadrupled, and that of heroin and other inhalants tripled. In  the case of hallucinogens, the demand was 1.5 times greater than  the rate reported in 1988.    As for Matamoros, the increase was due mainly to an almost  100 percent rise in marijuana and cocaine use, causing this  district to become the largest consumer of inhalable substances.  The increase was 1.6 times larger than between 1988 and 1993.    In the case of Tijuana, the increments were due to cocaine  use, which rose 60 percent, and that of marijuana, with a 20  percent rise. In Monterrey, no variations were noted in the  prevalence of consumption. Marijuana use predominated, and there  was a decline in the consumption of other substances.    With regard to the educational level of addicts, Roberto  Tapia and Rafael Velasco noted that the majority have basic  primary and secondary level schooling. The population using  marijuana and cocaine is fundamentally male.  <H5>  Consumption of Medical Drugs </H5>   As for the consumption of medical drugs, the poll taken by  the Health Secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology  reveals that the total prevalence on the northern border  averaged 15 percent. The rates were 17.2 percent in Ciudad  Juarez, 15.8 in Matamoros, 14.8 in Tijuana, and 14.1 in  Monterrey.    The investigation shows that the use of medications without  a  doctor's prescription is greater in Ciudad Juarez, whereas in  Monterrey only 16 of every 100 persons reported this occurrence.    In conclusion, the medical report claims that, of all the  pharmaceuticals used, the largest percentage is represented by  the group of nervous system depressants (tranquilizers), with  8.6 percent. They are followed by opiates (analgesics,  narcotics), with 4.9 percent; and other sedatives and  stimulants, recorded at 3.0 percent, respectively.    The Health Secretariat's epidemiology director and the  coordinator of the National Council Against Addiction stressed  that there was a fourfold increase in consumption of medical  drugs between 1988 (the date of the last sampling) and 1993.    Although the growing use of these substances is  intensifying,  the specialists emphasized that, "fortunately," Mexico has not  yet reached the prevalence occurring in countries like the  United States. There, the results of the pertinent polls, taken  in 1990, indicated that 10 percent of the total population had  consumed marijuana during the previous year. This figure is not  comparable to the one reported on Mexico's northern border: only  1.2 percent.    Roberto Tapia and Rafael Velasco concluded by stating that  the situation is similar in the case of cocaine use because,  whereas in the neighboring country to the north 3 percent of the  population consumes the drug, in Mexico only 1 percent of the  zone's population used it during the previous year.</p>

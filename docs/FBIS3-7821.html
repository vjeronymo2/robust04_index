			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Komadina: "Marriage of All Serbian Spies </F> in Plitvice"]    [Text] As Zeljko Simic, vice chairman of the government of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was explaining at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Zagreb to numerous journalists  that Croatia and Serbia (Yugoslavia) would come closer, a  meeting of far more concrete intentions was being held  approximately 70 km southwards -- probably as a proof of the  Serbian sincerity. In the national park of Plitvice, which was  occupied and devastated by the Serbs, an agreement on joint  activities of the intelligence and counterintelligence services  of "all Serbian countries" was signed. Translated into normal  language, this means that intelligence services from the  Serb-occupied regions in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are now  connected with their principals in Yugoslavia. According to this  agreement the joint intelligence service would have four  divisions: for foreign contacts, for analysis and research, the  operative division, and the external security division. The  headquarters will be in Pancevo, which was in the former  Yugoslavia known as the center for education of intelligence  officers. There will be "branch offices" in Banja Luka, Pale,  Knin, and Petrinja. The so-called "branch offices" will consist  of groups of about 12 officers: a commander, a coordinator, and  an adviser for artillery, infantry, and air force. Each of the  "branch offices" will be led by a coordinator, whose task will  be to cooperate with the "headquarters." There will also be a  joint coordinator who will at the same time be the leader of the  intelligence services of the "Srpska republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina" and of the "republic of Serbian Krajina."  Bosko Kelecevic obtained the position of coordinator in  Croatia. Only several days before the meeting in Plitvice the  representatives of SVR, the newly established Russian  intelligence service, allegedly visited Knin. According to the  protocol about joint activities between the intelligence  services, it was decided to reorganize the intelligence service  in order to "efficiently achieve short-term and long-term  strategic and safety interests as well as the internal and  external security." The agreement was signed in the presence of  General Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, the head of the military  intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and  Radenko Radinovic, his assistant for the counterintelligence  service. Generals Bosko Kelecevic, Milan Gvero, and Milisav  Gagovic also participated in the meeting.    This event, about which some Belgrade and Slovene (!)  newspapers published short reports, means that the  reorganization of the Belgrade intelligence services, which have  been shaken by many scandals and internal conflicts between  Yugoslav and Serbian officers, has been completed. The victory  of the "hard" line is confirmed by the fact that General Bosko  Kelecevic has been appointed head, in other words the "main  intelligence service coordinator" between the so-called "Srpska  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and "Serbian Krajina."  <H5>  Kelecevic Moved to Slunj </H5>   The newly established "boss" of all Serbian spies, Mr. Bosko  Kelecevic was born 42 years ago in Bosanski Aleksandrovac, a  small place between Banja Luka and Bosanska Gradiska. After  having completed the education for noncommissioned officers, he  continued his education at the Military Academy in Belgrade. He  specialized in artillery. He spent the major part of his  military training in Krizevci, Croatia. He is married to a  Croatian national and has twin sons. In 1971 he entered KOS,  the intelligence service of the former Yugoslav People's Army  (this is the abbreviation, but the full name of the service was  The Security Department of the Federal Ministry of National  Defense). He became the head of the Security Department in the  Fifth Military Region in 1987. His activity covered Slovenia  and almost all of Croatia. At the beginning of the aggression  against Croatia he participated in numerous negotiations with  Croatian authorities. Together with the majority of the  commanders in the Fifth Military Region he moved with his family  from Zagreb to Slunj in May 1991. His boss, General Zivota  Avramovic, joined him there somewhat later. He performed the  same tasks in Slunj. In October 1991 he moved to Mrakovica, on  the Kozara Mountain, and then to Sarajevo at the end of 1991.  In Sarajevo he joined the Second Military Region led by the  notorious General Kukanjac. At the time when the army of  Bosnian Serbs was being formed, in April and May of 1992, he was  appointed chief of staff of the First Krajina Corps, which was  led by Momir Talic. The corps was situated in Banja Luka. He  was promoted to the general rank.  <H5>  Boss -- A Typical Noncommissioned Officer </H5>   Those who met Bosko Kelecevic during his service in Zagreb  say that he is a typical noncommissioned officer, a man  thoroughly loyal to and indoctrinated by the ideas of his  superiors. The word of his superiors has the power of law for  him. His activities in the war against Croatia are vague. He  did not distinguish himself anywhere except in the region of  Bosanska Posavina, where he fought for the preservation of the  corridor there under the command of Talic and Lisica. People  who know him well say that he is a better artillery man than an  intelligence officer. They claim that he substitutes a lack of  intelligence skills by his excellent feeling for organization  and exceptional energy. His greatest success in the  intelligence war in Croatia is considered the development of a  widely spread network of intelligence officers. He infiltrated  them by issuing journalists' cards for them, a well-known  method. Although he has not gone through all necessary stages in  the training of intelligence officers, his promotion was very  quick. This is explained by his good connections to the former  first man of KOS, Mr. Aleksandar Vasiljevic.    The information from the meeting in Plitvice is opening a  new chapter of questions about the intelligence war waged in  occupied Croatian territories. Three intelligence organizations  from Belgrade are active in the occupied Croatian territories:  The Intelligence Service of the Army of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia General Staff, the Department of the State Security  of the Army, and the Department of State Security of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia. Well-trained officers  work in these organizations, they have a long tradition and are  well equipped. Some of the officers are distinguished  professionals, such as Radenko Radinovic and Mr. Dimitrijevic,  who learned their profession through all the stages of education  at the Security Department. In the Ministry of Internal Affairs  of Serbia there are professionals such as Jovica Stanisic, the  head of this service, and Franko Simatovic-Frenki, the officer  in charge of connection with the occupied territories in  Croatia. Their main task is to decode the Croatian Army  movements and to collect data necessary for taking actions.  <H5>  Work Among Muslims </H5>   The fact that Serbian intelligence officers became united --  regardless of how dangerous this might seem at first sight -- is  nothing new. The main "coordinator" is still situated in  Belgrade, so that the alleged conflicts among the local bosses  in the occupied Croatian territories are in fact only a tactic  of the Belgrade intelligence services, which still have full  control of the so-called Krajina. In the last two years, during  the war between Croatian and Serbian intelligence officers,  there have been many struggles which mostly resulted in Croatian  victories. The final outcome will, however, depend on who has  the larger number of professionals and better organization and  equipment. The greatest Serbian success is considered the  infiltration of Serbian intelligence officers into Muslim  circles who allegedly contributed to the war between Bosnian  Muslims and Croats.    There is the impression, however, that the formal merger of  all Serbian intelligence services primarily has political rather  than professional, "spying" functions. After this merger, there  followed the monetary union. According to some information the  armies of "all Serbian countries" should become united in March  1995. Is not this yet another proof of Serbian sincerity when  it speaks about the normalization of relations between Croatia  and Serbia?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The country's Scientific Research Council warned  today that the irregular increase in the consumption of oil  products and energy waste will threaten our country's oil  exports and create more problems for the country's oil-related  income over the next decade.    According to our correspondent's report, the Scientific  Research Council's energy committee today issued a report  entitled "Perspectives of Energy Research in the Islamic  Republic of Iran" at a seminar in which lecturers, researchers,  and the country's executive officials in the energy sector were  present. The report says: It is estimated that our country  consumes more than one million barrels of oil each day. Even  with the present low oil prices, the country is consuming around  $5 billion worth of oil each year. That makes the need to  rationalize our country's energy consumption, to develop  consumption patterns, and to expand research into energy saving  unavoidable .    The secretary of the state Scientific Research Council's  energy committee also said: If the country's present trend of  energy consumption continues, we will need to build a new  refinery each year and that would cost a yearly investment of  more than $1.5 billion. He added: Savings of 5.5 percent in  energy consumption is realistic and can reduce foreign currency  expenditure equivalent to $1.5 billion for investment in  refining oil.</p>

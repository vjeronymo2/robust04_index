			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris suspends Euro Disney three times In spite of Wall Street's morning gains, bourses tended to close yesterday less hopefully than they began, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was boosted initially by buying on the first day of the monthly account, and by firmer bond futures; but the CAC-40 slipped into negative territory at the close of trading, ending 0.86 lower at 2,070.61 on profit-taking and growing concerns about last-minute GATT negotiations. Turnover was FFr4.3bn. Euro Disney hit the headlines again, suspended limit down three times during the day before closing FFr6.20, or 18.6 per cent lower at FFr27.20 in volume of nearly 1m shares as the company waited for its banks and its US parent, the Walt Disney Co, to put a restructuring package together. However, one of Tuesday's casualties, Elf Aquitaine, steadied with a fall of just FFr1.10 to FFr415.60 after a 3.5 per cent drop on a profits warning the day before. In New York, a Prudential Securities analyst upgraded the oil company to buy from hold on the company's longer term attractions. Among the winners, Societe Generale rose FFr16 to FFr681 after the bank's chairman, Mr Marc Vienot, said that he expected 1993 net profit to rise between 5 and 10 per cent. MILAN rebounded after the cumulative 5.9 per cent fall of the previous two sessions as the prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, sought to calm the political situation by meeting the political parties that have given active and tacit support in parliament. The Comit index rose 13.83 or 2.7 per cent to 526.27. Mr Michele Pacitti of NatWest Securities commented that foreign investors were again viewing the market with a little more equanimity, although the situation remained fragile. Telecommunications issues, sold heavily by foreign investors early in the week, made up some of the lost ground. Sip added L47 to L2,966 and Stet rose L21 to L3,471. Olivetti climbed L204 or 12.2 per cent to L1,780: news that the list of bidders for Italy's second cellular telephone licence would be announced by December 15 brought renewed speculation that Olivetti could win the lucrative contract. FRANKFURT had the will to recover but it was unable to sustain it, and the DAX index closed just 2.14 higher at 2,029.55 after an intraday high of 2,045.66 on short covering. Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to DM7.8bn. Hesse, the first of four western German states to report inflation data, said thatconsumer prices rose by 0.3 per cent in November, the same rate as in October, but slowed to 3.8 per cent for the year from 3.9 per cent; but this news was not striking enough to boost the broad market. At sector level, carmakers and automotive components suppliers regained some of the losses they sustained earlier in the week, with Daimler up DM8.30 to DM704.80 and Varta, the battery maker, DM7.50 higher at DM334.50. Volkswagen, meanwhile, rose DM7.50 to DM402.50 after compromise seemed possible in the negotiations over a four-day week at the company. ZURICH ended a volatile day firmer, the SMI index adding 15.7 to 2,717.8. Nestle finished SFr9 higher at SFr1,179 with its 10 month figures at the low end of some expectations. The bearers rose to a day's high of SFr1,186 in immediate response to higher group sales, but slipped back when details of net debt raised the spectre of a rights issue. Nestle said that it was not planning any capital increase or rights issue, although it might issue a bond, perhaps with an equity content. AMSTERDAM edged lower, the CBS Tendency index slipping 0.1 to 133.5, with activity restrained ahead of today's US holiday. KLM, 60 cents higher at Fl 38.10, continued to recoup some of the losses which followed the collapse of the Alcazar talks. KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, dipped 30 cents to Fl 40.20 ahead of its announcement of a Fl 9m third quarter loss. MADRID blamed foreign investor sales as the general index fell another 2.85 to 294.51. Banks were particularly weak, Santander leading the way down with a fall of Pta240, or 3.6 per cent to Pta6,460. BRUSSELS closed easier as strikes in six of the nine Belgian provinces kept volume low, and foreign investors cautious. The Bel-20 finished 3.17 lower at 1,384.09, with a general strike planned for tomorrow in protest at government austerity measures.

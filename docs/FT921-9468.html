			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: Opposition doubts UK government commitment to aid conditions Sir, Lynda Chalker, you report, says that, 'where human rights are systematically abused, or where aid is feeding corruption rather than mouths, we shall have no alternative but to cut it' ('Chalker coy of making aid commitment', February 7). Coming two days after the Indonesian foreign minister's visit to Britain, the statement could not have thrown into starker relief the yawning gap between the Conservative government's many words on 'good government', and its lack of action. Last November's Dili massacre by the Indonesian army in East Timor, horrific enough in itself, hardly came out of the blue. It was, in Amnesty International's recent words, part of the 'long-standing and continuing pattern of human rights violations in East Timor and Indonesia'. It was a pattern I witnessed first-hand when I visited three years ago, and one that continues. The Indonesian reaction to the Dili massacre has itself consisted of yet further violations, including imprisonments, torture and extrajudicial executions. If this does not measure up to Lynda Chalker's yardstick of 'systematic abuse' of human rights, I fail to see what does. And yet she and the prime minister still refuse to withhold British aid to Indonesia, which last year grew to Pounds 22.7m. While the intense pressure of world opinion has forced the British government to make disapproving noises about the massacre, they have bent over backwards to accommodate the Indonesians. Lynda Chalker, for example, gave dangerous credence to the Indonesian government-appointed national commission of inquiry by describing it repeatedly in parliament as 'independent'. Dominated by high-ranking military and government figures, the commission was discounted from the outset by genuinely independent observers like Amnesty, which this week stated that it was 'fatally flawed and that its findings are unacceptable'. The truth, of course, is that, while the pious rhetoric of 'good government' has grown of late, short-term commercial and political expediency continue to dictate government policy in practice - just as it did when it allowed the sale of arms to Saddam Hussein's Iraq or supported the factions fighting side-by-side with Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

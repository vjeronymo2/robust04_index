			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to audience </F> at concert in the Kremlin Palace in Moscow on Cosmonautics Day  -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] Dear participants in the celebrations, dear  veterans, scientists, cosmonauts, engineers, designers, people  who have taken part and are taking part today in the creation of  unique systems, I must first of all pass to you -- all of you  who work in this sphere -- warm greetings and congratulations  from the President of Russia Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.  [passage omitted]    Things are difficult today, yes. More difficult than ever.  But I can tell you one thing -- despite all the difficulties  this government will not be the last government, the one under  which people will cease talking about cosmonautics. We will do  all we can. I would not like to be the last premier, the one  who stopped progress in the sphere of cosmonautics.    Today this really is one of the very few branches of  Russia's  national economy which is continuing to bring glory to and do  great things for our country confidently, calmly, and with  certainty. I think that the program which Russia has before it  today -- the program before our fatherland and cosmonautics --  will always continue, today and tomorrow and in all the years to  come. The things which we are doing today, the fact that we are  creating unique systems jointly with other states, including the  United States of America and with the countries of Europe, this  once again uniquely testifies to the fact that Russia, the  scientists of Russia, the techniques, and the techology created  in Russia exists and will exist for centuries to come. [passage  omitted]    Once again, dear friends, I wish you success, health and  patience on our national festival. Thank you. [applause]</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELF-DEFENSE  </P> <P> I congratulate Claudia Luther ("When a Terrible Dream Becomes a Terrible  Reality, Raw Instinct Takes Over," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 13) on being able to  scream. Now, how about doing something more effective than relying on others to  come to her aid, such as taking a women's self-defense class? Classes are  usually low cost and can be taken in the evenings or on the weekends. For a  woman to think she can defend herself merely by screaming is ludicrous, which  is why I took a defense class.  </P> <P> Women should not be expected to trust only a scream to suffice, and Ms.  Luther's column, while heartening, stops short of reality.  </P> <P> KAREN MISHKIN  </P> <P> Santa Cruz  </P></p>

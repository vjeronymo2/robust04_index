			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Buthelezi today said the levels of anger have  never been as high as they are now in kwaZulu-Natal. In Ulundi  today, he briefed the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] Central  Committee on yesterday's leaders' summit.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] The IFP's  monthly meeting of its Central Committee today was dominated by  the outcome of yesterday's leaders' summit at Skukuza. The  party's leader, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said that despite the  leaders' meeting the road forward did not look promising.    [Buthelezi, in English] In my whole lifetime, in all the  years I have lived on planet earth, I've never seen the anger of  the people reaching the levels which it has reached.    [Alfonso] The IFP leader also said his party wanted the  election to be postponed across the entire country and not only  in kwaZulu-Natal. He also warned that people in the region  would act on their own against what he called strong-arm methods  by the government and the ANC to suppress the Zulu king's  followers.    [Buthelezi, in English] The people themselves here are our  last line of defense because people themselves here are incensed  about what is being done to them. [end recording]</p>

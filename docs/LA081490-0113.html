			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL BACKS NO-SMOKING RULE FOR L.A. RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: THE FULL COUNCIL WILL ACT ON THE PROPOSAL IN FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS. THE  TOBACCO INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO LOBBY HEAVILY AGAINST IT.  </P> <P> A proposal to ban smoking in all Los Angeles restaurants was approved by a City  Council committee Monday over the protests of restaurant owners, who fear their  businesses would be hurt.  </P> <P> If the full council approves the measure, Los Angeles would become the first  major city in the nation to impose such a ban.  </P> <P> The controversial matter will be taken up in four to five weeks and council  members expect heavy lobbying.  </P> <P> "To say the very least, we are elated. But the tobacco industry is not going to  take this lying down," said Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against  Tobacco Smoke, a national lobbying organization.  </P> <P> The proposal has met with strong opposition from restaurant and business  interests since it was proposed by Councilman Marvin Braude last May.  </P> <P> But after a public hearing Monday, the measure was approved by a 3-1 vote.  </P> <P> Braude, chairman of the Environmental Affairs Committee, and committee members  Councilwomen Ruth Galanter and Joy Picus voted for it.  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs, chairman of the Arts, Health and Humanities Committee,  which was invited who sat in onto the special hearing, cast the negative vote.  He said he was not convinced that a few hours' exposure to smoke in a  restaurant was significant and wanted more information before taking a final  position.  </P> <P> "I'm no more able to make a decision on this now than I was before the  hearing," he said.  </P> <P> Braude, the council's most tenacious anti-smoking crusader, used recent data on  the health dangers of second-hand smoke to justify his push for the ban. "This  proposal is crucial to protect the health of non-smokers from second-hand  smoke," he said.  </P> <P> Braude called tobacco smoke a "deadly carcinogen" that kills 35,000 non-smokers  a year in the United States.  </P> <P> Patrick Reynolds, a grandson of R. J. Reynolds, the founder of the giant  tobacco company, also spoke in favor of the ban, saying that second-hand smoke  causes cancer.  </P> <P> "The evidence is in and it's overwhelming," said Reynolds, who has broken with  his family and now crusades against tobacco.  </P> <P> Others who support the ban cited health considerations, both for restaurant  patrons and workers.  </P> <P> Several speakers opposed to the measure cited economic reasons, focusing on the  experience of Beverly Hills, which enacted a ban on restaurant smoking only to  rescind the measure when patronage fell sharply.  </P> <P> Rudy Cole, executive vice president of Restaurants for a Sensible Voluntary  Policy, said the ban would be "disastrous" for restaurant owners. "There is a  direct relationship between dining and smoking for many people," he said.  </P> <P> Dori Pye, president of the Los Angeles Business Council, argued that the  measure would make the city seem "unfriendly" to the German and Japanese  tourists. "These people like to smoke," she said.  </P> <P> The owner of a restaurant that caters to Filipinos voiced a similar complaint.  And Gerald Breitbart, a spokesman for the California Restaurant Assn. said the  ban would hurt small restaurants in "ethnic communities" where many people  smoke.  </P> <P> It is not yet clear whether the full council will support the ban, by far the  most stringent measure proposed by Braude since he began pushing for  anti-smoking proposals 15 years ago.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has ordinances -- all authored by Braude -- barring smoking in  grocery stores, elevators and rooms where public meetings are being conducted.  </P> <P> Under a Braude-sponsored law that was enacted in 1987, restaurants with more  than 50 seats must set aside as least half of them for non-smokers. Smaller  restaurants are exempt from the law.  </P></p>

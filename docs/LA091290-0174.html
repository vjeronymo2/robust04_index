			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DEBRA WINGER IS NOT FOR POLITICS  </P> <P> Debra Winger says she loves U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) but hates political  life.  </P> <P> "If I wanted an aquarium, I would've bought one and lived in it," Vanity Fair  quoted the actress as saying in its October issue. "That's why I don't have any  problem seeing other men."  </P> <P> Kerrey was governor of Nebraska when he met Winger in 1983 during filming of  "Terms of Endearment" in his state.  </P> <P> Their relationship ended in 1985, and Winger married actor Timothy Hutton in  1986. Hutton and Winger had a son before they separated in 1989.  </P> <P> Now, Winger and Kerrey are seeing each other again, but "not as often as I  want," Kerrey said. "It seems like once every 10 years."  </P></p>

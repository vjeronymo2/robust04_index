			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Tobacco ruling to allow some injury suits THE US Supreme Court yesterday ruled that suits can be brought against tobacco companies under individual states' product liability laws, giving the green light for some types of personal injury claim. Ambiguities in the judgment, however, allowed both the tobacco industry and the anti-smoking lobby to hail the court's 7-2 decision as a victory. The ruling overturns the industry's claim that such suits should be barred because federal law requires that cigarette packets carry health warnings on the risks of smoking. Congress passed cigarette labelling laws in 1965 and 1969. The decision comes in the context of a long-running case brought by Mrs Rose Cipollone against three tobacco companies, after she had a cancerous lung removed in 1983. The Supreme Court justices expressed a range of views over what type of claims could be brought under state liability laws. The majority concluded that some of the claims brought in the Cipollone case  -for example, that the defendants had failed to warn adequately about the health dangers of smoking and fraudulently misrepresented the risks - were precluded by the federal labelling law. However, they also said that claims brought on other grounds - such as intentional misrepresention by the tobacco companies - should be allowed to proceed. Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday affirmed its debt ratings for US-based tobacco groups. 'Although the decision could result in a greater number of liability filings against cigarette manufacturers, and an increase in legal expenses, we believe it will take a considerable amount of time before the court decision would affect creditor protection, if at all,' said the large Wall Street rating agency. In London, shares in BAT Industries initially fell 38p, but rallied later to close 26p down on the day at 731p. Rothmans International was 19p lower at 1,091p. In New York, shares in RJR Nabisco fell to Dollars 8 3/8 at one stage, but recovered to close down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 3/8 . Philip Morris closed up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 73 3/4 . Philip Morris, whose brands include Marlboro, claimed that the decision was 'a significant victory'. It noted the court had held that smokers cannot sue on the grounds that they were not adequately warned of the risks of smoking once the 1969 legislation had been enacted.

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Spaniards make a meal of feast day When the church and civil society clash over holidays in Spain the manana syndrome asserts itself in all its laid back glory. Because December 6 - a public holiday marking the endorsement by referendum of Spain's post-Franco constitution - falls on a Tuesday, and December 8 - the Roman Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception, one of the several religious public holidays in the calendar - falls on a Thursday, many Spaniards will take the whole week off just a fortnight before the Christmas partying starts. The employment ministry bowed to the inevitable over the weekend when its efforts to contain the damage by bunching the two holidays together came to nothing. The trade unions refused to have the constitution day holiday moved forward to Friday December 9 and the bishops opposed bringing the Immaculate Conception feast back to Monday December 5. Earlier, the ministry had drawn the combined fire of the unions and the bishops by attempting to negotiate moving both the holidays to successive Mondays. The result is that, in addition to the expected massive absenteeism during the nominally working days of the first week of December, many industrial plants will grind to a halt during the whole period because the transport of dangerous goods is banned on a public holiday and on the eve of a holiday. The ministry's woeful negotiating skills, and the obstinacy of both unions and bishops, came in for sharp criticism from the employers, save those in the travel and hotel business who have reported very strong bookings over the week.</p>

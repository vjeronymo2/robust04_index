			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Risky business reveals US bank's Achilles heel: Bankers Trust's leveraged swaps Leveraged swaps have turned into the Achilles heel of Bankers Trust's derivatives business. The bank says it has sold these instruments to fewer than a dozen companies, all of them in the US. But at least two of these companies have since filed lawsuits over multi-million dollar losses they incurred. And an internal investigation has uncovered breaches of the bank's rules in the way other leveraged swaps were sold to companies, leading to the removal of six executives from their posts last week. In an interview before the internal actions last week, Mr Charles Sanford, the bank's chairman, refused to comment on the legal cases - a Dollars 130m (Pounds 79m) claim from Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, and a Dollars 73m lawsuit from Gibson Greetings, a greetings card company. But, referring to companies which buy complicated financial instruments, he said: 'Everybody has to have risk management.' The experience of recent weeks raises some questions. First, should the bank have been selling these instruments to companies at all? Under a leveraged swap, the normal payments that would be made under an interest rate swap agreement are multiplied, making them more volatile when market rates move. Mr Brian Walsh, the bank's head of derivatives, says many companies last year were engaged in 'aggressive hedging' - an apparent contradiction in terms. Knowing this, was the bank right to sell such instruments to non-financial companies? According to Mr Walsh, leveraged swaps were only sold to companies with sophisticated treasury departments capable of understanding and managing the risks. Mr Sanford, meanwhile, says the bank will follow a 'belt and braces' approach in future, taking extra care to ensure companies understand what they are buying. With regulators breathing down its neck, the bank is likely to seek to control its derivatives sales force more closely. For a bank that has been at the forefront of developments in the derivatives markets, putting the brakes on ambitious staff could cause problems. Mr Sanford says: 'I hope we will always be an innovative company with good products.' Second, does the failure of the leveraged swaps reveal a deeper weakness in Bankers Trust's ability to manage financial risk? 'They didn't work out as well as we'd like,' says Mr Sanford of the disputed contracts. But he adds: 'In the rest of the derivatives business and the rest of the bank, we didn't feel any problems' from the upheaval in financial markets this year. Certainly, the bank's management of risk in its own trading business this year has been more effective than many other big traders, whether hedge funds or other banks - though it failed to repeat last year's Dollars 1.6bn of revenues from trading, much of it from proprietary trading. 'We've outperformed most of our competitors with a 15-16 per cent return on equity, even with a big capital base,' says Mr Sanford. 'If this is our low year, that's not at all bad.' For now, the bank has pulled in its horns, withdrawing much of its capital from proprietary trading business - though it expects to return in force when conditions improve. Third, do the cases reveal a deeper weakness - a lack of the sort of lasting relationships with big US companies that will support its business in future? While the bank has made a successful business out of raising finance for below-investment grade companies, its dealings with big companies have tended to come either through its trading business, or through its trust and custody business. The bank's relationship with Procter &amp; Gamble was not handled by a single relationship manager. That is not surprising, given that Bankers Trust claims to have sold derivatives to 3,100 different entities over the years. 'With all these counterparties, there will be lots where the relationship is at the product management end,' says Mr Sanford. But as the leveraged swap experience is showing, that strategy can break down when product managers are loosely controlled. Despite a spectacular post-tax return on capital of more than 20 per cent in each of the past four years, Bankers Trust's shares have consistently traded at a discount to its peers. Mr Sanford is unapologetic. The bank will not change its strategic direction, he says. The case for derivatives - that they provide a way for companies, banks or investors to manage risks more effectively - stands. 'I don't see it slacking off in intellectual or practical intensity,' he says. 'It's a technique for risk management that is so efficient, I don't think that it will slow down.' In its lawsuit against the bank, even P&amp;G talks of the way derivatives can hold down borrowing costs or reduce risk. Says Mr Sanford: 'Most senior managers (in corporates) are now locked into using derivatives.'</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> Guess Who's in Town?  </P> <P> In some cases, looks are everything. Watch what happens when Claudia Schiffer  graces L.A. in the flesh today. She's the Guess Girl (the baby Bardot of  voluptuous pulchritude who appears in the Guess? jeans ads). Tonight she's  scheduled to tape the Rick Dees show. Saturday her dance card is filled with  appearances at three Robinson's stores (Santa Ana at 11 a.m., Del Amo at 1 p.m.  and Puente Hills at 4 p.m.) pushing the new Guess fragrance -- Guess Parfum,  $65 for .25 ounces. Saturday night, an intimate soiree has been planned at  Arena for Claudia and 8,000 of her closest fans. Her appearance at Macy's in  Manhattan drew 2,500 people, the third-largest celeb/scent crowd to date,  surpassed only by the turnouts for Elizabeth Taylor and Cher. Not a bad stat  for a 20-year-old German lass whose only claim to fame is those lips, those  eyes and those ads.  </P> <P> NO-SHOWS: New York designer Charlotte Neuville has canceled her spring fashion  show, usually held during October press week, and will donate a substantial  portion of what a show costs ($50,000 to $100,000) to the care of AIDS  patients. More reason to believe the fashion system is headed toward endangered  species status: Last spring, London's Rifat Ozbek played a videotape of his  newest styles. Giorgio Armani started this anti-show trend in the mid-'80s when  he displayed his collection on hangers. Some designers say it is in reaction to  the high cost of showing. Others say they're tired of the circus-like excess of  typical presentations.  </P> <P> MAKES CENTS TO US: Maybe everybody else thinks it's odd that Cartier now has  two stores on the same street, but Ralph Destino, Cartier chairman, does not.  At a Tuesday night party for the opening of the new, smaller boutique, he  pointed out that there are two Cartier stores on Fifth Avenue in New York, two  more at Place Vendome in Paris, and now two on Rodeo Drive.  </P> <P> MAKING THE SHOPPING LIST: Teri Garr cruised by Ice at the Beverly Center,  looking for something to wear on the talk show circuit; she's promoting her new  film "Waiting for the Light." She waltzed out with a Carmelo Pomodoro ivory  blouse and bronze-colored sarong skirt. Also spotted flipping through the  hangers was Bridget Fonda (daughter of Peter). She left with a black wool  pantsuit from Ice's private label collection.  </P></p>

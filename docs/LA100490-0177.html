			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI SCIENTISTS CALL METHANE LEAKS MASSIVE IN E. EUROPE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THEY SAY DILAPIDATED NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS ARE TO BLAME FOR THE  POLLUTION, WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING.  </P> <P> Methane, a major chemical linked to global warming, is leaking in massive  amounts in several Eastern European cities, much of it thought to be from  antiquated natural gas systems, according to researchers from UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Since methane accounts for up to 25% of the gases causing the so-called  greenhouse effect, plugging leaky pipes in Eastern bloc nations could make an  important dent in efforts to forestall global warming, the UCI scientists  reported today in the scientific journal Nature.  </P> <P> "Methane is different," said research team director F. Sherwood Rowland, the  UCI chemist who discovered in the mid-1970s that the Earth's protective ozone  layer is being destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons, another variety of chemicals  also implicated in global warming. "Because its lifetime is about 10 years, if  we take away just 10% of (the world's methane) emissions, we can get methane in  the atmosphere back in balance."  </P> <P> Eastern Europe would not account for all of that 10%, researchers say.  </P> <P> "We're not pointing a finger at any of the Eastern European cities," said  atmospheric chemist Donald R. Blake, a member of Rowland's research team.  "We're saying that here's an area, (given) the short lifetime of methane, where  we could be seeing some results." Efforts to reduce methane in the rest of the  industrialized world must also continue, he said.  </P> <P> The UCI data corresponds with previous findings of European scientists, said  Kathleen Hogan, chief of the methane program for the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency's global resource division. Those scientists have estimated  that as much as 10% of the natural gas supplies piped through the Soviet Union  and Eastern Europe are leaking into the atmosphere, she said.  </P> <P> The high levels of methane were measured in air samples taken last May in the  cities of Budapest, Hungary; Krakow, Poland; Prague, Czechoslovakia; and  Berlin. Similar tests found far lower levels of methane gas -- levels  comparable to most U.S. cities -- in the more modern cities of Vienna and  Zagreb, Yugoslavia, Rowland, Blake and Neil Harris reported in the  correspondence published in Nature.  </P> <P> Sampling in the Yerevan region of Soviet Armenia last January also turned up  high emissions of methane, but because it is not an urban area, Rowland said  they are uncertain of the source. Further studies throughout Eastern Europe are  warranted, the researchers said.  </P> <P> Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of industrialization, is the chief gas responsible  for the greenhouse effect, caused by a buildup of gases in the Earth's  atmosphere that traps heat. Scientists believe an increase of only several  degrees in the Earth's average temperature could result in rapid and dramatic  changes in global weather patterns, rising ocean levels and possibly the  extinction of many plant and animal species.  </P> <P> Carbon dioxide represents about half of the greenhouse gases, with methane and  chlorofluorocarbons making up the remainder.  </P> <P> Methane is an odorless, flammable gas that is a chief component in the natural  gas commonly used for household heating and cooking. It also is formed by  decomposing vegetation and found in coal deposits. The bulk of the 550 megatons  of methane spewed into the atmosphere each year is thought to come from such  rural sources as swamps, marshes, tundra, coal mines, rice paddies, landfills  and flatulent cows.  </P> <P> However, urban areas are increasingly being viewed as the easiest, quickest way  to reduce methane concentrations. Because the Earth's atmosphere has the  ability to cleanse about 500 megatons of methane per year, a 10% worldwide  decrease in methane emissions would virtually eliminate the gas as part of the  global warming problem, Rowland said.  </P> <P> Global warming experts called the UCI findings "very interesting."  </P> <P> "The sources of methane are not well understood," said Michael Oppenheimer, an  atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Defense Fund and author of the  book, "Dead Heat: The Race Against The Greenhouse Effect," which was published  in April.  </P> <P> But Oppenheimer said the Rowland group's data "indicates that high levels of  methane are being released in the (Eastern European) cities."  </P> <P> Reducing those releases by repairing leaky gas distribution systems, if indeed  that is the source of the urban methane, "would be a cost-effective way to cut  down on the growth of atmospheric gases," he said.  </P> <P> There are economic reasons, too, for Eastern European countries to consider  repairing the pipelines that deliver most of their natural gas from the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Hogan said that beginning Jan. 1, the Soviet Union will require hard cash in  exchange for natural gas sold at market rates. That will be a heavy incentive  to reduce waste through leaky systems, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNNATURAL GAS LEAKS -- Here are methane levels measured in each city in parts  per million by volume (ppmv). Methane concentrations found in the cities are  believed to emanate from man made sources. For comparison, methane levels  outside these cities averaged about 1.80 ppmv.  </P> <P> Berlin, Germany: 1.96  </P> <P> Prague, Czechoslovakia: 2.30  </P> <P> Krakow, Poland: 2.15  </P> <P> Vienna, Austria: 1.86  </P> <P> Budapest, Hungary: 2.10  </P> <P> Zagreb, Yugoslavia: 1.85  </P> <P> Source: The Rowland Group at UC Irvine  </P></p>

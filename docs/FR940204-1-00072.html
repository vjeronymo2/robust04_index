			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed under ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' the three animals and their habitats are vulnerable to several activities. The Service is concerned about the impacts of the illicit commercial trade of the Alameda whipsnake, callippe silverspot butterfly, and Behren's silverspot butterfly. Unauthorized collecting is an activity that can be difficult to control because it can be done in a fairly discrete manner. The precise pinpointing of localities that would result from publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would increase enforcement problems because the species proposed herein for listing would be more vulnerable to collecting, as well as vandalism to their habitat. The potential for declines due to the collection of these species is so great that any benefit from the designation of critical habitat is outweighed by the risk of increased taking. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these animals is not prudent. Protection of the habitat of these species will be addressed through the section 4 recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking are discussed, in part, below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No populations of the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and the Alameda whipsnake are known to occur on property owned by the Federal government. However, several Federal agencies would be affected by the listing of these animals. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may insure housing loans in areas that presently support the species proposed for listing herein. Therefore, HUD actions regarding these loans would be subject to review by the Service under section 7 of the Act. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation would be affected by the listing of these animals as this is the lead agency in administering the permits for the proposed Los Vaqueros Reservoir. The Army Corps of Engineers' activities or issuances of permits subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act would be subject to the Endangered Species Act section 7 requirements. The Department of Transportation (Federal Highways Administration) may be involved with the construction and maintenance of roads and highways in areas where some or all of these species may be affected, hence this agency would also be subject to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Any Federal actions that are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act may be subject to the requirements of section 7 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

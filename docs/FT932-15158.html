			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Talks on sale of Leyland Daf plant THE management buy-out team seeking to acquire the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, has started formal negotiations with the administrative receivers. Mr John Gilchrist, who is leading the buy-out team, said yesterday 'a number of offers of funding support' had been received from leading financial institutions. Crucially the MBO team has also received a letter of intent from Daf Trucks in the Netherlands for the supply of its UK-built range of Leyland Daf light trucks to the Dutch company's European dealer network. The management buy-out team is also negotiating with the receivers on behalf of Lancashire County Council, which is seeking to acquire the entire Leyland site for development by Lancashire Enterprises, its economic development agency, into a business and high technology park. The MBO team is seeking to secure the use of the truck assembly plant itself, but the remainder of the 230 acre site includes a range of other industrial buildings, including the Leyland components plant and Leyland Daf headquarters building, Lancaster House. Mr Gilchrist said the joint bid would give the truck business 'a future' and contribute to the regeneration of the Leyland site. The bid from the management buy-out team was in its 'final stages'. Negotiations were expected to continue for several days, but it was hoped a final agreement could be reached by the end of the month. The future ownership of the former African subsidiaries of Leyland Daf, the subject of separate management buy-out negotiations, was 'not in any way critical' to the success of the Leyland MBO team's bid, said Mr Gilchrist. Automotive Products, the automotive components maker, which has stopped supplying brakes and clutches to Leyland Daf pending the repayment of debts totalling Pounds 758,000, said last night it was 'on the verge' of completing an agreement with the Leyland truck MBO team to resume supplies of clutches, if the buy-out bid succeeded.</p>

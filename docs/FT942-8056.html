			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Cabinet focuses on house prices Israeli ministers are to hold a second cabinet session tomorrow to debate ways to slow the rise in house prices, having failed to reach any final decisions at a long cabinet meeting yesterday. With the Gaza-Jericho autonomy deal still in its earliest stages, and a threat of hostilities on the Lebanese border following the weekend's kidnapping by Israelis of an Islamic extremist leader, the scheduling of a second cabinet session devoted to house prices reflects the extent of government concern. Government figures indicate that apartment prices have risen by some 60 per cent in dollar terms over the past four years alone. Real estate rises are the key factor in the monthly consumer price index - housing accounted for 0.8 points of the 2.1 per cent rise in the index for April - and the continued rises so far this year have already in effect killed hopes that Israel might keep inflation to single figures in 1994. Flats in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, where demand is highest, are selling for an average of Dollars 3,500 (Pounds 2,300) a square metre. What most concerns Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labour government is the growing anger among both new immigrants and young Israeli families that they can no longer reach even the first rung on the housing ladder. Mr Rabin fears economic discontent, centred on housing costs, could rebound against him at the next elections in two years. Unimpressed by the efforts of his minister of construction, Mr Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, to speed the procedures for freeing state land for building, he recently appointed an inter-ministerial committee, headed by his own bureau director-general, Mr Shimon Shevis, to devise new proposals to slow the price rises. The cabinet heard the first of these proposals yesterday, including plans for government building projects, for schemes to guarantee government purchase of apartments that contractors prove unable to sell privately, and for the allocation of land for 110,000 apartments over the next two years. The Treasury and the Bank of Israel, however, strongly oppose public construction and government guarantees for private contractors.</p>

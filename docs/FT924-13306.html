			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / BR fares to rise by up to 9.5%: Increases in rail and London Transport prices prompt protests BRITISH RAIL and London Transport prompted angry protests yesterday by announcing government-approved fare rises averaging 7.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent respectively, more than double the rate of inflation. The increases come as private sector businesses are moderating or foregoing price rises in the face of a severe recession. But BR and LT are able to impose big increases because many of their passengers, particularly rush-hour commuters in London and the south-east, cannot realistically turn to alternative means of transport. Network SouthEast commuters will pay up to 9.5 per cent more for season tickets, while holders of LT Travelcard season tickets will pay up to 10 per cent more. Other rail travellers will face lower-than-average increases because BR is trying to stem the downturn in leisure travel by keeping off-peak fares competitive. The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the statutory rail passengers' watchdog, accused BR of exploiting its monopoly position. Major-General Lennox Napier, the committee's chairman, said: 'Fare increases above the rate of inflation are only justifiable where there have been material improvements in services and where quality standards are being fully met. 'Both InterCity and Network SouthEast failed to meet some of their key quality targets in 1991-92, so the decision to raise season ticket rates by an average of twice the rate of inflation is unreasonable.' Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said: 'Britain's railways are now the most expensive and least invested, with reducing quality, of any developed European railway system.' British Rail said higher fares were needed to offset a downturn in revenues. It was also facing higher safety and security costs and needed to fund a substantial investment programme. It said the highest fare increases were being paid by commuters who had benefited from new trains. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said: 'Both BR and London Underground are in the middle of enormous investment programmes. Much of that money comes from the taxpayer, but it is only right that passengers should make a contribution.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     BRITISH RAIL/LONDON TRANSPORT FARE RISES ON JANUARY 3 1993 (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Season    Full    Savers/    Apex                                                       Cheap day  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- InterCity                               7.5      6        4         0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Network SouthEast seasons and standard fares Great Northern, Chiltern                                            9.5 West Anglia, Northampton                                            9.5 Kent Coast, London Tilbury &amp; Southend                               5.0 All other lines                                                     7.5 Network SouthEast cheap day and away breaks All lines                                                           5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London Transport Underground and bus fares (average)                                 8.5 Travelcards (weekly)                                           9.0-32.7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

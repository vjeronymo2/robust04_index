			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / An appetite for acquisitions: Europe's market in food is being transformed by predators and fiercer competition Just when the fashion for large cross-border takeovers seemed to be waning, the battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Italian Agnelli family for the French Perrier group, the world's biggest mineral water company, has brought it bouncing back to life. The contest is striking evidence that recession has not dulled corporate appetites for expansion in western Europe's Dollars 700bn-a-year food market, nor diminished the intense rivalry to wrest control of producers with world-class brands. Since the mid-1980s, a wave of restructuring has swept through the industry, as manufacturers have scrambled to adapt to stiffer competition, changing tastes and products, faster innovation and the advance of European economic integration. The challenge facing many companies is to grow bigger quickly, or to shrink. None has responded more aggressively than trans-national heavyweights such as Nestle, the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group and Philip Morris, the US tobacco giant, which 18 months ago became Europe's third largest food group by buying Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company, for Dollars 3.8bn. A tier below in size, France's BSN has been an exceptionally active cross-border shopper, followed more recently by manufacturers including Britain's United Biscuits and Cadbury Schweppes and scores of smaller companies. All are looking to expand further - and some of those hunting are also potential prey. The main limiting factor seems to be the number of prizes available. Many of the most desirable have already been snapped up or, in most countries except Britain, are defended against takeover. When a plum comes on the market, bidding can soar sky-high. 'I admit entirely that there is a lot of opportunism in it,' says Mr Floris Maljers, co-chairman of Unilever. 'Something is for sale and everybody begins to think feverishly, how does it fit into my strategy?' The pace of change seems unlikely to slow - though there have recently been signs of a shift in direction. The 20 largest food manufacturers in Europe still account for only about 12 per cent of a market peopled by an estimated 100,000 companies. By contrast, 40 of the world's top spirits brands are controlled by only four groups. However, the fragmentation of the food industry also reflects genuine diversity. It is really a cluster of many separate businesses, with widely varying competitive structures, growth rates, profitability and capital intensity. Adding to the complexity are Europe's differing national and local taste patterns, which make truly standardised products and brands a rarity. Even as well-established a Euro-brand as Nescafe comes in 50 combinations of strength, taste and flavour. Nonetheless, in some product categories supply is already quite concentrated. Unilever, for instance, accounts for an estimated 60 per cent of edible fats sales and a big slice of the ice cream business in Europe. Kellogg holds half the breakfast cereals market, while Mars, Nestle, Suchard and Cadbury dominate in chocolate. By contrast, there are no clear leaders in sectors such as cheese, fruit juice or meat-processing. However, even the biggest food companies do not attempt to compete across the entire spectrum, but have strengths in a limited number of areas. Indeed, some industry experts argue that, for all their financial clout, the majors operate industrially as federations of medium-sized companies. Of all the factors spurring the race to grow bigger, probably the most important is changes in food retailing, above all in northern Europe. Though the trade remains largely nationally-based, the power of large supermarkets has substantially increased in the past decade. In Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, one or two chains now account for roughly a third of all food sales. Meanwhile, the spread of electronic point of sale systems and more sophisticated management techniques is providing supermarket groups with up-to-the-minute data about what products they sell, in what volumes, and how much profit they contribute. As a consequence, manufacturers, once used to lording it over the retailers, face fewer, bigger and more knowledgeable customers, who not only bargain harder on price but are increasingly choosy about what they stock. The trend seems certain to develop further, particularly as supermarkets in different European countries press ahead with efforts to purchase and develop new products jointly. The increasing competition for precious shelf-space is making life steadily harder for brands without strong consumer loyalty or powerful promotion. In the words of Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN: 'In this business, the number one makes a lot of money, the number two can make a decent living, the number three just suffers.' The rapid growth of private-label products, sold under retailers' own names at prices which usually undercut top brands, has added to the pressure. More than a third of all packaged groceries sold in Britain - and roughly a fifth in France, Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland - are now private label. 'The low and high ends of the market are growing, but the middle ground is really being squeezed,' says Mr Peter Mensing, a food industry specialist with consultants Booz Allen. 'Manufacturers have either to trade up or down.' Most at risk are second- and third-rank manufacturers which compete mainly on price and in one national market. Many - particularly in the UK - have been driven to expand across European borders largely to offset dependence on a handful of powerful customers at home. The acquisition motives of the bigger companies are more complex. Broadly, they fall into three categories: Extending the power of established brands, the source of profits and market power. 'Everyone today is trying to get a bigger leverage to the consumer and a bigger leverage to the trade,' says Mr Camillo Pagano, vice-president of marketing at Nestle. Though large groups hold big shares of the overall European market in certain products, their strengths are often unevenly spread. BSN, though the world's biggest biscuit-maker, still does three quarters of its total sales in France and Italy, while two thirds of Suchard's Dollars 4.5bn turnover is in Germany and France. Often, the only way to achieve a better geographic balance is through small acquisitions. Unilever, for instance, made more than 100 at a cost of about Dollars 2.5bn in the second half of the 1980s. Filling up costly distribution and manufacturing capacity by adding new products. That is becoming increasingly important as large food companies increasingly centralise production in fewer plants designed to serve the entire European market. Diversifying into new businesses. Though overall European food consumption is increasing only slowly, businesses such as fresh, chilled and convenience foods are enjoying rapid growth and high margins. Innovations in these markets are often pioneered by smaller companies, which often sell out to bigger groups. The dilemma facing all would-be acquirers, however, is that keener rivalry has driven up the prices of quality targets, while extracting quick returns is increasingly difficult. Scope for boosting profits simply by cutting the costs of acquired companies has diminished, because many have already streamlined their operations and improved efficiency. 'Generally speaking, at today's high prices it may be difficult to consider an acquisition because you couldn't make it pay unless there were some unusual synergistic elements which would reduce this non-return calculation to a more favourable basis,' says Mr Hans Storr, executive vice-president and chief financial officer of Philip Morris. But achieving worthwhile 'synergies' can be a tricky proposition in a business as diverse and fast-changing as food, where scale economies often lie as much in marketing as in manufacturing. Some industry experts believe opportunistic acquirers have over-estimated the potential benefits. 'Cost savings from synergies often prove illusory or fail to cover acquisition premiums,' says Mr Ian Davis, director of the European consumer industries practice at consultants McKinsey. A growing awareness of the risks is prompting a search for other expansion routes, such as alliances. Nestle, once averse to joint ventures, has recently teamed up with General Mills of the US to exploit the international breakfast cereals market, with Coca-Cola in canned coffee and with BSN to buy Cokoladovny, a Czech biscuit and confectionery company. Nestle also says it is prepared to settle initially for a partial shareholding in Perrier, if necessary. Mr Jim Grover of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, which advises several leading European food companies, says they are increasingly interested in collaboration in preference to outright purchases. But he also admits that only about 10 per cent of joint venture proposals get beyond the ideas stage. A further element is the intrusion of anti-trust regulation, particularly from Brussels. If Nestle's bid for Perrier succeeds, it will probably be the first big food industry deal to be vetted under the EC merger control regulation since it took effect 16 months ago. None of these developments, however, is likely to slow the competition which is relentlessly bearing down on weaker players. Adding to the pressure are the ambitions of big US food groups such as Philip Morris, PepsiCo, Sara Lee and Campbells Soup, all of which see European expansion as a high priority. Says Mr Maljers of Unilever: 'I see a future for two kinds of food company: the well-managed specialist with perhaps one product in one country, and the multinational. Middle-sized companies present in only two or three countries are in trouble.' Some in the industry would consider that prognosis excessively stark. However, it is also a salutary reminder that building a broader international base is only one - and not necessarily a sufficient - condition for surviving in the European food markets of tomorrow. At least as important are the ability to carve out carefully-defined business segments and to exploit them with single-minded dedication. In a highly-fragmented industry where even the biggest players have prospered by focusing selectively on core products and skills, the company which spreads its resources across a wide range of activities and markets is more at risk than the small producer committed to doing one thing superlatively well.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------               TOP TEN CROSS-BORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER               TARGET                          YEAR    DOLLARS BN Nestle (Switz)       Rowntree (UK)                    1988      4.92 Phillip Morris (US)  Jacobs Suchard (Switz)           1990      3.80 BSN (France)         Smiths Crisps, Walkers           1989      2.50                      Crisps, Jacobs (all UK)                      Saiwa (Italy), Belin (France) Nestle (Switz)       Buitoni                          1988      1.40 Pepsico (US)         Smiths Crisps, Walkers Crisps    1989      1.35                      (UK) Sudzucker (Ger)      Raffinerie Tirlemont (Belgium)   1989      0.99 BSN (France)         HP Foods/Lea &amp; Perrins (UK)      1988      0.34 Ferruzzi (Italy)     Lesieur (cooking oils division)  1988      0.26                      (France) Freia (Norway)       Marabou (Sweden)                 1990      0.23 Kuwait Investment    Ebro (Spain)                     1988      0.22 Office  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

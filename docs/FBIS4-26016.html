			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondents Li Jianmin and Zhou Zongmin] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- A growing number of  the world's leading investors are flocking to China, a huge  market of 1.2 billion people, as the country's economy continues  booming.    Fifty-two giant transnational conglomerates, listed among  the  world's top 500 companies in the U.S. "FORTUNE" magazine, have  pumped money into China since 1993, with a total contractual  capital of four billion U.S. dollars, said officials from the  State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC), in a  recent exclusive interview with XINHUA.    The arrival of leading international investors marked a  significant shift in China's introduction of foreign investment  which had been dominated by relatively small projects, the  officials said. More fund and technology-intensive projects are  coming in, they added.    "China's fast-growing economy and improved investment  environment are major factors behind the transnational  companies' favoring China," said Martin Claus, chief  representative of the German KHD Company's Beijing office. KHD,  one of the most prestigious engineering firms in the world, is  now close to signing a 400- million-U.S. dollar contract with  China.    China's economy has been growing at double-digit pace over  the past several years and is expected to grow 12 percent in the  first half of this year and 10 percent for the whole year.    Latest statistics indicate that transnational companies  account for about half of the total foreign investment in China  since 1993.    According to the SAIC officials, over 3,700 foreign firms  have established representative offices or branches in China  since the beginning of last year, including some 260 powerful  companies. Among them are big names like Du Pont, General  Electric, Siemens, IBM, Philips, Mitsubishi and National. While  bringing investments to China, the transnationals have come  along with more projects of technical cooperation.    Apart from Western firms, rising giants from  newly-industrialized countries and regions, such as Singapore  and the Republic of Korea, are also elbowing for a share in the  Chinese market.    A survey conducted recently by an international organization  shows that 98 percent of U.S. firms interviewed have listed  China as the best place for investment.    Attracting big transnational firms has been China's main  target in the 1990s. Foreign investments in chunks up to 10  million dollars are most welcome, particularly in key economic  fields such as infrastructure and basic industries.    More big international firms are putting money in these  sectors as well as the service industries, said an official of  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.    China has announced that its imports will be as high as  1,000  billion dollars in the remaining years before the end of the  century. And foreign investors now face a good prospect.</p>

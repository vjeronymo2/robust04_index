			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov "Military Review": "Pavel Makes Iron </F> Curtains for Window Opened by Peter"]    [Text] Army General Grachev, Russian defense minister,  spent the end of last week visiting Kaliningrad. Although he  himself described this as a scheduled trip, the visit to the  Russian enclave in the West was in many respects unexpected.  Grachev was expected in St. Petersburg. Informed sources  believe that the military minister's plans were changed by the  urgent need to decide the Baltic Fleet's future -- whether it is  to exist or not.    The Defense Ministry is disastrously short of money. Whereas  at the end of 1992 the state's debts to the military totaled 5  percent of the defense budget, at the end of 1993 the army and  navy were owed 25 percent of their finances. In January 1994  the Defense Ministry was given just 63 percent of the money it  requires. There is only enough money to pay wages. The Defense  Ministry cannot pay the military-industrial complex for hardware  and weapons. Some 64 percent of all Russia's enterprises work  for the defense industry and are paid by the Defense Ministry --  over half the country's plants, millions of workers. In 1993  only half of the Defense Ministry's 2.2 trillion-ruble arrears  to the military-industrial complex were paid off. The  military-industrial complex is "falling apart."    The results of the "battle" over the military budget in 1994  are unpredictable. But it is obvious even now that the Defense  Ministry will not receive all the money it requires. Therefore  the question of cutting back a number of military structures is  an acute one. The Baltic Fleet has come under attack. Two  views have clashed in the Defense Ministry. First: That the  fleet not be destroyed. Second: That, on the basis of the  Baltic Fleet and the Leningrad Naval Base, a "diviziya" of  warships be created which would come under general military  command [obshchevoyskovoye komandovaniye].    Both ideas are backed by high-ranking people, and there are  reports that a real battle has flared up. Pavel Grachev took a  group of military and naval top brass with him to investigate  the situation on the spot.  <H3>  Will We Be Posing a Threat From Here? No -- Defending  Ourselves </H3>   In Kaliningrad the defense minister listened to the command  of the Baltic Fleet and visited a number of military  installations, troop units, and ships, many of which were put on  alert during his work in the oblast and put to sea or took to  the field.    Summing up the results of the trip, Pavel Grachev gave a  cautious response to the direct question of whether the Baltic  Fleet is to exist or not: "The Baltic Fleet will evidently  remain as it was." Clearly, a definitive decision will be made  once the results of the work of the numerous representatives of  the Defense Ministry central apparatus and the commanders in  chief of the branches of the Armed Forces who visited  Kaliningrad Oblast with the defense minister have been  summarized. However, Grachev assured the men of the Baltic  Fleet that he personally is in favor of keeping a fleet in the  Baltic.    The minister said that the main purpose of the visit was to  study the decision to create a Kaliningrad Oblast Special  Defense Area [KOOR]. This territorial operational formation is  to comprise large groupings of ground forces, military aviation,  air defense forces, and part of the forces of the Baltic Fleet.  The Kaliningrad Special Defense Area will interact with the  border troops and, possibly, with units of the Russian Ministry  of Internal Affairs [MVD] internal troops, which Pavel Grachev  intends to discuss with [MVD Minister] Viktor Yerin in Moscow in  the near future.    The plan is to place the Kaliningrad Special Defense Area  under the jurisdiction of the defense minster and the General  Staff. The grouping will be under the command of a single  commanding officer. If he is a naval commander, his deputies  will be general military personnel. And vice versa. The  special defense area's main tasks are to defend the littoral and  the airspace.    All categories of support for the Kaliningrad Special  Defense  Area will be organized at central level. That is difficult right  now owing to the isolated position of Russia's most westerly  oblast. Following his talks with the Kaliningrad Oblast  Administration Pavel Grachev intends to confront the Russian  authorities with the question of creating a St.  Petersburg-Baltiysk "sea run". It is envisaged that a  transshipment base will be set up in Leningrad Oblast from which  military freight and combat hardware will be shipped to the  Kaliningrad Special Defense Area by amphibious warfare ships or  seagoing ferries. That is a costly business, but transit  through Lithuania is now several times more costly. Like cable  communications lines too. The laying of underwater lines is now  being completed, and it is also planned to provide the  Kaliningrad Special Defense Area with additional space  communications systems.  <H5>  Minister Gunning for Every Penny </H5>   During his final news conference in the Baltiysk Garrison  Officers' Club the defense minister devoted half an hour instead  of the promised 10 minutes to journalists and film crews.  Warming to his theme, Pavel Grachev spoke about...    ...his daily routine: "I spend half my working time thinking  about where to get money for the army and navy -- I search it  out, or I `extort' it."    ...Armed Forces manning: "The fall draft went OK. I hope  the spring draft will also provide us with enlisted men and  seamen. I think that by the end of 1994 we will be able to man  the main Armed Forces categories some 85-90 percent. And  secondary categories 60-65 percent. That is quite acceptable  given the realities we face. Throughout the world, 20-30  percent of citizens are exempt from the draft. Legislators in  our country have 'gone over the toip': 70 percent of citizens  are exempt from service, while 30-40 percent of those who are  drafted are sick."    ...contract service: "There are already 120,000 contract  personnel. The president has authorized another 150,000 to be  recruited in 1994."    ...the "breakup" of the Air Defense Forces: "There have been  reports in the press that the Air Defense Forces are being  halved. Not at all. We are to some extent 'contracting' the  troops, removing obsolete systems. All the same, we cannot  cover all the targets in the country, we will select the most  important. Special attention now is to be focused on electronic  reconnaissance systems and reinforcing the Air Defense Forces'  fighter aviation. There will be good intelligence, making it  possible to enlist the Air Force and antimissile defense forces  and systems to defend the airspace."</p>

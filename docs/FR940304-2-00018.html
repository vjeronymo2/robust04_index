			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Harbor seals and gray seals are known to interact with salmon net pens in the Gulf of Maine (GME), yet the rate at which interactions occur may be increasing based on stranding reports and communication with net pen owners and their representatives. Recently, the Maine Aquaculture Association appealed to NMFS to provide net pen owners with a means for limited intentional lethal taking of seals, indicating a 10 percent loss of salmon due to predation by seals. In their appeal, they noted that a ``Predator Control Seminar'' was held in Eastport, Maine, in April 1993 to discuss the effectiveness of non-lethal means of deterring seals. The group determined that although non-lethal deterrence efforts are being employed, ``periodic intentional lethal take of individual seals is a necessary tool for the continued success of this industry.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners of salmon net pens have been subject to the reporting requirements of a Category III fishery, which require that all lethal takes of marine mammals be reported to NMFS within 10 days. However, only limited reports of seal mortalities due to salmon net pen operations have been received by NMFS since 1989. NMFS is concerned that the take rate of marine mammals in salmon net pen operations may be greater than previously estimated, and therefore proposes that the Gulf of Maine salmon net pen fishery be reclassified from Category III to Category II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Literature Cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Barlow, J., P.

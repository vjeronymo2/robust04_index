			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Thorny questions on commissions: The OFT inquiry into fees charged for raising capital Throughout decades of upheaval and change in the securities industry, at least one thing has remained immutable - the scale of commissions companies pay for raising capital. Even that could now change following an inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading. Its move could bring to a head a long-simmering controversy pitting companies anxious to reduce costs against brokers and underwriters who collect the fees, and which could even question the UK system of pre-emptive rights. For companies on the verge of bankruptcy and for those in the pink of health, 2 per cent of new equity capital has traditionally been set aside to cover the costs of brokers, underwriters and sub-underwriters. Brokers to a rights or initial public offering earn 0.25 per cent of the total, underwriters and sub-underwriters 0.50 and 1.25 per cent, respectively. Only in rare cases such as privatisations are commissions lower. But early this year, the OFT began questioning the resistance of the cost of raising capital to competition, market conditions or indeed, any other factor. In March, the OFT approached City of London trade associations to discuss why underwriting fees remained impervious to market forces. Its review is in a preliminary phase, and no decision has been made on whether to launch a formal investigation. The OFT has received no formal complaints from companies, but it has been made aware of 'general comment' from some unhappy about their inability to negotiate fees. 'It just seems to me to be illogical,' says Mr Hugh Collum, finance director at SmithKline Beecham and chairman of the 100 Group of Finance Directors which includes Britain's largest corporations. Companies planning rights negotiate the size of the discount to the share price at which new stock is to be offered. He says there seems little reason why fees for the service should not also be negotiable. City brokers say the possible OFT attack on underwriting fees raises the prospect of a two-tiered market, with blue chip companies making rights offerings at a fraction of the former cost. Companies making rights offerings to prevent them sliding into bankruptcy face higher costs. Thus, the cost of capital would rise steeply for those needing it most. They view the prospect with anxiety. At the heart of the UK system of underwriting lies the pre-emptive right of shareholders to have first refusal of any offering of stock that might dilute their stake. Preserving pre-emptive rights requires companies to announce their intention to sell shares at a set price ahead of the offering date and makes underwritten offerings the one way companies can be sure of raising the capital they need. In the US, where shareholders do not have pre-emptive rights, issues are rarely underwritten. Companies take advantage of shelf-registration rule 415 of the Securities and Exchange Act and file documents announcing their intention to raise capital. When conditions are advantageous, they take their filing 'off the shelf' and sell shares. While there are other costs, US companies say the procedure has made raising capital cheaper. In the UK, a company's largest institutional shareholders typically act as its sub-underwriters in rights offerings, selling the shares to others at roughly what they cost but keeping the 1.25 per cent commission as profit. 'It's money for old rope,' said one institutional fund manager. To the brokers and fund managers who earn the fees, the system is efficient, logical and cheap. Mr Charles Nunnelley, chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association and chairman of Robert Fleming Asset Management, says companies can - and do  - negotiate costs by arguing over the level of discount to market price at which shares are to be sold. He says the size of the discount is the real expense for companies, not the cost of commissions to underwriters. Underwriting commissions are a kind of insurance policy, Mr Nunnelley argues. They are not intended to reflect the risk of an issue but the general market risk between the date an offering is announced and the date the shares are sold. Brokers say the system of underwriting militates against negotiating fees. 'A broker calls you up and says will you take a piece of XYZ company's stock at this price and you have to say yes or no on the spot. You don't have the opportunity to negotiate the fee,' said one fund manager. Brokers claim capital-raising costs have responded to market forces. Discounts on rights offerings have fluctuated widely over the years. They hovered between 15 per cent and 20 per cent through the early 1980s, but the competition of Big Bang in 1986 and go-go stock market prices combined to narrow discounts to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. Last year, after several well-publicised rights issue flops, discounts on a few issues widened to more than 20 per cent. Meanwhile, Mr Nunnelley and others in the fund management industry say little money is made from underwriting or sub-underwriting. 'It's a lot of very small profits that can be wiped out by a single failure,' he said. When the UK government sold its stake in British Petroleum, arranging underwriting days before the October 1987 stock market crash, the ensuing losses were said to have wiped out several years' worth of institutions' underwriting profits. The OFT wants to know how much money is made from underwriting. It has asked IFMA, the British Merchant Bankers Association and the National Association of Pension Funds for profits earned by members from the activity over the past 10 years. Mr John Rogers, secretary to NAPF's investment committee, says the exercise has been profitable for pension funds 'or they wouldn't do it'. But the profits are marginal compared with investment gains. If sub-underwriting became operationally difficult for pension funds, they would not do it at all, he says. 'For our part, we are as happy to see non-underwritten deep discounted issues,' he says.</p>

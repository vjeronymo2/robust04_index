			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> CHANGE IN TAX PLAN SOUGHT  </P> <P> Parents and other residents Tuesday night suggested to the Beverly Hills school  board ways to sell voters a proposed parcel tax to help shore up the schools.  </P> <P> The tax measure, which will be on the June 5 ballot, must be approved by  two-thirds of the voters to take effect.  </P> <P> The school board has drafted a tiered assessment system in which properties  would be taxed $350 to $750 a year, depending on their size and use. The  measure would raise about $4.5 million a year for the next five years.  </P> <P> Phillip Harris, speaking on behalf of Children First, a parents group,  recommended that the varying tax rates have what he termed a "more equitable  spread." The group suggested, for instance, that single-family homes on parcels  less than 9,999 square feet be taxed $300 a year, instead of the $350 proposed  by the board. For single-family homes on larger parcels, it suggested rates of  $600 and $800 instead of the $500 and $650 in the board's version.  </P> <P> "We've discussed it with many senior citizens," Harris said. "We think a little  more spread would be more palatable."  </P> <P> Children First's plan would raise about $4.8 million a year, Harris said.  </P> <P> The group and individual parents also suggested changes in wording of the  ballot question and the board's official resolution calling for the tax.  </P> <P> Parent Dave Gordon warned the board of a silent opposition that helped defeat  the district's last parcel-tax attempt in 1987. When he walked door-to-door in  support of that measure, he said, "motherhood, flags, the schools -- everyone  was in favor. But they didn't vote that way."  </P> <P> District officials said they will review the recommendations and adopt a final  version today. "We want to make this as palatable as possible," said Frank  Fenton, board president.  </P></p>

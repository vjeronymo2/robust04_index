			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDGE BARS PRESS FROM HEARING REAGAN TESTIFY;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: BUT EDITED TAPES OF THE TESTIMONY WILL BE MADE PUBLIC. MEANWHILE,  PRESIDENT BUSH ALSO WANTS TO KEEP REAGAN DIARIES SECRET.  </P> <P> A federal judge today refused to allow reporters to attend Ronald Reagan's  videotaped Iran-Contra deposition in Los Angeles Friday, but allowed media  access to the videotape as soon as it is edited.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, in a 13-page decision, rejected a lawsuit by  12 news organizations seeking an order allowing press and public attendance  when Reagan undergoes questioning in a California federal courtroom.  </P> <P> Greene refused to open the deposition to the press and public, saying the  likelihood of disclosure of sensitive national security information is too  high.  </P> <P> But, in a partial compromise, Greene said the edited videotape would be made  public before its use at the trial of Reagan's former national security  adviser, John M. Poindexter, now scheduled for March 5 in Washington.  </P> <P> In a footnote to his opinion, Greene said the videotape should be edited in  "two or three working days" barring any "extraordinary disputes" over  classified material.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Bush Administration invoked executive privilege today -- joining  a move Reagan made earlier -- in an attempt to keep secret excerpts from  Reagan's personal diaries. Although Reagan agreed to testify on videotape, he  still is fighting to keep the diaries secret.  </P> <P> The Justice Department said it was claiming executive privilege on the diary  excerpts on behalf of Bush and maintained that Poindexter has not shown a  sufficient need for the personal notes to overcome the importance of enabling  "Presidents to consult with their advisers effectively."  </P> <P> Greene said he will resolve the diary issue after he hears Reagan's testimony.  The judge will decide which portions of Reagan's testimony will be edited out  of the videotape.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times and other news organizations had fought for access under  the First Amendment -- freedom of the press. Greene ruled that the First  Amendment had to be considered in conjunction with "respect for the  constitutional prerogatives of the chief executive."  </P> <P> Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser, is accused of five  criminal charges.  </P></p>

The petition was assigned Docket No. PRM&hyph;50&hyph;59 on January 19, 1994. The petitioner requests that the Commission amend its regulations to change the frequency with which each licensee conducts independent reviews and audits of its safeguards contingency plan and security program from annually to biennially. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments July 20, 1994.

Final NRC action on this petition would be consistent with actions taken on modifications to other program audit requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner's Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virginia Power requests that the NRC amend its regulations in 10 CFR parts 50 and 73 to change the requirements that each licensee provide for a review at least every 12 months (annually) of its safeguards contingency plan and security programs to nominally every 24 months (biennially). The petitioner also requests that appendix C to 10 CFR part 73 be amended to change the requirement that each licensee provide for a review and audit of its safeguards contingency plan at intervals not to exceed 12 months to a frequency of 24 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner states that the proposed amendments would require each licensee to conduct independent reviews and audits of its safeguards contingency plan and security program at least biennially. The petitioner states that the resources presently used for audits in each area could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reallocated if justified by performance to address more safety-significant concerns that might be identified. The petitioner also states that the proposed audit frequency provides a greater degree of flexibility in applying resources, thereby permitting a licensee to implement a more performance-based audit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Grounds for Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner states that the changes requested are identified as present requirements that are resource intensive but of marginal importance to safety. The petitioner offers the following reasons for the request. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The underlying purpose of the requirements is to overview and ensure effective implementation of security programs. Given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available objective criteria that industry performance is commendable in this area, aggressive overview activities do not seem to be warranted. Resources, which previously would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strictly dedicated to the conduct of mandatory audits, could now be more effectively used to address performance issues having safety significance. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an acceptable, formal confirmation of security program implementation. The underlying purpose of the existing requirement will continue to be met by the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The current industry Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) average for the security category is 1.27  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as of October 15, 1993. Clearly, this represents a commendable overall performance in this area and supports the move to biennial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits which can be supplemented as performance warrants. Based on the overall industry SALP ratings concerning safeguards contingency plan and security program effectiveness, Virginia Power concludes that changing the audit frequency to two years will have no adverse impact on implementation of the plan and program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A two-year audit schedule would permit the licensee an increased degree of flexibility to concentrate available audit resources in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas of observed weakness based on performance rather than conducting a mandatory annual audit of marginal safety significance. Thus, personnel resources would be allowed to address and resolve issues having greater safety significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Regulatory Guide 1.33, Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation), prescribes a two-year audit frequency for most operational phase activities commensurate with the activity's operational safety significance. The proposed rule would be consistent with this previously defined regulatory position and the present safety significance as evidenced by industry performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The requirements to conduct annual audits are not of themselves necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.54(p) and 10 CFR part 73. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable formal confirmation of program effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

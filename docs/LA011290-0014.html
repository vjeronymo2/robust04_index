			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: MOTTA IN SACRAMENTO: THE REST OF THE STORY  </P> <P> Several NBA reporters raised an eyebrow when Dick Motta was hired to coach the  Sacramento Kings. Jan Hubbard of Newsday suspects an ulterior motive was  involved:  </P> <P> "Hmmmmm. Two of the finalists for the Sacramento Kings' job were John MacLeod  and Bob Weiss. Dick Motta was hired. MacLeod is the guy who replaced Motta when  Motta left the Dallas Mavericks. MacLeod coached the Mavericks to the Western  Conference finals, which is further than they ever advanced during seven years  under Motta.  </P> <P> "And Weiss, who would have been hired had Motta not accepted the job, was  Motta's assistant in Dallas for six years. But the working relationship between  the two did not end on ideal terms when Weiss was hired by the San Antonio  Spurs in 1986.  </P> <P> "So could it be possible that Motta saw two guys he either did not respect or  of whom he was jealous and decided to shaft both of them by taking the Kings  job?  </P> <P> "Ugly thoughts. And about such a nice, loyal guy."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Through 1989, what high school produced the most NFL players?  </P> <P> Cartoons were on: Rookie guard Doug Widell of the Denver Broncos, asked about  Earnest Byner's fumble that preserved the Broncos' 38-33 victory over the  Cleveland Browns in the 1987 AFC championship game:  </P> <P> "I wasn't that big of a fan of NFL football when I was in college. I watched  the Super Bowls, but I get bored watching football games on television. Maybe I  saw that game, but I probably fell asleep."  </P> <P> Add cartoons: After the Clippers lost to the Detroit Pistons Jan. 3, center  Benoit Benjamin showered, dressed and began spraying rancid-smelling cologne  all over himself. Teammate Charles Smith began fanning the air and complaining.  Benjamin looked at reporters and said, "Might get them out of here."  </P> <P> Question of balance: The New York Knicks' Kenny Walker started three games in  place of injured Charles Oakley last week. He missed all seven of his shots in  the first game but made all 10 of his free throws. In the second game, Walker  was five for seven from the field but two for six from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> "Next game it will all come together," Walker said.  </P> <P> It did. Walker was one for five from the field and one for four from the line.  </P> <P> Tears of a clown: Frank Layden, who quit as coach of the Utah Jazz last winter,  on what he would have done differently: "I would have stopped the comic act a  long time ago. I thought I had to be like Casey Stengel to take people's minds  off our bad team. But after we got good, I kept joking, and I don't know if  anyone ever took me seriously as a coach."  </P> <P> Bunch of flunkies: Buddy Ryan, coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, gave print  reporters an A for their reporting this season and assessed TV reporters a  B-minus. Ryan said: "Radio guys, you guys are down in the Gs. That's even below  Fs."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Big Spring High in Big Spring, Tex., 11.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Notre Dame football Coach Lou Holtz on Bo Schembechler, new  president of the Detroit Tigers: "I just love to listen to Bo talk. Maybe it's  because I don't have much choice when we're together." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

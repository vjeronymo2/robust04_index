Open them up and you should be in the right mood to listen to Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie reading The Billy Bunter Stories on Radio 2 (7.00).

Yarroo] Do you feel deprived of programmes about the prison system, convicts' feelings, recidivism and the like? In case you missed the last four score, BBC2 offers yet another: Andy Campbell - A Prisoner's Tale (7.30). If you have had the tribulations of being a criminal just about up to here, simply switch to Radio 3 and listen to BBC Proms. Today's programme includes Rachmaninov's rarely performed 'Spring' cantata, and Chopin's 2nd Piano Concerto, played by Vladimir Ovchinikov, past winner of the Leeds competition. In the series Far Flung Floyd the wine enthusiast goes for a rest on Koh Samui and cooks rice noodles with shrimp, egg, beancurd and tamarind syrup (8.30 BBC2).</p>

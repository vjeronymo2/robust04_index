			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Public-sector rises exceed guidelines Many of those employed in Britain's public sector continue to enjoy pay rises well above the government's own wage guidelines and the monthly pay index. This is the surprising but firm conclusion to be drawn from the detailed evidence in the first instalment of this year's New Earnings Survey published by the Department of Employment yesterday. But the picture is highly diverse, with winners and losers in both the public and private-sector pay league tables. The biggest boost to pay in the public sector in the year to April was for women employed full-time in the BBC - their average earnings climbed by 12.2 per cent to Pounds 500.80 for a 37-hour week. They were followed by full-time women secretaries and typists in the civil service, with a 7.5 per cent rise in earnings to Pounds 257.40 for a 37-hour week. The highest percentage rises among full-time male employees in the public sector were those employed as scientific officers in the civil service with a 6.8 per cent increase to Pounds 451.30 for a 37.5-hour week. They were followed by female nurses and midwives who had a 6.2 per cent rise in average earnings to Pounds 305.40 for a 38-hour working week. Ambulance workers were next with a 6.1 per cent rise to Pounds 313.20 for a massive 49.7-hour week, including 5.4 hours of overtime. Male teachers in England and Wales secured 3.4 per cent rises to an average Pounds 454.70 for a 30.4-hour working week while their female colleagues had 3.8 per cent rises to Pounds 395.30 for a 30.1-hour week. Men employed in the higher and middle grades of the civil service had 3.7 per cent rises to Pounds 417.90 for a 38.9-hour working week but their female colleagues secured 3.4 per cent in earnings to Pounds 344.30 for a 38.4-hour working week. There have been some losers in the public sector. Male police had average pay rises of only 0.3 per cent to Pounds 446.80 for a 42-hour week while firefighters had 1.1 per cent, taking them to an average Pounds 344.60 for a 43.6-hour week. Both of those groups have their pay linked to the earnings of others. Male manual workers in local government in England and Wales had only a 1.8 per cent earnings rise to Pounds 241 for 47.3 hours a week while in Scotland the comparable group secured a 1.2 per cent improvement to Pounds 248.30 for a 50.1-hour working week. Low earnings increases were also recorded for academics (up 1.2 per cent for men and 2.6 per cent for women). In the private sector the picture is even more diverse, with some substantial earnings increases in a number of industries and services. The largest earnings boost was recorded among males in the managerial and professional group at British Telecommunications, with a 22.6 per cent increase taking their pre-tax pay to Pounds 702.00 for a 41.6-hour working week. Substantial improvements were also recorded for men in British Gas (10.1 per cent), the car industry (13.0 per cent), ceramics (16.6 per cent) and general printing in England and Wales. The survey also reveals widespread regional pay differences. New Earnings Survey 1994, Part A. HMSO.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 26--The visiting Singapore Prime  Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, today expressed the view that the  framework for a strategic economic alliance between his country  and India had been created with his visit.    Talking to a small group of journalists this evening, Mr.  Goh  said the objective of his visit was to forge such a strategic  economic alliance with India and he had found a responsive chord  in the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao.    Terming his visit as timely, Mr. Goh said India till now was  focusing more on the West and West Asia, and not much on Asia.  At the same time, Singapore was looking to the West, as it had  invested heavily in China and was looking for opportunities  elsewhere. India had a big potential which was still unrealised  and its trade and investment flows were minimal. Moreover, the  potential for tourism was immense and India too was interested  in exploiting this sector to earn more foreign exchange.  Singapore could help in this, he said.    Kashmir issue: About the political discussions  between him and Mr. Rao, Mr. Goh said both had provided an  assessment of the situation in their respective areas. He had  been briefed about the Kashmir situation, he said, but refused  to comment about Pakistan's role in aiding and abetting  terrorism there. "Singapore is a good friend of both India and  Pakistan. So it will not be proper for me to comment during this  visit, as it is a very complex issue." He said it was for India  and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir problem. "Singapore has no  role in it, nor do I see any role for any third party. It is  essentially for India and Pakistan to resolve the issue."    To a question on the strident western campaign about alleged  human rights abuses in Asian countries, Mr. Goh was categorical  in rejecting the western concept of human rights. "Asian  countries cannot be dictated by western standards. We should  have our own concept of human rights since we have to feed our  population, clothe them, educate them, house them. All this  requires a stable law and order situation. Of course there  should be some basic freedoms, but it should be appreciated that  most of the Asian countries are in the first stage of  development and that for many of them, the concept of democracy  is new. Even the western countries had no human rights concept  in their early stages of development and industrialisation.    Asked about India's role in the Association of South East  Asian Nations (ASEAN), Mr. Goh reiterated that India should  first develop its trade and investment relations with the  Association. A sectoral dialogue with India had begun in this  context and once trade and economic relations flourished, India  could be given the status of a full sectoral partner, but not a  member, he said.    On the future of the South Asian Association for Regional  Cooperation (SAARC), Mr. Goh was not very optimistic, saying  that it had no middle-income country as its member which could  generate economic exchanges or capital flows. Moreover, some of  the SAARC members had intractable problems between them and this  would weigh down cooperation amongst them, he felt. "So I see  slow progress for the SAARC, though I hope I am wrong in this  assessment."    `Consensus emerging': Asked about his assessment  on the economic reforms in India, Mr. Goh said that a consensus  seemed to be emerging here on the need to de-regulate this  economy and reform it. "I say this on the basis of my  discussions with politicians and businessmen. Of course, I did  not have any opportunity to discuss this with the Opposition  parties here, but I feel a consensus is emerging."    On the new areas for reforms in India, Mr. Goh said he was  looking for more liberalisation in the property laws.</p>

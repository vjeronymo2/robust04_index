			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suleyman Demirel returned to Turkey today  from official visits to Ukraine and Moldova. On the last day of  his visit, various agreements were signed between Turkey and  Moldova envisaging friendship and cooperation.    The president held a news conference at Ankara Esenboga  Airport on his return and assessed his visits. He pointed out  that the visits added strong and rich contents to the relations  between Turkey and Ukraine and Moldova. He said: I have come  back from a historic embrace with our Turkic brothers.    Demirel pointed out that in Ukraine, he gave the message  that  Turkey is a good friend, a useful neighbor, and a serious  cooperation partner for that country. He said that an agreement  in principle was reached to jointly build a Mediterranean-Black  Sea oil pipeline, and other agreements were signed in highway  transportation and tourism. He added: These are basic  agreements that will enable our peoples and our business circles  to engage in deeper and more beneficial cooperation relations,  and they complement agreements signed earlier. We also took a  very important step during our visit in affirming that the  Crimean Turks -- one of the historical owners of Ukrainian lands  -- constitute a real bridge of friendship and cooperation in the  relations between our two countries. We announced our good news  that as a contribution of the Turkish nation to the return of  the Crimean Turks to their historical homeland, we will build  1,000 homes in Crimea. This will be the first international aid  to the Crimean Turks ever since they started to return to their  homeland.    The president said that during his visit to Moldova, he gave  the Moldovan officials the message that they can trust Turkey's  friendship and that Turkey will try to extend every possible  kind of aid to that country. He stressed that the visit built  the strong legal foundations of the bilateral relations based on  agreements.    Demirel pointed out that eight agreements were signed with  Moldova on transportation, agriculture, culture, the fight  against organized crime, and so on. The most important of these  agreements, he said, was the agreement on friendship and  cooperation.    Demirel said: We reached an agreement on a $35 million  Eximbank loan -- which was being discussed for some time -- to  be used in the development projects in the Gagauz region.  Meanwhile, in the framework of another agreement, the Turkish  Cooperation and Development Agency will open an office in  Kishinev.    President Demirel pointed out that during his visit, he  toured the Gagauz region accompanied by the Moldovan president.  He added that he had the opportunity to observe the rich  customs and traditions of the Gagauz Turks.    Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Transportation Minister  Mehmet Kostepen returned to Turkey with President Demirel.</p>

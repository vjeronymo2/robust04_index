			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Vance and Owen may turn to UN BOSNIA peace mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen may soon decide to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose a settlement on the three warring factions. After six days of intensive negotiations in Geneva on the proposed map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, very little progress has been made, according to the conference spokesman, Mr Fred Eckhard. However, rebel Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, claimed significant progress had been made and the warring sides could agree a peace package this weekend. It is clear the serious outbreak of fighting between Croats and Serbs in Krajina, the Serb-occupied region of Croatia, has broken the momentum of the conference on Bosnia and weakened the political will of all three warring parties - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - to reach an agreement. 'One of the options before the (Security) Council would be whether it would consider enforcing a peace proposal that Vance and Owen think is fair, even if one or two of the parties had not signed on to it,' Mr Eckhard said. It remains unclear what measures the Security Council would take to enforce the peace plan, given the deep reluctance of most of its members to resort to military intervention. There was no firm indication yesterday whether the international mediators had set themselves a deadline for reaching an agreement. The general assumption appears to be that they are prepared to spin out this round of negotiations at least until the weekend. But if no progress has been registered by then, the decision to turn to the Security Council could come very quickly. In London, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, ruled out any international military intervention in Bosnia. He told parliament's foreign affairs committee: 'We don't believe it is possible to impose a peaceful solution (in Bosnia) by means of a military protectorate.'</p>

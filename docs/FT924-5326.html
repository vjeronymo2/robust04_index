			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Women 'find new jobs more quickly' WOMEN executives find new jobs more quickly than men after being made redundant or being fired, according to InterExec, the career management and outplacement consultants, Lisa Wood writes. A survey of the company's clients says men in the Pounds 30,000-Pounds 40,000 salary range took more than six months to get a new job while women in the same bracket took just over three months. The results are endorsed by DBM, another outplacement consultancy, which said the most likely explanation was that women have to work harder to become executives and therefore they are the better qualified when it comes to making new job applications. Consultants said, however, that men are better at networking among contacts to find new jobs.</p>

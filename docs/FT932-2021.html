			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Observer: BBC bully? If there really is no one in overall charge of the Government's publicity machine, why did Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor of the exchequer, cancel his chance of being grilled by Jonathan Dimbleby on the BBC TV's On the Record yesterday? He would have been rewarded with handsome coverage in today's papers. Having scrapped the silly tradition of budget purdah just last week, it seems odd that Clarke should suddenly fall silent now. Perhaps he lost his nerve (unlikely), or Treasury officials have already convinced him he is talking too much about something he doesn't know much about (possible). Whatever the reason, the BBC was miffed at being let down at such short notice - which is no bad thing. It might be a sign that Clarke wants to prove that he, rather than the media, is in charge of setting the economic agenda.</p>

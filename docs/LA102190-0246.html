You can set your VCR for Kids World (weekdays at 6:30 a.m. on Nickelodeon), a  syndicated news and documentary program created by and for kids.

For 2- to 6-year-olds.  </P> <P> On Kids Court (7:30 a.m. weekends on Nickelodeon), kids can air their  grievances in a courtroom setting.

For 8- to 15-year-olds.  </P> <P> Every weekday at 6 a.m., the Discovery Channel airs two commercial-free 20-25  minute program segments under the umbrella title Assignment: Discovery. Shows  presented fall under daily themes: Monday shows explore science and technology,  Tuesday social studies, Wednesday natural science, Thursday arts and humanities  and Friday world events and contemporary issues.

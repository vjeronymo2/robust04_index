			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Hong Kong bargain hunters out Investors in Hong Kong could be forgiven if they lack democratic fervour. Governor Chris Patten's plans to forge on with democratisation, and the resulting war of words with Beijing, have exerted a heavy toll on share prices in Hong Kong and the rest of the Far East. On Tuesday the Hang Seng fell 5 per cent - its worst since August 1991  - following a drop of 3 per cent on the previous day. Then on Thursday it fell another 8 per cent, its worst day since the Tiananmen square massacre in 1989. But yesterday the bargain hunters emerged, and share prices rose 5.8 per cent - the largest single day gain for more than a month.</p>

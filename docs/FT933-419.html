			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: 'The Vampyr' strikes a winning vein - The Prix Italia Television Festival The Prix Italia almost died this year. Admittedly, at 45 it is astoundingly long in the tooth for a broadcasting festival, but it deserves to live and, if television is to be anything more than a gadget for funnelling advertising income into global media conglomerates, we must keep fighting for its survival. The winners of the three main awards for television this year were the Dutch drama I Am Going To Tahiti; a 'home video' about Aids from the US, Silverlake Life, which won the documentary category; and Britain's so-called 'soap opera' The Vampyr, which won the music and arts prize. Between them they provide a vivid illustration of the sort of thing the Prix Italia has stood for since its creation as a radio festival in 1948. The people who come to this festival to bring their programmes, or serve on the juries are not marketing experts: they have not come to sell programmes as have most of the people who attend other broadcasting festivals. When you meet them in the bar, or under the umbrella pines that seem to surround most of the beautiful venues chosen over the years for this event, virtually all admit that they work in television because they believe it can be more than a medium for screening game shows and commercials. The Prix Italia has never concerned itself with quizzes, news, sport, variety, soap opera, movies or light entertainment. Its categories have always been drama, music and arts, and documentary, and the programme makers who come to compete, adjudicate and talk (oh the talk]) believe passionately that - just as much as theatre or cinema, print or paint - television can serve as a medium for the expression of opinion, politics, and the arts. They are people who, in another age, would have been writing pamphlets or, earlier, leading bands of strolling players. The winning Dutch drama told economically, tautly, and with a quietness unusual for such a subject, of the SS visiting the studio of artist/painter Hendrik Werkman in early 1945. No one said 'Ve haf vays of making you talk', this was a meeting between a complicated artist and a softly spoken totalitarian bureaucrat. Written by Ger Beukenkamp and directed by Gerrard Verhage it was all the more powerful for showing Werkman not as a heroic member of the Resistance (there was a tedious French drama along those lines, with the old cliche of betrayal under torture, heavily signalled in the first five minutes, then spun out prettily for a further 85) but as a pragmatist who even refused to use his printing skills to help the Resistance. Yet the senseless killing of this man, beside a pit on the edge of a forest, and his last request to look around for a moment before he died, was more moving than all the familiar footage of Auschwitz railway lines and Auschwitz ovens rammed into ITV's arts entry, The Symphony Of Sorrowful Songs, a South Bank Show on Henryk Gorecki and his third symphony. The 'American' documentary Silverlake Life (which would never have been made had Channel 4 not commissioned it and put up the seed money, according to its producer) is a home video shot by Tom Joslin and Mark Massi as Aids destroyed their health and eventually caused Joslin's death. At nearly two hours it is demandingly long and, some would say, flawed by its lack of any sense of modesty, a characteristic apparently seen as a virtue in modern America. Yet it is undeniably moving. The BBC's winning entry in the music and arts category, The Vampyr, is an extraordinary conflation of grand opera and television soap opera. A 19th century work by Heinrich Marschner was rewritten as a horror film screenplay by Janet Street-Porter and Nigel Finch, and directed by Finch in brief episodes that were screened in Britain on successive days last Christmas. At this festival we saw a single 46 minute episode which worked slightly less well, but still deservedly took the top prize. So what does all this illustrate? First, a determination that we shall not forget the holocaust, and a belief that television can and must bear witness to it. In the 20 odd years that I have been attending the Prix Italia no one has ever attacked television for screening game shows or soap operas but I have lost count of the number who have, metaphorically and sometimes literally, cornered me to insist that, whatever else it does, television must sustain the memory of this key event in 20th century European history. Somehow I doubt that you hear the same sentiment expressed too often in the offices of Global Satellite TV Inc. Though paramount, the holocaust is not the only subject of its sort: Prix Italia entries have dealt with genocide in Cambodia, and this year there was a noticeable increase in the number or programmes concerned with the idiocies and cruelty of eastern Europe's late communist regimes. The Czechs entered a drama, A Chateau In Bohemia, which came close to glorifying the spirit and standards of the old aristocracy, as personified by a doughty countess during the darkest days of the 1950s, and a somewhat chaotic - yet brief and amusing - documentary about political protest in Moscow today. Secondly, the closely connected determination that television shall document the great social factors of our own time. Over the years this has included the ageing of the western European population and the problems inherent in nuclear fission. These days it includes child sex abuse (this year's Canadian entry, The Boys Of St Vincent, illustrated this with a gripping drama typical of North American professionalism) and the emergence of third-world mega cities as global centres of industrial manufacturing, a subject superbly covered by the Danish entry, Battle Of The Titans. Above all there is now Aids, a subject treated by television with far more compassion than it has received in the press, though less objectivity, perhaps - an approach typified by Silverlake Life. Thirdly there is the conviction that television can and should be used for conveying works of art - plays, operas, ballets - to big audiences (La Sept of France gave us Kurt Weill's Seven Deadly Sins . . . again: what is this fixation exerted by the monotonous work of Weill over European intellectuals?); for exploring their construction (Denmark's Giselle used rehearsals by the Royal Danish Ballet to speak volumes about the process of dance); and to renew and popularise existing or forgotten material, a purpose achieved with extraordinary effectiveness by the BBC's Vampyr. One of the dangers of championing the Prix Italia if you are British is the suspicion that you are doing so because Britain has been uniquely successful at this event. Since 1959 when television programmes were introduced, 33 of the top prizes have been awarded to UK broadcasters. The second most successful nation has been France with 13, third is Sweden with 10, and equal fourth with seven each are Japan and the US. There are not many areas in which postwar Britain can claim to have been nearly five times as successful as Japan and the US but television programming - if you accept the judgment of the international juries at this, the most keenly contested of broadcasting festivals - is one. So there is a danger of hubris. But as so much of European television turns, with frightening rapidity, into a clone of its counterpart in the US, where commerce is all and ratings are the only criterion, we should risk accusations of special pleading and do all we can to encourage RAI, Italy's equivalent of the BBC, to keep the Prix Italia going. This year they put it on a life support system, holding the event at their own concert hall in Rome instead of the usual exotic resort. At a dinner held by Britain's independent broadcasters the retiring secretary-general, Piergiorgio Branzi, promised that the event would now go on, and members of the secretariat bravely declare that it has been saved 'forever'. Yet the recession and Italy's fraught politics show few signs of abating. Most dangerous of all is the attitude of philistine politicians, in all countries, who argue that public service broadcasters such as RAI and the BBC should merely fill in the gaps where satellite and cable operators cannot make a profit. It is the attitude of the showbiz huckster that the Prix Italia exists to resist. Today that resistance is more rare and vital than ever.</p>

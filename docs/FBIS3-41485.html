There has been a ban on  importing and producing asbestos since the beginning of this  year. When the new regulations go into effect, asbestos will be  permitted only in certain special cases.    Chief supervisor Kirsi Makela of the Labor Ministry's Worker  Protection Division said the Finnish regulations are stricter  than those in the European Union countries. According to the  European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, Finland has a right to  stand by its stricter rules.</p>

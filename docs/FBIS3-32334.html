			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace </F> and reconciliation in Chiapas; in San Cristobal de las Cases,  Chiapas State on 4 February; from the "24 Hours" newscast --  recorded]    [Text] Good evening. This is the public communique I am  sending to the command of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN]:    The de facto strategy, including messages, has yielded  fruits. Written communication, both public and confidential, has  been serious and has contributed to maintaining the cease-fire  and the gradual return to calm in the region.    I have received your confidential communication on holding  meetings for peace and reconciliation. I agree with your  proposal. In a confidential document I am answering your  questions on the final details.    The dialogue can begin:    1. The meeting will proceed based on the agenda we have  mutually accepted. I will listen to your points of view on  other issues of interest, knowing that national issues will not  be included in the resolutions.    2. Regarding the International Red Cross, I inform you that  the participation of this institution is based on the terms of  the formal request the International Red Cross made to the  Mexican Government. The position of the Mexican Government and  this institution is that the activities of the International Red  Cross in Mexico should be restricted to its strictly  humanitarian purpose and that they should not represent meddling  in the domestic affairs of the Mexican state.    3. The objective is an honorable peace. We have started  from the principle that peace must be secured while safeguarding  the full sovereignty of the Mexican people. All of us --  Congress, the political parties, society, the government, and  the churches -- have spoken in favor of a national solution to a  Mexican problem. There is no need for internationalizing this  conflict. We will have neutral space and offer the guarantees  you demand in your confidential document.    4. My tasks are clear: to propose to the government, based  on what you tell me, measures aimed at resolving, without gaps,  the situation. This is what I have been doing. I also have the  task of keeping the people informed and creating an awareness in  society that together with a solution to your demands should  contribute to the construction of peace.    5. The purpose of the dialogue is to find solutions. All of  us, as Mexicans who enjoy equal rights, can propose solutions.  This way we can make progress on the most difficult aspect of  all negotiations. We can create a framework of respect that will  facilitate the peace process.    I realize that needs that have been built-up for decades  cannot be resolved overnight, but I also know that progress can  be made by making big and honest efforts. We will march forward  as fast as you are ready to march.    6. I know that solutions to this conflict are complex, that  this is not a matter of simply increasing investments or  programs but of generating, with your participation, economic,  political, and social solutions that will allow the  establishment of a new relationship between the authorities and  the communities.    I am certain that the Indian communities you represent that  form part of the EZLN require a new kind of relationship with  the institutions of Chiapas and Mexican society.    The Mexican nation has the strength of its intrinsic  diversity and cultural wealth. My starting point is: respect  for the dignity of the Indian communities.    Thank you very much. You are very kind.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Army has categorically denied that its  commander in chief, Captain General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, is  traveling with a false passport "because he is traveling with an  official passport issued by the Chilean Government to public  authorities fulfilling official duties abroad." As for reports  that Pinochet had to hastily check out of a hotel in the  Netherlands, the Army stated through a communique that the  reports "are inaccurate" because the high-ranking official "has  fulfilled the scheduled itinerary without any changes."    The Army communique ends by stating that in Prague, capital  of the Czech Republic, Gen. Pinochet was received by Chilean  Ambassador Rolando Stein and the Omnipol Company president, who  held a reception in his honor. [passage omitted]</p>

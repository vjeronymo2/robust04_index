			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Hui-hsin (3769 1979 7451): "To Prevent the </F> Bubble Economy From Causing Drastic Price Rises, Beijing  Tightens Credits To Cool Down Overheated Real Estate Market"]    [Text] Despite the move to rectify the bubble economy  during July and December last year, the real estate investment  in mainland China has tended to become overheated again since  last November. Recently, the CPC Central Committee determinedly  adopted "cool down" measures with a view to slowing the pace of  real estate development, reducing fixed-asset investment, and  easing inflationary pressures. The State Council issued a  "red-letterhead document" at the end of last January, ordering  all localities to maintain effective control over real estate  investment, and to standardize and guide foreign investment in  China's real estate market. In addition to halting the  construction of "two courses" (racecourses and golf courses),  many projects for the construction of high-priced Western-style  houses, office buildings, and villas also have been suspended or  canceled.  <H3>  The Red-Letterhead Document Orders Rectification of the Real  Estate Market </H3>   Hong Kong investors are the "catalyst" to the mainland's  real  estate craze, and their investment has involved over 100 million  square meters of real estate. Therefore, this new upsurge of  macroeconomic control and regulation will have a considerable  impact on Hong Kong businessmen who invest in real estate and on  Hong Kong people who have brought residential housing on the  mainland.    Under the heading "Circular on Continuously Strengthening  Macroeconomic Control and Regulation of Fixed-Asset Investment,"  the red-letterhead document calls for efforts, in the present  situation marked by "overheated growth in investment and an  unduly large scale of construction," to bring the country's  fixed-asset investment (including commodity housing) into accord  with the government plan.    According to the red-letterhead document, a reduction in  real  estate investment and financing is the key task for the new  upsurge of macroeconomic control and regulation. All investment  and financing concerning real estate development and  foreign-related economic development zones will be brought under  the planning and control of the State Council and local  governments, and projects that are not listed in the state plan  cannot obtain bank financing. The Beijing authorities still  welcome foreign businessmen to invest in China's real estate  market, but the investment should be oriented toward the  ordinary residential housing urgently needed by common urban  dwellers. In another word, they should act in coordination with  the housing reform on the mainland, and should build more  commodity units that ordinary mainland residents can afford, not  high-priced Western-style houses, villas, and holiday resorts;  still less should they build racecourses or golf courses.    Before the red-letterhead document was relayed to the lower  levels, RENMIN RIBAO, the official newspaper of the CPC Central  Committee, carried a commentator's article entitled "Preventing  Blind Development in the Real Estate Industry." It noted: "At  present, the scale of basic construction remains considerably  great. Some localities, departments, and units have failed to  act according to relevant state regulations; some exceed their  examination and approval authority, while others act in their  own way and start new projects blindly. As a result, the real  estate market is tending to become overheated again, and the  situation is extremely unfavorable to our efforts to promote  national economic development and to check inflation."    One can easily see from the official CPC newspaper and the  red-letterhead document that failure to check the real estate  craze will lead to the same "grim economic situation" as in the  first half of last year. Although initial results were achieved  in rectifying the bubble economy and in checking speculation in  the stock, foreign exchange, and real estate markets during July  and October last year, the scale of fixed-asset investment still  remains unduly large, and 13 and 19.5 percent increases,  respectively, have been registered in the general level of  retail prices and in the retail commodity price index in 35  large and medium-sized cities. The drastic rises in commodity  prices inevitably will lead to resentment on the part of the  public, and are therefore unfavorable to maintaining social  stability. This serves as one of the major reasons why the CPC  is reemploying the "cool down" to check the real estate craze.  <H3>  The Cool Down Treatment Can Result in Optimizing the  Structure </H3>   Optimization of structure is another aim of the "cool down."    The so-called optimization of structure has a two-fold  definition: One is the "capital preference" in terms of  investment, and the other is the "supply readjustment  preference" within the real estate industry. The former refers  to the investment (including that made by Hong Kong and foreign  businessmen) in such basic industries as energy, communications,  transport, telecommunications, and agriculture. By so doing, we  can put an end to the present "bottleneck" situation, inject  more funds into technology-intensive and capital-intensive  industries, optimize the industrial structure of the national  economy as a whole, and prevent the bubble economy from exerting  adverse impact on social life.  <H3>  Commodity Prices Are Soaring, and the Gap Between the Rich  and the Poor Has Become Graphic </H3>   The "cool down" of real estate investment also is aimed at  maintaining social stability.    The excessive expansion of the real estate industry will  cause drastic rises in the prices of building materials, which  are already in short supply. Moreover, the supply capability of  communications, transport, and energy will be weakened; as a  result, they will fail to concentrate on the country's key  construction project, raise the prices and charges for  commodities and services, and bring about greater inflationary  pressure. Tightening control over real estate investment and  bank financing can help deter the further growth of commodity  prices. This is a component part of our efforts to maintain  social stability.    Another aim of the "cool down" is to prevent the gap between  the rich and the poor from becoming too wide. Businessmen from  Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries take possession of some  land; on it they build Western-style villas and high-priced  holiday resorts and houses for "rich households" on the  mainland, thus giving rise to "luxury housing districts."  However, most of the residents in these areas are still  "difficult households" or "packed households." The "difference"  between the luxurious and dilapidated houses of two social  stratums have made the gap between the rich and the poor too  "graphic," a fact that poor households cannot accept easily. In  addition, the excessive supply of high-grade residential housing  is also a waste of our resources. Therefore, applying a  appropriate brake is not only necessary, but is favorable to  maintaining social stability.    Since the Beijing authorities first used "the experience of  Hong Kong" for reference in reforming its land system and put  into trial practice the system of "separating two powers" in the  mid 1980's, experiments have been made with sales of land use  rights in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and large areas of land have  been leased or sold in all parts of the country. As a result,  the country has attained rapid growth in its real estate  industry, the scale of investment is expanding constantly, and  Hong Kong and foreign businessmen have become more involved in  real estate development on the mainland.    The Ministry of Construction under the State Council has  revealed the annual growth rate of real estate investment during  the "period of above-norm development" of the 1990's:    The investment amount in 1991 totalled 31.6 billion yuan, up  by 32 percent over the previous year.    The total investment amount reached 90 billion yuan in 1992,  registering an increase of about 170 percent.    The estimated investment amount exceeded 100 billion yuan in  1993, with a growth rate of about 13 percent.    The unduly rapid growth in real estate investment has put  tremendous pressure on bank financing, building materials, and  commodity prices, thus giving rise to a situation wherein demand  exceeds supply. Under such circumstances, the "cool down" can  help bring about "healthy development" in the real estate  industry.    At present, the Beijing authorities have tightened bank  financing and have ordered the abandonment of a large number of  construction projects. This move will not only drive many  small-scale Hong Kong real estate developers into a tight  corner, but also will subject those who want to gain profits  from their property mainland investment to the effects of a  stagnant market and land devaluation, and force them to face a  series of problems that cannot be solved easily.</p>

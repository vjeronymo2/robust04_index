			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The vicissitudes of  lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau have been reflecting climatic  and environmental changes since ancient times.    This conclusion was drawn by a team of Chinese geologists  who  recently completed extensive scientific studies on this highest  plateau in the world, situated in western China.    The geologists found that the bulging movement of the  plateau  has had a great influence on the change of water level of the  lakes.    For example, Qinghai lake was a shallow saltwater lake only  ten m deep in its early stages. At one time, the level was 20 m  higher than the present level.    The dropping of the water level started only 3,000 years  ago,  and the change of lake water temperature began 2,500 years ago.    By way of satellite reconnaissance the scientists discovered  that the alternations of time, geological region and climatic  conditions all produce changes in the lake.</p>

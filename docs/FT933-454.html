			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Patten attacks 'duff' schools MR JOHN Patten, education secretary, said yesterday that he had a list of several hundred 'duff' schools - mostly in inner cities - where the march of reform was being 'debauched'. Mr Patten said he was considering replacing local authority control of the schools with management teams called 'educational associations'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the issue of educational associations could become a 'battlefield' for the next few years. Mr Patten said: 'There are clusters of schools who I think are short-changing pupils horribly. 'The march of reform is being debauched in those areas. There will be action after January 1.' Speaking to business leaders at the launch of Education in Industry, he said that he would act on the advice of inspectors who are reviewing the schools. He refused to name them, but said most were in inner cities with concentrations in a few London boroughs. Teachers' union leaders said the comments suggested that educational associations would be used to force more schools into opting out of local education authority control. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said that Mr Patten's new power 'had always been justified as a last-resort measure'. He said Mr Patten would need to have the 'firmest evidence' before sending in educational associations to remedy a problem. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, described the remarks as insulting and unhelpful, adding that they did not help the situation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The United  Nations will open a key bridge in Sarajevo on Monday [28  February] "for UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) vehicles and  pedestrians," said a U.N. spokesman.    The opening of the bridge of "brotherhood and unity" will  for  the first time link the Muslim-dominated inner-city area with  the part held by the Serbs in Sarajevo since the Bosnian capital  came under siege in April 1992.    "Both sides have agreed to the opening" beginning Monday  noon, Spokesman Rob Annink said.    The bridge, now cleared of mines, will be guarded by UN  peacekeepers and Muslim and Serb troops, with access to the  bridge controlled by Muslims and Serbs separately on each side.    The bridge was once a no-man's land between the front-line  Muslim and Serb forces and thus split Sarajevo into two parts.  Its opening is the first step to restore peace to the city  under a plan proposed by Michael Rose, commander of the UN  peacekeeping force in Bosnia.    Rose said his next step is to open routes between Muslim and  Serb-controlled neighborhoods along with the roads in and out of  the city.    Meanwhile, the passage connecting Sarajevo with the outside  will also be open on Monday, Annink announced today.    Reports reaching here said that a UN humanitarian relief  convoy will be heading for Sarajevo tomorrow via Muslim, Serb  and Croat-held areas, with passage permit from the warring  factions no longer necessary.    Under Rose's order, the convoy will be escorted by UN  troops,  and the aircraft of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will  provide air cover and resort to "necessary military means" if it  is intercepted.</p>

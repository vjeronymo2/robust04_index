			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Win some . . . - Charities THERE is at least one sense in which this was a 'giveaway' Budget: the chancellor made it slightly easier to give to charity. However, as the most important measures then failed to appear in the Finance Act, he has shown that what can be given can be taken away. Measures for charities must now be regarded as plans only, to be enacted if the Conservatives are re-elected. But if you want to give money to charity tax-free, and would rather not do so through a regular covenant, it is worth being reminded of the gift aid regulations. At present, you must give Pounds 600 to a registered charity before qualifying for gift aid relief. The Budget proposals did not reach the Finance Act but, if passed in due course, this limit would be reduced to Pounds 400 from July 1, which should bring the scheme within the comfortable reach of many more people. Under the proposals, gifts to charitable groups would be treated as net of basic-rate tax. In other words, a Pounds 400 donation would be viewed as if you had paid Pounds 533.33; the charity could then claim tax relief at 25 per cent (Pounds 133.33). Top-rate taxpayers could reclaim for themselves the 15 per cent difference (Pounds 79.99) between basic and top rates. So, a top-rate taxpayer could give Pounds 533.33 to charity for a net outlay of Pounds 320.01. Charities are happy that the limit could come down, as this should increase donations. A Pounds 400 limit would still be sufficiently high not to deter donations made by covenant. Michael Brophy, director of the Charities Aid Foundation, said: 'The reduction in the minimum limit for gift aid payments will lead to a substantial increase in the number of people able to use this scheme. We estimate that the effect will be to increase donations under gift aid from the present level of Pounds 200m per year to something in excess of Pounds 300m - a net gain of at least Pounds 100m to charities.'</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (5): Deep hole of over-supply - Property market and bad debt provisions or a change in market prospects. This spring, just when Wall Street investors had convinced themselves it was safe to begin building up their shareholdings in major bank stocks, the world's biggest property developer began filing for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the US. The parlous state of Olympia &amp; York has sent a shiver through the US commercial property market. It has also reminded investors that some of the very US commercial banks that had been deemed to be on the recovery path might still face substantial bad debt provisions and loan write-offs from their property loan portfolios. In the same week last month that saw Olympia &amp; York place its Canary Wharf project into administration in London, a couple of gloomy analyst reports in New York warned that bankers might yet suffer more pain from the continuing US commercial property slump. The commercial property team at Salomon Brothers in New York said the stage was set for 'a modest, but painful recovery' in the US office market. But noting that the market presently faced a glut of supply equal to 12 years of available office space, Salomon argued that the property market 'is so deep in the hole of over-supply that it will take many years to climb out'. If there were any doubts as to the possible implications of this gloomy outlook, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, spelt out the bad news. Calling the Olympia &amp; York bankruptcy filings 'a vivid confirmation' that property markets had not truly begun to recover or stabilise, S&amp;P warned that the problem loan work-out period would be protracted and that the losses for banks would 'have a long tail, reaching substantially higher levels than they have to date'. Ms Tanya Azarchs, the S&amp;P banking analyst, declared that bad debt provisions as of late May were not yet adequate to cover expected losses on property loan portfolios at many banks in the US. She added that while additional reserve requirements generally appeared to be manageable, the overhang of losses would continue to be a significant drain on banking sector earnings over the next few years. This situation, S&amp;P explained, would probably delay ratings increases for many in the banking industry. That, in turn, could hamper the ability of some US banks to raise cash by way of new securities offerings, especially if such lower-rated banks were competing on the world capital markets against higher-rated foreign banks such as Deutsche Bank, the German powerhouse. The S&amp;P analysis was termed over-pessimistic by some, but it came less than three months after the top executives at Citicorp, Chemical and Chase Manhattan all said they expected their 1992 bad debt provisions to be at about the same levels as last year, mainly because of the depressed US commercial property sector. By the middle of April, as a number of banks reported a recovery in first quarter earnings, market sentiment became somewhat more bullish again. After all, the Federal Reserve had acted to lower interest rates and to ease the reserve requirements in order to help banks strengthen capital ratios. But the message from the property market in recent weeks has been that the situation could deteriorate again. Mr George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities, recently recommended that investors sell their stock in BankAmerica, Wells Fargo, Citicorp and First Chicago; in each case Mr Salem's concerns about commercial property loan losses was a motivating factor. Mr David Shulman, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, went even further than Standard &amp; Poor's: 'I don't think the reserves for non-performing commercial real estate assets are sufficient at many banks. I think eventual write-offs at some institutions could range between 30 and 50 per cent of the outstandings.' Yet investors on the New York Stock Exchange have been returning to bank shares at a consistent pace in recent months, assuming the worst is over and buying stock at reduced prices. But Mr Shulman says: 'The stock market is viewing the property issue as last year's problem. I think the stock market has got it wrong.' Commercial property loan exposure is the single most important issue that could influence the earnings and stock market performances of US banks. And there are a series of other factors that will be watched closely in coming months. Congress failed last year to approve bank reform legislation that would allow interstate branching, a move that could help reduce administrative overheads and other costs. But few expect such legislation to come up for consideration until after November's presidential election. The infamous 'credit crunch' - the period over the past 18 months during which bankers have been accused of refusing to make many new loans to commerce and industry - seems to be over. But loan demand remains extremely weak in many parts of the US. Healthy demand for loans may not return until much later in the economic recovery cycle. Mergers between sizeable institutions got under way in earnest last year, with three big combinations - BankAmerica and Security Pacific, Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank and NCNB and C &amp; S/Sovran  - helping to consolidate the industry. This year has seen a rash of smaller deals, including two Dollars 1bn takeovers by regional banks such as Banc One of Ohio and Barnett of Florida. But the industry still needs more mergers if it is to continue to rationalise across the national market. Capital ratios, which were criticised by regulators two years ago as being inadequate at many banks, are being strengthened, with some exceptions. But more big property loan write-offs could affect the speed with which banks carry on bolstering their capital bases. Looking ahead, it appears that the US commercial banking industry may slog through a problematic 1992. The worst of the industry's crisis may well be over, but there is still the prospect of unpleasant surprises.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            THE LEADING US BANKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          Non-                                                       performing                                  non-    US Commercial   real     Loan               Total     Total  performing    real       estate    loss               assets    loans    loans   estate loans   loans  provision  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Dollars   Dollars   Dollars   Dollars    Dollars   Dollars Citicorp      216.9bn  147.64bn    7.45bn     12bn      4.86bn   3,890m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Dollars   Dollars   Dollars   Dollars    Dollars   Dollars Chemical*     138.9bn   84.24bn    6.16bn    8.8bn      2.32bn   1,345m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Dollars   Dollars   Dollars   Dollars    Dollars   Dollars Bank America** 115.5bn  86.37bn    3.08bn    9.1bn      1.42bn     805m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Dollars  Dollars   Dollars   Dollars    Dollars   Dollars Nationsbank*** 110.3bn   69.11bn  2.8  bn    5.94bn      na    1,582m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Dollars   Dollars   Dollars   Dollars    Dollars   Dollars J P Morgan     103.5bn   27.8bn    0.64bn    0.41bn      na       40m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Dollars   Dollars   Dollars   Dollars    Dollars   Dollars Chase  Manhattan     98.2bn  67.79bn    4.35bn    8.6bn      3.37bn    1,085m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Figures have been restated to show combined data for Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover. **BankAmerica and Security Pacific have not stated pro-forma 1991 results.

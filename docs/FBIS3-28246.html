			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Health and Welfare Minister  Keigo Ouchi said Friday [4 February] the cabinet of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has scored a "minus point" because  the ruling coalition renounced a package of tax cuts and  increases.    Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP),  told  reporters the cabinet "must submit itself to criticism." But  Ouchi said "the minus point is not so large" as to justify talk  of whether or not the prime minister should take political  responsibility," a term used to imply resignation.    Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro  Ishida, who heads Komeito, said discussions were insufficient  before deciding the tax plan.    Ishida indicated he does not support a proposal to use the 7  percent "National Welfare Tax" solely for welfare, saying that  it is difficult to limit its use because revenues from the  proposed tax are large. He said welfare concerns every aspect  of national life from medical treatment to pensions and housing.    Science and Technology Agency Director General Satsuki Eda  told a news conference that now is the time to tackle the  problem of how to boost the national economy but cautioned  against seeking a solution on tax reform in a hasty manner.    Eda, leader of a minor political party, the United Social  Democratic Party (USDP), declined to comment on reports that  some party members have called for Eda's resignation as a  cabinet member.    Eda said, "the prime minister's proposal is crudely put as a  decision but is worth considering."    Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said  he will take the blame for a major political crisis that stemmed  from Hosokawa's tax reform plan announcement.    Hata said the Finance Ministry only helped the coalition  work  out the new tax plan.    In an early Thursday morning news conference, Hosokawa  announced a decision to cut 6 trillion yen in taxes. As a  revenue source, the prime minister proposed scrapping the  present 3 percent consumption tax and instead imposing a 7  percent "National Welfare Tax" in April 1997.    Hosokawa's announcement angered the Social Democratic Party,  the largest of the seven parties in the coalition, which  threatened to quit the alliance, throwing the political world  into turmoil.    On Friday, leaders of the coalition parties announced they  would renounce the tax plan to avert a possible collapse of the  Hosokawa cabinet.</p>

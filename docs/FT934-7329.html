			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Divisions over Ulster exposed by Dublin leak THE GAP between the British and Irish governments over the shape of a constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland was underlined yesterday by a document setting out Dublin's terms. A draft position paper leaked to an Irish newspaper confirmed Dublin's intention to drop its territorial claim over Northern Ireland and acknowledged there could be no change in the province's status without the consent of a majority of the population. But in return it sought British acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the goal of Irish unity 'by agreement' and consent to a marked extension of Dublin's role in the province. This would be exercised through a strengthened Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference and new north-south institutions with executive powers. The leak  - coming just a day after Mr John Major, the prime minister, reinforced his personal commitment to a settlement  - embarrassed the Irish government and annoyed Downing Street. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, quickly disassociated himself from the paper, whose authenticity was confirmed by the Irish foreign ministry. Mr Reynolds said no such document had been presented to the Dublin government. The paper had 'no connection whatso-ever' with the peace initiative. Neither Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, nor Downing Street would comment yesterday on the substance of the document. But the interventionist tone of some proposals would almost certainly be unacceptable to London. There also seems little prospect of Downing Street agreeing to an inter-governmental body with powers as wide-ranging as Dublin envisages or to entrust the proposed north-south institutions with developing an integrated approach to the European Union. Unionists were yesterday already balking at the paper's emphasis on 'enhancing' the co-operative structures of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Mr Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, said it was 'presumptuous' for Dublin to take such a 'divisive' approach to a delicate problem. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said: 'We are moving to Mark Two of the Anglo-Irish agreement.' The two governments did not want to 'consult the people' at all. 'Until we deal with Articles 2 and 3 (of the Irish constitution which lay claim to Northern Ireland) there can be no progress.' Sir Patrick said the paper was 'not a document we have received' and it would be futile for him to speculate on it. The Northern Ireland secretary met briefly with Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, at a conference in Londonderry. Mr Hume said he would shortly meet Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, to brief him on his recent talks with Mr Major.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Giles Hewitt] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 9 (AFP)--Leading Chinese dissident  Bao Ge was picked up by police Saturday morning from his home in  Shanghai, a dissident source said, announcing the fifth  detention of a pro-democracy campaigner in China in eight days.    Bao was seized just 12 hours after the arrest of another  prominent activist in the city, as French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, whose country has a record for championing human  rights, arrived in Shanghai.    "Eight policemen took him away this morning at 9:10 a.m.  (0110 GMT)," Bao's father said by telephone, adding that the  police had given no reason for the arrest.    "When (Bao) asked them to produce some arrest papers, they  simply said they didn't need any," he said.    Bao was taken to a local police station, the father said,  adding that he hoped his son would be released within 24 hours.    The latest detention followed the arrest Friday evening of  the secretary general of the Shanghai-based Chinese Human Rights  Association, Wang Fucheng.    "It looks as if this is the start of a major crackdown on  dissidents," said the association's spokesman Yang Zhou, who was  himself detained and questioned by police twice last month.    Since April 1, three other members of China's pro-democracy  and human rights campaign have been detained -- Wei Jingsheng,  43, and Xu Wenli, 49, who came to fame for their activism in the  late 1970s and were released last year after long jail terms,  and Wei's secretary, Tong Yi.    Wei is officially under investigation for purported "new  crimes." The ministry of public security and the Beijing police  denied Saturday any knowledge of Xu's detention.    Yang, also contacted by telephone, said Wang had not yet  been  released.    Bao, 31, who recently sent a letter urging the Chinese  government to push Tokyo into paying reparations for atrocities  committed during the 1937-45 Sino-Japanese war, had previously  been detained March 21 during the visit to Shanghai by Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Wang Fucheng, a 30-year-old entrepreneur, spent three years  in jail for "counter-revolutionary" activities during the  1978-79 Democracy Wall Movement.    He had previously been held for three days in mid-March  during a police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai.    Balladur, meanwhile, arrived in Shanghai on the third day of  a four-day official visit aimed at repairing ties with China  that were damaged two years ago when France sold Mirage  fighter-bombers to Taiwan, Beijing's rival.    China has systematically rounded up dissidents during visits  by VIPs, in an apparent attempt to thwart embarrassing contacts.    Similar steps to harass or detain activists were taken  during  visits to China last month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and the Japanese premier.</p>

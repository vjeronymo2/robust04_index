			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's reviews Credit Suisse MOODY's Investors Service, yesterday remained the only leading credit rating agency to put Credit Suisse under review following the announcement earlier in the week of its agreed bid for Swiss Volksbank. Standard &amp; Poor's is expected to decide today whether to follow suit. Moody's rating of the giant Swiss bank is already out of line with other agencies. It downgraded Credit Suisse to AA1 last year, while S&amp;P and IBCA, the European agency, both continue to accord the bank their top AAA ratings. Any further downgrade by Moody's would put the bank in the even more unusual position of having split ratings which were two notches apart on the ratings scale. Moody's said its review, which affects Dollars 2.3bn of debt, was prompted by concerns over the effect the takeover of Volksbank would have on Credit Suisse's asset quality, core profitability and market position in Switzerland. At the same time, Volksbank's short-term P2 rating has been put under review for a possible upgrade. Credit Suisse reacted coolly to the news yesterday. 'That we have been put on the watch list is regrettable. But we cannot set our long-term strategies according to the short-term views of the rating agencies,' said Mr Josef Ackermann, chief executive designate of Credit Suisse. S&amp;P said that its Europe and US-based analysts were likely to take a view today on whether to put the bank on the watchlist. European Options Exchange, the Dutch options market, expects a 1992 net profit of at least Fl 16m, compared with Fl 19.8m profit in 1991, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. Mr Tjerk Westerterp, president, said 1992 volume rose by almost 2 per cent to 11.3m traded contracts, which was better than originally forecast.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Northern League Absent As Liberal </F> Democrat Pole Forged"]    [Text] Rome, 1 Feb (ANSA) -- [Northern League Secretary]  Umberto Bossi was conspicuous by his absence when Rooting for  Italy [Forza Italia] chief Silvio Berlusconi forged a liberal  democratic alliance with the Democratic Christian Centre and  Centre Union Tuesday [1 February].    In a meeting in Berlusconi's Rome home, representatives from  the three right-of-centre groups reached full agreement on a  programme for the winning alliance in March 27 elections.    According to Berlusconi, talks focussed on "politics and  programmes." "I explained to them what I consider to be the  right and proper solutions for Italy's problems, and I am happy  to say that they were unanimously approved," said Berlusconi,  owner of the Fininvest broadcasting-to-construction conglomerate.    Also present for today's meeting were Francesco D'Onofrio,  Pierferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella of the Democratic  Christian Centre, and Alfredo Biondi of the Centre Union.    The Democratic Christian Centre was formed two weeks ago by  right-wingers splitting from the Christian Democratic Party when  it renamed itself the People's Party [Italian Popular Party],  while the Centre Union is made up of ex-members of the Liberal  and Social Democrat parties.    Widely tipped to enter into an agreement with the  right-of-centre alliance are the separatist Northern League and  the National Alliance [NA], the renamed neofascist Italian  Social Movement, neither of which were represented at today's  talks. A partnership with the National Alliance was not ruled  out by Clemente Mastella, who told journalists later that "we  must give careful consideration to the National Alliance, which  is a different thing from the Italian Social Movement. It is  important that we avoid prejudice. With goodwill and generosity  agreement is possible. We must show that we are able to make  sacrifices for the good of the country."    An outburst, Monday, by League chief Bossi, who said that he  would have nothing to do with "fascists" or with anyone who  struck deals with them, was brushed aside by Berlusconi today:  "I have my own way of doing politics," he told the press. "We  have had enough of empty words and quips. I have no intention of  responding to off-hand comments like that." Berlusconi was also  quoted as saying that Bossi could not go on thinking that Milan  was his own private hunting reserve.    Francesco D'Onofrio stressed that the federalist movement  would now have to enter a right-wing alliance on the terms of  the parties already involved: "We have reached an agreement,  and it is a sound one," he said. "We found no sticking points  over our political programme, and now we just have to see to  putting it into practise. The League must be aware that we are  the nucleus of the liberal democratic pole, that we are united  and strong."</p>

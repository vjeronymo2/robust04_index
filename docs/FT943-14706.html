			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Observer: Not in the club Surely there are enough professional bodies of accountants in the UK? The DTI obviously thinks not for it has just announced that members of the Gateshead- based Association of International Accountants are now authorised to carry out audits. No doubt, concern about spreading the cake too thinly is at the root of the dismissive noises coming from rivals. Perhaps they should not worry too much. The AIA's own auditor, Francis Hoogewerf who is a member of the AIA, has decided not to apply to be registered under the new auditing regulations in the UK. He has therefore had to be replaced by a firm of chartered accountants, BDO Binder Hamlyn.</p>

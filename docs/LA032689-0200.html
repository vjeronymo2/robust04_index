			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPRING STORM CAUSES ONLY A FEW PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The first spring storm to hit the Southland, dropping less than half an inch of  rain in most of Orange County, was enough to dampen the spirits of hundreds of  youngsters ready for the annual Easter Fair at Garden Grove Park in Garden  Grove.  </P> <P> The fair had to rescheduled to a new date, which will be announced later, City  Manager George Tindall said.  </P> <P> The rain also caused a few minor accidents in the county, but nothing as  serious as most police agencies had expected.  </P> <P> "Usually a rain like this, we'll have about a dozen fender benders," said  Placentia police spokesman David Taylor.  </P> <P> "Today we didn't have a single one. Very unusual, but we were happy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Varies Around County  </P> <P> The rain was twice as heavy in parts of south Orange County than in the north  and central sections.  </P> <P> At 7 p.m., San Juan Capistrano had received 0.82 of an inch of rain, the  National Weather Service reported, in comparison to less than half an inch in  most of the county.  </P> <P> "It was funny weather," said one San Clemente police spokesman. "I left home in  Laguna Hills where there wasn't a drop. Then I drive to work and hit a hell of  a rain."  </P> <P> The rainy weather brought cooler-than-average temperatures to the county, with  the high in Santa Ana at 64 degrees and the high along the coast at 60. Winds  in Newport Beach were reported Saturday evening at 15 m.p.h., and the evening  temperatures along the coast dropped to the low 50s.  </P> <P> In other incidents, the weather was blamed for a mudslide at 9:30 a.m. Saturday  in Los Angeles County that temporarily blocked one lane of the Long Beach  Freeway near Lakewood. It also caused a downed power line that left 1,600  people on Los Angeles' Koreatown area and 800 in Encino without electricity for  part of the day.  </P></p>

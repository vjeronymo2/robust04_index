			<p>Language: <F P=105>Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia has concluded an agreement with the Baltic  countries on supplying gas in 1994 on mutually advantageous  conditions. Lentransgas Director General Radionov announced  this to journalists today. He was a member of the delegation  from the Rossiyskiy Gaz joint-stock company which has just  completed a trip to the Baltics. As its participants noted, the  disagreements which arose last year between Russia on the one  hand and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on the other because of  irregular payments for gas consumption have completely  disappeared. Having received credits from the West, the Baltic  countries have covered all their debts. Lithuania is the  exception and has undertaken to remit $5 million by 15 March.  The price of gas is set according to average European prices,  which is about $80 per thousand cubic meters.    The agreement on gas supplies which has been signed means a  significant influx of hard curency to the budgets of St.  Petersburg and the oblast, over the territory of which the gas  is transported to the Baltic.</p>

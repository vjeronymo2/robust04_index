			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" report by Sinisa Lepojevic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (TANJUG) -- Judging by the facts  of the real life and the war reality, the Moslem-Croat  confederation in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, under discussion in Washington for the past  three days, will be practically impossible to achieve.    Well-informed sources and diplomats are aware of that, as  are  most probably its initiators in Washington, and by doing so they  are consciously drawing Bosnia further away from peace and an  end of the war. The idea is basically also directed against the  interests of the Bosnian Moslems.    The ten-month war between the Bosnian Moslems and Croats has  reached such horrible proportions that its cruelty surpasses all  previous wars and has broken up all alliances between these two  peoples, i.e. their political leaders. The key issue is central  Bosnia, the scene of fierce battles between the Moslems and  Croats over control of mixed territories and arms factories.    This part of Bosnia is the essence of life of the Bosnian  Croats in that ex-Yugoslav republic. It was inhabited by over  400,000 Croats, 200,000 of whom fled before the clashes with the  Moslems, while the death toll remains unknown.    The worst Moslem atrocities against the civilians were  committed in this region, while the Bosnian Croat forces (HVO)  carried out massacres over the Moslems, especially in the area  of Vares, Vitez, Gornji Vakuf and Prozor.    The Bosnian Croats have demolished Mostar which, after the  Serbs were forced to leave, became a predominantly Moslem town.  One wonders if a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia is possible  from that viewpoint.    The fact remains that the idea for a federation comes from  abroad and that the negotiatiors are under terrible pressure.  Regardless of the outcome, these talks represent the defeat of  the policy of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and his party,  the Croatian Democratic Union (H.D.Z.). One should recall that  the major disputes in [word indistinct] occured over central  Bosnia, which is now virtually lost because a federation implies  the maintaining of actual state of affairs. [as received]    This discord within HDZ was stemmed from the insistence of  the Bosnian branch of H.D.Z. on maintaining central Bosnia as a  "basis" of Croat population, while western Herzegovina, in which  Zagreb was mainly interested, was "ethnically clean" even before  the start of the war and had very loose links with Sarajevo.    The United States' excuse that this kind of federation would  solve the problem of the Moslem access to the sea is also  invalid, because part of the coast of former Bosnia-Herzegovina  has been ethnically clean, i.e. Croat-populated, for a long time.    Simultaneously, the urging of a new federation by the United  States, former defender of the Bosnian Moslems, proves that the  Moslems are the winners in the war with the Croats, and are thus  in a superior position.    On the other hand, the United States, which until now has  undermined all peace efforts by insisting on a so-called intact  Bosnia-Herzegovina, now admits that division is inevitable.  This represents a defeat of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic, if he is the one who makes any decisions at all.    This only proves that the Bosnian Serbs were right in  insisting that it [words indistinct] who in fact does not want a  Bosnian Moslem state.    Furthermore, it is unclear what will happen to the  autonomous  province of Western Bosnia, Moslem enclave in northwest Bosnia.  Judging by the current state of affairs, if a Moslem-Croat  federation came to life, this part of Bosnia called Cazinska  Krajina would very likely become autonomous within the Bosnian  Serb republic.    The question is what could this federation mean for the  Bosnian Serbs. [words indistinct] ways for its setting up  primarily recognize the sovereignty and independence of the  Bosnian Serbs within Bosnia- Herzegovina.    On the other hand, if such a community was a threat to  Bosnian Serb interests and could provoke yet another [words  indistinct] major Croat-Serb clashes would be bound to happen,  and concerning the latest Russian initiatives in the Balkans,  the fighting could have tragic consequences primarily for  Europe, as well as for the whole world.    Regardless of what led the United States to insist on this  idea, its realization certainly does not accept reality and the  actual state of the affairs, and simultaneously draws  Bosnia-Herzegovina away from the much desired peace.</p>

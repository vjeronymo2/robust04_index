			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures slip SHORT-DATED sterling futures slipped sharply yesterday as the pound plunged to a new historic low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. The pound's weakness damped earlier speculation that the UK authorities would cut interest rates at or before next month's budget. The March short sterling contract fell 14 basis points to a low of 93.94 before closing at 93.95. At this level, it effectively assumes that base rates will be unchanged at 6 per cent immediately after the budget. The June contract was also badly hit, falling 17 basis points to a close of 94.47. At this level, it assumes that base rates will be cut by around 50 basis points by the summer, although the market assumes that this will be the only policy easing in this cycle. Dealers easily removed a large shortage of Pounds 2.15bn forecast by the Bank of England yesterday, another indication that there are no expectations of a rate cut in the short term. The easier monetary conditions helped the slight easing in the cost of 3-month money from 6 3/16 per cent to 6 1/8 per cent on the offered side. In European markets, the mood was a good deal more tense, partly because of the release of poor inflation figures in Germany. In North Rhine Westpahalia, the cost of living rose of 0.4 per cent in the month to mid-February, a greater increase than the market had anticipated. The Bundesbank did not help matters by keeping conditions relatively tight and draining a net DM7.4bn from the banking system in this week's tender for securities repurchase funds. Banks quoted call money at around 8.65 per cent, little changed from the previous day. Thre-month money closed at 8.31 per cent. The March Euromark contract continued its fall of recent days, closing 1 basis point down on the day at 91.85. The March French franc was even weaker, closing 12 basis points down on the day at a new record low of 88.18. The June contract closed 28 basis points down at 90.68. Both Spanish and Danish money market interest rates remained high as their currencies came under pressure in the European exchange rate mechanism. By the close of trading yesterday, 3-month Danish krone were being quoted as high as 22 per cent, while 1-month pesetas were slightly easier on the day at around 18 per cent.</p>

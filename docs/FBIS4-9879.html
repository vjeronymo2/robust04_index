			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special report from Montevideo by correspondent Roberto </F> Cavada -- live or recorded]    [Text] At the end of the first talks held this Monday  afternoon with Uruguayan Central Bank Director Enrique Braga,  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said Uruguay is willing  to not freeze the Cuban debt to Uruguay and to look for  solutions favorable to both countries. On this matter, the Cuban  foreign minister told this station the following:    [Begin Robaina recording] I think the main objective is not  to submit a concrete proposal on how or with what to pay the  foreign debt. Cuba does not have what is in fact needed to pay  the debt as far as money is concerned, but we are surely willing  to try to find a solution and to sit at a negotiating table to  discuss all possibilities. We can establish what Cuba needs and  the investment possibilities for Uruguay. Some Cuban products  could be useful to Uruguay, so these products can contribute to  solving this problem.    The important thing is that a Cuban delegation headed by the  Cuban Central Bank president will arrive here soon, and they  have the decision-making power to choose the options to solve  this debt problem. [end recording]    The Cuban foreign minister met previously with Uruguayan  President Luis Alberto Lacalle. They exchanged ideas on the  forthcoming Ibero-American Summit to be held in Colombia,  transformations in the economic area taking place in Cuba, and  preparations for the emigre conference that will take place by  the end of this month, among other subjects.    Robaina's agenda, which is certainly tight, included a  meeting with Liber Seregni, president of the Broad Front; an  interesting meeting with the Uruguayan Congress foreign  relations committee, at which the Cuban foreign minister  explained the true situation in Cuba; a meeting with Cuban  residents in Uruguay; and another meeting with Uruguayan  intellectuals.    According to a Cuban delegation spokesman, Tuesday's agenda  contemplates the beginning of talks at the Foreign Ministry  level, a meeting with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu,  contacts with several television networks from Montevideo and  the most important national newspapers, like EL OBSERVADOR  ECONOMICO.</p>

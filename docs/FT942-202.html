			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / IFS study highlights toils of low paid Patrick, a 37-year-old divorcee, takes home Pounds 157 for an average 60-hour week as a security guard at a central London office. He is one of those whose position was highlighted yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said the gap between those who earn the most and those who earn the least is at its highest this century and that the lowest earners earn less than they did in 1975 in real terms. Earning Pounds 4.16 an hour for a 12 hour day, Patrick says he is well paid for a security guard - he knows some in the south-east on as little as Pounds 3 an hour. But he receives no sickness benefits and no pension, and has 15 days holiday a year. Holiday pay is given after the holiday period. 'The company wants to make sure you come back,' he says. 'It is the young married blokes that get hurt most by this job,' he says. 'They have to put in hours and hours of overtime to make a living wage. There are so many divorces because the hours are very anti-social.' Patrick's shift pattern is punishing. He works seven days on, five days off, followed by seven nights on and three days off. 'It is not possible to have a social life,' he says. Patrick left school with no qualifications. He sees no career progression in his present job and says he sees no point in trying to get any qualifications. 'Look at all those graduates and skilled people on the dole,' he says. 'Why bother?'</p>

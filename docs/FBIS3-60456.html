Deputy Health Minister Hoseyn Malek Afzali said 60 percent  of  the people who caught AIDS in 1992 were exposed to the virus  through sexual intercourse.    He said 269 people were known to have caught the disease in  Iran, of whom 62 people had died and 85 had developed full-blown  AIDS.    However, the number of Iranians infected with the virus  could  be as high as 5,000 nationwide, Afzali said.    Although the subject of sex is considered taboo in Iran the  government has stepped up a campaign to prevent the spread of  the disease.    The authorities launched an AIDS awareness campaign two  years  ago and the use of condoms is allowed, although sex before  marriage is forbidden.</p>

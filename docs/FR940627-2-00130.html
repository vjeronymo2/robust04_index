At such time that the hazard is determined to no longer exist or to be significantly reduced, the Commission may reduce the amount of primary financial protection and permit the licensee to withdraw from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the legislative history of the Price-Anderson Act does not explicitly consider the potential hazards that might exist after termination of operation, the staff generically evaluated the offsite consequences associated with normal and abnormal operations, design basis accidents, and beyond design basis accidents for reactors that have been permanently defueled and shut down. The staff concluded that where an appropriate cooling time has elapsed since plant shutdown, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of spent fuel and radioactive materials, no reasonably conceivable potential accident exists that could cause significant offsite damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As summarized in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, a severe transportation accident could potentially result in local contamination requiring cleanup and offsite liabilities resulting from traffic disruption and consequential damages. This type of accident would warrant maintaining some level of liability insurance. The liabilities an indemnification requirements associated with the transfer of spent fuel from the licensee to the Department of Energy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis at a future time when spent fuel is shipped to a repository. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As further set forth in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, the most significant accident sequence for a permanently defueled and shutdown reactor involves the complete loss of water from a light water reactor spent fuel pool. This beyond-design-basis accident sequence could result in a zirconium fuel cladding fire that could propagate through the spent fuel storage pool and result in significant offsite consequences. The potential consequences of such an accident could involve billions of dollars. Although such an accident is beyond the design bases, it may be considered ``reasonably conceivable'' and could warrant requiring substantial financial protection. Such an accident is possible during the first year after reactor shutdown for a low density spent fuel storage configuration and during the first two or three years after shutdown for spent fuel stored in certain high density configurations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accident scenarios involving blockage of coolant channels in conjunction with loss of spent fuel pool water could hypothetically extend the time within which a zirconium fuel cladding fire could occur. However, in addition to being less likely than loss of water, air flow to react with the zirconium and to disperse fission products would likely be inhibited by such blockage. The staff believes that this sequence approaches the strictly hypothetical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the requisite cooling period after reactor shutdown has elapsed, the zirconium fuel cladding fire sequence after a postulated loss of spent fuel pool water is no longer a concern since the fuel would air cool sufficiently to avoid zirconium fuel cladding combustion. Possible accident scenarios, after these cooling period have elapsed, have greatly reduced consequences but could still result in small releases or precautionary evacuations which could result in offsite liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

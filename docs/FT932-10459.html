			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Banesto tumbles after first-term provisions BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank which earlier this week unwrapped a Pta130bn (Dollars 1.1bn) capital increase, announced yesterday that first-quarter pre-tax profits had almost disappeared following large provisions, Reuter reports from Madrid. The group reported a pre-tax profit of Pta808m, down from Pta17.23bn in the first quarter of 1992. The bank said that its profits had been distorted by the sale of Banco de Madrid to Deutsche Bank of Germany in March. Banesto said it had used almost its entire first-quarter profit to cover special provisions, mostly for bad loans. It said Pta18.09bn in capital gains from the recent sale of Banco de Madrid had been devoted to a special fund to cover future contingencies. Banesto said the decision reflected its intention to build on previous efforts to strengthen the group, which included increasing equity and stricter risk control, as well as a need to act decisively against the effects of the economic crisis. 'In consequence, the bank has set as a priority goal that of favouring solidity over short-term profits, by increasing provisions and allocating the entire first-quarter parent bank profit to extraordinary provisions,' it said. Mr Mario Conde, chairman, announced at last year's annual meeting that a special fund would be set up for contingencies, which would initially amount to Pta6bn. The Bank of Spain reached agreement late last year with Banesto for the bank to increase provisions against growing loan losses.</p>

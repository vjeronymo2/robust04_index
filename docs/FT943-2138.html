			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Street welcome turns sour as police wade in A festive mood in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, turned sour yesterday with a return of the political violence which has so often bedevilled the republic. Thousands of people took to the streets. Some wanted to watch the spectacle of the US military operation as more troops rolled ashore; others wished to celebrate what they believed was the end of military rule. However, their jubilation was premature. Haitian police waded into a crowd demonstrating against General Raoul Cedras, beating them and leaving one man dead. US servicemen, working with the Haitians as their partners, had been ordered not to intervene in domestic police business. Although Operation Restore Democracy may have entered its second day without a logistical glitch, domestic Haitian problems were already raising their head. Whether the US can end the operation as smoothly as it began will depend on how it limits its role in reviving a decrepit political culture and a bankrupt economy. Huge crowds lined the mile-long quayside, jostling for a glimpse of the trucks and jeeps rolling off US supply ships. At the airport, people clung to the perimeter fence to watch the troops landing in vast C5 and C141 transport aircraft. On the balconies and rooftops around the city, those residents not yet fed up with the relentless drone watched convoy after convoy of low-flying helicopters ferry army supplies to US positions. By early yesterday morning, more than 3,300 US personnel had landed in Haiti. With an amphibious landing at Cap Haitien later in the day to secure a bridgehead in the north of the country, and commercial flights employed with army aircraft to carry more people in, the number of troops was expected to have at least doubled by this morning. US troops fanned out from secure points through Monday night and during the day yesterday to set up patrol stations. The American units have been sent with French-speaking interpreters. The intention is clearly to move towards multinational patrol groups, including either a Haitian soldier or member of the UN coalition of forces as soon as possible. Before the violence of the demonstration altered the mood, the expanding US presence inspired jubilation in some quarters. Dancing celebrations gathered momentum quickly. In one instance, a group of supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide rallied round a line of 10 US trucks headed into one of the city's poorer districts. As they walked, they chanted the increasingly common cry, 'mi no te Cedras' ('handcuff Cedras'). Soon the walk had turned into a skipping march and the chant into a song, 'ba ma Aristide too suit' ('give me Aristide right now'). The group of hundreds grew to thousands who, having ripped branches from the trees, waved them in a frenzy. Observers were overwhelmed by big hugs, big smiles and the big promise that 'Aristide will bring peace, will bring money, will bring food'. Up on the hills above the city, in the contiguous town of Petionville, Haiti's wealthy elite remain sceptical that US forces will satisfy popular needs or aspirations. Many members of the Haitian bourgeoisie expect that an Aristide government would be no better than rule by Cedras - and even, possibly, worse. 'One man is not a democracy,' said the manager of Haiti's only functioning brewery. According to his point of view, the Clinton administration has made a miscalculation. 'This is not a human rights problem, there aren't cadavers piled up on street corners. This is not a political issue alone. The problem is poverty  -it is economics,' he said.</p>

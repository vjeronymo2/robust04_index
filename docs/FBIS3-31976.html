Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock confirmed  today to LA PRENSA that Gen. Ortega underwent "a minor  operation in Mexico on both knees but is in perfect condition  and will soon return to the country."    Yesterday, Sergio Ramirez called a news conference to defend  himself from attacks by his opponents in Sandinist radio  stations La Primerisima and Ya.    In a commentary, newsman William Grisby said Gen. Ortega had  maintained a political alliance with Presidency Minister Antonio  Lacayo and Ramirez, but these two had betrayed the army chief  last September.    When Ramirez was asked about the charges that he betrayed  Gen. Ortega, he replied: The last time I spoke with Humberto  Ortega was Thursday, when he called me from Mexico because of my  mother's death. "From his hospital bed and still under the  anesthesia, he called me very shaken to give me his  condolences.... That is my personal relationship with Humberto  Ortega," the former Sandinist vice president stated. It is not  known if Ortega will use crutches for some time or will walk  with a cane.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: MoDo forced to slice payout MODO, Sweden's third largest pulp and paper company, yesterday announced that profits after financial items dropped by 82 per cent to SKr221m (Dollars 36.8m) for 1991. It plans to cut its dividend to SKr7 from SKr13. The result was better than MoDo's forecast of break-even for 1991. The company said it was too early to give a forecast for 1992. Sales last year fell by 5.5 per cent to SKr17.4bn, as the recession and excess production capacity depressed pulp and paper prices. Although pulp prices have started to rise, the outlook for price increases for fine paper, newsprint and magazine paper remains uncertain. Operating profits dropped by 50 per cent to SKr969m. Although most of MoDo's divisions reported earnings close to 1990 results, the MoDo Paper group swung into a loss of SKr194m after a profit of SKr617m a year earlier. MoDo also wrote off SKr145m against its operating result for the planned reduction of personnel this year, as part of a rationalisation programme. MoDo intends to cut costs by SKr500m to SKr15bn by the end of 1993. This will include the elimination of 2,000 jobs. Danish medical measuring equipment maker, Radiometer, has agreed to buy family-controlled laboratory equipment producer, Struers, for DKr93.5m (Dollars 14.4m). It said it had been looking for a strategic alliance after a fall in sales which left it with a DKr13m net loss in 1990-1991. The deficit came despite cost cuts and staff reductions. It forecast a DKr7m loss in 1991-1992 and a swing to a small profit the following year.</p>

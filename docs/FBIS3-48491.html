			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Issue and `North Korea's </F> Internationalization'"]    [Text] North Korea and the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] have been holding discussions on the scope and  method of nuclear inspection to confirm any changes in the  status of North Korea's nuclear facilities [pukhan  haekhyonhwang]. This is a precondition to holding the third  round of talks between North Korea and the United States for  resolving the nuclear issue.    In order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the  United States has insisted upon, first of all, the continuity of  IAEA inspections; second, making North Korea accept inspections  of its two unreported facilities at the third round of talks;  and, finally, leading North Korea to abandon its nuclear policy  through its internationalization.    Meanwhile, North Korea has tried to improve relations with  the United States and other advanced capitalist countries to  overcome difficulties in maintaining its own system. Towards  that end, North Korea has tried to use its nuclear card to the  utmost in optimizing relations with the United States and other  advanced capitalist countries to the most of its abilities.    Given these conflicts of interest, unless North Korea  changes  its policy fundamentally, the North Korea-U.S. talks will likely  be prolonged and North Korea's denuclearization will only be  possible through North Korea's "perestroyka" [previous word in  English].    Therefore, the short-term and tentative way to resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue is to make every effort in  negotiations to conduct thorough nuclear inspections, and the  long-term and ultimate way is to make North Korea realize that  embarking on a "road of internationalization" is a better way to  maintaining its system than embarking on a "road of  chuche-orientation" by formulating an international assistance  program.    It is almost impossible for the current North Korean  political leaders to abandon the "road of chuche-orientation"  because this would mean the collapse of their system. However,  insisting on the road of chuche-orientation in a world of  internationalization, will only invite the danger of the  collapse of the North Korean system. Therefore, to lead North  Korea to pursue the maintenance of its system by carrying out a  policy of internationalization, we must contemplate the  formation of an international assistance program at some  appropriate time in the future that can make North Korea see  that in reality, "perestroyka" will help boost its system.    When our government's initiative and close cooperative  system  with the United States, Japan, and other advanced capitalist  countries and international agencies results in an assistance  program to accelerate North Korea's "perestroyka," we will then  be able to realize our dream of denuclearizing the Korean  peninsula.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Full phone listings It used to be hard enough to get an itemised phone bill. Now Energis, the newest UK long-distance phone company, is promising business customers a full 'telephone management' service. In addition to a list of all outgoing calls, subscribers will get information on the numbers of incoming calls - including the number of calls unanswered and the average length of time taken to answer a call. This will be broken down into different time periods of the day. The facts will be issued monthly - and are bound to concentrate the minds of telephone managers wonderfully.</p>

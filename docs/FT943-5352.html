			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Writ names Saunders as marketing adviser Mr Ernest Saunders is back in business as a marketing consultant. Just over three years after the former Guinness chief executive was released on parole for his part in the Guinness affair, having told a Court of Appeal that he was suffering from pre-senile dementia, resembling Alzheimer's disease, he has been named on a writ as marketing adviser to a troubled publishing venture. He is being sued in a legal battle between the two partners in a joint venture called Retail Revolution, which planned to launch 30 magazines to be sold exclusively through petrol stations. Retail Revolution was set up by Mr David Elias, the multi-millionaire owner of Harpur, a finance group, and Mr Richard Desmond, chairman of Northern and Shell, which owns a range of magazines including Penthouse. Mr Saunders is named as one of nine defendants in a writ issued by Mr Desmond's company, St Alban's Investments. The former Guinness executive was hired by Mr Elias as a marketing consultant for the venture. The other defendants include Mr Elias and his company, the Richbell Group. The writ, issued by St Alban's last month, alleges that it was excluded from the management of the affairs of the joint venture and that money was spent on the venture without its authority. The total damages sought are thought to total about Pounds 1.39m. Mr Elias responded a few days later by issuing a writ against Mr Desmond and Northern and Shell claiming breaches of the joint venture agreement. Retail Revolution had planned to publish 30 magazines this month - the largest number of titles ever launched by a single publisher in the UK. The planned titles, to have been produced by Northern and Shell, included Bodytalk, a health magazine, Megaboobs, an adult magazine and Brainbox, a puzzle publication. The venture aimed to sell the magazines through 4,500 petrol stations rather than traditional newsagents to achieve substantial savings in distribution costs. Harpur has a relationship with these stations as a supplier of fuel credit cards. Retail Revolution is still technically in operation as a company but Northern and Shell has terminated its involvement in the venture and refused to resume its supply of magazines.</p>

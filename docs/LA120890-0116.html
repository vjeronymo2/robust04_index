			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DELAYS ACTION ON POMERADO ROAD  </P> <P> Poway's attempt to force neighboring San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road to  traffic between the two cities was detoured Friday, dashing Poway city leaders'  hopes of giving their constituents an early Christmas present -- the easing of  ever-increasing traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Jeffery T. Miller ordered the North County community to  present more evidence in its case against the city of San Diego. Poway contends  that San Diego has no legal right to keep Pomerado Road blockaded now that a  $3-million face lift has removed its hairpin turns and other traffic hazards.  </P> <P> Miller set a Dec. 20 hearing for oral arguments by attorneys on both sides and  ordered Poway City Atty. Stephen M. Eckis to submit further evidence on whether  Pomerado Road is a major road, and whether it is specified as such in San  Diego's general plan.  </P> <P> "Based upon this issue, the city of Poway feels confident that the judge will  order the reopening of Pomerado Road following the hearing of oral arguments on  Dec. 20," John Fitch, Poway's assistant city manager, said.  </P> <P> Fitch conceded that Poway officials were "somewhat disappointed" that the judge  did not order San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road immediately but said he remains  confident that the smaller city will prevail.  </P> <P> The battle over the road, a popular shortcut that bypasses a 3-mile section of  Interstate 15 that slows to a crawl during commuting hours, began more than two  years ago when San Diego annexed several hundred acres of land north to the  Poway city limits.  </P> <P> Pomerado, which runs through the annexed area, was ordered closed after the  annexation because the narrow, winding roadway was considered a safety hazard  that did not meet city street standards.  </P> <P> Last month -- after the San Diego City Council had voted to reopen the newly  contructed road, then reversed itself -- Poway sued San Diego, contending that  the bigger city was violating state motor vehicle codes by blockading a  traveled regional route. Local governments may close major roads temporarily  for repairs or other safety regions, Poway argued, but cannot keep the roads  closed after the safety hazards are removed.  </P> <P> Les Girard, San Diego deputy city attorney, said Poway's attorney "is painting  the issue all black or white."  </P> <P> State laws allow a city to take such actions as closing a major road if certain  specific actions are taken, Girard said, "and we took those actions in 1988, by  amending the Scripps Miramar North community plan to provide that Pomerado Road  would remain closed until another major road was completed" that linked Poway  with Interstate 15 and San Diego.  </P> <P> "Poway's problem is that they did not challenge the action at that time,"  Girard said, "and now it is too late."  </P></p>

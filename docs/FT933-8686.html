			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / French industrial production down 1.9% in first quarter THE pressures on the French economy were highlighted yesterday by publication of official figures showing that industrial production fell 1.9 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter and 4.7 per cent against the first quarter last year. Yesterday's industrial production figures, released by Insee, the state statistics institute, reflect the downward trend of previous monthly estimates but show an unexpectedly sharp output fall for capital goods, such as aerospace and industrial equipment. The strains on industry appeared to have alleviated slightly in the second quarter. The provisional production figures for April showed a 0.6 per cent decline from March, but the May figures showed a 0.2 per cent increase. The June figures will be published on Tuesday. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, recently used these figures as evidence that the French economy had stabilised because of the impact of the reductions in interest rates since the centre-right government took power this spring. However, there is so far no evidence of a recovery in activity. The recent round of first-half turnover figures from French companies has painted a gloomy picture of reduced sales across the corporate sector. A number of leading industrial groups yesterday reported falls in first half sales including Michelin, the tyre maker, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals and the Bouygues construction company. 'The corporate sector may have stabilised but there is absolutely no sign of a pick-up in demand,' said Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'Companies won't feel the full impact of lower interest rates until early next year.'</p>

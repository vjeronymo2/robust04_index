			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC boosts soya demand A SHARP increase in European Community demand will help boost world soyameal consumption by 3m tonnes to a record 74.5m in 1992-93, the Oil World newsletter says, Reuter reports from Hamburg. Lack of domestic soft seeds is forcing widespread switching to soya in the EC and the publication expects net imports of soyabeans and soyameal to rise by 1.3m and 400,000 tonnes respectively in 1992-93. Oil World puts EC soyabean imports in 1992-93 at 15.1m tonnes, against 14m in 1991-92, with exports totalling 421,000 against 398,000. EC soyameal imports are seen reaching 14m tonnes (13.6m in 1991-92), with exports unchanged at 4m. Oil World says soyameal demand will also be strong in the US this season, and offtake is expanding in Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, China and Mexico.</p>

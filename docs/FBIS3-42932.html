They Are Scooping Up Our Fish With  Their Nets, Taking Advantage of the Fever Russia Is Running: The  Public Demands That the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation Immediately and Resolutely Put an End to  Foreign Fishing Piracy in the Sea of Okhotsk"]    [Text] Magadan--For three years now foreign fishermen  have played the master in the neutral section of the Sea of  Okhotsk. Nature has preordained it that the migration routes of  schools of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk run through the  "neutral zone." So, the newcomers engage in uncontrolled,  quota-free fishing here, undercutting the fishing resources of  the entire basin.    How did last year end there?    Alas, it is hardly reassuring. Dozens of foreign  supertrawlers continue to operate in the "neutral zone."  According to estimates by scientists, they caught about 1  million tonnes of pollock last year.    The Russian Government has taken some measures to solve the  problem. Two conferences with the participation of all  interested parties have been convened. Unfortunately, their  effectiveness proved to be low. South Korea was the only one to  promise to completely discontinue operations in neutral waters  and kept its word, having been granted in return the right to  catch 32,000 tonnes of pollock in our zone.    Undoubtedly, this is a more civilized way to settle issues  in  dispute. The position of the South Koreans was strongly  influenced by their participation in many contracts with  Russians which could otherwise have been canceled. We do not  have such contracts with other countries, hence the  consequences. At first, the Poles announced that they will cut  back operations by 25 percent, but did not withdraw a single  vessel. Our specialists believe that their promise is hollow,  all the more so because at the second meeting the Polish side  did not even mention it. The Chinese refused to discuss this  issue at all. Fishermen from these two countries still  constitute the shock "poaching" force.    The moratorium on fishing in the neutral section of the Sea  of Okhotsk announced by Russia accomplished nothing. Our  fishermen withdrew, but foreigners do not give a damn about the  Russian moratorium. After all, present-day Russia is neither the  USSR nor America, which, after detecting a threat to the pollock  population in the Bering Sea, instantly found ways to influence  Poland, China, and Korea. As a result, their moratorium is very  strictly complied with, and vessels which operated in the  "neutral zone" of the Bering Sea have migrated to the Sea of  Okhotsk, thus augmenting the already powerful pressure on it.    At present 30-35 Polish trawlers and 15-20 Chinese trawlers  continuously operate in the ill-fated region. Vessels flying the  Panamanian flag have appeared. A supertrawler from the Baltic  area fished for a period of time, but left quickly. As far as  the Ukrainian refrigerator ships the Bukhta Omega and the  Sevastopolskaya Bukhta are concerned, they have apparently been  coming here for a long time. They pick up fish from the Poles  and take it to the West. Perhaps this is way Ukraine is  "thanking" Russia for the oil and gas delivered to it. Recently,  even an American tanker was spotted here, which is also symbolic  because previously the Americans behaved properly.    Fishing inspectorate organs closely monitor the situation in  the Sea of Okhotsk. Last year four specialized  fishing-inspection vessels of the Commodore class took turns  spending about 200 days in the neutral waters. Surveillance was  also conducted from the air. Fifteen violations of the Russian  economic zone were detected; five Polish and Chinese vessels  were seized. In the process, fishing inspectors note that  violators are aware of our weakness and for this reason are  "raiding" the economic zone increasingly often and behaving ever  more arrogantly. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA has reported on the case of  the Chinese trawler Geng Hai in which its crew, which was caught  red-handed, refused to proceed to a Russian port. A patrol ship  of the border guard that was called in to assist arrived at the  site of the event as late as the sixth day: Fuel had to be  collected from the vessels of the entire brigade for the patrol  ship to be able to put out to sea.    The episode with the Polish supertrawler Amaryl proved even  more instructive. Having seen that the unarmed fishing  inspectors were getting no reinforcement from the border guard,  the captain reported this to his company, and got the following  response: "The fishing inspectors shall be put on a skiff and  sent to their vessel, with safety rules observed," which was  done immediately.    There is food for thought for the government here. If it is  not in a position to provide fuel for the ships of the border  guard, which has so far been officially responsible for  protecting the economic zone, should we perhaps take the path  that the Americans and the Japanese took and arm the fishing  inspectorate, granting it the relevant status? After all, it is  clear that emergency measures must be taken; otherwise, poachers  will very soon begin to penetrate not only the economic zone but  the territorial waters of Russia.    Funding for the services of the fishing inspectorate is  still  the weak element. Under our conditions, a combination of  seaborne and airborne surveillance in which airborne observers  quickly pass on the coordinates of violators to inspectorate  vessels is the most efficient. However, the number of aircraft  sorties fell by a factor of 10 last year compared to 1990  because of lack of funds.    The Russian Federation Committee on Fishing allocated for  these purposes insignificant fishing quotas, with the fish  earmarked for sale. These actions caused furious criticism from  the Ministry of Ecology and its local divisions which, instead  of coordinating efforts to protect natural resources, continue  the course of harsh confrontation with the Committee on Fishing.  Could the fact that the allocation of such quotas has now been  approved by the head of the government bring the prolonged  debate to closure now?    Incidentally, the quotas for "keeping up the pants" of the  fishing inspectorate and fisheries research do not cause  unfavorable emotions among fish producers. They fully understand  that by yielding a little, they stand to win much more from the  actions of these services.    In general, resolution of the fishing piracy issue comes  down  to the question of whether Russia will be a strong state which  nearby and faraway neighbors will begin to reckon with. For now,  the reverse process is underway here.</p>

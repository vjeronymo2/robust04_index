			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> RED CROSS WORKER REVISIT THE PAIN OF VIETNAM  </P> <P> The Vietnam War left Cherie Rankin a legacy of sadness denied and tears  delayed.  </P> <P> As a 24-year-old Red Cross worker confronted every day by death and suffering,  she was unable to cry. "When you're in a war," she says, "you have to turn off  the feelings in order to do the work."  </P> <P> For more than a decade after she came home in September, 1971, just thinking  about Vietnam produced headaches, and she'd become sick to her stomach. At a  reunion of Red Cross workers in 1984, she threw up. Until then, she says, she  had no idea how Vietnam had affected her.  </P> <P> Now, 20 years later, she is making a sentimental journey back to help restore  some of what the United States destroyed, and to shed her tears.  </P> <P> Rankin is part of a group of nine Americans paying their own way over to help  rebuild a medical clinic near Hanoi destroyed by U.S. bombers.  </P> <P> The team, which is leaving this month, is the third to return to build badly  needed medical facilities under the auspices of the Veterans Vietnam  Restoration Project in Garberville, Calif. During September and October, they  will work with former Vietnamese enemies who now are comrades in peace.  </P> <P> Rankin, now 44, will revisit the fields where the men she knew died and walk  the grounds of the Da Nang-area orphanage where she fed, clothed and played  with the pitifully maimed children of war.  </P> <P> "While I was there, I never felt the sadness, and I carry around some pain for  those children," she said. "Being able to do the crying on the spot would be  helpful -- being near firebases where many men who died I knew, whose faces I  see in my mind, to do some crying for them."  </P> <P> She remembers flying in helicopters to the American firebases to boost the  soldiers' morale. She is in field hospitals holding the hands of mortally  wounded GIs. They clutch her tightly. She is their last link to life.  </P> <P> The baby-face of a young GI she met in Da Nang while he was awaiting his  assignment is forever fixed in her mind. He was so new his boots still were  spit-shined. A few days later, she saw him lying in a field hospital with tubes  sticking out of him and the right side of his face blown away.  </P> <P> "I went over to him and held his hand," she said. "I reminded him I had seen  him the other day, and I think I said to him: 'I'm sorry.' He flicked his eyes.  He couldn't talk. But he gripped my hand."  </P> <P> Within minutes, he was dead. "That was my first death experience. I marked that  as the period of time where I numbed out. When I saw that kid there, I really  wanted to run. I wanted to go home. I wanted my mother."  </P> <P> Sometimes, she still can hear the familiar whirring sounds of the helicopters  and her mind drifts back. She now feels the fear she repressed, and she shakes  at the thought of it.  </P> <P> Dreams of Vietnam invade her sleep. If she doesn't remember them, there always  are the pillows across her body to remind her. During the war, Red Cross  workers pulled mattresses over their bodies to protect themselves during rocket  attacks.  </P> <P> "I will wake up startled . . . and all of my bed pillows are lined up the  length of the bed," she said. "Even if I don't have a clear memory of the  dream, I'm acting as though I were experiencing it."  </P> <P> Other images are of the children for whom she cared. They are scorched by  napalm, blinded by bombs. Their arms and legs are missing.  </P> <P> Among her poignant photos is one of an orphan, an Amerasian boy born to a  Vietnamese mother and American father. He sits forlornly. A fly rests on his  face. One of his legs is missing, blown away by a mine.  </P> <P> "He represents Vietnam to me," said Rankin. "This is the child of the war and  it says it all to me."  </P> <P> But there were rare moments of joy amid the poverty and pain. A reminder is  another photo, this one of three grinning orphan boys throwing their arms  around her. One is blind, one is missing part of his leg and one is retarded.  </P> <P> "I love it," Rankin said. "Just look at how happy I am to see those kids and  how happy they are to see me, how much physical touch is being shared."  </P> <P> Rankin, who originally is from West Palm Beach, Fla., went to Vietnam in  September, 1970, just out of Florida State University in Tallahassee. She did  not believe in the war but had faith in the men who were fighting, like her  younger brother, Doug, a Marine.  </P> <P> "I went to visit my brother," she said. "Even though I had questions about the  war, I really understood why the guys were there and I wanted to do what I  could to help them. I also wanted the adventure and to find out why we were  there, see for myself."  </P> <P> Despite her reservations, and the sexism and sexual harassment she sometimes  encountered, she didn't question the U.S. government's morality or motivation.  </P> <P> "I was so red, white and blue my blood was lavender," Rankin said. "I think we  fell into two categories in their mind. We were either virgins or whores, their  favorite girlfriend or sister, or we were there to be propositioned.  </P> <P> "I feel I was a pawn of our government, coercing soldiers to fight. Red Cross  women were held up as home and apple pie. 'This is what you're fighting for.'  The way the military used Red Cross women was sexist. We were there to be their  decoration. We're flying out in helicopters in dresses."  </P> <P> When she returned home a year later, the formerly gregarious woman withdrew  into herself, seeking solace in solitude. "For many years, I would be afraid to  be in crowds. I did not like going to social events," she said.  </P> <P> But that has improved through counseling at a veterans center.  </P> <P> "I've had therapy off and on for 10 years," she said. "I figure it's the rest  of my life . . . I have impairment for any level of functioning, but it's a  matter of growth, knowing yourself, learning about yourself. It's an ongoing  process."  </P> <P> She first went into therapy for help with some marital and childhood issues.  </P> <P> "I had no idea Vietnam affected me until around six years ago," she said.  </P> <P> She and her husband divorced in 1983, partly due to the war.  </P> <P> "I closed the book on Vietnam when I got back like everybody else did," she  said. "My husband had been a war protester and we never talked about Vietnam.  He was not comfortable talking about it. Neither was anybody else in the  country."  </P> <P> At the Vietnam reunion in New York City six years ago, "the whole thing started  opening up, everything started coming to the surface," she said. Just after she  arrived, she got a throbbing headache that lasted for a day and a half until  she threw up.  </P> <P> "I felt better after I did that," she said. "It's taken me a long time.  </P></p>

However, Janusz Bryczkowski, at whose invitation Zhirinovskiy  came to Poland, said that these people are politicians and  businessmen of the new, rising generation and not of the current  political setup.    During the news conference, Zhirinovskiy devoted much  attention to "Pan-Slavonic economic solidarity, in which Poland  and Russia can play an important role." In his opinion, bank  guarantees are needed for trade between the two countries. "We  can give preferential treatment to Polish construction  companies, including the construction of highways, among other  things," he said. He announced that talks with Moscow banks  would be held to discuss this matter. He did not exclude the  possibility of his own company participating in this undertaking.    Asked for comment on Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to  Moscow,  Zhirinovskiy said that politics runs along two separate tracks.  "If what is worked out by Poland and Russia turns out to be  good, we will accept it. We are not going to reject good  solutions," he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iranian Revolutionary Guards aided by Libyan  agents planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec.  21, killing 270 people, a London newspaper reported. The Sunday Telegraph  quoted unidentified intelligence officials in Washington as saying hard  evidence is emerging to show that Iranians blew up the Boeing 747 partly in  reprisal for the shooting down of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. cruiser  Vincennes in the Persian Gulf last summer. It said U.S. officials suspect  Libyans acted as a conduit for the explosives and provided intelligence for the  Iranian team.  </P></p>

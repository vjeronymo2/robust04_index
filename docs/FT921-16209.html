			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Motoring: Is there a cure for this illness? - Stuart Marshall gets a peculiar complaint every time he drives a hot hatchback . . . I AM suffering from a complaint you will not find in medical books. It comes on every time I slide behind the wheel of a hot hatchback. I call it motoring writer's schizophrenia. It affects many people in my trade. The symptoms begin with exhilaration, which develops into euphoria, accompanied by sharpened reactions and heightened self-esteem. During an attack there may be phases of over-confidence followed by moments of acute apprehension. Once the attack is over the patient suffers feelings of guilt. I have had several of them recently. The first was in France, when Peugeot let me loose in its new 106 TSi. It is a muscular little beast with a 100 horsepower, 1.4 litre engine under its shoebox-sized bonnet. Next was in Wales when trying Fiat's 148 horsepower, 2-litre Tipo 16v. Then I had further attacks when living for a week at a time with the Renault Clio 16v (1.8 litres, 137 bhp) and Ford's latest manifestation of the Escort, the 2-litre, 150 bhp, 16-valve engined RS 2000. Normally, I am not what you would call a fast driver. I aim to cover the ground reasonably quickly but above all smoothly, as a chauffeur might when hurrying with the governor to Heathrow to catch Concorde. I confess to not taking the 70 mph (113 kph) British motorway limit too seriously when traffic is light and the road dry. But I think most urban 30 mph (48 kph) and 40 mph (64 kph) limits are about right and 30 mph can be much too fast when, say, the schools are turning out. Dammit, I do not even approve of self-styled fast drivers - the kind which squeak tyres as they leap away from traffic lights, look no further ahead than the back of the car they are tailgating and rely on heavy braking to keep them out of trouble. They drive with all the finesse of a bulldozer uprooting a hedge. Now, really fast drivers - people I have been privileged to ride with like former rally ace Erik Carlsson - are another matter. On the road they do not seem fast but manage to progress incredibly quickly while making you feel totally safe. But I am wandering away from my point. Why do hot hatchbacks spark off attacks of motoring writer's schizophrenia? Why should they make one drive in a manner that can be hugely enjoyable but which one knows, deep down, is wrong and out of character? They are, all of them, attractive cars. Their power is seductive. Driving them is flatteringly easy because they are instantly responsive. True, the Clio's clutch was a muscle builder and the non-power steered Peugeot 104 felt a bit heavy to park. The Fiat was a flier on the open road, a gentle thing in town. I thought the Ford RS 2000 spectacularly good; the best version of the latest Escort by far. Maximum speeds are irrelevant nowadays though the slowest of the quartet is the 118 mph (190 kph) Peugeot 106TSi; all the others are good for 130 mph (210kph). Standing-start acceleration and pick-up in third or fourth gears are impressive. So impressive that the temptation to head the pack is irresistible, even if it does mean overtaking lines of slower vehicles where it may be safe, but not always courteous, to do so. Firmed-up suspension and wide, higher speed-rated tyres encourage fast driving on winding roads. Brakes are uprated and sometimes have an anti-lock system. Let me be honest. Exploiting most of a hot hatchback's performance, handling and roadholding in, say, the Brecon Beacons or the Scottish Highlands is as exciting as giving a good horse its head across open country. But it certainly is not legal. Is it responsible? A small, still voice has often told me afterwards that it is not. Of course, one does not have to drive a hot hatchback hard enough to offend the law or antagonise other road users. But if one is not going to make use of the extra acceleration and higher cornering and braking limits, why have one at all? For all their desirability, hot hatchbacks have their downside. They ride harder and less comfortably than humbler models in the range. They use more fuel and are more likely to be stolen or at least driven away and possibly wrecked by those mis-named criminal pests, the joyriders. The current generation of hot hatchbacks started with the Golf GTi of the mid-1970s. But the first off-the-peg small car that could run rings round expensive sporting machines was the Mini-Cooper 1275 S of 1965 - and it was in a Mini-Cooper S that I felt the first twinges of the sickness I have suffered from ever since. But a cure for motoring writer's schizophrenia may be in sight. The hot hatchback, like the white rhino, is a threatened species. Insurance companies hate them, especially when they are owned by the young. Premiums are now high enough to put ownership beyond the financial reach of many a covetous under 30-year-old, especially if they have had a couple of accident claims. Because of this, demand for used ones has fallen away. They now tend to depreciate at a similar rate to large engined executive saloons, some of which are worth only 50 per cent of their list price after one year. It may be only a matter of time before hardening police and public attitudes to aggressive driving and flagrant speeding administer a coup de grace.</p>

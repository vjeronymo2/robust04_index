			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Doc. 9.22_Draft Infractions Report for COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support the Secretariat's review of alleged infractions by the Parties, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary and appropriate recommendations to obtain wider compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terms of the Convention. Support an open discussion at COP9 of major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infractions, and a greater emphasis by the Parties on the enforcement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the laws and regulations implementing the Convention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article XIII of the Convention provides for COP review of alleged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infractions. The Secretariat prepares an Infractions Report for each COP,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which details instances that the Convention is not being effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented, or where trade is adversely affecting a species. The first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft of the Infractions Report contains numerous such alleged infractions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States has commented on the draft Infractions Report. A cursory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of the alleged infractions indicates a great difference in the depth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the reporting on infractions over previous reports. The United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers this to be an excellent, well-researched and well-prepared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretariat document. A large number of infractions are caused by lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, lack of personnel, or lack of knowledge on the workings of CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of the alleged infractions should be a major cause of concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Parties. When the final Infractions Report (incorporating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments of Parties) is circulated by the Secretariat, it will be available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the public upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Implementation of the Convention in the European Community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This issue was discussed extensively at COP8; absent any document, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States cannot formulate a position at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. National Laws for Implementation of the Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States was strongly supportive at COP8 of a review of national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laws for the implementation of the Convention; such laws are required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article VIII of the Convention. The Service provided funding for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project, and has already received reviews of national legislation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several countries. The United States believes that the Convention's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness is undermined when Party states do not have national laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the Convention, including laws and regulations that authorize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seizure and/or forfeiture of specimens imported or exported in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contravention of the Convention, and laws and regulations that provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate penalties for such violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Enforcement of the Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position is possible at this time. Support establishment of a Law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement Network.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notification to the Parties number 776 asked the Parties for their comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a proposal for establishment of a Law Enforcement Network. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States supported establishment of such a network at that time, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continues to do so. The United States will continue its support for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of law enforcement training to assist Parties in implementing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcing the Convention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nine Parties responded to Notification 776, which asked the Parties for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their comments on the proposed Law Enforcement Network, as follows: five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries (Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States) supported the proposal; three countries (Belgium, France  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Uruguay) opposed the proposal; and one country (Spain) was neutral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it was not adopted by the Standing Committee, it was agreed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Parties should discuss the issue at the COP. The United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers effective enforcement of the Convention to be a critical element  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is lacking for many countries, for a number of reasons, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of training, inadequate legislation or regulations, lack of funding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of infrastructure, and inadequate communications and networking with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other countries and entities. The United States believes that establishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Law Enforcement Network, comparable to other committees or working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups established by the Parties, will begin the process of alleviating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

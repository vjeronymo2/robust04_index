			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> WILL WEISMAN GIFT WORK WONDERS IN SAN DIEGO?;  </P> <P> ART: LACKLUSTER MUSEUM HAS AN ENVIABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON A NEW FOUNDATION  OF IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA WORKS.  </P> <P> If Walter Annenberg were to donate his exceptional collection of Impressionist  and Post-Impressionist paintings to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where  they are on temporary display through Sunday, the gift would instantaneously  transform the museum's holdings. Overnight, a respectable museum collection  would become an internationally prominent repository for late European  painting.  </P> <P> By stark contrast, a similar gift to, say, the Metropolitan Museum, the  Philadelphia Museum, the National Gallery or any other art-rich repository  wouldn't have anywhere near the same impact. All of those institutions would  likely appreciate the magnanimous windfall, and all of them could make good use  of the paintings. But, at any one of them, the gift would rank as just one  among many important private assemblies donated over the years. The Annenberg  collection would be readily absorbed into an already substantive pool of  Western art.  </P> <P> Precisely where a private collection goes public is, in the end, as important  as the fact that it's going public at all. Such gifts to museums can have  strategic purposes -- and ultimately should have, if the greatest public  benefit is to be served. The abundant fruits of a private collector's labors  can give clarity and focus to an otherwise shapeless public repository, or  provide much-needed depth to an assembly of art that only skims the surface.  And a transformative donation like that can yield results that will profoundly  affect an institution far into the future.  </P> <P> Evidence of the sudden, sharp difference that can be made by strategic  placement came not long ago from the surprise announcement that the Frederick  R. Weisman Art Foundation has given a significant group of 33 paintings and  sculptures by several prominent Californians to the San Diego Museum of Art.  The scale of the gift is certainly far less exalted and dramatic than an  Annenberg benefaction would be. But the principle is the same. In the context  of the San Diego Museum, where officials are now busily planning the spring  debut of the Weisman gift, it could have far-reaching implications.  </P> <P> News of the Weisman donation came as a surprise because, several months ago,  when rumors began to circulate that a gift to an unspecified California museum  was in the works, a host of institutions seemed likely candidates. The San  Diego Museum of Art, safe to say, was not high on any observer's list. Of the  state's numerous museums, it is hardly one that has distinguished itself either  in the brilliance of its collections or the sustained verve of its programming.  </P> <P> The exhibition program has been generally tepid. Exhibitions tend toward the  popular or the pleasantly benign, such as last year's displays of Faberge eggs  and of the Spanish Impressionist Joaquin Sorolla, or the 1988 Cecil Beaton  showcase. A real eye-opener hasn't occupied the special exhibition galleries  for a very long time (the last was no doubt the 1986 touring retrospective of  Bauhaus artist Oskar Schlemmer). And in the past decade, the museum itself has  organized few shows of note, relying instead on packaged exhibitions from  elsewhere.  </P> <P> As for art made in California, the most recent substantive effort was a  sprawling survey of sculpture mounted 10 years ago, in the summer of 1980.  </P> <P> Like most provincial museums in the United States, the San Diego Museum boasts  a collection long on minor art by major names, of quaint workshop pictures from  otherwise notable European schools, and of once fashionable decorative objects  that, commonly, find their way into public collections as a result of travels  to exotic locales by distinguished pillars of local society. If it's lucky, a  provincial collection is given spice by an item or two of unusual merit -- the  kind of thing that becomes a magnet for cognoscenti, like an art-world  trademark. The chief example at the nearly 70-year-old institution in Balboa  Park is the odd, startlingly modern, meditative still life, "Quince, Cabbage,  Melon and Cucumber," painted around 1602 by a Carthusian monk, Juan Sanchez  Cotan. One among a small but respectable group of Spanish Baroque pictures,  it's the justifiably acclaimed standout in the museum's collection and one of  the great paintings of its kind.  </P> <P> More to the point of the Weisman gift, the museum's assembly of 20th-Century  art is, save for isolated examples, negligible, and its holdings in  contemporary art made in California exceedingly thin. On a recent visit, a  scant three works by Californians were on view: unimpressive 1980s figurative  sculptures by Manuel Neri and Deborah Butterfield (a San Diego native) and  Wayne Thiebaud's small 1962 painting "Caged Pie."  </P> <P> There is admitted irony to the choice of an institution unable to claim a track  record of conspicuous excellence as recipient of a $1.5-million gift of  paintings and sculptures. This is especially true in light of the proximity of  other museums that can indeed make such claims -- most obviously, the San Diego  Museum of Contemporary Art in nearby La Jolla, the Newport Harbor Art Museum up  the road a piece or even the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Right  about now those outposts must be wondering if a languid, relatively disengaged  program is in fact the hidden road to success with benefactors.  </P> <P> And yet, the gift to the San Diego Museum of Art does make strategic sense. In  one stroke, the Weisman donation elevates contemporary California art to the  status of a significant focus for the collection -- likely the only focus with  the capacity to develop substantively in the future. That factor may have  played a part in the willingness of the museum, apparently alone among its  rivals for the Weisman holdings, to set aside permanent exhibition space solely  for California art.  </P> <P> Roughly half of the gift is composed of works that any museum would be eager to  have. Aside from a terrific 1962 assemblage-sculpture by Bruce Connor, who  works in the Bay Area, it principally includes art by Southern Californians:  John McLaughlin, John Altoon, Craig Kauffman, Ron Davis, Robert Irwin, Edward  Ruscha and John Baldessari, as well as the younger artists Alexis Smith, Matt  Mullican and Tim Ebner. Clearly, the assembly leaves considerable room for  development in several areas, should the museum decide to concentrate on  filling out a representative display of art made in California since the 1960s.  </P> <P> That effort would be worthwhile. With cleverness and skill, the San Diego  Museum of Art could transform itself into something rather common in Europe but  quite rare in the United States: a museum located outside the central art  capitals, but one that gains enviable significance as a repository for the art  of the region.  </P> <P> In short, the gift means that a museum that has always lacked a strong artistic  identity is suddenly within reach of one. The absence of a strong identity,  which is not a problem for La Jolla, Newport or MOCA, is the paradoxical  ingredient that seems to have made the San Diego Museum of Art the perfect  strategic choice. Whether the museum will, through future acquisitions and  exhibition programs in the field of contemporary California art, refine and  sharpen that profile with diligence and vigor remains to be seen. Yet for the  institution and its community, the Weisman donation has offered both art and a  golden opportunity.  </P></p>

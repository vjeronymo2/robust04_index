			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Not Enough"] </F>   [Text] Bruntal -- It is a dark blemish on the otherwise  sparkling economic performance of the Czech Republic. Isolated,  undeveloped and depressed, the small north Moravian slice of  land known as the Bruntal district has the highest level of  unemployment in the country.    "It's desperate," said 18-year-old Jarmila Kuzelova as she  stood outside the employment office of Moravsky Beroun, a  deathly quiet town at the southern end of the district. "It's  just catastrophic."    After graduating from school, Kuzelova worked as a waitress  for 800 Kc ($27.50) a month, but quit that job when she realized  she could be receiving monthly welfare payments of 1,300 Kc  instead. But now she's had enough and wants out. Together with  her husband, Kuzelova is moving to Mainz, Germany, where she has  found work as a waitress.    "There's nothing here. I just want to leave," she said,  echoing the pessimistic view of many people in the district.    In February, Bruntal's unemployment rate reached 9.4  percent,  a sharp contrast to the national rate, which remains a low 3.5  percent. By the end of this year, the Bruntal employment office  predicts a jobless rate of 11.16 percent. For more than two  years, the largely agricultural Bruntal -- a district with only  about 110,400 inhabitants -- has had the highest unemployment  level in the country. Measures that have brought rapid economic  growth to the rest of the Czech Republic have had little effect  on this isolated region.    Hampered by a lack of basic infrastructure, such as a  telephone connection to the outside world, the area is linked to  the rest of the country only by a circuit of tortuous highways  that wind through the region's rolling green hills. The  exposure to a free market has bludgeoned Bruntal with massive  layoffs at state farms and textile factories.    It was recently named one of four regions to receive a 150  million Kc ($5.17 million) emergency job-creating state subsidy  largely aimed at developing infrastructure and small business.  To the skeptical people of this region, however, the subsidy is  laughably meager. "Don't ask me if it's enough. Of course it's  not enough," said Stanislav Navratil, the district chairman of  Bruntal.    Sitting in his elegant wood-paneled office, Navratil added  that he is suspicious of the economic development schemes  hatched by Prague bureaucrats who know very little about the  region's problems. A case in point is the Economics Ministry's  plan to install a mobile telephone system in the district.    "These are political solutions. As a gesture it's fantastic,  but it's not systematic," he said. Navratil worries that without  a proper cable system, the mobile line will become jammed by  people trying to phone outside the region.    As far as private investment is concerned, the region has  fallen far behind the rest of the country, not only because poor  infrastructure makes it highly unattractive to investors, but  also because of unresolved and muddied ownership relations.  Restitution in the district has been slower and more complex  than almost anywhere else in the country. The root of the  problem lies in Bruntal's recent history. Up until the end of  the World War II, the region had a large Sudeten German  population that had lived there for centuries.    When the postwar Czechoslovak government deported most of  the  Germans, so-called "gold miner" Czechs swept into districts like  Bruntal to claim the deportees' property and homes. These  people weren't familiar with the land, however, and the district  quickly became a backwater of Moravia.    Today returning land to the Sudeten Germans is out of the  question, and the mass migrations of people around the region in  the postwar period has hopelessly entangled the process of  restoring nationalized property to its original owners. The  Order of German Knights, a charity organization comprised of the  former nobility, has had its claim on large tracts of land in  the district shuffled around the courts for months.    Added to this is the peculiar farm system used by the  communist government in Bruntal. With low-quality land and a  small, dispersed population, the typical collective farm system  proved all but impossible to set up in the area. Instead a  series of state-run farms was introduced, each saddled with  managers from outside the region. That resulted in colossal  losses as managers tossed money all over the region, confident  the state would bail them out every time.    Today those state farms are stuck in limbo, because no one  is  willing to invest large sums of money to develop or modernize  them before the crucial question of ownership is resolved.    Jaroslav Soural, an opposition deputy for the constituency  of  north Moravia, said at least some of the blame must also be laid  on the current national government. "The Economics Ministry has  turned its back on systemic solutions and has instead reacted to  individual problems as they arise," said Soural, a member of the  communist Left Bloc coalition. The first step, he said, would  be the introduction of a responsible regional government system  that would put elected officials in charge. Thus far, Prague has  dragged its feet on establishing regional governments as called  for by the Constitution. So Navratil's office functions like a  bureaucratic department of the central government.    For all its problems, both Soural and Navratil see potential  in the region once the restitution problems are set aside and  real investment can begin slowly creeping into the region.  Navratil talks of a "renaissance" in the local textile industry  and of reviving the region's wood craftsmanship tradition, which  was interrupted by the deportation of the Sudeten Germans.    He is also excited by a recently-signed cooperation accord  that links the district with the German region of Wettrau.  "We're saying that we are ready to take far more responsibility  for our own development," he said confidently.    But out in the dozens of small towns and villages that dot  the district, a different mood has begun to take hold.    "Everything is going downhill," said Jiri Bartu, a  28-year-old resident of Moravsky Beroun. Bartu runs his own  trucking company, but lately he has had difficulty getting some  of his local customers to pay their bills.    "And I don't believe it will somehow turn around for the  better. On the contrary, it will just continue going downhill."</p>

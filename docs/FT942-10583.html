			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Three-point solution to Turkey's ills Sir, There is a pragmatic solution to Turkey's economic problems ('No delight at Turkish central bank plan', April 28): 1. Reduction of the unproductive military expenditure to 1 per cent of gross national product - the level of nearly all countries. This will be the best therapy for budget deficits and chronic inflation. The reallocation of resources for productive uses will speed up growth - another important national goal. 2. Withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus following the United Nations plan. This will give Greece the green light for freeing EU funds to Turkey which are needed for the external economic stability of the country. 3. Offer complete autonomy to the Kurds in the framework of a federal organisation following the Treaty of Sevres (1920). This will promote domestic and international stability - a necessary condition for progress. Athenian Lysistrata could teach Mrs Tansu Ciller, Turkey's prime minister, it is better to make love and not war. S. Theofanides, Panteion University, Athens 176 71, Greece</p>

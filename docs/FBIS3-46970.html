The package will  include strong controls over cartel practices such as price  fixing by automakers and measures to stabilize the prices of  personal services. They also agreed to revise the five-year new  economy plan to ensure steady growth on the basis of freer  business activities in the private sector.    Under the revision, the government will no longer set goals  for macroeconomic indicators, such as growth, inflation and  balance of payments, from this year.    Also agreed to in the meeting, where Economic Planning  Minister Chong Chae-sok led the government team and chief  policymaker Yi Se-ki headed the DLP team, was a plan to study  measures to pave the way for companies to pay bonuses in shares  or convertible bonds instead of cash.    The government will take legal steps to encourage  corporations to invest in infrastructure, while deregulating the  capital market further so that listed companies have easier  access to markets for rights issues and corporate bonds.    It will also prepare, by the end of March, a plan to raise  15  trillion won for rural development, which President Kim Yong-sam  promised in his New Year press conference. They agreed to study  positively a plan to allow corporations to introduce foreign  commercial loans for capital investment.</p>

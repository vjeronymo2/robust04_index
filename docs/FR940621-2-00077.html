TREET is a group trust which is utilized for the investment on an undivided basis of certain real estate assets of the Plans, resulting from the reorganization of AT&amp;T and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization) approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the matter of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Western Electric Co., Inc., et.al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Civil Action No. 82&hyph;1092). The assets of the Plans' predecessor plans had been held in trusts established for the Bell System Pension Plan (the BSPP) and the Bell System Management Pension Plan (the BSMPP). On January 1, 1984, the trusts for the BSPP and the BSMPP were merged into the Bell System Trust (the BST). Substantially all of the non-real estate assets in the BST were transferred to a new AT&amp;T trust. The real estate assets were retained in the BST, which was amended and restated as TREET. The original participants in TREET were employee benefit plans maintained by various separate companies resulting from the Reorganization (the New Companies' Plans), each of which agreed that interests in TREET would be bought and sold only among the participating plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Buying and selling of interests in TREET has occurred among the Bell Companies' Plans in such manner that the AT&amp;T Plans and the BellSouth Plans are the only New Companies' Plans which continue to own participating interests in TREET. As of December 31, 1992, TREET had net assets of approximately $2,637,276,588. Currently, the only participants in TREET are the AT&amp;T Master Pension Trust, which holds the assets of the AT&amp;T Plans, and the BellSouth Master Pension Trust, which holds the assets of the BellSouth Plans. On January 1, 1993, the assets of seventeen defined benefit plans sponsored by the NCR Corporation (NCR) were added to the AT&amp;T Master Pension Trust, as a result of AT&amp;T's acquisition of NCR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

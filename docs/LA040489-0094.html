			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALMANAC: ASIAN MOTOR COMPANIES IN COUNTY;  </P> <P> FIRMS SETTLE IN 'PACIFIC MOTOWN'  </P> <P> Japanese motorcycle makers were the first Asian motor companies to open  distribution and marketing headquarters in Orange County when they came here in  the 1960s. Since then, several Asian car companies have made Orange County  their American home. Although no cars are made here, one industry analyst  describes the county as "Motown on the Pacific."  </P> <P> The largest Japanese motor companies -- Toyota, Nissan and Honda -- are in Los  Angeles County, where they settled more than 25 years ago. But most of those  arriving from Asia in the 1980s have chosen Orange County, citing the  availability of land, the attractiveness of the area, the increase of ethnic  diversity.  </P> <P> "I'm living where tastes are being set. It's the perfect place to do my work,"  said Hideaki Yoshizawa, executive vice president and general manager of design  at Mitsubishi's Cypress Design Studio.  </P> <P> AMERICAN SUZUKI MOTOR CORP.  </P> <P> Headquarters: Brea  </P> <P> Year came to O.C.: 1985  </P> <P> U.S. 1988 gross sales *: $1.3 billion  </P> <P> O.C. employees: 443  </P> <P> U.S. employees: 644  </P> <P> Space occupied in O.C.: N/A  </P> <P> Other facilities in Orange County: parts warehouse, training center.  </P> <P> Vehicles are made in Japan.

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Record Pounds 239m Vauxhall profit VAUXHALL, the UK subsid-iary of General Motors, increased its pre-tax profits last year to a record Pounds 239.1m from Pounds 236.3m a year earlier. The company was helped by favourable exchange-rate movements that cut currency losses to only Pounds 3.2m from Pounds 29.3m in 1989. Operating profits declined by 13 per cent to Pounds 190.9m from Pounds 219.7m a year earlier, chiefly under the impact of the recession in the UK new car market. Mr Paul Tosch, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, warned yesterday that operating profits would fall further this year in the face of the continuing steep drop in UK new car demand. Marketing costs jumped last year as Vauxhall, along with rival car makers, was forced to increase sales incentives sharply. The company outperformed the market by holding the drop in UK car sales volume to 7.7 per cent - 323,054 units - compared with a fall in the overall market of 12.7 per cent. Vauxhall, which ousted Rover from second place in the UK car market in 1989, boosted its share further last year to 16.1 per cent from 15.2 per cent. Vauxhall's financial performance was supported last year by a 16 per cent increase in vehicle production to a record 276,000 units. UK-built cars accounted for 80 per cent of sales, compared with 64 per cent in 1989. The drop in domestic sales was cushioned by the start of exports to GM markets in continental Europe. Exports will be increased to 70,000 this year and will account for close to 30 per cent of Vauxhall's total production from its Luton and Ellesmere Port assembly plants. Vauxhall turnover rose last year by 4.9 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn, reflecting the positive impact of the export programme. Net profits fell 13.3 per cent to Pounds 181.3m from Pounds 209.1m, as the company faced a full-tax payment, having exhausted its carry-forward losses in 1989. It made a Pounds 184m dividend payment last year to GM, after one of Pounds 194.6m in 1989, its first for more than 20 years.</p>

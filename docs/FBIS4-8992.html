			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by </F> Pavol Minarik; place and date not given: "Meciar's Opposition  Criticizes the Government for Meeting the Czech Republic  Halfway"]    [Text] [Minarik] Do you have the impression that, in  connection with the approaching elections, some Slovak  politicians are trying to play the Czech card in an unpleasant  way?    [Kukan] Despite the short time in office, the new government  is being strongly criticized by Meciar's opposition for  allegedly being too willing to meet the Czech side halfway. I  have participated in a meeting of the Customs Union Council, and  I can only say that the treaty we concluded is a reasonable  compromise. I believe that we will be able to find compromise  solutions when solving other, more serious problems. It is very  easy to bang the door when we have a dispute [allusion to  Meciar's behavior]. However, the situation that follows may  become a problem. In the election campaign, there certainly  will be politicians who will try to show that we are making  concessions to Prague. It is important for the current  government Cabinet to have clean hands and a clear conscience  and to show that it has never gambled with or bargained for  Slovak interests.    [Minarik] A month ago, you became minister in the new Slovak  Government. What are the priorities in the relations between  Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in your opinion?    [Kukan] I do no like to speak about certain priorities  because, in relations between the Slovak Republic and the Czech  Republic, there should be as few controversial points as  possible. Of course, we are interested in having as few  disputes as possible because we should make use of the good  things that united us in the past. In the world, we have gained  respect for our civilized separation, and I am not sure whether  we have presented this fact correctly at home. Certainly, it  would be nice if we finally solved all of the problems linked to  the division of the property of the former federation and closed  the difficult chapter in our mutual relations. The property  division is always the most difficult thing after a divorce.  Here, we have a divorce of two countries that have been living  together for several decades. You always need two sides to  preserve good relations. This government is sincerely  interested in good relations with the Czech Republic, as much as  it is interested in the protection of the Slovak interests. I  personally believe that it is possible. This does not have to  be against the spirit of neighborly cooperation.    [Minarik] What about relations with Hungary, which have been  a very sensitive issue in the Slovak Republic's foreign policy?  Budapest was positive about the first steps of Moravcik's  government, but....    [Kukan] We really want the Slovak-Hungarian relations to be  calm and reasonable, so that we might be able to discuss  anything anytime. I believe there are certain problems that we  will be able to sort out in the short period of time our  government has available. However, this will require a sober,  realistic, and reasonable attitude on the Hungarian side, too.  We are not succumbing to the illusion that we will be able to  very quickly sort out the problems there are between us.  Moreover, in Hungary, parliamentary elections are to be held  soon, in less than a month. Public opinion polls have shown  that the government may change after the elections. We want to  proceed in the same way, independently of who is in power in  Budapest or Bratislava. Without hesitating too much, we have  proposed a meeting on the readmission treaty, the temporary  economic regime on the Danube, and other issues.    [Minarik] You were called on to assume the position of  foreign minister when you were the Slovak Republic's ambassador  to the UN in New York. How have your colleagues accepted this  fact?    [Kukan] I was quite surprised when Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik phoned me with the proposal. However, I suspected that  this could happen when the prime minister said, immediately  after he had been appointed, that a professional diplomat should  become foreign minister. I will be sincere: I liked it in New  York; I felt like a fish in fresh water. You have situations in  your life where it is impossible to say no to an offer. I have  spent all my life in service abroad--30 years in the diplomatic  service, and now I have a unique opportunity to look at the  thing from a different angle. Despite the fact that I have been  appointed to this function for the period of six months--that  is, until the election in the fall--I consider it to be the  culmination of my professional career as a diplomat. As regards  my colleagues, they certainly were surprised to a certain  extent. My Czech colleague Karel Kovanda was the first to  congratulate me, even before I confirmed my decision to the  prime minister. In the UN, this was not such a surprise. It is  not unusual that some of the ambassadors become foreign  ministers.    [Minarik] It was Knazko's Alliance of Democrats that  proposed you for the position of foreign minister. What do you  have in common with it?    [Kukan] I am not a member of the Alliance of Democrats or of  any other party. According to the coalition agreement, every  member has the right to propose the agreed-upon number of  candidates to the government. They proposed me.    [Minarik] How does the United States, where you lived for  four years, view Slovakia? What improves and what damages  Slovakia's image?    [Kukan] The ordinary American does not know much about  Slovakia. He can learn about Slovakia from the media when they  report dramatic events. There does not have to be bloodshed,  but it is always an event that is worth noticing. The reports  usually have a negative rather than a positive flavor. This  should not be regarded as bad intentions but as characteristic  of many media sources. With the access to information they  have, it is quite normal that they would notice the statements  and steps of our politicians who are not the usual and the best  ones. Not all of us realize that everything we do at home is  being carefully watched abroad and that, logically, this has  certain effects. This is why a well-considered domestic policy  is the best foreign policy. I have found myself in humorous  situations quite often. For example, Americans asked me whether  they should travel to Bratislava or to some other place in  Slovakia and whether the situation was safe there. Many confuse  us with the former Yugoslavia. This is why we have to explain  the very basic things about ourselves during various meetings  and lectures....    [Minarik] What is Slovakia's attitude toward the plan of  French Prime Minister Balladur, according to which the change of  borders could become the subject of talks between countries?    [Kukan] We must understand the Balladur plan in the wide  context. I am not going to say it in a diplomatic way, but, at  the beginning, this plan contained unacceptable conditions for  Slovakia. For Slovakia, it is unacceptable to link the question  of minorities to the change of borders. If we speak about  stability in Europe, we cannot ignore the fact that stability  does not depend exclusively on the status of ethnic minorities,  but also on political, economic, and security links and matters.  Since it first appeared, the idea of the Balladur plan has  undergone certain development. The text of the pertinent treaty  is still the subject of negotiations. We are aware of the fact  that this is a matter for the European Twelve to discuss. I  believe that the authors of the plan will accept some of our  views. I believe that the resulting document will be acceptable  for all, and there will be no losers and no winners.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Risk grows of Tory split over EU expansion The prospects of a damaging split in Britain's Conservative party over enlargement of the European Union increased yesterday as opinion hardened on both sides of the Channel ahead of a crucial meeting tomorrow in Brussels. Senior ministers insisted that the crisis over the entry terms for Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria would be resolved by the Union's foreign affairs council. But leading members of the council, the Commission and the European parliament said Britain would have to accept substantial changes in the Union's system of qualified majority voting. Backbench Conservative MPs, including some not normally regarded as anti-European, said any retreat by the government would precipitate a crisis in the parliamentary party. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said he was confident that Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, would achieve a compromise allow-ing enlargement to go ahead. 'Britain's vital national interests have to be protected at this point. I am pretty clear that can be made compatible with an agreement. But I think the idea that this whole thing is going to sink on British obduracy is really an invention,' he said. Mr Portillo also claimed that the government's reluctance to allow changes in the voting system would help the Conservatives in the European parliament elections on June 9. He said: 'I don't think British people want to be swept along by a tide. They want to know there are certain rights protected in the EU.' However, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said there could be no compromise based on Britain's wish to retain the existing voting system, under which 23 of 76 votes form a blocking mechanism in the Council of Ministers. Mr Helveg Petersen said most member states would probably accept Greek proposals for a move to a blocking mechanism of 27 votes out of 90 in the enlarged council, combined with a one-month cooling-off period to allow reflection. Mr Leo Tindemans, leader of the European People's party, the transnational grouping to which the British Conservatives are affiliated, said no compromise would be acceptable unless it involved a move to 27 votes. Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for foreign affairs, said there was 'amazement' among Britain's EU partners that the government was prepared to risk delaying enlargement. Some MPs linked the issue to Mr John Major's leadership of the party. Mr Bernard Jenkin, a hardline Euro-sceptic, said compromise would put in question the credibility of Mr Major's vision of the Union as a group of self-governing nation states.</p>

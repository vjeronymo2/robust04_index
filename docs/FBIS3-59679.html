Radio piloting equipment  will be installed on retained stocks of F-104J fighter planes  retired from active service in 1985. The cost of refitting the  F-104's will come to about &yen;600 million per plane and six  planes have been ordered for Fiscal Year 1993 (FY-93). The  production of F-15 interceptor-fighter aircraft by MHI's  Aircraft Division has peaked and the firm's sales can be  expected to be further reduced by slower growth in the budget  for front-line armaments. MHI hopes to make up for the decline  in its work on new planes by publicizing its pioletless-aircraft  technology to win orders to refit a total of around 20 aircraft.    In 1990, MHI delivered to the Defense Agency two F-104's  that  it had refitted with pilotless technology. The two planes were,  however, designed to also allow piloted flight; the two planes  were intended to collect various kinds of data on pilotless  flight and could be described as being at the experimental stage.    The F104 was once a masterpiece said to be "the ultimate in  manned flight," but refitting it with pilotless technology was  difficult and took time because, among other things, the plane's  landing speed is fast since it becomes unstable at slow speeds.    MHI resolved the technical problems in experiments that it  conducted up to FY92 and received orders for six planes in FY93,  so it's beginning full-fledged refittings in order to convert  the planes to completely pilotless aircraft at its Nagoya  Aerospace Systems Komaki South Plant (located in Toyoyama  Township, Aichi Prefecture). MHI plans to have all the planes  delivered by the beginning of FY93.    The Defense Agency has kept in stock 20 or more F-104's that  it has not disposed of by disassembly, and MHI believes that  there will be a demand for refitting them as pilotless aircraft  beginning in FY94.    In addition to being able to fly on a pre-programmed course  the pilotless planes will be able to be controlled by radio  while monitoring it by television from the ground. Moreover, if  the pilotless planes go beyond the range that they can receive  radio signals they will automatically return to skies within  radio reception. The Air Self-Defense Forces plan to utilize the  refitted F-104's as target aircraft in training around Iwo Jima.  Currently MHI is mainly occupied with such tasks as producing  F-15 interceptor-fighter aircraft under license for the Air  Self-Defense Forces and sharing the production of the civilian  passenger plane Boeing 777. The production of F-15's has already  peaked and the production of civilian passenger planes has  slumped due to the world-wide recession in the airline industry.  MHI hopes to receive refitting-work orders as a way of  maintaining sales until the next-generation FSX fighter begins  to be mass-produced.</p>

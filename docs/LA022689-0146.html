			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH ON GUN CONTROL  </P> <P> I cannot afford a large ad in The Times as did the NRA (Part I, Feb. 13). I am  sorry that others seem to think an AK-47 or an Uzi is a necessity for  law-abiding citizens. Hopefully, our legislators will pass a law that will get  rid of some of them.  </P> <P> I am not under the illusion that gangs and criminals will turn theirs in. But a  journey begins one step at a time.  </P> <P> ELEANORA J. HUNTER  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

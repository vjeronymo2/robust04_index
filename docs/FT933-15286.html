			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: EdF's position miscast Sir, The article 'Where big is beautiful', which was published in your Power for Europe survey (June 22), is factually incorrect. It states that: 'EdF's view of privatisation was reflected earlier this year in a series of highly critical reviews of the UK experience. The reports, which EdF commissioned from outside consultants, concluded that privatisation in Britain was characterised by price increases, economic disruption . . .' EdF never commissioned these reports on the British electricity system. The reports to which you refer were commissioned by the Comite d'Entreprise of EdF, which is entirely independent of management influence and in no way represents the views of EdF's management. In France, members of Comite d'Entreprise are composed of staff representatives. In accordance with French law, a Comite d'Entreprise has funds set aside for commissioning external stud-ies. On February 24, David Buchan, FT correspondent in Paris, attended the press conference organised by EdF staff representatives who presented the reports mentioned above. This was correctly reported in your paper at the time. Unfortunately an error was made when this story was repeated in your survey. Christian Nadal, director, Electricite de France, Paris</p>

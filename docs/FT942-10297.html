			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Royal Bank of Scotland seeks to purchase building society Royal Bank of Scotland would like to buy a medium-sized building society with a 'recognisable name' in the high street, Mr George Mathewson, its chief executive said yesterday. Mr Mathewson, whose bank will disclose its interim results for the six months to March 31 today, said a society acquisition could help it with its strategy of diversifying business, and making its earnings less volatile. Mr Mathewson confirmed Royal Bank had been interested in acquiring Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, for which Lloyds has bid Pounds 1.8bn. But it was also interested in societies with a different mix of operations. 'We would certainly be interested in the right building society. It would need to be substantial in size, of high quality, and with a recognisable brand name,' he said. Mr Mathewson said that the acquisition of a society could also help to strengthen its deposit base. 'The cost-income ratios of other societies may be higher (than C&amp;G's) but that does not necessarily mean they are poorer businesses,' he said. He also said that Royal Bank might be an attractive owner for a society because it had shown it was capable of allowing subsidiaries such as Direct Line, its telephone insurance arm, to have operating autonomy. Mr Mathewson's confirmation of interest in acquiring a society follows similar statements by Bank of Scotland, Abbey National and TSB Group. Mr Mathewson said that Royal Bank would like to increase the proportion of residential mortgages within its assets because they have been less risky than corporate loans. This would help to make its earnings less volatile. Background, Page 28</p>

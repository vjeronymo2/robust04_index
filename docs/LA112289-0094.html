			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOBBLING UP PROFITS;  </P> <P> WITH NEW PRODUCTS BOOSTING SALES, TURKEY FARMERS HAVE MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR.  </P> <P> They have been tossed from low-flying airplanes in an odd Arkansas ritual,  bowled frozen down the aisles of an Orange County supermarket, adopted as pets  and hijacked as political pawns.  </P> <P> They have been ridiculed as too dumb to live and found to be too fat to  procreate unassisted. They are a strutting symbol of suffering stupidity, and  yet we invite them to dine with us in increasing numbers.  </P> <P> The turkey's time has come, and we're not just talking Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> When processors started turning out various turkey products in the 1970s --  turkey bologna, turkey pastrami, turkey kielbasa, ham and hot dogs -- the  bird's fate was sealed as one of America's fastest-growing foodstuffs.  </P> <P> "Things are really happening out there," said Mervin Amerine, manager of the  California Turkey Industry Board. "We're moving in on the other animal protein  items -- beef, pork, you name it. We keep getting their business all the time."  </P> <P> When consumers want beef or pork these days, they're often gobbling up turkey  instead -- and at a rate that's turned it from holiday fare into everyday  eating. In fact, the Thanksgiving-through-New Year's Day turkey glut now  accounts for only about 35% of the total turkey market, said Laurie Wilson,  National Turkey Federation spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "We haven't lost the holiday image," Wilson said. "We've just added on."  </P> <P> While the turkey has such a secure position in American mythology and cuisine,  there is relatively little known about the bird for certain. One solid fact is  that the plastic-packaged fowl has its roots in the native American wild  turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, which roamed the forests from southern Canada to  Mexico.  </P> <P> The bird was brought from Mexico to Europe in the 1500s by the Spaniards.  Merchants from the eastern Mediterranean, often Turks, usually touched down in  Seville on their way west and are thought to have picked the bird up there and  introduced it to England. The English, it is said, named it the "turkie cock,"  though it was called everything from the "cock of India" to the "elephant bird"  throughout the Old World.  </P> <P> Then there's the question of whether the Pilgrims actually ate the bird at the  first Thanksgiving back in 1621.  </P> <P> William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, allegedly described a  turkeyless feast in his personal notes, listing venison, duck and goose among  the menu items. Some historians contend, however, that the Indians brought the  birds to the potluck dinner or that Pilgrim hunters went out and shot a few  before bowing their heads over grace.  </P> <P> Either way, turkey eating had a slow start in the United States, a situation  that showed no improvement for more than three centuries. By 1930, Americans  were eating a mere 1 1/2 pounds of turkey each year -- about enough for a  drumstick or two on Thanksgiving Day, followed by a sandwich and a plate of  Turkey a la king during the post-holiday weekend.  </P> <P> According to the National Turkey Federation, consumption grew slowly but  steadily for about 50 years.  </P> <P> Then 1980 hit. That year, Americans ate 10.4 pounds apiece; in 1988, it was up  to 16.1 pounds.  </P> <P> The turkey federation predicts per-capita consumption to reach nearly 18 pounds  by 1990. Consumers in California are already eating 23 pounds each year -- more  than any other area of the country.  </P> <P> Health is a major reason for the switch. The decade that brought us aerobics  and lycra tights, that saw alcohol consumption take a plunge and gym  memberships rise, also taught us about the dangers of cholesterol.  </P> <P> "Today, people are perceiving turkey as a low-fat, low-calorie alternative for  red meat products," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Consider: A three-ounce portion of roasted white turkey meat contains 119  calories, one gram of fat, 55 milligrams of cholesterol and 26 grams of  protein. The same-sized serving of a beef rib roast has 217 calories, 12.9  grams of fat, 68 milligrams of cholesterol and 24 grams of protein.  </P> <P> Turkey processors were quick to catch on that the way into Americans' stomachs  is through unclogged arteries. Tom Herrick is generally credited as being the  father of turkey ham, a product he seasoned into being in 1974 when he was  general manager of a Turlock, Calif., turkey processing company.  </P> <P> Five years later, the Louis Rich Co. introduced turkey bologna, salami and  pastrami to the sandwich-eating public. Last June, turkey bacon made its debut  in American frying pans, thanks to Con-Agra Turkey Co., producers of the Turkey  Selects by Armour label.  </P> <P> Why did it take 15 years for turkey to metamorphose from drumstick to breakfast  strip? Robert Wangerien, director of marketing for ConAgra's Turlock Division,  figures it's a combination of technology and taste.  </P> <P> "It took a little bit of more technology on the part of the manufacturers to  make a turkey breakfast strip," Wangerien said. "And now there's greater and  greater consumer demand for products that are healthful, lower in fat and more  nutritious in general. And there's a greater awareness of turkey."  </P> <P> The 1980s also taught turkey processors that small is beautiful. Instead of  just offering a frozen 20-pound Tom, they began to cut turkeys up like chickens  and offer turkey cutlets and tenderloin, legs, thighs, breasts.  </P> <P> In addition to growing more turkeys, farmers are also growing different  turkeys, birds selectively bred to carry more meat.  </P> <P> "Ours are broad-breasted turkey, and it's a genetic thing, a development  through the years," said Joyce Wesolowski, general coordinator at Willie Bird  Turkeys in Petaluma. "They have developed the turkey to where we get very, very  large hens. When they get too big, they'll topple over, because they're too  heavy on the breast."  </P> <P> Increased weight also makes breeding the birds more difficult, industry experts  say, so turkey breeders rely on artificial insemination and trickery to  increase mating.  </P> <P> Left to their own devices, turkeys would breed earlier in the year than optimal  for mass production and holiday sales. So some turkey producers keep the birds  in darkened sheds. When light is suddenly let in, the birds think it's spring  and nature takes its course.  </P> <P> But then, turkeys were never known for their native intelligence. Their major  activities consist of eating and sleeping; young turkeys have been known to  stand in the rain with their heads up and mouths open until they drown.  </P> <P> But some turkey owners would beg to differ when it comes to talking turkey  intelligence.  </P> <P> Wilbur, a Wisconsin Tom, made national news when his owner decided not to eat  him for Thanksgiving in 1982.  </P> <P> The reason? After eight months in the home of Bob Fecteau, Wilbur had taken up  jogging, his owner insisted. It was proof, Fecteau said, of turkeys' kinship  with humans. Fecteau ate ham for his holiday dinner.  </P> <P> He's not the only American who has spent time with a turkey in activities  outside of raising, cooking and eating.  </P> <P> Derrick Johnson, for one, has created the Poultry Bowling Assn. to promote a  sport he dreamed up while stocking shelves. The Santa Ana grocery clerk was  watching workers in the meat department slide a Butterball across the linoleum  one Thanksgiving a few years back when he realized how fast and accurate the  bird was in its frozen state.  </P> <P> Within minutes, turkey bowling was born -- a new, late-night indoor sport. To  play, stack 2-liter plastic soda pop bottles at the end of the grocery aisle.  Grip the Butterball by its yellow handle, wind up and slide. But  Swift-Eckerich, the Chicago-based maker of the Butterball, has said it is not  amused.  </P> <P> Three years ago, members of Farm Sanctuary, a Delaware-based animal rights  group, took six turkeys on the road for a kind of protest of fowl treatment and  delivered them to families in Cincinnati, Boulder, Colo., and Camarillo --  families that promised not to braise the beasts.  </P> <P> "People have to be aware that animals have feelings, at least feelings of  pain," said Linda Callahan, a Camarillo resident whose back yard became the  home of Trotter and Strutter at the end of their trip West.  </P> <P> Farm Sanctuary would almost certainly question the motives of the Yellville  city fathers. In Yellville, Ark., wild turkeys, which can fly better than their  domestic cousins, are thrown from zooming airplanes during the annual Turkey  Trot Festival in mid-October.  </P> <P> "The plane flies pretty low over the park, and they throw out the turkeys and  they fly and people try to catch them," said Joyce Newton, Yellville city  clerk. "There's a farm nearby, and ones they don't catch usually end up there.  The farmer has quite a herd of them by now."  </P></p>

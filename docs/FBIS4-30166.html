			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Korean Authorities Must Immediately Stop </F> Distributing Despicable Decoy Materials" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities are these days resorting to such a despicable act as  distributing decoy materials full of falsehood and fabrications  to officials of the DPRK working abroad and progressive figures  of different countries.    This despicable disinformation campaign is part of their  persistent anti-DPRK intrigues.    Their decoy materials such as letters, publications and  video  cassettes are, without exception, run through with sheer lies  groundlessly vilifying the DPRK.    They send such propaganda materials in the name of the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) or  Koreans in Japan or even the International Institute of the  Chuche Idea [IIJI].    This is an intolerable insult to and mockery of Chongnyon  and  Koreans in Japan and the IIJI.    It goes without saying that the disinformation campaign is a  brainchild of the notorious South Korean "Security Planning  Board" [SPB], an anti-DPRK plot-breeding machine accustomed to  telling lies and fabricating things.    The "SPB" recently launched into such dastardly campaign  with  the sinister political aim of creating ideological confusion  among officials of the DPRK and progressive figures of different  countries by taking advantage of the situation complicated by  the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    The South Korean authorities stoop to any infamy in their  efforts to create ideological confusion within the DPRK and take  the edge off the international movement for solidarity with the  Korean people's cause of justice growing stronger with every  passing day, while running amok in their preparations to unleash  another war and stifle the DPRK with the help of outside forces.  But, by doing so they are stripping themselves fully naked as  sycophant traitors.    It is a gross mistake, if they think they can give rise to  any slightest ideological vacillation among officials of the  DPRK and world's progressive people with such dirty tricks.    It is as foolish an act as trying to destroy a rock with an  egg.    The South Korean authorities must immediately stop the  despicable act of distributing decoy materials that can convince  no one.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Interest Rates Rise: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities  rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in three weeks. The Treasury  Department sold $7.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate  of 7.72%, up from 7.64% last week. Another $7.4 billion was sold in six-month  bills at an average discount rate of 7.79%, up from 7.64% last week. The rates  were the highest since Sept. 5 when three-month bills sold for 7.88% and  six-month bills averaged 7.87%. The new discount rates understate the actual  return to investors -- 7.98% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling  for $9,804.90, and 8.22% for a six-month bill selling for $9,606.20.  </P></p>

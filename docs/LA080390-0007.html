			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: BUCKING THE TREND ON CLEAN AIR  </P> <P> When Ray Remy was Los Angeles deputy mayor, he liked to smother controversy by  using a bureaucratic device called "reaching a consensus."  </P> <P> He'd announce that the Administration had made a unanimous decision. The truth  was, City Hall might have been torn apart with dissension. But dissidents in  the bureaucracy, worried about job security, knew enough to keep their mouths  shut.  </P> <P> Since 1984, however, Remy's been out of the consensus business. As president of  the Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, he's fighting the strict clean air  rules proposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. He says the  rules are anti-business.  </P> <P> The transformation of Remy from super bureaucrat to tenacious lobbyist -- and  his employment by the chamber -- reveal something about the changing nature of  power in L.A.  </P> <P> Remy was more than City Hall's dictator of consensus. He was also the master of  the technical end of government, working in perfect harmony with technocrat  Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> The two loved to talk about the details of sewage disposal, street construction  and power generation. They'd been doing it for years. Remy worked for the  League of California Cities when Bradley first met him. Later, Remy headed the  Southern California Assn. of Governments before going to work for Bradley in  1976. Meetings of both organizations are seminars in the heavy details of  planning, sewage disposal, road building, police deployment and all the other  municipal tasks.  </P> <P> Remy was friends with like-minded bureaucrats from around the area. He knew his  way around Sacramento and Washington, was on a first-name basis with powerful  lawmakers and important staff members. And he knew the insides of every City  Hall from Long Beach to West Covina. All that made him just the man for the  chamber.  </P> <P> Since its founding in 1888, the chamber has gone through periods of furious  activity followed by sleepy ineffectiveness.  </P> <P> Created to pull the city out of a business bust, the chamber manufactured the  early Los Angeles image of sunshine and health. One chamber advertising  campaign featured a "California On Wheels" train, carrying fruits, vegetables,  nuts and pitchmen. It toured the country, luring families to the Southland. In  another promotion, the chamber built a 1,200-pound elephant, "Jumbo," out of  walnuts.  </P> <P> The chamber had more to offer than advertising. It was a political force in  building the harbor and bringing in water from the Owens Valley. Decisions were  made by a few powerful chamber cronies who settled things over lunch at the  California Club in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But by mid-century, the city of Los Angeles was just one part of an economic  network that spread from the harbor and the airport through the Inland Empire,  and from Ventura through Orange County. Decisions at places like the Lockheed  plant in Burbank were more important than those made in the California Club.  </P> <P> So Remy and board supporters remade the chamber to fit the new political  realities. The board became more diverse, becoming 20% minority.  </P> <P> Remy also recognized that the fight against clean air proposals was more  complicated than anything faced by his early-day chamber predecessors.  </P> <P> All they had to do was fix matters at City Hall or bully a few key members of  Congress into voting for a harbor appropriation. But the chamber couldn't push  the AQMD board around. That's because it's not elected. Members are appointed  by cities, counties, the governor and legislative leaders and serve five-year  terms, designed to make them immune from political pressure.  </P> <P> So Remy's hoping to benefit from all those trips to Washington and Sacramento,  all those journeys on the small-city banquet circuit. He's got to find members  of Congress and legislators who'll write laws weakening the district's  regulatory power. He needs small-city officials to help persuade members of  Congress.  </P> <P> That's not easy in Southern California, where polls show people are willing to  make sacrifices to clean up the air. It's tough in Washington, too, where Remy  must confront the House's most influential clean air advocate, Rep. Henry  Waxman of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Remy's a lot smoother than his predecessors, the harbor and aqueduct builders.  He tries to avoid making waves. But in the end, Remy knowns this is no time for  consensus.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL REJECTS BASE CLOSURE LIMITS  </P> <P> The House Rules Committee has rejected an amendment that would have prevented  the government from closing some bases unless an audit found the savings to the  Pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of closure or reorganization.  </P> <P> The move means the amendment will likely be dropped next week when the House  considers the military construction bill. But the committee delivered a victory  Thursday to supporters of the Presidio, a San Francisco base that has been  ordered to close. Lawmakers will be allowed to offer an amendment that would  keep that base open.  </P> <P> Other California bases that might have benefited from the rejected amendment  are George AFB, Mather AFB, Norton AFB and Hunters Point Naval Station.  </P></p>

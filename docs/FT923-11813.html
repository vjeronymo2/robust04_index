			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / BA creates global giant with Dollars 750m USAir deal BRITISH AIRWAYS is buying a stake in USAir, the sixth biggest US airline, in a move that creates the world's biggest airline alliance. BA is paying Dollars 750m (Pounds 393m) initially for a stake of up to 44 per cent in USAir, to be held in the form of convertible shares. US regulations limit foreign ownership of voting shares so the British airline will only have 21 per cent of voting rights. The combined operation will link the world's biggest international air network with the sixth biggest US domestic network and will carry more passengers than any other airline. BA's biggest deal since it was privatised in 1987 closes a long and frustrating period for the company, providing a long-sought foothold in the huge north American market. 'We have been stalking a number of airlines for some time,' Lord King, non-executive chairman, said yesterday. 'The catchment area for BA is this little island. For USAir it is a very large part of the US.' It also throws a lifeline to USAir, which has incurred after-tax losses of Dollars 760m during the past two years and has debts of more than Dollars 2bn. But Mr Seth Schofield, president of USAir, denied that BA's capital injection was a rescue deal. 'We still had strong liquidity and we would have been a survivor,' he said. Investors in London and New York welcomed the deal. British Airways shares rose 10p to 268p in London and USAir shares closed up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 . Either BA or USAir can pull out if the deal is not completed by Christmas Eve this year. To ease the way through US anti-trust laws, BA will take over running USAir's few existing transatlantic routes. In the US, the deal will need clearance from the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation. Mr Schofield made clear that the carriers will argue the deal improves competition, creating a stronger rival to the three big US carriers - Delta, American and United. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United, the second biggest US carrier, said the deal presented 'a singular opportunity to achieve competitive breakthrough in air services between the US and Great Britain'. He forecast an expansion of US air carrier access to the UK. Mr Robert Crandall, head of American Airlines, echoed United's stance and offered conditional support for the deal. 'We have long advocated greater liberalisation of both investment and competitive opportunities for all international carriers,' he said. 'This proposal . . . seems consistent with the advocacy - assuming that the US government assures the availability of appropriate new competitive opportunities for US carriers.'

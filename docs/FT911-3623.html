			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Budgens board examines cost of restructuring proposals BUDGENS, the troubled chain of neighbourhood grocery stores, is asking Charterhouse to act as its financial advisers in addition to Kleinwort Benson after receiving restructuring proposals from a group of institutional shareholders. These proposals called for the removal of Mr John Fletcher as chairman and the appointment of new directors. Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP marketing services group, will now play a pivotal role in determining the Mr Fletcher's future. As the only non-executive director on the Budgens board, Mr Sorrell will have to consider the merits of the proposals put to the company by IEP Securities, Electra Investment Trust, and Gartmore Investment Management which between them account for 27 per cent of its equity. The proposals also envisaged bolstering the board through the appointment of three external executives: Mr John von Spreckelsen and Mr Christian Williams, who previously worked at Bowater Freight Services, and Mr Graham Rigby, an accountant. Budgens is currently inquiring into the experience of the three executives and considering what expertise they could bring to the company. The board is also exploring its options concerning the future funding of the company and how it can reduce its borrowings of Pounds 30m. One factor that will weigh heavily with the Budgens board is the cost of replacing Mr Fletcher. He has only recently signed a five-year contract and his pay last year amounted to Pounds 145,000. Coupled with pension payments it is conceivable that Mr Fletcher could receive more in a compensation package for loss of office than the shareholders will gain this year in dividends. But the three executives who may join the board will not come cheap as they are asking for a collective salary package of about Pounds 300,000 plus a number of share options. The prime mover behind the proposals is IEP Securities, the investment vehicle founded by Sir Ron Brierley, which bought into Budgens at the time of the company's merger discussions with William Low, the Scottish grocery chain, in 1989. IEP later bought further shares to average down the cost of its shareholding but it is still sitting on a huge loss. The average price it paid for its shares is estimated at 85p compared with Budgens' closing share price of 46p yesterday. The Budgens board will have to be careful not to be seen to favour one group of investors - however powerful they may be - above the other 23,000 shareholders.</p>

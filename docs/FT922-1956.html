			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sparbanken in SKr750m loss for first four months SPARBANKEN, the Swedish savings bank, has posted a SKr750m (Dollars 132.7m) operating loss for the first four months of the year after loan losses totalling SKr3.073bn, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The bank said yesterday that the deficit was in line with estimates made at the time of the Swedish government's SKr7.3bn bail-out of Forsta Sparbanken in April. The Swedish savings bank industry is going through drastic change. By the end of the year, Sparbanken will merge with 10 regional savings banks, the Stockholm-based Forsta Sparbanken and Swedebank. The aim is to streamline the industry by creating the largest savings bank in the country with SKr540bn in assets. By 1994, Sparbanken intends to cut costs by SKr2bn from a level of SKr9.5bn at the beginning of the year in an effort to achieve a 15 per cent profitability ratio.</p>

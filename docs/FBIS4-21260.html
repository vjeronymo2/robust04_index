			<p>Zamora,   Drug Trafficker   <F P=102> PY1904212694 La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1100 GMT  19 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY1904212694 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz Radio Fides Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Minister German Quiroga </F> by radio director Father Eduardo Perez Iribarne in La Paz --  live]    [Excerpts] Perez: Good morning Minister German  Quiroga. Would you like to clarify whether the telephones [of  ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora] were tapped or not and about the  Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise] telephone bills.  The entire country is listening. Go ahead.    Quiroga: Thank you; good evening Father. What I  showed on national television last night was a request made by  the narcotics prosecutor to Entel and Entel's answer on the  telephone bills. What we have are the Entel bills, both of the  telephones of [Isaac] Chavarria [drug trafficker] at his  property in Las Maras, Santa Cruz Department, and his house in  Irpavi. Therefore, there was no violation of any constitutional  regulation. We had no access to any kind of conversation and  this was clarified last night. All we did was to get the Entel  bills on the calls made, and this was made through a request by  the prosecutor. All the information including the telephone  bills will be submitted today to the Controlled Substances Court  and a legalized copy to the Constitutional and Chamber of  Deputies Judicial Police Committee, where the investigation is  being carried out.    Perez: I have a cable from the ERBOL [Bolivian  radio Schools] news agency on your interview by reporter Carlos  Mesa Guisbert last night on state television. Were the telephone  calls made only from 1990 to 1991; were there any calls after  1991 in 1992 or 1993?    Quiroga: The telephone calls were from 1989 to  1993. There are also two telephone bills after the presidential  term, in September 1993.    Perez: In other words, the telephone contacts  between Isaac Chavarria and ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora were  before, during, and after his presidential term.    Quiroga: What can really be proven through the  prosecutor's request is that El Picacho's [Paz Zamora's house]  telephone was called from Chavarria's telephone 10 times from  1989 to 1993.    Perez: You clearly said there was communication  between the two telephones and obviously due to Article 20 of  the Constitution it is not possible to know who talked on the  phones.    Quiroga: It cannot be established who talked from  each end of the telephones. The only thing that can be  established is that the two telephones were in contact. It also  can be established through the telephone bills how long the  calls were because the bills show the time and the amount. But  it will be impossible to establish who spoke on the phone.  [passage omitted]    Perez: As government minister you are the top  political authority in the country and must enforce the  Constitution on behalf of the president. Can you guarantee the  entire country that in Bolivia no telephones are tapped by  anyone and under no circumstances?    Quiroga: By anyone and under no circumstances from  the ethical and legal point of view. And also from the technical  point of view, we cannot do it because we do not have the  equipment in the ministry to do it. I invite you and the media  to visit the intelligence services to see that technically we  cannot do it. But we would not do it either because of legal and  ethical principles. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Brussels may keep eye out for UFOs The European Union, which at its last five summits has acknowledged its failure to bring Euro-doings 'closer to the citizen', is being offered the chance to plug another communications gap - by setting up an EU observatory to watch for unidentified flying objects. The proposal comes from the energy, research and technology committee of the European Parliament, which wants to turn France's Sepra space study unit in Toulouse into a fully fledged Euro-institution. The Italian nuclear physicist Mr Tullio Regge, who is responsible for producing the committee report, is understood not to believe in the 'metaphysics' of UFOs. The committee, however, notes that Sepra has reported 2,300 cases of UFO sightings in the past 15 years. Some were hoaxes, some could be explained rationally, but more than two-fifths could not easily be explained. A Belgian institution called Sobeps has logged 1,500 sightings based on reports to the gendarmerie, while the Italian air force reported 32 sightings last year. Some EU officials wonder whether Europe's putative ability to communicate with extra-terrestrials would compensate for its inability to reach its own citizens. Were the plan really to take wing, it might further complicate Europe's integration process. The eventual prospect of intergalactic integration, for instance, might severely tangle controversial Euro-issues such as subsidiarity - whether measures are most effectively taken at local, regional, national, pan-European, international, and now, interstellar level. On enlargement, more parochial officials among the existing 12 member states are already chary about taking into the Union four new Nordic and alpine countries from the European Free Trade Association, referring to them as 'Eftans'. It may be argued that it is premature to expect such member states to adjust to the idea of linking up with Martians so soon after Eftans. But the European Parliament committee insists that Europe should stop looking inwards and raise its gaze to new potential neighbours. 'The possibility that aliens have established a base in the asteroid belt cannot be ruled out,' it says.</p>

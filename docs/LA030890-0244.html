			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT PLACES NETS' SHACKLEFORD INTO PRE-TRIAL PROGRAM  </P> <P> New Jersey Nets forward Charles Shackleford was placed in a pre-trial  intervention program today at a court hearing into marijuana possession charges  against him.  </P> <P> Shackleford's attorney, Matthew Boylan, acknowledged that his client was  carrying marijuana when he was arrested March 1, but Shackleford did not enter  a plea under terms of state law that allows first-time offenders to enter a  pre-trial program.  </P> <P> The pre-trial program is designed to allow authorities to monitor Shackleford's  activities and does not involve substance abuse treatment or counseling, Boylan  said.  </P> <P> If the player successfully completes terms of the six-month program, a  disorderly person charge will be dropped and Shackleford's record cleared.  </P> <P> Shackleford, 23, is the focus of news reports about an investigation of an  alleged point-shaving scheme when he was at North Carolina State.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh parliament  speakers Babken Ararktsiyan and Karen Baburiyan said during the  meeting with Kyrgyz Parliament Speaker Medetkan Sherimkulov in  Bishkek Friday that they would take steps on their return home  to achieve a cease-fire in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict  zone.    Sherimkulov, who is also the chairman of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group for  Nagorno-Karabakh, told Interfax that both speakers had made the  pledge in response to his own call for a unilateral cease-fire  in the conflict zone beginning midnight on 9 May.    The cease-fire would, he said, involve an agreement like the  one which would have been achieved at the recent meeting in  Bishkek on 4-5 May (on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict)  had Azerbaijan not refused to sign the relevant protocol after  objecting to some of the document's items.    Sherimkulov announced that he would also meet with  Azerbaijani representatives and repeat his request for a  cease-fire from on 6 May.    He said the next round of talks on Nagorno-Karabakh would  take place in St. Petersburg at the beginning of June.    The Armenian speaker, who had been impressed by the Bishkek  meeting, assured Interfax in an interview that the Armenian  party would be "putting the protocol signed in Bishkek into  effect" unilaterally.    He stressed that the "Azerbaijanis have once again displayed  their unwillingness to solve the Karabakh issue by political  means." However, Ararktsiyan said he was hopeful that Baku would  appreciate that the conflict could not be resolved by force.</p>

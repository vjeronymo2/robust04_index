			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Ryszard Malik] </F>   [Text] After taking up the post of Polish diplomacy chief,  Andrzej Olechowski had not yet had an opportunity to present a  set of principles on which Poland's East policies are based.  This kind of opportunity presented itself with an invitation  issued by the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission where Minister  Olechowski spoke Thursday [17 February].    His speech was very concrete. The minister, who has been  talking from the beginning about a need for close cooperation  between politics and economics, outlined five programs for  specific cooperation with the countries from beyond our Eastern  border:    --"Contact" is a program that is designed to support the  development of human contacts, broadly speaking--individual,  interparliamentary, intergovernmental, interministerial, and  cultural contacts;    --"Associates" is a program of measures aimed at  establishing  mutual, capital-related associations which would strengthen  economic cooperation;    --"Wokulski" is a program designed to support Polish  exporters of merchandise and services;    --"Transit" is a program of measures for improving and  widening the infrastructure which would make it possible to  profit from Poland's beneficial geographical location;    --"Market and Democracy" is a program designed to cover  governmental and extra-governmental projects which will support  the development of market and democracy.    Polish East policies are without a doubt a continuation of  the policies of postcommunist governments. But since 1989, so  much has been happening beyond our Eastern border, that a  straightforward continuation of the policies applied up to now  is not possible. Besides, it turned out that while Poland has a  vision of a policy regarding its own security and that of the  region, Russia has no such vision. At least that was the  impression made after the "whole confusion" linked with  President Boris Yeltsin's Warsaw statement regarding our  membership in NATO.    We will be able to find out soon what kind of policy Russia  really wants to conduct vis-a-vis Poland and East and Central  Europe. The Russian foreign minister will talk about that in  Krakow next week--he has been invited to a Polish-Russian  conference called "In the Direction of a New Partnership," which  is being organized by the International Center for the  Development of Democracy.</p>

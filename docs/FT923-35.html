			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (2): Perhaps the worst is over - After a deep recession, there are signs that the economy is starting to recover THE Finnish economy is going through its deepest and longest recession for over 60 years. In 1991 the country's real gross domestic product plummeted by 6.5 per cent, the sharpest drop Finland has known this century in peacetime. There will be a negative growth rate - of at least a further minus 1.5 per cent - this year. Production in manufacturing sank by as much as 10.7 per cent last year while there was a 12.1 per cent decline in production in the construction sector. Unemployment, only 3.5 per cent in 1990, climbed to 7.6 per cent last year and is now over 14 per cent. This winter the number of jobless is expected to peak at about 350,000 or 15 per cent of the population. Finland's current account deficit will total FM18bn in the current year, 3.3 per cent of GDP. The collapse of the country's trade with the former Soviet Union has been particularly painful with a fall of no less than 65 per cent last year alone. The textile sector suffered a 30 per cent contraction in its exports as a result. The squeeze on living standards has been severe. With a rise of only 2.2 per cent in real earnings in 1991 and an expected zero increase this year, household real disposable income rose by 0.7 per cent last year and fell by 5.5 per cent in 1992. During this year, Finland has started to pull itself painfully out of its slump. 'Today we have rather a schizophrenic economy,' observes Dr Pentti Vartia, head of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (Etla). A number of key indicators suggests that the worst could be over: Last November's 12.3 per cent devaluation of the markka has helped the competitiveness of Finland's main export industries - pulp and paper and engineering. The volume of exports is likely to rise this year by 18 per cent. Although Finland's overseas markets - Sweden and Britain - have been sluggish, both Germany and France have provided good export opportunities. Over the first six months of this year the country's metal and engineering sector enjoyed a rise of more than 20 per cent in its export earnings to FM25bn. The recovery has been particularly noticeable in the electro-technical and electronic sector as well as transport equipment while the export of steel and metals also improved. The picture has been less satisfactory in mechanical engineering. Fimet, Finland's engineering federation, believes the demand abroad for goods from the country's metal and engineering sector will strengthen during 1993. This may compensate to a certain extent for the decline in the domestic market which looks like continuing into next year. Finland is likely to improve its labour productivity this year by 5.5 per cent and by a further 4 per cent in 1993, according to Ministry of Finance forecasts. There is expected to be an actual 0.5 per cent decline in real earnings next year with an 8 per cent fall in labour costs in manufacturing measured by unit of output this year, with a further decline of 1.5 per cent in 1993. Inflation is going to be at historically low levels with a rise in next year's consumer price index of 2.5 per cent, half of which will be caused by increases in indirect taxes and public charges. The price competitiveness of Finland looks impressive for once. But there is also a darker side to Finland's present economic outlook. Investment prospects remain bleak, according to the forecasts which suggest it may be 1994 before any upturn can be expected. As Etla says in its latest report: 'The commencement of investment activity is being hampered by the low capacity utilisation rate, high indebtedness and financing difficulties. The investment ratio will remain exceptionally low for several years and the capital stock will be reduced.' The biggest single economic headache for the Finnish government is the rapid escalation of its own debt. At the end of 1991 it amounted to 18.3 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With local authority spending, the debt amounted to 23 per cent of GDP, at FM117bn. This year it is expected to have risen to FM160bn. The projections for the next few years suggest that without a much tighter government fiscal policy the budget deficit and the funding of it will swallow up most of Finland's GDP by the middle of the decade. Why has the government's debt risen so fast? Part of the trouble stems from the decline in tax revenues as the recession has deepened. But Mr Aho, the prime minister, also blames the cost of financing rising unemployment and the banks' problems that have already forced the government to put aside about FM28bn to assist those in trouble. There is little doubt that the public sector grew too fast in the carefree 1980s. By Nordic standards, Finland has a relatively small public sector. This year it accounts for 48 per cent of total output but the trend of public consumption since 1970 has been ever upwards. Taxes have risen as a proportion of GDP from 31.1 per cent in 1970 to 37.1 per cent today. 'Ordinary people understand we cannot go on the way we were doing,' says Mr Iivo Viinanen, the country's finance minister. Mr Jaakko Iloniemi, head of the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy (Eva), agrees. 'There is a much greater national awareness of the need for radical adjustments,' he says. 'It is up to us to clear up our own mess.' Most policy-makers accept the country's public sector must be reduced but the troubles centre over the precise detail on what has to be cut. The government is working on a medium-term strategy to reduce its spending programmes up to 1995. Next year the cuts already agreed by ministers amount to FM18bn, 10 per cent less than in 1992 with further cuts proposed of FM20bn-30bn for 1994 and 1995. Mr Viinanen warns that this will mean slicing away at the state's large cash support for agriculture as well as a contraction in the value of many social benefits and financial support for local authorities. 'It is going to be hard to do this but anybody else would have to do the same,' he adds. 'The chickens are coming home to roost,' declares Mr Jarl Kohler, head of the forestry employers' association. 'There is now a good rapport between government and industry. We are talking constructively together now. Everybody accepts the reality.' Although the pulp and paper sector benefited competitively from last November's devaluation, Mr Kohler has no enthusiasm at all for the floating markka. The weak dollar has hit the industry, as 20 per cent of its business is invoiced in that currency. Forestry's foreign debts total an estimated FM30bn. At present, Finnish paper mills operate at only 81 per cent of capacity. Mr Kohler warns: 'We will only invest in new capacity when there is a market for the product and it is profitable.' Despite the turbulence of the markets and continuing anxieties over the financial sector, the Finnish economy should ease gradually upwards next year. Total output, according to government estimates, should improve by 3 per cent in 1993 with a continuing strong export performance. The current account deficit looks set to fall to around FM10.5bn next year, or 2 per cent of GDP. There is also expected to be a modest recovery in investment in machinery and equipment of around 2.5 per cent. Industrial production looks set to grow by 5.5 per cent next year with a particularly sharp improvement in minerals of 12.5 per cent and a 6.5 per cent increase in manufacturing. Inflation is set to rise slightly to 4 per cent through a further 10 per cent depreciation of the markka when it is eventually pegged again to the European Currency Unit. But Finnish average living standards will stagnate at best, if not decline further as unemployment stays high and domestic demand is squeezed. Wage 'flexibility' is expected to cut most real incomes despite a rise in labour costs of around 4 to 5 per cent in engineering and forestry. After the spread of financial chaos across the European money markets last month, Finnish policy-makers feel less harassed and apologetic about their decision to float the markka. They believe the European Commission in particular recognises they faced no alternative but to take such unorthodox action. However, Finland's economy remains more sensitive than most to the vagaries of the outside world. The size of the proposed government cuts package may go some way to calm the markets. But Mr Viinanen and his cabinet colleagues will need to show greater determination if they hope to convince the foreign exchange dealers that Finland is serious about coming to terms with more straitened times.</p>

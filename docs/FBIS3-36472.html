			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Before today most talk about the Estonian-Russian  talks focused on the fact that the Russian side failed to  present a timetable for its troop withdrawal. Some other  aspects have come to light today, however. In fact, in the  course of the 16th round of the Estonian-Russian talks an  agreement on the troop withdrawal from Estonia was almost  completely agreed upon. For the first time Estonia agreed  officially to the Russian proposal for the troops to be  withdrawn by 31 August of this year. This has been stated by  Juri Kahn, Estonian ambassador to Russia. According to Kahn the  only point in the agreement that remains unresolved is the issue  of financial compensation. This will have to be regulated at  the level of heads of state. The Russian side has, however,  (?stipulated) that they would agree to holding a summit only  once the Estonian side has ensured social protection for the  Russian military pensioners in Estonia, according to the  conditions set by Russia.    Considerable progress at this round of Estonian-Russian  talks  was achieved also concerning issues on dismantling the nuclear  reactors at Paldiski. According to ETA this was stated by Mark  Sinisoo, leader of the Estonian delegation's working group on  Paldiski and an adviser at the Foreign Ministry, at a news  conference today. According to him success achieved at the talks  in Moscow resulted directly from the conclusions made at the  conference held last week in Stockholm on the issue of Paldiski.</p>

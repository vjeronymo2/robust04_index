			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITING DIVERSE LATINO GROUPS  </P> <P> I dislike the term "Hispanic." Not only does it connote a non-existent unity,  but more importantly it goes against the principle of self-determination. It is  a government-concocted word that undermines the hard work of Chicano activists  of the 1960s and 1970s. Let us not forget that at the very heart of the word  Chicano was the belief that Mexican Americans should define for themselves who  they were and what they should pursue.  </P> <P> The term "Chicano" came about as a reaction against being considered hyphenated  Americans (as in Mexican-American) which in reality meant second-class  citizens. Yes, the hyphen has disappeared but in its place has come a new word  that reinforces and perpetuates the fact that Chicanos/Latinos/Mexicanos still  have no say over their own destiny.  </P> <P> ERNESTO CHAVEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POT ESTIMATE  </P> <P> It was with considerable amusement that I read your story regarding Mexico's  production of marijuana (Part A, Feb. 25).  </P> <P> I did some quick calculations (I had to do them longhand as my calculator ran  out of space) and came up with a total U.S., Mexico and Colombia annual  production of 124 million pounds, or approximately 2 billion ounces. That's  enough marijuana to keep every man, woman, child, and dog north of the Mexican  border in bliss well into the next century.  </P> <P> Either drug czar William Bennett thinks we're all so doped up that we can't  operate our calculators or he's got the whips and jingles so bad from tobacco  withdrawal that he can't operate his.  </P> <P> DAN RYAN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

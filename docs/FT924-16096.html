			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Safety functions may be contracted out THE government is considering the partial privatisation of the health and safety inspectorates, according to an internal Health and Safety Executive document. The HSE confirmed yesterday that the government had asked advisers to test the suitability of contracting out HSE regulatory functions. A programme of market testing in the HSE's internal legal services, graphics, press, publications and information departments began this year. Consultants are evaluating cost-effectiveness and the quality of provision. The new areas to be examined include the seven inspectorates, one of which is responsible for enforcing safety law at nuclear installations. Together they are responsible for inspecting hundreds of thousands of workplaces. Mr John Barrell of the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, whose journal Health and Safety Practitioner made the document public, said he did not think private companies would have the expertise to carry out HSE inspection and regulation functions.</p>

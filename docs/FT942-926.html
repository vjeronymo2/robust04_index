			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Tokyo adjusts to tempestuous times: William Dawkins says the downfall of Tsutomu Hata has far-reaching implications for Japan and its partners Japan's partners could be forgiven for feeling some alarm that the world's second largest economy has just dumped its fifth prime minister in five years. The forced resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata, one of Japan's more competent leaders, after just 59 days in office, has wider international repercussions than the departure of his predecessor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. The downfall of Mr Hata, a victim of Japan's latest series of political brawls, makes it possible that Japan will, for the second year running, send a lame duck head of government to next month's Group of Seven summit in Naples. It is a symbol of the new instability of what used to be one of the world's most stable political systems. Unless Japan's politicians achieve a miracle and pull together a strong coalition in the next few days, whoever represents Japan at the G7 will lack the authority to deliver a contribution to solving one of the world's biggest economic difficulties, the recent plunge of the dollar to record levels against the yen. Whoever holds the precarious top job in Tokyo - a caretaker Mr Hata or his successor - will have little chance of obtaining a pre-summit resolution of the dispute with the US over how to curb the huge Japanese trade surplus. This increases the risk of another surge of the yen on the foreign exchanges this morning, which would be an unwelcome blow to Japan's fragile recovery and, as a consequence, threaten the economic health of its trade partners. Already, Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister in the outgoing government, has had to cancel a weekend meeting with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, because of the axe hanging over his short ministerial career. Japanese trade negotiators report that it was becoming hard to make progress in talks with the US last week, because of political indecision in Tokyo. It is cold comfort to Japan's partners that the downfall of Mr Hata's government, the shortest-lived since 1945, was widely expected. The weekend's events were the latest stage in a chain reaction started by a corruption scandal which precipitated last summer's downfall of the Liberal Democratic Party, after 38 years in power. Yet wider forces are also at work, suggesting that Japan's partners should adjust to the fact that it may be only at the start of several years of wobbly coalition governments. The formerly stable structure of Japanese power has become unbalanced, argues Mr Kiyoaki Kikuchi, a former ambassador to the UN who is now senior adviser to Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics company. 'The collapse of the triangle of politics, business and the bureaucracy is greater than foreign observers might think,' he said in an interview last week. 'Now that one dominant party has ceased to exist, business no longer knows where to go for favours and bureaucrats feel there is no power centre . . . The whole cement of Japanese society has collapsed. It's very real.' Japan's influential bureaucracy has attempted to fill some of the vacuum created by the weak political leadership - and its influence may rise as a result of the latest government collapse. But not even Japan's civil servants can set the political agenda. They would hate to be seen trying to do so, judging by their hypersensitivity to criticism by the US and Japanese press. Mr Hata's departure has an air of tragi-comedy, which illustrates the unbalanced state of the nation described by Mr Kikuchi. His policies and personality are popular and all mainstream politicians agree that Japan needs a stable government now more than ever, to tackle its domestic economic problems, the rise of the yen and the North Korean nuclear threat. Mr Hata is untainted by allegations of corruption, unlike his predecessor Mr Hosokawa, brought down in April by LDP allegations of financial impropriety. Mr Hata is, however, tainted by his perceived closeness to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's brilliant but unpopular backroom strategist. But for better or worse, the end of Mr Hata's reign was inevitable. The LDP and Social Democratic Party, the second largest opposition group - both criticised for irresponsible behaviour in the Japanese press yesterday - had repeatedly warned they would launch a no-confidence motion as soon as parliament had passed this year's budget. The LDP saw a chance to return to power, while the SDP was partly motivated by revenge: the formation of a centre right bloc in the governing coalition caused the SDP to walk out of the Hata government, depriving it of a majority, just after it was formed in April. True to its word, the LDP swung into attack straight after the budget cleared Parliament last Thursday, delayed by three months because of the wranglings leading up to Mr Hosokawa's departure. It took less than two days, until Saturday morning, for Mr Hata to discover the SDP was asking an impossible price to come back into the coalition. It wanted Mr Hata's head, plus a watering down of the tax reform plans eagerly hoped for by G7 members at the July 8 summit to stimulate Japan's economy. After a 10-hour meeting with Mr Ozawa, a pale and exhausted looking Mr Hata announced on television that he would step down. Japanese business leaders were relieved that Mr Hata chose to sacrifice himself and leave it up to the opposition to form a new government, rather than fight it out in a general election. 'That was the best decision Mr Hata could make,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren economic federation. The ensuing one-month election campaign would have paralysed economic policy, worsening the existing upheavals on the foreign exchanges when the yen's recent rise already threatens a recovery in corporate profits. That, said Mr Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel, would have been the worst scenario for Japan. A majority of politicians agree that now is not the time for an election, as shown by a petition signed 10 days ago by 306 of the 511 members of the lower house of Parliament. They share Mr Saito's worries. Just as important, political funds are low after last year's general election and a judicial crackdown on corruption. An election would have also delayed, maybe even prevented, plans to introduce a more stable and representative political system, due to be ready by the autumn. The political reform scheme, supported by a powerful younger generation of politicians, but strongly opposed by the old guard, would encourage parties to win votes with policy ideas rather than favours. It marks a decisive push against the old-style backroom deal making that was taking place in Tokyo at the weekend, in an attempt to form a new government. The four bills needed to regulate political fundraising and introduce a mix of single seat constituencies and proportional representation to replace Japan's unique multi-seat districts, passed parliament in January. An independent panel is now at work on the final stage, drawing up new constituencies, which could be in place by the autumn, unless an early general election under the old system intervenes. The shape of the new order struggling to emerge from the chaos depends on whether Japan can form a government able to stay in office until the new electoral system is in place. By yesterday afternoon, the signs were that another unstable coalition could emerge in the next few days. Leaders of the LDP, New Harbinger Party, a centre-left LDP splinter group and the SDP said they might form an alliance, which would have a roughly 40-seat majority. This would be a curious turn of events, since the LDP and SDP were respectively in government and opposition for nearly four decades until last year. Such a coalition would be just as wobbly as the previous two, since the SDP's policies are even more distant from the LDP than from Mr Hata's alliance. Mr Hata's supporters, meanwhile, hinted that his resignation was a mere tactical retreat and floated the idea of a new coalition with reform-minded members of the SDP and LDP. In theory he could become prime minister again, following the example of former prime minister Mr Ichiro Hatoyama, who resigned and achieved instant reincarnation in 1955. Political observers believe several general elections, under the new system, will be needed before a stable two or three party balance emerges from the present ever shifting web of alliances between the record 11 parties represented in the lower house of parliament. Until then, expect the unexpected from Japan.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mohamed Loughali: "The Tazoult Prison Breakout: </F> 26 Escapees Killed and 114 Captured" -- first paragraph is EL  WATAN introduction]    [Text] The escape of close to a thousand prisoners from the  Tazoult prison represents the worst humiliation a government  could experience, a government whose absence in recent weeks in  the area of security had greatly eroded what little popular  support remained.    Almost one year to the day later, and using the same tactics  used at Boughzoul, the Tazoult prison, formerly Lambese,  supposedly an impregnable fortress, was attacked by an armed  group made up of about 100 individuals. The toll: the escape of  close to 1,000 prisoners, 64 of them from the high security ward  set aside for those sentenced to death, and 400 prisoners  serving life sentences.    Of the 1,000 escapees, 200 are ordinary prisoners if you  believe that the Islamic fundamentalists sentenced by the  special courts are not. Beyond the fact that this will mean that  the armed groups' capacity to do harm, which is already great,  will be increased by 1,000, it seems that the sophisticated  operation, from the organizational and timing points of view,  had three objectives.    The first aimed at freeing "mujahadeen" brothers locked up  in  government prisons to prove that that government was incapable  of operating on the road of God's will controlled by the armed  groups. The second aimed at swelling the armed groups' numbers  so as to prepare a new stage in the military action in order to  attack strategic, generally "well-guarded" targets.    And last, the choice of Tazoult was heavy with symbolism, in  which the megalomania of the emirs takes such delight. They  could have operated in Berrouaghia, where the number of Islamic  fundamentalist prisoners is the same.    They could have chosen El Harrach so the escapees could  blend  in more easily with city crowds. They opted for Tazoult because  it is the best protected prison and has a reportedly infallible  alarm system, has 200 guards, and that in 10 years has recorded  just one escape. But above and beyond all these obstacles, which  will feed the armed groups' invincibility myth and maintain the  feeling of terror that is paralyzing people, the choice of  Lambese might be explained by its proximity to Batna, the home  town of Zeroual, who, in their eyes, wants to stab the emirs in  the back by carrying on discussions with politicians who have  never left the sweet comforts of their living room or their  cell, depending.    Everyone had noticed this desertion by the state from the  scene. Some spoke of a tactical withdrawal, others of a  Machiavellian strategy to draw all of society into the  antiterrorist struggle. But for some as well as for others, the  Tazoult breakout is a slap in the face that will long echo in  the corridors of the presidency, the corridors of government  headquarters, or even those of the Ali Khodja barracks. In the  wake of the economic collapse, political improvisation, and the  suspicion weighing on its judiciary faced with its stubbornness  about not opening its corruption files, now this state is seeing  its institutions demonstrate their inability to manage the  detention of 3,000 law breakers.    The Lambese breakout challenges us in many ways. Even if we  granted that the few hundred attackers possessed some military  genius, the prison is supposed to be guarded by 200 security  guards.    Furthermore, if we remember the account given in the Justice  Ministry's communique, there were reported to have been one  guard killed, four others wounded, and seven carried off by the  attackers; if we add the two supposed accomplices, this would  produce a total of 14; so where were the 186 others?  <H5>  Revolt at the Constantine Prison </H5>   In addition, a trustworthy source has told us that the  operation's main instigator, whose identity has not been  revealed to us, is a prison guard who was supposedly thrown out  of the army because of assumptions that he belonged to the Said  Mekhloufi group, even if the proof was not there. The security  forces were reported to have informed the central prison  authorities on several occasions, in vain.    Here is another disturbing fact: the same authorities did  not  take seriously the warning that the revolt at the civilian  prison in Constantine gave them 15 days ago, to improve the  security forces around prison facilities, especially those  housing Islamic fundamentalists reputed to be dangerous.  Furthermore, it has been learned that instructions had been  issued at the Justice Ministry to avoid any concentration of  Islamic fundamentalists.    Apparently these instructions were not carried out. In a  normal country, a breakout on this scale, where there would be  no similar case, would have led to the resignation of the  minister of justice, but Algeria long ago ceased being a normal  country.    What is left is the war of the communiques. Nearly 72 hours  had to pass before a communique from the Justice Ministry would  make public information previously reported by AFP and picked up  by the national press.    The contents of the communique gave no precise figure for  the  number of attackers or the number of escapees, and even less  regarding their identities.    AFP's source spoke of 900 escapees and 150 attackers. From  Bonn, an Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] spokesman for his part  spoke of the escape of 1,684 "political prisoners from FIS's  base."    Officially the manhunt that began right after the end of the  armed operation led to the arrest of 114 escapees and attackers  whereas 26 others were reported to have been shot. The figures  given by the FIS are not very credible, since they refer to  there being some 350 prisoners sentenced to death among the  escapees.    Now the total of capital punishment sentences handed down by  the special courts amounts to 402, close to 300 of whom were  sentences in absentia. So the figure of 64 prisoners sentenced  to death seems the more credible one.    The search operations are being carried out mainly in the  Aures Mountains even if the FIS's spokesman has said that the  escapees have already spread throughout all of algeria. There is  talk of a large group that has reportedly been located in the  Jijel area and of another in the Laghouat area.    That is to say, the logistics required to make a success of  the operation.</p>

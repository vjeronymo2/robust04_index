			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GUITARIST WILLIAMS RETURNS TO AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> Making the routine sound fresh and inspiring may be one of the greatest gifts  for a musician. With guitarist John Williams' first Los Angeles appearance in  two years at the Ambassador Auditorium, Saturday and Sunday nights, this gift  was displayed in abundance.  </P> <P> Williams is still a remarkable musician whose playing remains a wonder. In his  hands, rapid passages flow effortlessly, melodies sing and difficult techniques  seemingly become child's play.  </P> <P> While his versatility finds him exploring jazz, popular music and new music, he  masters traditional repertory with similar confidence and authority. Standing  ovations and three encores greeted his Sunday performance of a half  Baroque/half 20th-Century program that the Australian-born, English guitarist  presented with low-volume amplification.  </P> <P> True, Williams has played the bulk of the music heard in these latest recitals  many times before: his own carefully wrought transcriptions of Scarlatti  Sonatas and the Chaconne from Bach's D-minor Partita, plus some flashy pieces  by Barrios. But he still commands every note with charm, every phrase without  seam and every piece with intelligence.  </P> <P> Interspersed with the familiar offerings were a few new undertakings,  highlighted by Toru Takemitsu's "Folios" (1974). Here, Williams approached the  mild dissonances, pulsating rhythms and koto-imitating stretches with delicacy  and special attention to sonority.  </P> <P> Two Post-Modern pieces by Leo Brouwer -- the overly sentimental, tonal  "Berceuse" and the more virtuosic "Danza Caracteristica" -- provided occasional  moments of interest. "Sunburst," by Glendale composer Andrew York, seeks a  popular, new age appeal that proved a bit commercial -- in the "Windham Hill"  sense of the word -- but provided some moments of admirable virtuosity as  well.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

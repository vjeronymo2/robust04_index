			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Polish broadcasters bid for TV contract Local private broadcasters have strengthened their chances of winning Poland's first national commercial television licence after three days of public hearings which ended yesterday. The companies are competing in Warsaw for the 10-year licence against multinationals such as the Bertelsmann group of Germany, Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) and Time Warner of the US, which have put in bids with local partners. The tone of the local applications contrasted with the bid from Bertelsmann, which has offered to invest Dollars 200m and makes little secret of the fact that it intends to control the venture. Time Warner, Capital Cities-ABC and CNN, which are making a joint bid, have taken a cautious approach with an overall initial investment worth Dollars 12m in their project valued at Dollars 50m. The group estimates that the project requires the construction of transmission equipment by Nexus, a UK company, worth Dollars 37m. By Polish law, foreign shareholdings in broadcast companies are limited to 33 per cent. The hearings saw Polsat, a 100 per cent locally owned station which is already broadcasting into Poland via satellite from Hilversum in Holland, arguing that the new channel should stay in Polish hands. The argument was echoed by Antena Polska, another applicant, which is controlled by ZPR, a privatised entertainment group which owns Superexpress, a profitable Warsaw daily, as well as a local radio station and several gambling establishments. The two groups which could merge to strengthen their bid, contend that the financing of around Dollars 70m needed for the channel can be raised on local capital markets while management expertise and programming can be brought in from abroad. The arguments appeared to be favourably received by the Radio and TV Council, a broadcast media regulatory body established under laws passed last year which removed the state's monopoly over the airwaves. A decision on the licence is due next month.</p>

The individual petitions are described below, including the parties seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 229, Locomotive Safety Standards, for locomotives used in switching service in Memphis, Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BN is seeking a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR 229.123 of the Locomotive Safety Standards_Pilots, snowplows, end plates_for locomotives used in the Tennessee Yard Terminal, Memphis. The BN is requesting that it be permitted to increase the height of the locomotive pilot above the top of the rail from the maximum allowable 6 inches to 9 inches. The BN states that with the pilots at the maximum height of 6 inches above the top of rail, both the pilot and the retarder equipment are being damaged when the locomotives go through the hump yard. This waiver would only apply to locomotives used exclusively for hump service in the Tennessee Yard Terminal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP), Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The UP is seeking a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 229, Locomotive Safety Standards, for locomotives used in switching service in all of its hump yards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The UP is seeking a waiver of compliance with &sect;229.123 of the Locomotive Safety Standards_Pilots, snowplows, end plates_for locomotives used in switch service in the hump yards located at Hinkle, Oregon, North Platte, Nebraska, North Little Rock, Arkansas, Ft. Worth, Texas, Pocatello, Idaho, and Los Angeles, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The UP and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) collectively own or lease 100 percent of the affected locomotives used in the hump yards. The UP is requesting that it be permitted to increase the height of the locomotive pilot above the top of the rail from the maximum permissible 6 inches to 83/4 inches in order to achieve sufficient clearance and avoid damage to the locomotives and retarders. With the pilots at the maximum permissible height of 6 inches above the top of rail, the pilot and the retarder equipment are being damaged when the locomotives go through the hump yard. This waiver would only apply to locomotives used exclusively in switching service in the hump yards. Further, the UP states that safety of its operations in hump yards will not be adversely affected. All affected locomotives will be brought back to the maximum permissible clearance of 6 inches before used in any other service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Northeast Illinois Railroad Corporation (Metra), Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;15 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Metra is seeking a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR 229.133 Locomotive Conspicuity, Minimum Standards for Auxiliary External Lights (ditch lights), for passenger equipment used in the Chicago metropolitan area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metra owns the former Rock Island, Milwaukee Road and Illinois Central Commuter service and oversees, through the purchase of service agreements, the Chicago and North Western, Norfolk Southern (Southwest Service) and Burlington Northern Computer Service. Metra has a fleet of 134 passenger locomotives, 7 switcher locomotives, 165 electric multiple unit locomotives (M.U. locomotives) and 161 non-M.U. control cab locomotives (cab car) which fall under the jurisdiction of 49 CFR 229.133. Metra has developed schedules and placed material purchase orders to install ditch lights on its passenger equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metra is seeking a waiver from the interim rule requirement for the minimum height of the ditch lights on 165 MU locomotives, which are currently being rebuilt. Section 229.133(b)(1) requires that two ditch lights shall be placed at the front of the locomotive, not less than 36 inches nor more than 84 inches above top of rail. Metra says that the ditch lights will be installed at a height of 25 inches above top of the rail, which is below the FRA minimum of 36 inches. Further, at this height the lights have proven to be very conspicuous. Metra states that a higher location on these MU locomotives would present an unnecessary financial burden that would not measurably enhance or improve the conspicuity of the ditch lights. The burden would be attributable to extensive carbody and control cab modifications necessary to adapt the car body structure for the mounting of recessed ditch lights at the 36 inch minimum height. Further, Metra states that one route is parallelled on both sides by public streets, and separated by concrete barriers. If the height of the ditch lights was raised above 25 inches above top of rail, the lights would be directed into the line of sight of vehicles traveling next to the track and could contribute to motor vehicle accidents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing.

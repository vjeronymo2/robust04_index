			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the co-chairmen  of the coordination committee of the international conference on  Yugoslavia have spoken in favor of holding urgent consultations  between special representatives of Russia, the United States,  the United Nations, and the European Union in order to work out  a common stance on the Bosnian settlement. They held talks in  Moscow today.    Simultaneously, Kozyrev had a telephone conversation with  Warren Christopher, suggesting to him that an American  representative be sent to these quadrilateral consultations.  The U.S. secretary of state has so far neither accepted nor  rejected the proposal.    The result of the consultations should be a concrete plan  for  a postwar structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will then be  discussed at a quadrilateral summit and presented to the  conflicting sides.</p>

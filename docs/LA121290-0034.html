			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> DRUNK DRIVERS TO BE BILLED BY POLICE  </P> <P> Fillmore will try to recover the costs of drunk-driving arrests, the City  Council decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> Local police will bill convicted drivers for the time spent processing each  offense.  </P> <P> The fee will be charged when the case is filed, and defendants who are found  innocent will be issued a refund, said Lt. Dick Purnell of the Ventura County  sheriff's office in Fillmore. Purnell said 134 people were arrested for driving  under the influence in the city last year.  </P> <P> Officers spend an average of three hours on each arrest, he said. Their time  will be billed at $29 per hour. The new $120 fee now charged to cities for  booking suspects into the county jail will be included in Fillmore's costs, for  a total of about $207 per drunk-driving offense.  </P> <P> The city's charges will be levied in addition to any fines or other penalties  related to the conviction.  </P> <P> Purnell said that the city is charged a booking fee most often for  drunk-driving arrests. The ordinance will take effect in mid-January. He said  the department also is researching cost recovery for other crimes. JANET  BERGAMO  </P></p>

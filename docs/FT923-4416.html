			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / UK airline passengers to clear US immigration in London ALL airline passengers flying to the US from London's two main airports will clear American immigration before leaving Britain following a UK-US agreement to ease border controls, the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service said at the weekend. The move, backed by the airports operator BAA and involving all scheduled airlines flying from Heathrow or Gatwick to the US, follows a separate UK commitment last week to relax border controls for European Community nationals. Under the scheme, due to be launched early next year, US officials will check passports at airport departure gates so that passengers will be officially 'admitted' to the US while still in London. Negotiations are continuing in London between INS officials, the Home Office and BAA to iron out any remaining difficulties following 'pre-inspection' experiments last year. BAA officials said they welcomed any move to ease congestion but were anxious to avoid importing the problems of long US immigration queues to London. Minimum standards for immigration control, meanwhile, have been introduced at Heathrow. 'EC nationals should queue for no more than three minutes and non-EC nationals for no more than 10 minutes,' BAA officials said. BAA is seeking flexibility in staffing to increase the number of immigration officers on duty at peak times. Fixed shifts for airport security staff have been abandoned but similar moves for Home Office employees could encounter union opposition. The INS is recruiting non-union immigration officers to oversee introduction of the US scheme, which it hopes will be fully operational by spring 1993. Mr Richard Kenney, chief of INS public affairs, said passengers arriving from Britain would avoid queues caused when several flights arrive at a US hub close together. The costs of the scheme are expected to be passed on to airline passengers, who will pay a Dollars 5 (Pounds 2.50) ticket surcharge, Mr Kenney added. While welcoming the immigration initiatives for US-bound travellers, American executives have called for reciprocal arrangements at US airports. 'Business travellers would like to clear UK immigration in the US. If they could avoid the lines at Heathrow they would jump at it,' said Mr Joe Brancatelli, executive editor of Frequent Flier, the New York magazine published by Official Airline Guides and distributed to 320,000 US businessmen. The Home Office in London said it would consider such proposals but had not received any formal applications from airlines for such a scheme. Travel without hindrance, Page 7</p>

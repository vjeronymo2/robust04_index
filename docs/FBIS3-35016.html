			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pascal Lacorie in Jerusalem: "Middle East -- </F> France Backs Palestinians"]    [Text] France will help the future Palestinian economy as  it takes its first steps. This is especially necessary as the  first year may well be the most hazardous. The Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO), which is practically bankrupt,  will need to set up a civil service and to launch industrial  projects in order to create jobs. Today, Alain Juppe will be  able to see firsthand the huge task that lies ahead during his  visit to the Gaza strip -- the first such visit by a French  foreign minister.    "The international aid which has been pledged must reach  Gaza  as soon as possible," Alain Juppe has said repeatedly. As for  France, it is already taking action: A delegation from the  Finance Ministry spent some time in the West Bank and the Gaza  strip last week and is scheduled to go to the PLO's Tunis  headquarters within the next few days. Its goal: To identify  projects to be funded by a Fr60 million aid package. Use of the  funds should include training of experts, technical assistance,  and purchase of French equipment. Another Fr20 million [francs]  will be allocated for low-interest loans to Palestinian firms.  <H5>  Market Marginal So Far </H5>   France has also pledged to provide almost one quarter of the  Fr3.6 billion the European Union has said it will grant the PLO  for the next five years. In total, international aid will  amount to over Fr12 billion, enough to attract French firms.  Indeed, CNPF [National Council of French Employers] President  Francois Perigot stated at the end of last year -- on the  occasion of a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat -- that French firms  did wish to be present.    French firms interested in the new market include France  Telecom, Bouygues, Spic-Batignolles, and Lyonnaise des Eaux.  France-2 has been chosen to set up the future Palestinian  television network.    So far, the Palestinian market has been marginal. French  exports there did not exceed Fr200 million in sectors such as  home appliances, medical equipment, and textile and chemical  products.    Alain Juppe did not seek to minimize the hurdles that remain  to be overcome. According to the French minister, the  Palestinians must organize themselves in order to channel and  manage the flow of aid. "The PLO is a political organization  which is unfamiliar with such tasks," he explained in an  interview with the Israeli daily HAARETZ. This comment referred  to the reservations expressed by the World Bank, the European  Union, and the United States as to the high proportion of  "political" officials among the members of the Palestinian  Economic Council set up by the PLO and chaired by Yasir 'Arafat  himself.</p>

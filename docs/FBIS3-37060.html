The course of reforms and the plan of measures aimed at  implementing them was adopted in August last year at a sitting  of the Council of Ministers and endorsed by the president. This  course remains unchanged, the statement says. A working group  has been set up by the government to draw up a plan of urgent  and high priority measures and actions for this year. It is  headed by Sergey Vasilyev, deputy economics minister. It  examines every proposal submitted by scientists and  industrialists irrespective of their stance, the statement by  Sergeyev notes. The group will submit a corresponding document  to the head of the government having taken into account the  proposals and a message from the Russian president to the  Federal Assembly, which is to be made public on 18 February.</p>

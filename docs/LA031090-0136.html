			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> EDITED VERSION OF SCHOOL PLAY ALLOWED  </P> <P> The principal of El Dorado High School will allow the school's drama students  to perform an edited version of a play about a young woman with cerebral palsy,  reversing a decision he made earlier this week banning the production.  </P> <P> But Principal Richard Bernier said the decision to allow the play, "They Dance  Real Slow in Jackson," should not be interpreted as a move toward "more lenient  policy on school plays."  </P> <P> "The final editing right shall be mine," Bernier said. "I certainly will  continue to push for more family-type plays."  </P> <P> Bernier first objected to the play because of its sexual innuendoes and  profanity. He decided to allow the play only after making changes in the script  to eliminate some of the harsh language and explicit scenes. Drama teacher Gai  Jones said the changes do not take away from the play's message.  </P> <P> And both Bernier and the drama students, who supported the original version of  the play, said the incident has helped improve campus relations.  </P> <P> "I think we'll always have conflicting ideas," Jones said. "But at least we can  be negotiable so that in the future it won't have to reach the levels it did  this time."  </P> <P> Senior Melissa Frydman, who spearheaded the student campaign to preserve the  original version of the play, said: "I'm really pleased that Mr. Bernier  listened to us. . . . I hope it means that he won't come out again and flat-out  say no."  </P> <P> Problems arose Monday when Bernier said he had not read the entire play but had  decided to ban it and would not consider reading an edited version.

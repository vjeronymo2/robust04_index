			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> VOLUNTARY WATER SAVING IS REQUESTED  </P> <P> The City Council, calling for a voluntary conservation effort, has passed an  ordinance asking residents to reduce water consumption by 10%.  </P> <P> "Residents are asked to cut their usage by 10% any way they can," city public  information officer Mike Maxfield said.  </P> <P> "Water conservation kits and a list of suggestions are available at the finance  desk at the civic center."  </P> <P> If the voluntary effort does not produce the desired reduction, and if the  drought continues, Maxfield said, the city may be forced to regulate the times  and dates of lawn watering.  </P> <P> The city has not set a time frame for evaluating whether the voluntary effort  is successful.  </P> <P> City officials said they might also regulate water usage by prohibiting the  washing of cars and the hosing down of sidewalks.  </P> <P> Maxfield said the city will use July, 1989, water usage as a baseline for  determining cutback levels.  </P> <P> If mandatory cutbacks are initiated, that usage will probably also be used to  establish penalties for residences that don't achieve a 10% reduction.  </P> <P> "There will be some sort of appeal process for those who have already cut back  usage," Maxfield added.

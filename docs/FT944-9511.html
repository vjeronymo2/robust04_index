			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sony Music wary after first-half drop Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) is cautious on future earnings after it posted a drop in both parent and group earnings in the first half, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Foreign exchange market instability and cuts in capital investment in Japan were cancelling out rises in consumer spending and a bottoming-out in corporate earnings, it said. In the six months to September, Sony Music, which is 71 per cent owned by the consumer electronics group Sony Corp, reported a 5 per cent fall in parent recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y9.41bn (Dollars 96.5m). Group recurring profits in the six months were Y10.61bn, down 16.4 per cent. But for the full year to March 1995, Sony Music forecast parent recurring profits of Y20.3bn against Y19.84bn a year earlier, and group recurring profits of Y23bn against Y25.8bn For the parent company, new releases by top Japanese and overseas artists is likely to boost earnings. But the higher-than-expected cost of setting up two record companies this year and falling sales at a sports goods subsidiary will hit group earnings. A decline in sales of Japanese-language records and earnings from financial investments as well as a rise in the company's tax bill hurt first-half earnings.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Actor Rex Harrison, 81, made it through two acts of W. Somerset Maugham's 1921  play "The Circle" Wednesday night in Baltimore, but was unable to finish  because he was suffering pain from dental surgery. The audience was told he was  unable to continue and an understudy took over. The play is headed for Broadway  on Nov. 20 with Harrison, Glynis John and Stewart Granger as the stars.

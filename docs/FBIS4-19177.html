			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Caligaris: `NATO Is Getting It </F> Wrong'"]    [Text] Rome -- The NATO bombing of Gorazde and its policy  toward the former Yugoslavia were the center of attention  yesterday for the victors of the 28 March elections. First to  comment was former General Luigi Caligaris, who could assume a  post (foreign affairs or defense) in a future Berlusconi  government. Caligaris stated that he was against NATO  intervention in the skies over Bosnia: "The deterrence function  of NATO aircraft above Gorazde," Caligaris stated, "has no  influence once the situation on the ground is uncontrollable.  The political world," the general added, "must show that it is  willing to intervene in this situation. However, it does not  wish to risk a ground operation which, at the present time, no  one is in a position to undertake." The United States itself,  according to Caligaris, is afraid of getting mixed up in an  operation which could last for years and result in a large  number of human casualties. The sole solution to the problem  should come, in the opinion of the Forza Italia expert, from a  political intervention aimed at the protagonists, "as is  currently being done."    The Northern League, on the other hand, has come out in  favor  of a hard line in Bosnia and "approves and supports  Butrus-Ghali's and NATO's firmness in having the UN ultimatums  respected." Christian Monti, League foreign affairs spokesman,  stated that "the NATO bombardments of Gorazde are nothing more  than the logical and necessary implementation of the UN  resolution, following the umpteenth violation by the Serbs of  the ultimatum issued to safeguard the Bosnian community."    Meanwhile, Forza Italia parliamentarians meeting in Fiuggi  yesterday approved an agenda reminding the Ciampi government of  the need "not to prejudice, by irreversible actions, the  question of Slovenia and Croatia's accession to the European  Union." The agenda, promoted by Antonietta Vascon, an Istrian  refugee and deputy for Trieste, emphasizes that this is a  question which "involves" the rights of 350,000 exiles from  Istria and Dalmatia and Italian minorities in these states.  Forza Italia reminded the government "of its duty to stick  strictly to day-to-day administrative responsibilities."  According to Forza Italia, "the government which is in power  for a few days longer, and which is an expression of political  balances that have been displaced by the popular vote, has, in  recent weeks, made decisions which prejudice, at times  irreversibly, questions which are delicate and frequently  crucial to future developments." For this reason the Forza  Italia parliamentarians "give warning that this practice must be  stopped immediately out of respect for the most elementary  democratic principles." "Very great satisfaction" at Vascon's  agenda, also supported by Berlusconi, was expressed by lawyer  Paolo Sardos Albertini, president of the Federation of Istrian,  Fiume, and Dalmatian exiles.</p>

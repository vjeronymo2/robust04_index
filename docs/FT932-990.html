			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lucas on target with its divestment programme AN EXPERIMENT in glasnost by Lucas Industries, the engineering group, passed off uneventfully yesterday. Lucas told a party of 26 stockbroking analysts that the group's divestment programme was on target to raise Pounds 75m within the current financial year and that Lucas Acoustic Instruments had been added to the list of disposal candidates. Those were the principal pieces of new information to emerge from the visit, during which Lucas executives were at pains to give a message of 'encouraging progress and no surprises'. The shares closed unchanged at 136 1/2 p. The company nevertheless put out a 700-word statement to the Stock Exchange at 4pm yesterday, so as not to be accused of feeding analysts price-sensitive information. Last week the share price fell after analysts who attended a company dinner at the Paris Air Show took away a bleak impression of current trading conditions - particularly in the European brakes business. Mr Bernard Carey, director of corporate communications, said the analysts were told that Lucas did not want to take any questions on profit forecasts or the dividend outlook. The statement, said Mr John Grant, finance director, reported that although markets were tough and Lucas had taken a prudent view for planning purposes, most of the company's market segments were relatively strong. Lucas had made useful gains in new business and market share throughout the recession and cost reductions would more than offset falls in volume and price pressures.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Investing in France  -Agencies are preparing campaigns for the first wave of a privatisation drive It sounds like a marketing nightmare. Over the next few days Andre de Marco must finalise the preparations for one of the most important product launches in his company's history. Yet he still does not know exactly what he will be selling, or when it will go on sale. The product is a block of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals company, the French government hopes to sell this autumn in the first phase of its privatisation drive. Unfortunately for de Marco, Rhone-Poulenc's director of communications, the economy ministry will wait until the last moment to announce the size and date of the sale. 'With an ordinary marketing campaign you are able to choose the best possible time to make sure that conditions are right,' he says. 'But we have no control over the timing of our issue, or over whether the government will sell its full 43.4 per cent stake. All we can do is make sure that everything is ready to go anytime from early September.' Rhone-Poulenc is not alone. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the other first-phase candidate, is also putting the finishing touches to its marketing campaign. Even companies earmarked for sale in the second phase, likely to be early next year, such as the Elf Aquitaine oil group, are now starting to plan the marketing of their issues. These companies not only need to ensure that they attract enough interest to sell all the shares, but that the stock ends up in the right hands to create a stable base of shareholders. The marketing of the issues will play a critical part in this process through mainstream advertising to the public and through specialist communications to institutional investors in France and other countries. The specialist programme is likely to be the most straightforward. Most of the privatisation candidates are large, international groups which have a small percentage of their equity in public issue. They have already invested heavily to build up a core of institutional shareholders and to ensure they are well known in the international financial community. 'French companies have made tremendous progress in communicating with international investors,' says Joe Hall, head of international sales at Warburg Securities in London. 'The first catalyst was the mid-1980s privatisation drive, but things have really improved over the last three or four years when foreign institutions have become major investors in France.' The most expensive, and challenging, aspect of privatisation marketing is advertising to the public. There is no real tradition of private share ownership in France and the 1987 stock market crash brought the mid-1980s vogue for equity investment to an abrupt halt. The economics ministry says it may consider a follow-up to this summer's successful Balladur bond advertising campaign to encourage investors to convert bonds into privatisation shares, but it has no plans to promote share ownership as such. This means the privatisation candidates must not only sell themselves, but also try to popularise the concept of share ownership. Elf has already started. It has expanded the corporate advertising campaign originally planned for this summer. The campaign, devised by the Euro-RSCG agency, features posters of childhood snapshots of mythical Elf employees. The company has added an extra picture of 'Louis, an Elf shareholder' to highlight the forthcoming share sale. Elf is preparing to choose an agency to handle the main privatisation campaign. However, its scale will be determined by how much of its 50.7 per cent stake the government decides to sell. If the issue is small Elf may concentrate its efforts on the institutions as it did for the partial privatisation. BNP caused a stir in the Paris advertising world last week by choosing BDDP, one of the most dynamic new French agencies to have emerged in the 1980s, rather than its long-standing agency, Euro-RSCG. The choice of BDDP, which worked for Michel Pebereau, the BNP chairman, on CCF's privatisation advertising, is expected to herald a new image for BNP, one of France's most traditional banks. The group plans to reinforce its advertising efforts by an extensive direct mail campaign to its 60,000 employees and 4.7m account holders to familiarise them with Pebereau's new strategy and to encourage them to buy its shares. Rhone-Poulenc last week helped to console Euro-RSCG for the loss of the BNP account by appointing the agency to handle its privatisation advertising. Like Elf, Rhone-Poulenc's efforts will depend on the ultimate size of the issue. One of its main aims is to attract more individual investors. It currently has 100,000 private shareholders who own less than 1 per cent of its total equity. 'If we want to build a well-balanced shareholder base we've got to attract more individual investors,' says de Marco. 'Privatisation provides an ideal opportunity. But it won't be easy. Most people in France know the name Rhone-Poulenc, but they're not really sure what we do.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Koichiro </F> Matsuura by reporter Masami Kagei of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Tokyo  Economic News Department; place and date not given]    [Text] Since the breakup of the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks at the Hosokawa-Clinton summit on 11 February,  the United States is urging Japan's market liberalization  measures by threat of economic sanctions. Why were economic  frictions intensified so badly between Japan and the United  States? What should the two nations do for relaxing the  friction? We interviewed Japanese and U.S. negotiators,  business leaders, and intellectuals.  <H5>  Japan Offered a Concession Plan </H5>   [Kagei] The economic framework talks showed very delicate  development in the final stage, and the United States reportedly  offered a concession plan for reaching an agreement on  microeconomic subjects. Could you describe a little bit about  that?    [Matsuura] On the evening of 9 February, Assistant to the  U.S. President Bowman Cutter verbally conveyed to us an informal  concession plan. We thought "the two nations may be able to  reach an agreement," but that offer did not come up in formal  conversations. I guess there were various opinions even in the  U.S. Government.    [Kagei] Did not Japan make any drastic proposal?    [Matsuura] In the final stage of the negotiations, we  offered a plan to use figures in objective criteria for  government procurement. That was a drastic proposal which  contained something more than the number and the amount of  biddings to be opened -- but I cannot disclose the proposal now  since development of the negotiations is still uncertain. In  addition, we were ready to comply with a U.S. demand for a  commitment on "maintaining past trends of import growth."  However, we would not have a chance to convey this since the  United States made no proposal.    [Kagei] In short, what is the reason for the breakup of the  framework talks?    [Matsuura] The primary reason is that we could not reach an  accord on what should be used for objective criteria to measure  the degree of market liberalization. But this was caused by  lack of mutual understanding. We were supposed to agree on why  the trade imbalance is growing between the two nations.  Nevertheless, we started negotiations without such common  ground.  <H5>  Discord on Agreement </H5>   [Kagei] What was the conflicting point between the two  nations?    [Matsuura] U.S. negotiators said "over 30 bilateral  agreements concluded between Japan and the United States are not  working well with a few exceptions, and this is why the trade  imbalance is getting bigger." But the opinion stands on two  false premises. First, most bilateral agreements, including  procurements by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company (NTT),  beef, and oranges, are working quite well. Second, the trade  imbalance is primarily caused by macroeconomic factors --  Japan's oversaving and U.S. overconsumption -- rather than  market policies in individual fields. Even American economists  say so. Unfortunately, however, the two governments could not  agree on the two points.    [Kagei] If you say macroeconomic policies are more important  for redressing the trade imbalance, the government's  announcement of a 6-trillion-yen [Y] income tax reduction  effective for one year is probably inadequate. What is your  comment on that?    [Matsuura] Please let me make one thing clear. In the  macroeconomic negotiations last July, both Japan and the United  States made commitments. Japan promised highly significant  reduction of its trade surplus in a mid-term period, but the  United States also said it would cut fiscal deficits in a  mid-term period. We must not forget about the U.S. promise.    Unfortunately, the United States did not show understanding  of our tax reduction plan, but it is inappropriate to discuss  further measures right now. At present, Japan should think  about how it can steadily implement the Y15-trillion  pump-priming package. The United States would understand  Japan's efforts when the package brings about a recovery of the  Japanese economy.    [Kagei] Are you really taking things so easy?    [Matsuura] The results cannot be obtained in a couple of  months, but Japan's commitment is to reduce the trade surplus  "in a mid-term period." In my understanding, a mid-term period  normally means four to five years. Even U.S. Ambassador to  Japan Walter Mondale said, in a 24 February interview with NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN, it is important for Japan to cut the trade  surplus in a mid-term period.  <H5>  2.8 Percent -- It Is Not an Objective </H5>   [Kagei] In a recent speech, you said "Japan's task" is to  realize the government's estimate that Japan's trade surplus  will become 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) within  fiscal 1994....    [Matsuura] What I meant is Japan should steadily go ahead to  fulfill the commitment to reduce the trade surplus in a mid-term  period. The figure, 2.8 percent, itself is not a goal, but an  estimate.    [Kagei] What are Japan's future tasks in the microeconomic  field?    [Matsuura] The cabinet held a meeting on international  economic issues on 25 February. Since Prime Minister Hosokawa  is emphasizing the deregulation policy, the government must  promote the policy as soon as possible. Regarding macroeconomic  policy, we should implement the pump-priming package, and, in  microeconomic policy, we must open markets through deregulation  measures. Japan's task is to promote the two policies at the  same time.    [Kagei] What is your comment on U.S. moves to seek economic  sanctions against Japan?    [Matsuura] I have no comment right now because it depends on  the future development of the issue. Generally speaking, it is  logically funny to discuss counteractions before settling  negotiations.</p>

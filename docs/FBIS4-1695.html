			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 3 (XINHUA) -- China is stepping up  preparations to host the Fourth World Women's Congress (FWWC)  slated for 1995 in Beijing.    Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary-general of the State Council  and  vice-chairman of the China Organizing Committee for the FWWC,  told reporters that the Chinese Government and leaders of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) regard the preparations for the  congress as important.    Chinese leaders, including Hu Jintao, Chen Xitong, Qian  Qichen, Chen Muhua and Peng Peiyun, have regularly heard  progress reports on the preparatory work of the China Organizing  Committee.    Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and also a member  of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said after  listening to a progress report that the holding of the FWWC in  China demonstrates that the world status of China under the  opening-up drive and reform has been improving.    "We must make concerted efforts to make a success of the  FWWC," he said.    Qian Qichen, vice-premier and also minister of foreign  affairs, said that by holding the congress the country would  demonstrate to the world that reformed, open China is now  enjoying social prosperity.    Chen Xitong, secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal  Committee, said that the city would carry out the preparations  well to ensure a smooth holding of the FWWC in the capital.    Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress and also president of the All-China  Women's Federation (ACWF), urged women all over the country to  make concerted efforts to make a success of the FWWC.    According to Xu, an estimated 20,000 foreign delegates are  expected to attend the congress.    Major conference sites, expected to accommodate tens of  thousands of people, have been chosen. The drafting of  important documents or reports has been finalized or completed  ahead of schedule, and a publicity campaign has been launched.    Some 12,000 guest rooms at luxury hotels have been booked to  accommodate more than 20,000 congress participants.    FWWC Secretary-General Gertrude Mongella and her party  expressed satisfaction with the service facilities after they  visited Beijing as leaders of a United Nations inspection  delegation last June.    About 30,000 women from 28 provinces, autonomous regions or  cities, including 1,000 officials, have been trained for the  congress or for the implementation of the strategies for the  advancement of women set by the last congress.    About 1,500 women delegates representing all nationalities  across China will participate in meetings associated with the  FWWC and a non-governmental organizations forum. About 20,000  people are expected to attend the forum, to be held before and  during the main congress.</p>

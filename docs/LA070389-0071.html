			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUAN POLICE BREAK UP SKIRMISH BETWEEN SANDINISTAS AND FOES AFTER MARCH  </P> <P> Riot police intervened Sunday to separate dozens of Sandinista and opposition  activists who rushed at each other in downtown Leon after a march by 1,200  people seeking the Sandinista government's electoral defeat.  </P> <P> Nobody was injured or arrested in the few brief skirmishes that occurred, but  the incident was a sign that the campaign for national elections next February  could be as physical as it is political.  </P> <P> Leon, 53 miles northwest of Managua, was a guerrilla stronghold during the  Sandinista-led uprising that toppled the dictatorship of President Anastasio  Somoza. The leftist Sandinista Front, which is marking its 10th anniversary in  power this month, and the 14-party National Opposition Union had police permits  to march along different routes of the city's cobblestone streets to separate  destinations.  </P> <P> The confrontation started when dozens of young Sandinistas strayed from their  route and fell in step behind the opposition parade, taunting the marchers.  </P> <P> "We won power with arms in our hands, so we have a right to these streets,"  said a 25-year-old Sandinista combat veteran who identified himself only as  Manuel. "We are here to repudiate these people, who are trying to deceive the  people and bring back Somocismo (the Somoza dictatorship)."  </P> <P> "What is the vanguard of the people?" chanted Manuel and his companions. "The  Sandinista Front!"  </P> <P> But the opposition marchers kept moving, livened by brass bands, firecrackers  and insults against the Sandinistas at their heels. "What do the people want?"  they shouted. "For the front to go away!"  </P> <P> A brief scuffle erupted when a young woman in the opposition camp tried to grab  a red-and-black Sandinista banner, but security people on both sides kept order  until the marchers reached a Gothic-style Roman Catholic church at the end of  the mile-long route.  </P> <P> There, in the 91-degree midday heat, groups of 50 to 100 people on each side  charged at each other until helmeted Sandinista police with shields and clubs  intervened. Capt. Ernesto Cuadra, the police chief in Leon, intervened  personally to stop at least two fistfights and finally ordered the Sandinista  militants to withdraw.  </P> <P> Then, at the urging of the police, an opposition organizer used a police car  megaphone to instruct anti-government marchers to withdraw, and both crowds  slowly dispersed.  </P> <P> Violent harassment by Sandinista gangs known as turbas marred the 1984 election  campaign, prompting the largest opposition coalition to withdraw. Duilio  Baltodano, a leader of Sunday's march, said the return of the turbas shows that  the Sandinistas "don't have the political will to respect the electoral  process."  </P> <P> But another opposition leader, Ulises Somarriba, declared that the marchers had  won a victory because "the Sandinistas tried to run us off the streets or to  provoke violence, but they failed."  </P></p>

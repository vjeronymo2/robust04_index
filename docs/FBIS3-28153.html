			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] plans to set up "multimedia information centers" in  several parts of Japan in a bid to nurture the multimedia  industry, which deals with combined technologies for computers,  communications devices, and home electric appliances. The  centers will collect various kinds of information in the form of  images, voice, and letters, and provide them to local businesses  and schools. Moreover, they will help nurture information  specialists and will be the pillar of a new social  infrastructure. MITI also plans to improve information networks  in government offices and public research institutes at the same  time as the establishment of the information centers. It has  demanded that 30 billion yen [Y] be allocated in the third  supplementary budget for establishing the centers and Y50  billion for improving information networks.    Multimedia technology makes it possible for computers to  process, send, and receive several kinds of data such as  letters, figures, still images, and moving images at one time.  The technology is expected to be used widely in such areas as  education, information searches, and entertainment.    MITI is to set up several multimedia information centers.  Each center will collect information on regional culture and  local businesses in the form of images and save them in the data  base. It will be equipped with a device to search for the  necessary information and project it onto a screen.    The centers will also have a device to composite and edit  images and voice information. This device will enable teachers  to make their own teaching materials for such purposes as  scientific experiments and English conversation, and enable  businesses to produce image software such as advertisement  pictures. They will also give lectures regarding multimedia as  a means to nurture information specialists.    Last year the government decided to establish a "multimedia  support center." The decision, made as a measure to give  all-around support to the development of multimedia software,  was included in the government pump-priming package announced  last year. The Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA), a  MITI-affiliated organization, is currently in the course of  selecting a location where the multimdea support center is to be  built.    The support center is to retain data amassed by the IPA. In  the future, MITI will establish an information network  connecting the multimedia support center and multimedia  information centers so that localities will be able to make  effective use of information from Tokyo.    MITI has demanded the government appropriate Y5 billion in  the third supplementary budget for expanding the functions of  the support center. Moreover, it has demanded: 1) Y5 billion  for creating a research data base for the New Energy and  Industrial Development Organization (NEDO); 2) about Y4 billion  for establishing LAN (local area network) in public research  institutes; and 3) Y3 billion for developing educational-use  software.    According to some calculations, the domestic information and  communications market will expand and be worth approximately Y67  trillion at the highest estimate by the year 2000. The figure  is about three times larger than the current market value. MITI  has concluded that to encourage recession-plagued private firms  to invest in the new business, it is necessary to create  circumstances favorable for the information-related business.</p>

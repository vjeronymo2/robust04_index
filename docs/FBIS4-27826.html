			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- So Man-sol,  vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), in a  statement on May 26 strongly demanded that the South Korean  authorities affirmatively accede to the DPRK's proposal for  convening a national conference and select delegates of the  South side to the preparatory committee of the national  conference at an early date to keep step with the DPRK,  according to a KNS [Korean News Service] report from Tokyo.    He noted that the consultative meeting of delegates of the  DPRK Government, political parties and public organisations  which was held in Pyongyang on May 25 discussed all the  questions related to the convening of the national conference,  sent a telephone message urging the South Korean authorities to  respond to the convening of the national conference and selected  five delegates of the North side to the preparatory committee of  the national conference.    It is no doubt that if the national conference is convened,  a  new phase of reconciliation and unity would be opened and a  common way of achieving great national unity and the peace and  Reunification of the country be found, So Man-sol said, and  stressed: The South Korean authorities, however, are turning  away their face from this proposal.    If the South Korean authorities truly think of the destiny  of  the country and the nation, they should give up their  anachronistic view of confrontation, come back to the stand of  national independence, sincerely accept the proposal of anyone  if it is helpful to the peace and Reunification of the country  and make no scruple of jointly opening the way of the nation.</p>

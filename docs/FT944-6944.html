			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Gladiators captured by the artist - Cricket / Teresa McLean visits an exhibition News of England's exploits at the start of their Australian tour made me so homesick for international cricket that when I passed a small exhibition of sporting art the other day, I went in to look at its pictures of cricket. They are in the right spirit for the Ashes struggles. The poster advertising the exhibition is taken from a screenprint of a batsman at the wicket, his bat, front pad and gloves closely aligned as the only hope against the bowling. When you look at the picture, you are looking down the wicket at him. The picture is called The Gladiator, and that is how the artist, Andrew Aarons, sees every modern cricketer - 'a hero, a gladiator, going out and conquering'. Trying to conquer, at any rate. Long spells of defeat makes the contest, such as England cricketers and cricket fans were experiencing until last summer, grim as well as life-threatening. In the winter of 1992-93, England lost all four tests against India and Sri Lanka, before going on to lose their third successive Ashes series the next summer. When Mike Atherton took over the captaincy from Graham Gooch, and won the 1993 Oval Test, too late to save the series, it was England's first Test victory in 19 Tests against Australia. As any English cricket fan knows, watching a losing team is hard work. And so is playing in one, with the constant expectation of more failures to come as well as those already accumulated. In the unlikely event of a triumph, such as Graham Gooch's courageous 65 and 133 against Australia at Old Trafford in 1993, it is a solo triumph, bereft of team support. When Gooch performed those heroics, only one of England's other first six scored as many as 30. No wonder Aarons speaks in fighting language of those who watch sport. 'They are participating in the contest; they are out there for the kill and the blood.' Spectators in Aarons' pictures watch their heroes keenly, fiercely, aggressively. With crowd uniforms differentiated from each other only by brightly coloured ties, they urge fearful batsmen or battered boxers to keep fighting. It is interesting that Aarons sees cricketers, boxers, sumo wrestlers, tennis players and jockeys as the great champions of modern sport. They give their followers an individual truth. Aarons paints rugby scrums, with a corporate muscularity in numbers, but he rarely paints cricket teams, nearly always individual cricketers. He is an artist, not a coach, and is free to hold team spirit in artistic contempt. It was no surprise that he picked Ian Botham as the supreme gladiator of contemporary cricket. He does not paint Botham, or anyone else, as an identifiable player, but as an embodiment of cricketing power. He seems not to have acknowledged Botham's retirement. 'He's got this incredible personality. You know, when you're at Lords and he's walking to the middle, this tiny little dot, and he's radiating power.' Bowlers pile on the pressure, but batsmen are the ones who have to survive. Aarons told me how he learnt this from experience. He went to Camberwell Art School when only 13 years old and in his first summer went on a school outing to the Isle of Wight. The man who ran the youth hostel where they stayed was a cricket fanatic and challenged the art school to a game. Camberwell was the home of one of the first fine cricket artists, Nicholas Wanostrocht, nicknamed Felix. Felix painted many an early 19th century cricket portrait and invented the awesome Catapulta bowling machine to teach schoolboys how to bat. The art school had a tradition to uphold. Aarons saved Camberwell's honour by turning, nicking and snicking the Isle's fast bowlers for at least 40 runs, far more than anyone else on his losing side. From that day he was a cricket addict. His wicketkeeper, guarding the entrance to the exhibition with huge, gloved hands, is drawn in Conte crayon which suits the wicketkeeper's job. Everything is black and white with sudden dashes of grey. No colour needed. Aarons finds wicketkeepers breathtakingly exciting. I could not agree with him that they stand much closer up to the stumps nowadays. Surely no contemporary 'keeper would stand up to Alec Bedser's fast medium swingers as Godfrey Evans did in the 1940s. But I know what he means by the special flamboyance of today's wicketkeeping, using television replays to emphasise its spectacular achievements. Aarons gives us a creative, handmade version of the dramas which cricket photographers record. He continues cricket artists' custom of making a good number of etchings and prints, so cricket lovers can afford his art. They are not cheap, but cheaper than paintings. His Gladiators screenprint costs Pounds 225 plus VAT. A small selection of Aarons' work remains on show at The Bodilly Galleries, 71 Lensfield Road, Cambridge. Tel: 0223-566555.</p>

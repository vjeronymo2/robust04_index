			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Property: Shropshire, county with a split personality - In a region where England and Wales meet, Gerald Cadogan finds the landscape beguiling and no lack of attractive houses for sale CHOOSE your bridge when you enter Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire that sits on a promontory above a large horseshoe bend in the river Severn. If you come from the left on the map, it is the Welsh bridge; from the right, the English. For centuries that choice - England or Wales - has influenced this old border capital and its county. Shrewsbury is an attractive town, packed with impressive buildings. Many are half-timbered, painted black and white and with overhanging eaves in the style that continues into Cheshire and Wales. Sometimes, brick replaces the wattle and daub filling between the beams. There are grand 18th and 19th century houses, and the glorious 1792 round church of St Chad designed by George Steuart. Shrewsbury has had less post-war redevelopment than most county towns; indeed, it has, to some extent, missed out on growth as the Japanese have located their factories at Telford, in east Shropshire. But with the new A5 Shrewsbury bypass linking to the M54 and M6, west Shropshire will prosper now that it is more accessible. Birmingham airport is less than an hour away by road (although north Shropshire people use Manchester) and London 2 1/2 hours. Unfortunately, train services are no longer so good. The county is extraordinarily beautiful, with long views and large valleys interrupted by the small mountains of the Wrekin, Wenlock Edge and the Long Mynd, and the hills of Wales on the skyline. There are sheep in plenty, and market gardening. When you look down from Clee Hill, over south Shropshire into Herefordshire and Worcestershire, the pattern of small fields and rolling country could be a Sienese painting, if in green rather than the Tuscan beige. As elsewhere, the housing market has been sluggish. But Anthony Clay, of Smith-Woolley, says it is picking up a little although remaining sticky around the Pounds 250,000-Pounds 350,000 range. Having 32 estate agents in Shrewsbury means considerable competition, and a danger that agents may over-value houses to secure vendors' business. There is always a shortage of good houses to sell in such a settled county where people live near their jobs, as they have done for ages. The new roads may well affect this, though. In Shrewsbury, Cooper &amp; Green offers a substantial Georgian town house (155 Abbey Foregate, just before the English bridge) at an enticing Pounds 170,000 although it needs some work. At the same price is a half-timbered, black-and-white, 15th century cottage called Wayside in Eaton Constantine, eight miles east of the town and close to the M54. Nearby, for Pounds 160,000, is a brick and timber cottage in Aston called The Thatches (agent: John German). This is also the price of Wadboro Thatch, at Haytons Bent, close to the attractive old town of Ludlow (Cooper &amp; Green). For Pounds 107,500, there is Rose Cottage in Condover, five miles south of Shrewsbury; while Pounds 178,000 is being asked for the four-bedroomed Waterside Cottage, beside the Shropshire Union canal at St Martins near Oswestry, in the northwest of the county (both from John German). At Marshbrook, between Church Stretton and Craven Arms in south Shropshire, Pounds 155,000 secures the Victorian brick Cwm Head House (agent: Balfour &amp; Cooke). At nearby Cardington Shoot, the grade II-listed Rough Shoot Farm is a medieval cruck hall with Tudor and 18th century additions in stone, half-timbering and brick. This good example of Shropshire vernacular costs around Pounds 225,000 from John German, which also is selling the 17th century stone and half-timbered Chatwall Home Farm, a mile away, for Pounds 280,000. A mile further in the lovely south Shropshire countryside, Smith-Woolley is offering Park House at Plaish, also in stone, for Pounds 270,000. On its books also is the half-timbered and brick Upper Monkhall at Monkhopton, south of Much Wenlock, for around Pounds 400,000 including a stone barn and seven acres. The site used to be a farm for the monks of Wenlock Abbey. The same agent (with Carter Jonas) is selling the stone-built Woodhouse Farm at Wyke, north-east of Much Wenlock and west of Ironbridge, for Pounds 350,000. The handsomest brick dwelling on the market is Farmcote House at Claverley, between Bridgnorth and Wolverhampton, which Balfour &amp; Cooke offers at over Pounds 400,000. Two brick houses for sale near Shrewsbury, through Cooper &amp; Green, are The Lynches at Yockleton (originally 17th century, Grade II, Pounds 240,000) and The Grange at Upton Magna (18th century, Pounds 250,000). In north Shropshire, Hampton House at Welshampton, near Ellesmere, dates from around 1830 and was built for the Tophams, who owned Aintree racecourse  -famous for the Grand National. Smith-Woolley is selling it at Pounds 340,000 along with Ellesmere House in Ellesmere; this originally was the Steward's House for the Earl of Bridgewater's estates and lately has been a home run by the county council, the vendor. The garden has a fine cedar tree and runs down to the Mere, Price: around Pounds 285,000. Two Victorian vicarages on offer are at Fauls Green, near Whitchurch, built solidly by the local lord in 1857 with Staffordshire blue diamond patterning on the red brick and now enhanced by an indoor swimming pool (Smith-Woolley: Pounds 395,000); and at Easthope, near Much Wenlock (Balfour &amp; Cooke: over Pounds 250,000). Shropshire's most unusual property for sale is the grade II Rowton Castle, 10 miles west of Shrewsbury and a mixture of medieval, William and Mary, and Regency Gothic. Now a hotel popular for wedding receptions, it is being sold by receivers through Balfour &amp; Cooke for Pounds 495,000. With 19 bedrooms for letting, 17 acres and what is said to be the largest cedar in the country, it looks a snip.

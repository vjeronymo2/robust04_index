			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government  is concerned over the rumors about "nuclear armament of Japan"  swirling through the startled air of the United States, Asia and  European countries and is racking its brains to find a  countermeasure. This shows that Japan is finding itself  attacked on all sides, put in the dock, for its nuclear  activities.    NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today.    The analyst points out:    In an effort to get out of the tight corner, the Japanese  authorities are using the anti-nuke sentiments of the Japanese  people as a veil for Japan's nuclear armament.    The first nuclear victims in the world during the second  world war, the Japanese people do not want the repetition of  that holocaust and are opposed to Japan's nuclear armament.    Turning a deaf ear to their voice, the Japanese Government  is  claiming that the possession of nuclear weapons is an  indispensable requisite to the conversion of the country into a  military power and a political power and hastening nuclear  armament to gratify its wild dominationist desire.    Japan has stockpiled a huge amount of plutonium and  technologically prepared to manufacture nuclear weapons. The  world thinks that it is a matter of time for Japan to  manufacture nuclear weapons.    Japan's launching the nuclear-capable space rocket H-2 shows  that if Japan possesses nuclear weapons, all the regions of the  world shall come within Japan's nuclear range.    The Japanese Government authorities are peddling "particular  sentiments of the people of the A-bomb victim nation" in a bid  to lull the apprehensions of the world for Japan's nuclear  armament. This is an insult to the A-bomb victims of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki and other Japanese people and a mockery of the  world people.    Unless it shows its will not to seek nuclear armament in  deeds, Japan will invite a bitter condemnation and accuses  worldwide, isolating itself.</p>

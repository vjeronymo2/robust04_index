Rexrodt Criticizes  Business's Innovation Failing"; first paragraph is an  introduction]    [Text] Berlin, Tuesday, 30 Nov 93  (HANDELSBLATT)--Technology and founder centers have proven their  worth as a tool for regional business development and promotion  of innovation in the federal republic. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft  Deutscher Technologie- und Grunderzentren e.V.  [Association  of German Technology and Founder Centers Registered Association]  (ADT) has drawn this conclusion.    The occasion is the establishment of the first German  technology center in Berlin (BIG) 10 years ago, which thus far  has been followed by 161 additional foundings of centers over  the entire territory of the federal republic. However,  innovation centers are not a wonder drug by which jobs can be  guaranteed in inefficient or uncompetitive companies, said Heinz  Fiedler, head of ADT's managing board, putting a damper on  excessive expectations at the fifth anniversary of his  association.    Particularly in the new federal states, where a real boom  has  developed since the change, "creating the bases for the  development of small and medium-sized businesses" is of prime  importance. Therefore, according to Fiedler, the centers in  Eastern Germany are not serving mainly technology companies, but  on the whole are oriented toward the promotion of  entrepreneurship.    In this sense, in the association's opinion, German  innovation centers could also serve as a model for comparable  institutions in the East European countries. However, a copy of  the successful models from the West is not possible. Instead,  the designs have to be adapted to the particular requirements in  East Europe. However, Fiedler judges that this should cause no  problem, because in Germany too each center is oriented toward  local concerns and therefore is "somewhat different from the  others." According to ADT, by now 100 founder centers exist in  the former COMECON countries.    Fifty-two centers have come into being in the new federal  states, and they are distinguished by strong expansion of their  regional offerings. Today they are offering to 500 companies  with 3000 employees a business-oriented infrastructure that is  assisting in the move into independence. More than 22,000  employees of just under 2700 companies are now working at  innovation and founder centers in all of Germany. Just a few  have given up in the last 10 years according to ADT.    Because the innovation centers are regional initiatives,  their spatial distribution differs very much over the territory  of Germany. For example, while Bavaria has just four such  centers, the intensive development in North Rhine-Westphalia has  resulted in the establishment of 49 facilities. Saturation has  been reached by now in some federal states, says ADT head Guido  Baranowski. In his opinion both public and private-industry  models have proven their worth in financing. In any case, the  innovation centers have to make their terms and conditions  market oriented in the long run, in their own interest and also  in the interest of their companies.    Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Rexrodt (FDP [Free  Democratic Party]) in the prelude to ADT's anniversary  criticized German industry's failing in innovation. The reasons  for this lie in companies themselves too, the minister said.  Financial relief and beneficial tax incentives alone can bring  about no fundamental changes. In this connection, Rexrodt also  called for a better functioning venture capital market in  Germany. In spite of the numerous venture capital funds in the  meanwhile, no breakthrough has been attained to date in this  area.</p>

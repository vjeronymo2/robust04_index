			<p>BFN     [Text] In Santiago de Cuba, Basic Industries Minister  Marcos Portal has announced that repair and maintenance  resources for electrical plants are arriving in Cuba given the  economic importance of electrical generation. Portal addressed  the workers of the Rente Antonio Maceo Electric Plant and told  them that in July, maintenance work will immediately begin on  Unit 6 once the reconstruction of Unit 4 is completed. After  those two units are repaired and 12 others receive maintenance  this year, the generation of electricity in the Rente plant  should increase to 300 megawatts, 60 percent of its total  capacity.    Portal praised the maintenance and modification work done at  the Rente plant to enhance circulation, drainage, and equipment.</p>

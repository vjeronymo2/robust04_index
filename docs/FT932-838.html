			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Mortgage arrears a long-term problem Sir, Mr Cole of James Capel proposes the view that 'mortgage arrears gloom is overdone' (Letters, June 23). May I suggest certain reasons for the opposite view. First, a very large number of mortgagors have had to 'capitalise' their arrears over the last few years, under pressure from their lenders. These cases will no longer appear in the official statistics as 'arrears' but as additional lending (falsely inflating the figures for new loans). In the short term, borrowers in this position are in the same position as those in arrears, so far as their ability to spend money is concerned. However, such borrowers (and their lenders) have transformed a short-term reduction in spending power into a reduction over the remaining term of their mortgages (often extended by the lenders to allow the repayment:income ratios to come back into line with their standard lending criteria). Second, published statistics on mortgage arrears rarely reflect the effect of 'arrears charges' on the balances owed by borrowers in difficulties. Such charges are in reality usurious, but are dressed up to avoid the usury laws. Their impact on mortgage balances, and consequently upon spending power, may be as much as 50 per cent of that of directly recorded arrears. Third, the impact of severe wage restraint on the high proportion of mortgagors who earn their livings in the public sector will ensure that the overhang of debt and arrears is not rapidly cleared.

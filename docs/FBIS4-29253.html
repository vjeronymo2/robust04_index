			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The Democratic People's  Republic of Korea is preserving the revolutionary relics and  remains as eternal wealth.    Recently the technical agency for the preservation of  revolutionary sites manufactured a new fireproof and waterproof  cloth and a glass cylinder, making it possible to permanently  preserve historical mementoes, slogan-bearing trees, relics and  remains of the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary  struggle.    There are many revolutionary mementoes and remains in all  parts of the country, especially in the area of Mt Paektu.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has long since made  sure  that the revolutionary relics and remains associated with the  glorious revolutionary traditions of the Workers' Party of Korea  were preserved well to be conveyed through generations. Saying  the revolutionary slogan-bearing trees are wealth more precious  than a thousand pieces of gold, he indicated the orientation and  way of permanently preserving them in glass cylinders.    The officials and working people in charge of the  preservation of revolutionary sites are building up the  revolutionary battle sites and historical sites and preserving  them well while discovering and arranging revolutionary  historical materials and revolutionary mementoes.    Musums have been built in every place associated with the  revolutionary traditions and relics and remains are preserved  well in their original state.    Secret bases, slogan-bearing trees, relics and remains of  the  period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle are being discovered  in large numbers through a vigorous unearthing of revolutionary  relics. Entering the 90s alone, more than 11,650 slogan-bearing  trees including those inscribed with the slogans "Let us uphold  general Kim Il-song, the hero of the nation and great man of all  people", "Woman general of Mt. Paektu Kim Chong-suk, woman  general of the anti-Japanese war produced by Korea" and "The  Paektu lodestar rose up above Mt. Paektu. It shines over three  thousand-ri land", and new secret bases and many revolutionary  relics and remains have been founded in Musan and Yonsa Counties  of North Hamgyong Province and other places.</p>

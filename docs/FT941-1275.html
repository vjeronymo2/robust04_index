			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carolco to merge with retailer Carolco, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, is to merge with the video and music retailer Live Entertainment in a stock-swap deal valued at about Dollars 15m. The two companies said the merger would create Hollywood's biggest independent film production and video distribution company. Carolco already owns more than a third of Live's stock. After the merger Live shareholders will own between 22 per cent and 29 per cent of the new company, to be called Carolco Entertainment. Under the merger terms, one share of newly issued Live common stock will be exchanged for 5.5 Carolco shares, but a 'collar' has been built into the transaction that will keep the total value of the deal within certain limits if the share prices of Carolco and Live fluctuate wildly before the merger is completed. The deal is the latest attempt by Carolco to survive a prolonged battle with financial insolvency. Although the studio has scored box office successes, rising debts, incurred partly because of lavish spending on big-budget films, have threatened to overwhelm it.</p>

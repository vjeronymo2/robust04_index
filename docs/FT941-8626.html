			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Beer cask demand behind 17% rise to Pounds 4.4m at Alumasc Strong demand for beer casks enabled Alumasc, the containers, components and building products group, to announce a 17 per cent increase in half-year profits. Growing orders from leading breweries pushed pre-tax profits up to Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 3.77m) in the six months to December 31. Welcoming the results, Mr John McCall, chairman, said: 'We've been surprised by demand for casks, it goes against the trend of declining beer consumption.' The half year figures also benefited from a three-month contribution by MR Holdings, the privately-owned wall insulation company which Alumasc acquired for Pounds 6.4m last autumn. MR contributed Pounds 1.62m to group turnover, which increased 12 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 24.3m). At the operating level, the new subsidiary played a less significant role - adding Pounds 253,000 to profits of Pounds 4.04m. Mr McCall said demand for insulation had been affected by declining local authority spending on council house refurbishments. Alumasc's six other building product businesses, ranging from drainage to roofing, had performed well despite subdued construction activity, Mr McCall added. The contribution, however, of the precision components division was held back by commissioning costs associated with new dies. Earnings per share, adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 share split last October, rose to 9.53p (8.25p). The interim dividend is 2.05p, an 11 per cent increase over last time's 1.85p.</p>

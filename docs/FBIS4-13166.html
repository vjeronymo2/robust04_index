			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States is pressuring Israel and the PLO  to sign a Gaza-Jericho withdrawal agreement this month so that  the signing ceremony can take place during the secretary of  state's visit to the region in late April.    Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that  Shim'on  Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will meet several times at a conference  in Bucharest on Thursday and Friday so as to speed up the  negotiations. Peres will probably also meet Jordanian Prime  Minister al-Majali there, and there are currently contacts to  work that out.    The United States is demanding that Israel and Syria prepare  a package of their demands on security, peace, and a Golan  withdrawal prior to Secretary Christopher's visit. Due to that,  deliberations are taking place in Rabin's and Peres' bureaus on  various position papers. It is unclear whether the Syrians are  working on their own proposals.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gulyana Khusanova, incorporating interview with </F> Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian  Border Troops in Tajikistan; place and date not given: "Spring  Offensive Has Failed To Materialize, but Two Russian Border  Guards Have Been Killed on the Tajik-Afghan Border in Recent  Days"]    [Text] Dushanbe -- The military's forecasts regarding a  major spring offensive by the armed Tajik opposition on the  Tajik-Afghan border have not worked out.    But Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the  Russian Border Troops in Tajikistan, considers that the  situation could deteriorate at any moment.    [Chechulin] Several hundred armed supporters of the Islamic  Revival Movement of Tajikistan are concentrated in a number of  our neighboring territory's border regions. Their redeployment  toward the border has been observed of late.    [Khasanova] Some people are of the opinion that Russia is  paying too high a price in its soldiers' blood and lives to  protect the sovereign Tajik border. Twenty-five men have been  killed in the 12th Border Troop Subunit. Could something  similar happen again?    [Chechulin] The families of the dead will forgive me, and I  hope it does not sound blasphemous, but we did learn a good  lesson from what happened ten months ago. I can now say with a  full sense of responsibility what the likelihood of a repetition  of the tragedy is. Everything has been done to ensure that  every border subunit or border post, without exception, can  repulse enemy attacks until the approach of reserves. We have  highly mobile motorized subunits, airborne assault units,  artillery, and military aircraft at our disposal. The  Tajik-Afghan border today is a system of modern obstacles,  including mined obstacles. We are setting up our own air  defense system. One in ten soldiers in the border troops is on  contract. The border troop subunits and border detachments are  manned at wartime strength.    [Khasanova] You will agree that such a situation cannot go  one for ever. The Tajik border must be taken under the  protection of units of the national army and local border  troops. When will this happen?    [Chechulin] Tajik units now mainly occupy the second  echelons, while we occupy the front echelons. This distance,  does not, incidentally, prevent our successfully carrying out  joint operations. However, I do think the time will come when  Tajikistan will have to guarantee the security of its own border  by its own devices. I don't, however, think this is going to  happen soon.    I cannot agree with the opinion that Russian troops should  be  withdrawn from here. The presence of Russia, which has its own  indisputable geopolitical interests here, is a real necessity.  The more successful the talks between the Dushanbe authorities  and the opposition are, the more nominal the Russian military  presence in Tajikistan will become.</p>

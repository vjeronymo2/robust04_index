			<p>BFN     [Text] We have the first interview with Faustin  Twagiramungu since he fled his house in Kigali on the morning of  7 April. He is the prime minister-designate and should lead the  next transition government in Rwanda. He narrowly escaped  arrest and death. Today he is at a secure place. He spoke this  evening for the first time. The extract we chose to broadcast  tonight is about the possible outcome of the inter-Rwandan peace  talks scheduled for 23 April in Tanzania. Christophe  Boisbouvier asked Faustin Twagiramungu what conditions the  rebels may set before any agreement can be reached:    [Begin Twagiramungu recording] There will be no negotiation  with the interim government. This government has not respected  the peace agreement, which is the basic law ruling our country  today. Today we must take a political decision through contacts  between officers of the General Staff and the RPF. As for the  government, there can be no contact with them as the government  does not exist. This solution needs a pre-condition: do the  military agree to denounce the presidential guard and pacify the  Rwandan people? Do they agree to demand that the massacre they  themselves started be stopped in the whole country?    If these conditions are accepted and if they take the  decision of stopping the broadcasts of the famous Milles  Collines independent radio, then I think that a political  solution could be found.

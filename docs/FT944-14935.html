			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: UBS rejects Ebner plan in proxy battle Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday rejected Mr Martin Ebner's proposal that a director be appointed specifically to represent the bank's registered shareholders. Pursuing its proxy battle with the maverick Zurich banker, the bank discounted Mr Ebner's warning that the bank could come under the control of drug barons or other undesirable groups once voting restrictions had been removed from its shares. The UBS board last month proposed splitting its registered shares and bearer shares into a new class of bearer shares with equal voting power and no voting restrictions. An extraordinary general meeting will be held on November 22 to vote on the proposal. The board made clear that its purpose was to remove the disproportionate voting power held by the registered shares. These shares have 51.1 per cent of all votes and can be voted only by Swiss nationals, but they represent only 17.3 per cent of the bank's capital. Mr Ebner is chairman of BK Vision, an investment fund that is UBS's largest shareholder with an 18 per cent holding in the registered shares. He has said he is trying to rally the support of other shareholders to vote for changes in the bank's strategy at the annual meeting next spring. Mr Nikolaus Senn, chairman, said the nomination of a board member to represent the registered shareholders would be superfluous if, as he expected, shareholders approved the board's motion. He said a Swiss banking law coming into effect at the beginning of the year would provide greater safeguards against undesirable takeovers than the registered shares. Mr Robert Studer, UBS chief executive, explained the bank's rejection of Mr Ebner's call for it to focus more on investment and private banking. He said the bank's strategy of underpinning its wholesale financial activities with a strong Swiss retail base ensured a more stable earnings performance and a higher share rating than those of US and UK banks. Mr Studer dismissed calls for compensation to registered shareholders for the loss in value of their shares because it could only come unfairly at the expense of the bearer shareholders. Analysts advised against buying the registered shares in recent months because of the abnormal premium they acquired. 'Those who bought despite this advice did so at their own risk,' Mr Studer said. Mr Senn acknowledged that BK Vision had opportunities to challenge the legality of the November vote. UBS has said its motion requires acceptance by two-thirds of the shares present and a majority of the capital.</p>

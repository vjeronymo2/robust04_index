			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Middle classes fuel student rise THE large increase in student numbers over the past three decades has been almost entirely drawn from the middle classes, according to research published by the National Commission on Education. A research paper issued by the commission, an independent think tank, shows that the proportion of students from working-class backgrounds going to higher education has scarcely shifted since 1963. The paper's author, Professor AH Halsey, of Nuffield College, Oxford, said: 'This is cold comfort for those who seek the classless society.' He says that fears in the 1960s that the expansion of higher education - from 216,000 students in 1963 to more than 1m in 1990 - would mean a dilution of standards were unfounded. The average A-level achievement of entrants to higher education rose markedly between 1976 and 1984 and has fallen only slightly since then. However, the expansion has affected the lecturer/student ratio, which has declined from 1:8 in 1970 to 1:11.6 last year. Prof Halsey concludes that Britain is on the road to an American-style system, where higher education embraces all post-secondary schooling. But, 'plans for funding the new expansion remain vague'.

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Apple juice brands taken off shelves Two brands of fresh apple juice were withdrawn from sale last night after it was discovered that they contained high levels of natural toxin, which can cause food poisoning. Customers who have purchased Duskins Bramley juice and its Granny Smith brand were warned not to drink them and to return cartons to the shops where they were bought. The dangerous levels were discovered in routine sampling by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>

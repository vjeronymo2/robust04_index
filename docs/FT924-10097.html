			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Political crisis stalls Bulgarian debt talks BULGARIA'S negotiations for a new three-year extended loan agreement with the International Monetary fund have been put on hold, after the collapse last week of the government led by Mr Filip Dimitrov. The political crisis has also led to postponement of planned debt re-negotiation talks with commercial bank creditors, who hold the bulk of Bulgaria's Dollars 12bn gross foreign debt. The government resigned last Wednesday night after the ruling Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) coalition had failed to win a confidence vote in parliament against the opposition of former communists and the party representing the ethnic Turkish minority. Mr Anoup Singh, head of an IMF mission to Bulgaria, was quoted in Sofia as having said he hoped the talks on a three-year agreement would continue with the new government. But it could be several weeks before a new government can be formed. The current stand-by arrangement with the IMF is to expire in March 1993. Mr Singh said in September that he hoped a new three-year programme could be established before the expiry. Mr Ivan Kostov, finance minister in the outgoing government, said negotiations with the advisory committee representing Bulgaria's commercial bank creditors, which were due to start on November 4, had been postponed. He declined to specify a date for the resumption of talks. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank, which heads the committee representing the commercial banks, said it would be up to Bulgaria to solve its governmental problems - 'then we will begin to talk again'. The head of an IMF mission to Poland said yesterday that he hoped to seal a new deal on co-operation with Warsaw in the next 10 days. 'I expect my visit to last about 10 days. I hope that, in that time, it will be possible to conclude an agreement between Poland and the IMF,' said Mr Michael Deppler, deputy director of the IMF's european department.</p>

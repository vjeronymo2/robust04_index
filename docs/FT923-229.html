			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Europe, the universe, and everything PERHAPS IT was predictable: 1992 is the year of European integration, so you can just imagine harried publishers scratching their heads a while back and deciding to commission a series of Euro-business and language guides. Essential information, where to stay, how to start a company . . . Need to tell your Italian contact that you now use CD ROM storage for financial records? Buy Essential Business Italian (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 4.99, 200 pages), turn to page 55 and the world's your ostrica. Or your huitre, auster, ostra, should you wish to repeat such stilted phrases in more than one language - the gurus at Hodder decided to repeat the formula in Europe's main business languages. Meanwhile at Cassell, an inadequate twist: should you wish, you can turn instead to its Business Companions series. These glorified phrase books are indeed 'new for the single European market'. At Pounds 12.99 a piece they are also expensive. The question publishers such as Hodder and Cassell should ask themselves is who is going to buy such books. There cannot be many cross-border executives who will learn very much from these guides. Perhaps the business travel market has become more linguistically sophisticated, but in that case why should anyone need help with such basic questions? At least such books have limited pretensions. A companion series by Hodder ambitiously suggests you can teach yourself Business German, a complete course for beginners (Pounds 6.99, 218 pages), although it concedes that a grammar might be a useful accompanying tool. That suggestion becomes laughable when one opens Business Japanese, but perhaps the less said about that the better. Just as well, then, that Hodder has somewhat redeemed itself with Languages in International Business: A Practical Guide (Pounds 10.99, 242 pages). The editors adopt an appropriately serious tone and address sensible questions, such as how can companies ensure that they have an organised approach to language, defined as everything from staff training to promotional material. This book does not set out to provide all the answers, but it does point to the main pitfalls and as such is well worth the price for companies venturing abroad for the first time. That basic quality is central to the success of Working in France (Frank Books, Pounds 8.99, 194 pages), where the emphasis is on how to find jobs and even a career in the tricky French labour market. Advice covers everything from graphology to where in Paris foreigners go to network. Therein lies a warning for UK readers; the book has a US perspective which at times is unhelpful. But in combination with Tim Green's useful and amusing Real French; a thematic guide to fluency in speech and writing (Harrap, Pounds 5.95, 127 pages), the aspiring citizen of Europe can get down to some serious integration.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Caution on Brussels jobless plan European finance ministers will today discuss an ambitious strategy for halving unemployment in the European Union by the year 2000. The strategy is outlined in a European Commission report intended as a call to arms for a common approach on tackling the economic crisis and restoring European competitiveness. Ministers are expected to give a cautious welcome, but some member states - notably the UK and Germany - are likely to resist commitments to specific targets for job creation, growth and interest rate policy. The Commission's paper, Restoring Growth and Employment - Strengthening Convergence, has assumed added significance as a guide to macroeconomic policy as a result of the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism last summer. Among its chief recommendations are a cut in the EU average of short-term interest rates of between 2 and 3 percentage points, conditional on curbs in wage rises and public deficits; a cap on real wage rises set at 1 percentage point below the rate of productivity; an inflation target of between 2 and 3 per cent; and annual economic growth of 3 per cent from the mid-1990s. The Commission also appeals for more flexible labour markets and a reduction in employment taxes, although it remains unclear how Brussels intends to propose funding these ideas. Inside the Commission, officials are divided on whether to recover the loss in revenue through taxes on pollutants such as carbon dioxide, higher value added tax, or taxes on income from savings and investment. Another proposal is to penalise equipment deemed to be polluting, though this has been condemned in some quarters as a threat to the internal market. Pro-labour forces are also pressing for a tax on capital to offset the sacrifices which employers and governments are expected to require from trade unions. They hope to receive a sympathetic hearing from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, who appears to have abandoned his earlier trial balloon in favour of a tax on speculative capital flows. Mr Delors is close to completing his separate White Paper on competitiveness for the Brussels summit next month. Finance ministers led by Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, are pressing hard to examine the White Paper ahead of the summit to test whether the Commission has incorporated members' submissions. However, Mr Delors is said to be reluctant to hand over the whole Commission document, arguing that it would risk being mutilated by those seeking to strengthen their anti-Brussels credentials at home. The Delors White Paper offers a framework for public discussion rather than directives for action. Though similar in content, the macroeconomic guidelines carry more formal weight since they have to be adopted by EU leaders under the Maastricht treaty.</p>

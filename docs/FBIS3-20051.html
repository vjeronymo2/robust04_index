The question of Swiss participation in the Partnership  for Peace was raised as it had been in Washington on Monday.  According to Mr. Cotti, the contacts established during the  trip confirm that Switzerland's neutrality is a key element of  its credibility on the international scene.    Following the example of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, Mr. Ouellet also asked Switzerland to consider a  possible "a la carte" participation in the Partnership for  Peace. Mr. Cotti said that Canada is willing to enhance  cooperation with countries that are not members of the Atlantic  Alliance.    The head of the federal department of foreign affairs  reaffirmed that Switzerland would examine the offer made by  NATO. The federal counselor will have to make a decision on the  principle and methods of the Partnership for Peace in the coming  months, he said. Mr. Cotti also stressed that any cooperation  with Switzerland should respect its neutrality status.  <H5>  Cooperation With Russia </H5>   Regarding international relations, the federal counselor  highlighted the agreement between the Swiss and the Canadian  Governments on the need to intensify cooperation between the  West and the Russian Federation. Switzerland also has a role to  play in the rapprochement process, even if only a modest one.  For Flavio Cotti, the assignment of Ambassador Edouard Brunner  as the UN mediator in Georgia is an example of this role. This  type of cooperation can be strenghtened in the future.  <H5>  Blue Helmets </H5>   The UN peacekeeping operations were also mentioned during  the  talks. The Canadian Government, with its long-standing  experience in this field, expressed interest in the campaign in  Switzerland for the creation of a contingent of blue helmets.  Mr. Cotti, for his part, acquainted himself with the experience  of the Canadian troops. A contingent of Canadian blue helmets is  now serving with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in former  Yugoslavia.    Turning to bilateral issues, both ministers welcomed the  quality of their relations. Mr. Cotti said bilateral ties are  strong and said they would be expanded in the future. In this  respect, the head of the Canadian diplomatic corps has been  invited to visit Switzerland at a time to be specified.</p>

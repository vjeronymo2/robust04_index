			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Zero hour for Zeneca The closing of Zeneca's rights issue on Monday ends a sequence of events which started with Hanson's appearence on ICI's share register in May 1991. The story so far has generated more excitement than value. Yesterday's aggregate of ICI's and Zeneca's share prices is around 10 per cent higher than the price Hanson paid for a stake in unified ICI. The All-Share index has risen by 19 per cent over the same period. While the rights issue hangs over Zeneca, such judgments may be premature. How long the issue acts as a drag turns on how much is taken up, and whether shareholders choose to retain their stock or sell in the market. On most measures, the 600p rights price looks fair value. A price earnings ratio of 11 times this year's forecast earnings - against a market average of 14 - is doubtless a far cry from what was envisaged when the demerger-plus-rights plan was hatched. If the scheme ever was an opportunistic attempt to raise equity for ICI as a whole on a fancy multiple, it must be considered a failure. But while institutions are re-weighting their investment portfolios away from drugs stocks - as Prudential did last week - a low multiple does not guarantee Zeneca an easy ride. But the process of reweighting will only run so far. Once the regulatory climate is clearer which, given the complexities of the US political process may not be until the autumn, the sector should rally. Drugs companies have no divine right to trade on a multiple above the market average. Those which make headway will have to deal imaginatively with tougher price controls. If demerger really does allow Zeneca's management to run the business with more drive and vision than was possible within the corporate giant, it stands at least a fighting chance of staying with the pack. On that basis the shares are worth holding at the rights price. As the shake-out in the drugs industry continues, though, it would be rash to expect a windfall gain. Having sold his stake in ICI at Pounds 14 a share last year, Lord Hanson may have had the best of the trade.</p>

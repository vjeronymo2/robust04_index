			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA WOMAN GETS BACK BABY, A PARROT SHE'S HAD 40 YEARS  </P> <P> Magda Wilson's Baby is home again. The 80-year-old Santa Monica woman who  suffered a heart-wrenching loss July 1 when the outspoken parrot she had owned  for nearly 40 years was apparently stolen outside her apartment was reunited  with her pet late Monday night.  </P> <P> "He just ate and ate and ate, and when he was done, he said, 'You wanna go to  bed? You wanna go to bed?' He was so tired," Wilson said today. "I'm very happy  now."  </P> <P> Wilson got Baby back after a young woman identified only as "Blanca" put her in  touch with a man who had apparently purchased the bird on the Santa Monica  Pier, police said. After a weekend of negotiations, the parties met Monday  night in front of a house on Pacific Coast Highway where the man, who remains  unidentified, gave Wilson her parrot in exchange for a reimbursement of the  $100 purchase price.  </P></p>

When asked about Sino-Japanese relations at a press  conference this morning, Qian said, China and Japan are close  neighbors and the leaders of the two countries often exchange  visits. Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan  achieved a great success.    Now Chinese leaders are looking forward to the Japanese  Prime  Minister Hosokawa's visit to China at a time when the  Sino-Japanese relations have achieved all-round development.    "I believe the visit will play a very important role for  further development of the Sino-Japanese relations and  cooperation in economic fields," he said.    During the visit, China and Japan will formally sign an  agreement on cooperation between the two governments in  strengthening environmental protection, Qian said.    On the relations between China and the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea and between China and the Republic of Korea,  Qian said, "our stand remains unchanged."    He said that Premier Li Peng has made it clear in his  government work report that China has further strengthened its  good-neighborly relations with the surrounding countries and the  friendship between China and the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea has grown.    China has steadily expanded its mutually beneficial  cooperation relations with Japan, Russia and the Republic of  Korea, Qian said.</p>

Foyt, four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, escaped serious injury Tuesday  when he crashed at Charlotte Motor Speedway at Concord, N.C., during a practice  session for an upcoming NASCAR race.  </P> <P> "He hit the wall in turn three, slid about 300 yards and came to a stop at the  entrance of pit road," speedway spokesman Eddie Gossage said. "The track  emergency staff worked about 10 minutes to get him out of the car. They were  mostly trying to be easy because they didn't want to hurt him worse than he  was."  </P> <P> Gossage said Foyt was conscious and alert when taken to the speedway hospital.  He was then transferred to Charlotte Memorial Hospital where officials said  X-rays proved negative.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev gave a speech last  Saturday [11 June] at a conference of foreign ministers held in  Istanbul. He said in particular that Kazakhstan, from the very  first days of its revived statehood, stands for the  strengthening of international security and an atmosphere of  confidence. The Kazakh leadership regards the country's  participation in North Atlantic cooperation from this viewpoint.  The preparation of the final documents was held in an  atmosphere of tense debates, and the Kazakh delegation's  amendment was introduced. As result, Paragraph 25 of the  conference statement says: We welcome the fact that the Republic  of Kazakhstan has joined the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation  Treaty as a state that does not possess such weapons, and highly  assess Kazakhstan's positive role in the process of dismantling  the nuclear weapons of the former USSR in conformity with the  Lisbon protocol.    On the same day Kanat Saudabayev met the foreign ministers  of  Germany, Greece, Canada, and Turkey. They touched upon topical  regional and international problems and bilateral relations, as  well as the further expansion of mutually beneficial trade and  economic cooperation. The Kazakhstan delegation returned home.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong leads regional declines in thin turnover Tokyo Uncertainty over fluctuations in the yen, US interest rates and the knock on effect from New York's embattled bond and stock markets prevailed in Japan, and the Nikkei 225 average lost moderate ground in very low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Small-lot, arbitrage-linked selling left the index 75.51 easier at 19,786.96 after a day's high of 19,820.86 and low of 19,721.04. Volume was 150m shares, against Friday's 175m. Investors looked for excuses to remain on the sidelines, said a Japanese trader. The settlement for index-futures options this Friday was cited as a further, domestic reason for the inactivity; and some market participants were said to be wary of the corporate earning reporting season, which starts this week. Fears over the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy and its possible negative impact on US financial markets pushed down the dollar. The currency closed Y0.69 off from Friday at Y102.67. Investors continued to be wary of the yen's rise and its adverse affect on corporate earnings. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 4.85 to 1,610.84 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.66 at 294.94. Falls led rises by 666 to 307, with 185 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.24 to 1,308.06. Export-oriented, high technology shares were lower on the rise in the yen. Sony fell Y90 to Y5,610. Toyota Motor also declined, by Y20 to Y1,960. Individual investors continued to trade speculative favourites. Brother Industries, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y2 to Y675 and Wakachiku Construction shed Y3 to Y667 on profit-taking. Higher commodity prices helped some sectors. Petroleum issues were higher on gains in crude oil, Showa Shell Sekiyu putting on Y30 at Y1,410 and General Sekiyu Y30 at Y1,250. The rise in gold bullion supported mining shares, Sumitomo Metal Mining rising Y5 to Y901. Arbitrage selling hurt bank stocks, Industrial Bank of Japan declining Y20 to Y3,200 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,930. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 69.53 to 22,027.33 in volume of 18.7m shares. Roundup Uneven trading characterised the Pacific Basin's markets yesterday. Manila was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG fell 2.3 per cent in lower than average turnover, although bargain hunting later in the day helped to trim the losses. The Hang Seng index shed 198.57 to 8,421.70. Turnover amounted to HKDollars 2.3bn, against Friday's HKDollars 3.6bn. Property and financial shares were selling targets. Brokers said uncertainties about plans to cool the overheated real estate market deterred purchases. Cheung Kong was the day's most active issue, losing HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 34, followed by HSBC, off HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 81.50. SINGAPORE retreated a further 1.5 per cent as the market continued to consolidate after testing the 2,300 level last week. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 33.79 to 2,222.40 in turnover of SDollars 438.8m. Brokers said weakness across the Pacific Rim undermined sentiment to push the index lower for the fourth session. Natsteel dropped 30 cents to SDollars 5.00 on news of a cut in domestic steel prices. SEOUL, in contrast, rose for the fourth consecutive day in increased trading. The composite index added 3.74 at 940.15. TAIWAN performed strongly and the weighted index gained 15.07 at 5,996.80, but after a session high of 6,054. Turnover fell to TDollars 66.5bn from Saturday's TDollars 77.4bn. Ruentex Industries closed the day's limit up at TDollars 31.80 on news that it could earn more than TDollars 1bn in coming years on land development projects. KUALA LUMPUR was marked down by 2 per cent, the falls led by foreign selling of blue chips. The composite index shed 20.94 to 990.63. AUSTRALIA closed higher on firmer commodity prices. The All Ordinaries index rose 5.0 to 2,009.3. Turnover totalled ADollars 307.0m. Higher gold and base metals prices offshore helped to boost the prices of most mining issues, while industrial stocks continued to be depressed by worries over a possible rise in US interest rates. WELLINGTON recovered from an early 20-point fall and the NZSE-40 capital index closed off 4.93 at 2,043.49. BOMBAY maintained Friday's momentum, with the BSE 30-share index adding 40.33 at 3,755.90. Brokers said that overseas fund managers had begun to pick up some blue chip stocks. KARACHI lost 2.5 per cent as many investors unloaded stock to square positions before today's clearing day. The KSE 100-share index fell 58.84 to 2,307.42. with Lever Brothers off Rs75 at Rs1,325.</p>

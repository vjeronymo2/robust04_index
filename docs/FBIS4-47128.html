This news provoked hostile responses in Moscow's  political and parapolitical circles. The market liberals were  startled: All the same, the government intends to carry out its  long-standing threats to "freeze wages," ignoring the natural  right of the workers to "earn according to their abilities." The  opponents of the ultra-liberals, the proponents of state  "regulation of consumption," on the other hand, consider the  measures promised by the edict to be cunning, the latest proof  of the fact that the state is persistently deviating from its  sacred duty to regulate social relations.    According to the official version, the future edict  realizes one of the points of the president's message to the  parliament, as well as the state program approved at the end of  April in the area of social policy. This does not preclude the  fact, however, that this document has been called upon to play  another role: to postpone a long-overdue decision. The  technology of this matter is simple: A deliberately unacceptable  circular is prepared, its content becomes public property, and a  negative "public reaction" follows, after which the unapproved  circular is filed away in the folder for the unpublished and the  forgotten, while the authorities find the moral right to  "postpone the matter" until better times.    This version has already been partially confirmed: On  Monday, the edict "On the Regulation..." was, among others,  submitted for approval to Yeltsin and, in contrast to the other  six edicts, was not signed. As to why the authorities have been  compelled periodically to turn to the problem of control over  incomes and why this always comes to naught, the reader can  judge, based on the conversation between OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  commentator Aleksandr Protsenko and Russian Federation Minister  of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan.    [Protsenko] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, the most graphic result  of  the state's noninterference in social processes is the  staggering and simply insane differentiation of the incomes of  the populace. As far as I know, the difference in the earnings  of the most highly paid 10 percent of the Russian citizens and  the lowest-paid 10 percent has reached a factor of 27.    [Melikyan] It has already passed 30. According to this  indicator, we have "surpassed" the civilized countries and have  come much closer to the Third World. But after all, we are a  country of extremes! It is true that it is not necessary to  think that the situation differs greatly from the period of the  "heyday of stagnation." Although then the difference in the  wages of a party oblast committee secretary or the manager of a  large plant and those of, for example, a cleaning lady was only  a factor of four or five, the difference in incomes was not less  than currently. It is just that all this was due to things other  than wages.    Today there are more rich people, and this is noticeable.  But  we cannot get away from an increase in the differentiation of  incomes--especially during the period of the initial  accumulation of capital. This is an inevitable and objective  process, although I agree that it is proceeding too rapidly,  which is intensifying social tension. Our country is accustomed  to life under wage leveling, but here we have this colossal  difference. And it frequently bears no relationship to the  amount and quality of the labor expended.    Currently in Russia, 40 percent of the children are living  in  families with incomes below the subsistence minimum. As a rule,  these are young families--the backbone of the state. They are  supposed to support themselves and their children, yet it is  through their labor that the country is supporting the  pensioners.    [Protsenko] Add the fact that these people are supposed to  be  the basic customers in our stores, and their rubles are supposed  to stimulate the production of domestic goods. But in our  country, to put it crudely, the populace is dividing into two  classes: the poor, who buy nothing, and the rich, who buy only  imported goods. As a result, domestic production is losing  sales, while its workers continue to live in poverty. Is this a  closed circle?    [Melikyan] This is all true. This also testifies to the fact  that the state is not performing its regulatory function--it is  supposed to limit the excessive incomes of a monopolist producer  and to support the workers of enterprises of promising sectors  and the budget-controlled sphere. But to support them not by  handing out subsidies, but rather by establishing a normal wage.  Indeed, currently in a number of sectors, and first and foremost  in the budget-controlled ones, wages have been artificially  understated. If a family consisting of two workers and two  children cannot support itself and turns out to be below the  poverty line, this is proof of an absolutely incorrect wage  system.    [Protsenko] Which is supposed to change now that the prime  minister has finally signed the decree on the governmental  program in the area of social policy. Incidentally, at the  presidium's meeting on this matter, you were the main speaker.  What can we expect?    [Melikyan] In the area of the regulation of incomes, there  are a few changes--if you talk about the number of items  introduced into the program. There is the indexing of the  guaranteed minimum incomes in connection with an increase in  prices and, first and foremost, an increase in the minimum wage.  There is the change in the system for figuring the wages for the  managers of state enterprises (and enterprises where the state  has the controlling block of shares). And finally, there is the  improvement of the system for taxing individual incomes. There  are several more items, but these are the main ones.    [Protsenko] Fine, let us talk about the main ones--for  example, about the minimum wage. Your predecessor in the labor  minister's post and now your curator with the rank of deputy  prime minister, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, moaned back in  November of 1990 that the minimum wage was less than the  subsistence minimum by at least a third. Today it amounts to  approximately 20 percent of the subsistence minimum. How is it  possible to pay a person, quite legally, an amount on which it  is impossible to exist?    [Melikyan] Well, actually, no one is being paid this  minimum,  and it is more for calculation purposes--proceeding based on it,  wages are calculated according to a wage scale in the  budget-controlled sphere. It is true that, according to the  statistical data, in public education 1.2 percent are being paid  according to the second category, but this is only 30 percent  more than the minimum. But for this money, people are working a  partial work day and holding down jobs, as a rule, in several  places. Usually they are pensioners. There is, unfortunately,  one more use of the minimum wage--it is paid to people who are  sent on forced leaves if an enterprise is on the brink of  bankruptcy.    [Protsenko] This seems familiar to us: "They pretend to pay  us, and we pretend to work." Payment of the minimum wage to  people on forced leaves helps the managers, under whose  leadership the enterprises were brought to the point of  bankruptcy, to survive, does it not?    [Melikyan] Theoretically, this is all true, but in  practice.... In our country, we are used to the fact that wages  perform not so much a stimulating role as the function of social  security. Do you want to break down this system? Fine, let us  raise the minimum wage, for example, sixfold and let the plant  manager decide if he can pay these wages to the people or if he  needs to fire a third of the workers. Is there any guarantee  that a social explosion will not occur at the enterprise and in  the city where a mass of unemployed people appears?    Of course, the minimum wage should be as close as possible  to  the subsistence minimum and, in the program adopted by the  government, provision has been made for raising it,  but--gradually. Remember: In order to give to one, it is  necessary to take from another!    [Protsenko] But is it not impossible to take from those  managers who have no money for workers' wages, but whose own  salaries are figured in "lemons" [millions]? Incidentally, such  information appeared in the press about the general manager of  the ZIL plant [motor vehicle plant imeni Lenin], is this true?    [Melikyan] I do not know how it was with Brakov, but there  have actually been and still are instances when the workers are  paid R80,000-R100,000, while the manager and his closest circle  are paid millions. At the end of last year, many executives  awarded themselves and their retinues completely outrageous  bonuses! Proceeding on the basis of this "experience," we  prepared proposals for regulating the executives' wages--they  also went into the governmental program. Now, based on a  contract with the state, a firm salary will be set for a manager  in relation to the type of production and the type of collective  he manages. And an executive can receive a salary supplement  only in an instance when the enterprise has derived a  substantial profit. The higher the profit, the higher the  supplement. At the same time, an item has been inserted into the  governmental program about strengthening control over the  distribution of funds for consumption--so that capital stock  will not be eaten up. At the same time, we proposed one more  measure--a temporary one which would permit restraining an  increase in the wage fund at enterprises where the wages already  exceed significantly the average for the sector. We also  proposed imposing certain restrictions for such enterprises: If,  for example, the price index rises over a quarter by 30 percent,  then the wage fund will increase by only 21 percent.    At first, some trade unions came out sharply against this  idea: We are, so they say, against any regulation of incomes! We  asked the dissenters: Do you realize that an enormous and  unfounded difference in incomes exists? "We do!" Do you  understand that the taxation mechanism, through which it would  be possible to solve these problems, will not begin working  either today or tomorrow? "We do!" Well then, shall we let this  madhouse be for the time being? "Let it be!"    So it is necessary to fight for social justice. As a result,  we then persuaded the trade unionists with the condition that  prices for a number of necessities will be regulated. Of course,  we had in mind not a direct restriction of prices, but rather  economic regulation, having proposed reducing the tax rate for  those commercial enterprises that increase the sale of goods.  And it can be increased by reducing (or at least not increasing)  retail prices. The budget would also gain--as sales increase,  the amount of tax receipts increase--and the consumer would gain  as well. And we would at least partially have solved the problem  of excessive differentiation of incomes. Unfortunately, for the  time being, this idea of ours has not been supported. It is true  that the presidential edict "On the Regulation of Assets  Directed Toward Consumption" has now been prepared: Enterprises  that have an average wage higher than 20 times the minimum wage  will have an additional tax imposed, which will go into the  local budget for rendering assistance to poor. The edict also  stipulates other measures for limiting excessive incomes.    [Protsenko] But does it not seem to you that you are looking  for a solution where there is none? The entire world is  combating the abnormal differentiation of incomes using an  income tax. There exist, as you know, taxes on wealth and real  estate taxes. "Poor Russia" is currently buying more Mercedes  than the entire civilized world--where is this purchasing power  coming from? Note: our entrepreneurs love very much to complain  about the "production" taxes: They say they are too high and  they make business expansion impossible. But complaints about  high taxes on personal incomes is something I have not heard. I  also do not know of an instance when a citizen who decides one  fine day to buy himself, let us say, an establishment for a  couple of hundred million has been asked by someone--no, not  about the source of his revenues--but rather, about whether or  not he had paid taxes on them.    [Melikyan] The root of this evil lies in the absence in our  country of normal taxation of natural persons. It is precisely  by these taxes that excessive incomes are regulated and  low-income people are supported. In the West, taxes from natural  persons amount to more than half of all budget receipts, while  they amount to only 8-10 percent in Russia. I will not even  mention the fact that the taxes are being collected very poorly  even from the enterprises. It is commonly believed that only 70  percent of taxes are currently being collected throughout the  country. Unfortunately, I fear it is just the opposite: 70  percent are remaining uncollected. We do not know how. Russian  citizens are not accustomed to paying taxes or even to figuring  out their incomes.    By the way, the tax on wealth is also a form of tax from  natural persons. We have inserted into the governmental program  an item on improvement of the system for taxing individual  incomes--we are hoping to prepare in the third quarter of this  year changes in the Law on the Income Tax from Natural Persons.  But we are not entertaining any particular illusions--both time  and our own standard of culture are needed for a radical change  in the tax system. Yet in our country even the tax service is  not ready, from a purely technical standpoint. Although, of  course, it is necessary to begin at some point....</p>

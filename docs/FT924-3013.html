			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / EC approves pounds 364m of aid for former Soviet Union The European Commission yesterday approved Ecu450m (Pounds 364m) of aid to the former Soviet Union, including Ecu100m for programmes to improve nuclear safety, writes Lionel Barber from Brussels. Russia is the largest beneficiary, with one quarter of the aid focused in the regions of St Petersburg, Moscow, Samara and Tyumen, mainly on helping businesses in food production, distribution and energy. Ukraine will receive Ecu48m. The Caucasian states - comprising Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - as well as the Central Asian states, including Kazakhstan, will receive technical aid worth Ecu57.4m. The EC money comes through the Tacis programme whose long-term goal is to use technical aid to help the nascent private sector and build up a market economy in the former Soviet republics. Last year, the EC committed Ecu400m to the newly independent states.</p>

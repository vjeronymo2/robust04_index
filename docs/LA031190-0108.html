			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST U.S. FOREIGN POLICY BEGINS AT HOME  </P> <P> It was to "create a more perfect Union" that the great men came to  Philadelphia; it was to permit the republic to grow to its natural size that  James K. Polk seized Texas and California; it was to preserve the Union -- not  end slavery -- that Lincoln invaded and subjugated the Confederate states.  </P> <P> "A republic if you can keep it," Benjamin Franklin told the lady in  Philadelphia. Surely, preservation of the Republic, defense of its  Constitution, living up to its ideals, that is our national purpose.  </P> <P> Yet national purpose has become a vessel, emptied of original content, into  which ideologues of all shades and hues are invited to pour their own causes,  their own visions.  </P> <P> In Charles Krauthammer's "vision," the "wish and work" of our nation should be  to "integrate" with Europe and Japan inside a "super-sovereign" entity that is  "economically, culturally and politically hegemonic in the world." This "new  universalism," he wrote for December's National Interest, "would require the  conscious depreciation not only of American sovereignty but of the notion of  sovereignty in general. This is not as outrageous as it sounds."  </P> <P> While Krauthammer's superstate may set off orgiastic rejoicing inside the  Trilateral Commission, it should set off alarm bells in more precincts than  Belmont, Mass. As national purpose, or national interest, it fails the  fundamental test: Americans will not fight for it.  </P> <P> A nation's purpose is discovered not by consulting ideologies, but by reviewing  its history, by searching the hearts of its people. What is it for which  Americans have always been willing to fight?  </P> <P> Well, let us go back to a time when the Establishment wanted war, but the  American people did not want to fight.  </P> <P> In the fall of 1941, Europe from the Pyrenees to Moscow, from the Arctic to  North Africa, was ruled by Hitler's Third Reich; east of Moscow, Stalin's gulag  extended across Asia to Manchuria, where it met the belligerent Empire of the  Rising Sun. England was in her darkest hour. Yet, still, America wanted to stay  out; we saw, in the world's bloody conflict, no cause why our soldiers should  be sent overseas to spill a single drop of American blood. Pearl Harbor, not  Franklin D. Roosevelt, made America to go to war.  </P> <P> The isolationism of our fathers is today condemned, and F.D.R. is adjudged a  great visionary, because he sought early involvement in Britain's war with  Hitler. But even the interventionists' arguments were, and are, couched in  terms of American national interest.  </P> <P> For a century after George Washington's death, we resisted the siren's call of  empire. Then, Kipling's call to "take up the white man's burden" fell upon the  receptive ears of President William McKinley, who came down from a sleepless  night of consulting the Almighty to tell the press: "God told me to take the  Philippines." We were launched.  </P> <P> Two decades later, 100,000 Americans lay dead in France in a European war  begun, as Otto von Bismarck predicted it would begin, "because of some damn  fool thing in the Balkans."  </P> <P> "To make the world safe for democracy" we joined an alliance of empires --  British, French and Russian -- that held most of mankind in colonial captivity.  Doughboys fell in places like the Argonne and Belleau Wood, in no small measure  to vindicate the German-phobia and Anglophilia of a regnant Yankee elite. When  the great "war to end all wars" had fertilized the seedbed that produced  Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin, Americans, by 1941, had concluded a blunder had  been made in ignoring the wise counsel of their Founding Father.  </P> <P> After V-E Day and V-J Day, all America wanted to "bring the boys home," and we  did. Then they were sent back, to Europe, to Asia, because Americans were  persuaded that the Cold War must be waged, because Lenin's party had made the  United States the "main enemy" in its war against the West. As the old saw  goes, you can refuse almost any invitation, but when the man wants to fight,  you've got to oblige him.  </P> <P> Now, if the Cold War is ending, what are the terms of honorable peace that will  permit us to go home? Withdrawal of the Red Army back within its own frontiers,  liberation of Central Europe and the Baltic republics, reunification of Germany  and the de-Leninizing of Moscow, i.e., overthrow of the imperialist party that  has prosecuted the 70 Years' War against the West.  </P> <P> The compensating concession we should offer is total withdrawal of U.S. troops  from Europe. If Moscow will get out, we will get out. Once the Red Army goes  home, the reason for keeping a U.S. Army in Europe vanishes. Forty years after  the Marshall Plan, let Europe conscript the soldiers for its own defense.  </P> <P> In 1956, at the high-water mark of the United States, America stood aside as  Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian revolution. With that decision, Dwight D.  Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles told the world that, while we support freedom  in Central Europe, America will not go to war over it. The year of revolution,  1989, revealed the logical corollary: from Berlin to Bucharest to Beijing, as  Lord Byron observed, "Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow."  </P> <P> Would America be leaving our allies in the lurch? Hardly. The North Atlantic  Treaty Organization contains 14 states which, together, are more populous and  three times as wealthy as a Soviet Union deep in an economic, social and  political crisis. Moreover, NATO would have a new buffer zone of free, neutral,  anti-communist nations between the Soviet and German frontiers. Our job will  have been done.  </P> <P> A united Germany is consistent with our values, our promise to the German  people -- and their national interest; Germans desire it and will attain it.  "Conditions" set down by the United States will prove as ineffectual as they  are insulting.  </P> <P> A free, united Germany in the heart of Europe, inoculated against Marxism by 45  years of the disease, would be a triumph of U.S. policy, a pillar of capitalism  and the first line of defense against a resurgent Russian imperialism. For the  United States to permit itself to be used by London, Paris and Moscow to impede  reunification is to re-enact, 70 years later, the folly of Versailles. Deny  Germans the unity they rightly seek and we shall awake one morning to find the  Russians have granted it.  </P> <P> But disengagement does not mean disarmament.  </P> <P> Still the greatest trading nation on earth, the United States depends on  freedom of the seas for prosperity. The strength of the U.S. Navy should be  non-negotiable; and when the President is invited to enter naval arms-control  negotiations, the answer should be no, even if Moscow walks out.  </P> <P> With the acquisition of ballistic missiles by China, Iran, Iraq, Syria and  Libya, with nuclear weapons work being done in half a dozen countries of the  Third World, the United States needs, nay, requires, a crash research and  development program for missile defense; no arms-control agreement is worth  trading away the Strategic Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> An island continent, America should use economic and technological superiority  to keep herself permanent mistress of the seas, first in air power, first in  space. Nor is the cost beyond our capacity; it is not warships and weapons that  consume half our defense budget; it is manpower and benefits. When defense cuts  are made, they should come in army bases no longer needed for homeland defense  and ground troops no longer needed on foreign soil.  </P> <P> As U.S. bases close in Europe, we should inform Moscow we want all Soviet  troops out of the Western hemisphere. They have no business here. This is our  hemisphere; and the Monroe Doctrine should be made again the cornerstone of  U.S. foreign policy.  </P> <P> We should also move our troops off the mainland of Asia. South Korea has twice  the population, five times the economic might of North Korea. We are not going  to fight another land war in Asia. No vital interest justifies it; our people  will not permit it. It is time we began uprooting the global network of  "tripwires" planted on foreign soil, to ensnare the United States in the wars  of other nations, to back commitments made before this generation of American  soldiers was even born.  </P> <P> The late Barbara Tuchman wrote that Kaiser Wilhelm could not stand it if,  somewhere in the world, a quarrel was going on and he was not a party to it.  Blessed by providence with pacific neighbors, north and south, and vast oceans,  east and west, to protect us, why seek permanent entanglement in other people's  quarrels?  </P> <P> As we ascend the staircase to the 21st Century, America is uniquely situated to  lead the world.  </P> <P> Japan has a population older and not half so large as ours; her land and  resources cannot match California's. Even a united Germany would have but a  third of our population, a fifth of our gross national product and a land area  smaller than Oregon and Washington. While the Soviet Union has the size,  resources and population to challenge as a world power, she is a prison house  of nations whose ethnic hatreds and unworkable system mean a decade of turmoil.  The corrupt, bankrupt China of Deng Xiaoping will not survive the decade.  Yasuhiro Nakasone was right: The 20th Century was the American century. The  21st will be the American century as well.  </P> <P> But America can lead the world into the 21st Century only if it is not saddled  down by baggage piled up in the 20th.  </P> <P> For 50 years, the United States has been drained of wealth and power by wars,  cold and hot. Much of that expenditure of blood and treasure was a necessary  investment. Much was not.  </P> <P> We cannot forever defend wealthy nations that refuse to defend themselves; we  cannot permit endless transfusions of the lifeblood of American capitalism into  the mendicant countries and economic corpses of socialism without bleeding  ourselves to death. Foreign aid is an idea whose time has passed. The communist  and socialist world now owe the West $1,000 billion and more, exclusive of  hundreds of billions we simply gave away. Our going-away gift to the globalist  ideologues should be to tell the Third World we are not sending the gunboats to  collect our debts, neither are we sending more money. The children are on their  own.  </P> <P> Americans are the most generous people in history. But our altruism has been  exploited by the guilt-and-pity crowd. At home, a monstrous welfare state of  tens of thousands of drones and millions of dependents consumes huge slices of  national income.  </P> <P> We should look, too, with a cold eye on the internationalist set, never at a  loss for new ideas to divert U.S. wealth and power into crusades and causes  having little or nothing to do with the true national interest of the United  States.  </P> <P> High among these is the democratist temptation, the worship of democracy as a  form of government and the concomitant ambition to see all mankind embrace it.  Like all idolatries, democratism substitutes a false god for the real, a love  of process for a love of country.  </P> <P> When we call a country "democratic," we say nothing about whether its rulers  are wise or good, or friendly or hostile; we only describe how they were  chosen.  </P> <P> How other people rule themselves is their own business. To call it a vital  interest of the United States is to contradict history and common sense. For  the Republic to seek to dictate to 160 nations what kind of regime each should  have is a formula for interminable meddling and endless conflict; it is a  textbook example of that "messianic globaloney" against which Dean Acheson  warned.  </P> <P> "We must consider first and last," Walter Lippmann wrote in 1943, "the American  national interest. If we do not, if we construct our foreign policy on some  kind of abstract theory of rights and duties, we shall build castles in the  air. We shall formulate policies which in fact the nation will not support with  its blood, its sweat and its tears." Exactly.  </P> <P> "Enlightened nationalism" was Lippmann's idea of a foreign policy to protect  America's true national interest. What we need is a new nationalism, a new  patriotism, a new foreign policy that puts America first -- and not only first,  but second and third as well.  </P></p>

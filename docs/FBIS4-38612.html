			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article: "President Abroad, Army on </F> Heightened Combat Readiness"]    [Text] Reports from Seoul to the effect that South Korea's  Army and police have been put on heightened combat readiness in  connection with President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Moscow that  begins today will elicit an understanding smile from the Russian  citizen. Experience shows that diverse problems may occur in  the absence of the country's leader. That is why a state of  heightened combat readiness is introduced in South Korea when  the head of state goes abroad.    This is particularly understandable now, when there are no  signs of any easing of tension in the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. And I think that this fact cannot but affect Kim  Yong-sam's upcoming talks with Boris Yeltsin. Needless to say,  our bilateral relations do not revolve around problems of  security. However, one is bound to see that the problems of  trade links and economic cooperation are in principle no  different from those that Russia has with other developed  states. There is also the question of Russia's debt to South  Korea and the difficulties standing in the way of South Korean  investors owing to our imperfect Russian legislation and Western  businessmen's fears due to the vagueness of our reforms.    There is no doubt that attention will be paid to all this  during the talks. However, the special feature of these  summit-level contacts between Moscow and Seoul is that South  Korea now seems extremely interested in cooperating with Russia  on the problem of nuclear security on the peninsula.    Kim Yong-sam's visit is taking place at a time when  relations  between the DPRK and the world community have deteriorated again  owing to suspicions regarding Pyongyang's nuclear program.  North Korea's leaders have once again upped the stakes in their  game of nuclear poker. Judging by statements by representatives  of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the DPRK is  replacing the fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor without  allowing this international organization's inspectors to monitor  this operation as they would like. It is a question of an  opportunity to find out what plutonium stocks the DPRK has and  consequently to determine whether or not it has the capability  of manufacturing nuclear munitions.    The UN Security Council urged the DPRK in a special  statement  to meet the IAEA's demands. This elicited an abrupt reproof  from Pyongyang. In this situation the wave of hypotheses  regarding possible tough measures against the DPRK is growing.  In particular, people are saying that the question of these  measures will be one of the main ones to be discussed at the  coming G-7 meeting in Naples (the Russian president will also  take part in it). At the same time military measures are also  being rehearsed. Thus, during the Rimpac-94 maneuvers a joint  grouping of U.S., Japanese, and South Korean ships will be  formed for the first time. Some experts regard this as a  rehearsal for joint actions in the event of the situation on the  Korean Peninsula worsening.    I will not venture to judge whether this pressure will have  any effect on the DPRK. But South Korea seems to be afraid of  further fueling tension. In particular, President Kim Yong-sam  stressed in an interview with NEWSWEEK that he considers the  reports exaggerated. Thus Moscow's and Seoul's positions may be  close in a desire to find real solutions to the situation and  give the DPRK a chance to meet the IAEA's demands and "save  face." That is precisely the purpose of the Russian proposal to  hold an international conference on the problems of nuclear  security on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul is also worried about  the way Moscow interprets the treaty concluded between the USSR  and the DPRK in 1961. In one way or another life itself is  pointing to Russia as an extremely important player in resolving  both the peninsula's nuclear problem and other problems of Asian  security.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMMO PILE FOUND IN GLESS SIEGE  </P> <P> A Santa Ana woman who barricaded herself inside a house owned by actress Sharon  Gless was armed with 500 rounds of ammunition, prosecutors said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Also, prosecutors said, during a burglary of the same Studio City residence a  week before the standoff, Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Santa Ana allegedly stole an  address book in hope of tracking down Gless at her Malibu home.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Chuck Hart said the book, which police found  during a search of Penn's car on Friday, did not contain the address of the  actress.  </P> <P> Penn, whom police described as an obsessed fan, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to  two counts of burglary at her arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court. If  convicted on both counts, Penn could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in  prison, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson, saying that Penn poses a danger to the  community, denied bail.  </P> <P> Penn surrendered to police after a seven-hour standoff Friday inside the  unoccupied house, which Gless uses as an office. Penn threatened to commit  suicide and locked herself in a bathroom while police negotiators tried to  persuade her to surrender, police said.  </P> <P> She was armed with a loaded .22-caliber AT-22 semiautomatic rifle that she had  bought from an Orange County sporting goods store three to four months earlier,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Penn had written more than 120 letters to Gless that had become increasingly  threatening, prosecutors said. In November, 1988, a court ordered Penn not to  harass the former star of the "Cagney and Lacey" TV series or come within 1,000  yards of the actress and her family.  </P> <P> Gless sought the order after receiving a letter from Penn's Santa Ana  psychiatrist that said: "Although this patient has no destructive intent toward  you, she did plan to shoot herself in front of you."  </P> <P> The arrest and unfolding charges shocked Penn's classmates at Golden West  College in Huntington Beach, where Penn studied drama and attended an acting  class just hours before breaking into Gless' home.  </P> <P> Students and instructors at Golden West's theater department said they are  perplexed by the news, saying that everything appeared normal as Penn left a  beginning-drama class Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Penn was earning an A in the course and never missed a day of class, instructor  Charles Mitchell said.  </P> <P> "I was watching the news Friday and there she was," Mitchell said. "I didn't  believe it. I thought it had to be a mistake."  </P></p>

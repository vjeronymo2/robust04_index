G. Apostolopulos's medical center has been interacting  closely with Russian medical personnel for a long time. He  opened a first aid station in Moscow equipped with special  machines for outpatient care brought in from Greece, there is a  diagnostic center, and other forms of cooperation are  developing. One other act of humanitarian assistance was carried  out in G. Apostolopulos's Athens clinic--an extremely complex  heart operation free of charge on Kseniya Lukidis, a girl from  St. Petersburg whom doctors in Russia were unable to cure.    ``Russia is a country with extremely rich resources, with  talented people who like to work,'' said the Greek businessman.  ``Having gained their freedom, your people will be able to  progress and flourish very quickly. The West needs to do more  than just provide humanitarian assistance: It should also  cooperate with Russia, it should not fear investing capital into  its economy, and it should supply new technology. All of this  will ultimately be advantageous to both sides.''</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIAL SERVICE PLANNED FOR SCHOOLS PIONEER HOWARD WOOD  </P> <P> Memorial services will be held Saturday for Dr. Howard Asa Wood, the first  president of the Torrance Unified School District Board of Education and one of  the district's founders.  </P> <P> Wood, who also was a founder and former chief of staff at Torrance Memorial  Medical Center, died Nov. 22 at the medical center. He was 95 years old.  </P> <P> "He was a very outgoing person, very generous," said Albert Posner, a retired  assistant superintendent of the Torrance school district, who was one of the  first principals hired by the fledgling school board in 1947. "He was wonderful  with children and a fine medical doctor," Posner said.  </P> <P> Born to farmer parents on the South Dakota prairie Jan. 12, 1894, Wood began  his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse before moving on to  undergraduate studies at Yale University and Linfield College in Oregon. He  graduated from Yale University's medical school in 1925.  </P> <P> Wood set up a medical practice in Long Beach, then moved to Beaumont, Calif.,  in 1930.  </P> <P> He came to Torrance in 1942 and quickly became one of several community  activists pushing for an independent Torrance school system, which at the time  was part of the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> In 1947, voters approved the new district, and Wood was selected as its first  president.  </P> <P> He is survived by a brother, Dr. Walter J. Wood of Corona; three nephews, David  Wood of Coronado, Leonard Wood of Laguna Beach and George Lewellen of Oregon;  and four nieces, Martha Kaye of Del Mar, Mary Eleanor Johnson of Fallbrook,  Joan Wood of Calabasas and Rebecca Beals of Oregon.  </P> <P> Services will be 11 a.m. Saturday at Halverson, Stone and Myers Mortuary in  Torrance. Memorial donations may be made to the Nature Conservancy, 1815 N.  Lynn St., Arlington, Va. 22209. Janet Rae-Dupree  </P></p>

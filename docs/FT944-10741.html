			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: M&amp;S advances 15% to Pounds 354m - Clothing, food and financial activities ahead, but furnishing suffers Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, lifted interim profits by 15 per cent on the back of a 7 per cent increase in sales. Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to October 1 grew from Pounds 308m to Pounds 354m, while sales increased from Pounds 2.87bn to Pounds 3.07bn. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman, yesterday described the trading climate as 'com-petitive' and consumers throughout the group's markets as 'cautious and value-conscious'. But the group was well placed to contain raw material price increases as its suppliers benefited from large production volumes. It would also continue to build on its 'traditional strengths of quality and value'. The shares yesterday closed at 404p, down 5 1/2 p. The UK, where the group now has 11.1m sq ft of selling space, continues to account for most of the turnover and profit. UK sales improved to Pounds 2.52bn (Pounds 2.37bn) and operating profits to Pounds 343m (Pounds 297m). The group continued to win market share in clothing, where sales improved by 8.9 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn. Food sales were ahead by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn. The group said that food sales had suffered from the fact that Easter, a traditionally strong period, had fallen in the previous financial year. It was confident the supermarkets were not eroding its market share. Home furnishing sales were down by almost 1 per cent. Sir Richard said the market had suffered a bad few months, with consumers cautious on big ticket items following tax increases. The group's financial activities lifted profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 18.5m following an increase in personal lending and a better performance on bad debts. The plan to accept debit cards, although not credit cards, will require a massive reprogramming of tills and information systems, which will begin after Christmas. Customers should be able to pay by debit card by next spring. The group is planning to open most of its stores on the four Sundays approaching Christmas now that Sunday trading is legal. But Sir Richard said it would continue to be 'very selective' in the stores it opened on Sundays for the rest of the year. At present about 30 are open regularly, although this could rise to 50. Outside the UK and Europe, sales were up from Pounds 276m to Pounds 291m, yielding operating profits of Pounds 10m (Pounds 8.7m). Operating profits at Brooks Brothers, the North American clothing subsidiary, fell from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 700,000. The group is looking for a US chief executive to replace Mr William Roberti, who leaves next month. The loss in Canada increased from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.9m. Sir Richard said the losses could mainly be blamed on rental costs - but said that Canada, with annual sales of Pounds 80m, was no longer a big problem. Earnings per share improved to 8.6p from 7.6p. The interim dividend is increased from 2.5p to 2.8p.</p>

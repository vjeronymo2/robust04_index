			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LOW BID TARNISHES GOLD FIRM STOCK  </P> <P> Share prices of Consolidated Gold Fields, the world's No. 2 gold producer,  dropped sharply today following the British mining conglomerate's decision to  accept a lower-than-expected bid from Hanson PLC.  </P> <P> Clearing the way for the largest corporate takeover in British history, Gold  Fields' board accepted the revised $5.6-billion offer from Hanson Tuesday  night. The bid values each Gold Fields share at $24.50 -- $22.90 in cash and  $1.60 in a special dividend and Hanson share warrants.  </P> <P> Gold Fields shares dropped 24 cents to $23.57 in early trading today,  reflecting disappointment in the agreed offer.  </P> <P> "It's a good deal for Hanson," Huw Williams, mining analyst at Kleinwort Benson  Securities, said today. "Shareholders were really given no option -- no other  bidder would come in -- so they'll probably get rid of their shares and be  happy about it."  </P></p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Gould may spark bout of Labour infighting MR BRYAN GOULD, Labour's leading Euro-sceptic, yesterday raised the prospect of a damaging bout of infighting by threatening to challenge Mrs Margaret Beckett next year for the party's deputy leadership. Mr Gould, who was decisively defeated by Mr John Smith in last year's leadership battle, said there was 'growing unhappiness with the party's current attitudes and strategy.' His comments follow a wide-ranging attack on Labour's centrist leadership in last week's Tribune, the newspaper of Labour's traditional left. Mr Gould acknowledged that a challenge to Mrs Beckett would not be possible this year because nominations had closed. However, he said unease among MPs and party activists 'might become more focused by this time next year, in which case the possibility of a challenge could not be ruled out.' He said: 'We have to do more to persuade people to vote Labour rather than sitting back and waiting for the Tories to lose support.' The extent of support for Mr Gould is unclear. Mr Peter Hain, secretary of the Tribune group of Labour MPs, said backing for 'radical socialist policies' was growing. He added: 'There is a widespread feeling in the parliamentary party and at constituency level that people are deeply disenchanted with the current drift on economic policy.' However Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary and former campaign manager for Mr Gould, said that 'divisions based on personalities' risked diverting the party.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Card spending reaches Pounds 20bn Shoppers spent a record total of almost Pounds 20bn using credit and debit card bills in 1993, a leading purchase processing company reported today. Barclays Merchant Services, which processes about 40 per cent of plastic card purchases, also recorded a huge surge in spending by last-minute festive shoppers, with more than 17m purchases in the last week before Christmas, a 40 per cent rise on the same period in 1992.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Coconut tycoon fights to retake Philippine group - Jose Galang unravels the webb of disputes about company ownership and voting rights that mark the comeback to the Manila corporate scene of Eduardo Cojuangco One of the most remarkable comebacks on the Philippine corporate scene is about to be brought off by Mr Eduardo 'Danding' Cojuangco, the coconut tycoon. Mr Cojuangco is in the final stages of retaking control of the United Coconut Planters Bank, which he helped set up in 1975 but was sequestered by the government in 1986 shortly after the fall of his patron, President Ferdinand Marcos. Mr Cojuangco's return to the Planters Bank should also open the door for his retaking of San Miguel, the country's largest industrial enterprise in which the Planters Bank holds a large block of shares that had been sequestered. Sequestration of both companies' shares was based on suspicion that they were acquired illegally by Mr Marcos, his relatives and business associates  -of whom the best known is Mr Cojuangco. Mrs Corazon Aquino, after assuming the presidency, set up a presidential commission on good government to track down and retrieve what she called the ill-gotten wealth. For Mr Cojuangco, regaining control of the Planters Bank and San Miguel will not only complete a task launched on his return to Manila in November 1989 from exile in the US, it could bolster his position in the Philippines' May election. Mr Cojuangco is one of eight candidates aiming to succeed his estranged cousin, Mrs Aquino, who is not seeking a second term as president. On a larger perspective, the musical chairs at the Planters Bank and San Miguel is an indictment of a system that induces businessmen to nurture political connections, even develop political acumen, to be able to stay the course. However, it remains unclear how Mr Cojuangco's regaining power at these companies will figure in his agenda if he wins the presidential election. Under the Philippine constitution, the president is not allowed to participate in any business. Mr Cojuangco's return to the Planters Bank, the country's sixth largest commercial bank in terms of assets, was paved by a Philippine Supreme Court ruling on March 4 upholding the coconut farmers' right to exercise the votes on their sequestered shares. At the time of the government's sequestration of nearly 95 per cent of the bank's outstanding shares in June 1986, Mr Cojuangco held 17.7 per cent. Another bloc representing 59.8 per cent was supposedly owned by 1.4m coconut farmers, although Mr Cojuangco and his associates of big landowners at the Philippine Coconut Producers Federation held proxies to these. Three Cojuangco appointees in the Planters Bank, all holding important positions in the bank, held 5 per cent each. The commission sequestered the Planters Bank on the argument that proceeds from a Marcos-era levy on coconuts had been used to set up the bank, so it should be run by the state. Total collections from the levy from 1973 to 1982 were estimated at 9.7bn pesos (Dollars 400m). The complex ownership layers in the levy-financed investments raised suspicions that Mr Marcos might have had shareholdings. The investments were made through various shell companies financed by a Coconut Industry Investment Fund, according to the commission investigators. One of Mr Cojuangco's appointees, Mr Danilo Ursua, the Planters Bank president at the time of the sequestration, admitted to the commission that he had endorsed to Mr Cojuangco all his shares in the bank in exchange for a guarantee to a loan to pay for his shares. Among items recovered at the presidential residence after Mr Marcos fled the country in 1986, were documents endorsing more than 16.2m shares in San Miguel. At today's prices, these are worth 972m pesos. The supreme court ruling on the Planters Bank excluded nominees of the commission who had been running the bank since 1986. It said the commission, as guardian of the bank's shares 'cannot exercise acts of strict ownership', including the right to vote. It directed that the Philippine anti-corruption court, before which the suits against Mr Cojuangco were filed by the government, conduct elections to the Planters Bank board using the court's guidelines. To prevent Mr Cojuangco and his group from 'dissipating' the bank's assets, the Supreme Court entitled the commission to appoint a comptroller and to review disbursements of more than 5m pesos. However, the presidential commission-installed board has no intention of letting go easily. Even as the commission's argument that the coconut levy investments should be managed by the state was still being pursued in the courts, the incumbent board postponed this year's annual shareholders' meeting, which should have been held on March 3. Mr Cojuangco's lawyers had petitioned the anti-corruption court to require the Planters Bank immediately to call board elections as ordered by the Supreme Court. The anti-corruption court is expected to rule on the petition in the next few days. At San Miguel, executives are edgy over the impending return of Mr Cojuangco. Many of them remember the company's unpleasant transformation, when Mr Cojuangco was chairman in the mid-1980s, from an apolitical enterprise, which had previously helped it survive the many political changes since it was set up as a small brewery in March 1890. Political intrigue and coconut levy money played a big role in Mr Cojuangco's entry into San Miguel. A bitter dispute in 1983 between the younger Mr Andres Soriano, then chairman, and his cousin Mr Enrique Zobel, one-time vice-chairman and head of Ayala Corporation, a property-based conglomerate with holdings in San Miguel, provided an entry for Mr Cojuangco. Mr Cojuangco's purchases of Mr Zobel's holdings were financed by the the Planters Bank. He declared that all his shares in San Miguel had been mortgaged to the bank. When Mr Soriano died in 1984, Mr Cojuangco assumed chairmanship and Mr Soriano's son, Andres, then only 33 years old, became president. After Mr Cojuangco fled the country with Mr Marcos during the 1986 rebellion, the young Mr Soriano moved to regain control of the corporation. But the principal element of his manoeuvre, the sale of the Planters Bank's 30 per cent holding to a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of San Miguel, Neptunia Corporation, aroused the suspicion of the commission. Fearing the transaction could benefit Mr Cojuangco or Mr Marcos, the commission sequestered the shares. Since then, the presidential commission nominees have been voting these shares, along with another bloc owned by Mr Cojuangco and two of his relatives. The supreme court last year ruled that Mr Cojuangco could vote this bloc, which enabled his group to regain three seats in the 15-member board last October. Now the Soriano family controls no more than 3 per cent of San Miguel's capital. If Mr Cojuangco's group gains the right to vote the Planters Bank holdings by April 21, the date of the next San Miguel annual meeting, the Soriano family is certain to be voted out.</p>

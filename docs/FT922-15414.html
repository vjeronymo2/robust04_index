			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sell-off threat to Labour's plans A FALL IN privatisation receipts in the financial year starting in April 1993 could pose a threat to Labour's spending plans. Although Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said on Monday that Labour would be 'on a par' with the Tories as regards income from privatisation, he said a Labour government would not add to projects in the pipeline. This suggests that Mr John Smith, if he becomes chancellor, could face a Pounds 9.5bn shortfall in revenues in 1993-94 and 1994-95. Yesterday, Mr Kinnock again shrugged off these concerns, describing them as 'crystal-ball gazing'. But his close aides were careful to add that a great deal will depend on how quickly Labour can re-establish growth. Questioned on the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte figures on future public spending options, Mr Kinnock said the accountancy firm had made the 'elementary error' of failing to account for Labour's willingness to continue with privatisations already begun. He would not make commitments beyond the coming financial year, but did concede that if the Red Book forecasts were proved incorrect it was 'conceivable' that Labour's programme would have to be reassessed in office. The Treasury Red Book envisaged privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn in the financial year starting today and Pounds 5.5bn in each of the two subsequent financial years. Whichever party is in power after the election is assured of privatisation proceeds of more than Pounds 6bn in 1992-93. But income of only Pounds 1bn is assured for 1993-94, while in 1994-95 the level of receipts assured at this stage falls to about Pounds 500m. Nearly Pounds 5.9bn of this year's privatisation receipts will come from second and third instalments of past share issues. The second instalment from the sale of the Scottish electricity companies should yield Pounds 835m in May, to be followed by Pounds 1,915m from the second instalment of the second BT sale in July, and Pounds 1,465m from the third payment due from the sale of the regional electricity companies in September. A third instalment from the BT sale is due next March and should yield Pounds 1,675m. A further inflow of Pounds 350m in 1992-93 is expected from repayment of debt and other small items. In addition, the government has announced plans to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity for about Pounds 350m. The Red Book projected a rise in the government's public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 28bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn in 1993-94, and subsequent declines in borrowing to Pounds 25bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 19bn in 1995-96. However, these projections take into account the Pounds 19bn of privatisation proceeds expected in the current and two following financial years. Without this income borrowing totals could be Pounds 37.5bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 30.5bn in 1994-95.</p>

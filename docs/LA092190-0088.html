			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO LOSES BID TO INTERVENE IN HYPERION DECREE  </P> <P> A federal judge has denied a motion by El Segundo to intervene in the 1987  consent decree that has led to a major long-term expansion project at the  Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. The work is necessary for Hyperion to comply  with the decree's requirement that the plant achieve full secondary sewage  treatment by 1998.  </P> <P> Officials in El Segundo, which borders Hyperion, fear that the expansion will  cause environmental and health problems for residents. The city sought to  become a party to the decree so it could participate fully in court decisions  made about the project. But federal Judge Harry Pregerson, who is supervising  the consent decree, ruled that the intervention was not timely because the  Hyperion case began in 1977.  </P> <P> Pregerson, however, granted the city "friend of the court" status, which  permits it to bring concerns about Hyperion to the court's attention. However,  the city may not make motions in the case.  </P> <P> In its request to intervene, which Pregerson ruled on without oral argument,  the city contended the action was proper because El Segundo did not learn the  extent of the Hyperion expansion until last year. El Segundo's request was  opposed by the city of Los Angeles, which is a party to the consent decree  along with state and federal environmental agencies.  </P> <P> "We are very pleased the city will have a voice in the proceedings, although we  think we should have a stronger voice," said City Atty. Leland Dolley.  </P> <P> But John Haggarty, a deputy Los Angeles city attorney, agreed with the court.  "There already is a judgment. Nothing is to be served by (El Segundo) coming in  now," he said.  </P></p>

[Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 25 May  carries a related report from Washington by Arye Golan, adding  that "in a meeting with Israeli correspondents yesterday, Peres  said that if the supporters of peace among the Palestinians do  not seize control of the self-government areas, there will be no  point in continuing the negotiations.

The report adds that "as for the future, Peres asserted  that the Palestinians prefer to continue the autonomy  negotiations immediately in Cairo and not in Washington."]</p>

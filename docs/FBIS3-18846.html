			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Luca De Biase and Marco Fossi: </F> "Telecommunications: The All-Out Battle"]    [Text] Behind the challenge for the new cellular telephone  market. Fiat, Fininvest, Olivetti, ENI [Italian Hydrocarbons  Corporation] in the arena for a 3-trillion-lire business. The  common enemy: the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company].  It possesses a secret weapon.    A revolver pointed at the nape of the neck: "Pull over." The  truck driver obeys the order, then surrenders the steering wheel  as the hijacker places a hood over his head. The cargo ends up  in a clandestine warehouse, and the hijackers abandon the TIR  [International Road Transport] vehicle and its driver. But when  does help arrive? Almost always too late. Each year Italian  insurance companies pay out 4 trillion lire for claims on TIR  robberies. In two years, though, the story will have a different  ending. As soon as the truck deviates from its route, a  satellite will warn police headquarters, which in turn will  sound the alarm. The credit goes to AT System, a small  Rovereto-based enterprise, which together with Seat and Apple  has already developed the solution. But above all, the credit  goes to the telecommunications crown's latest jewel, the GSM  [Global System for Mobile Communications].    Yes, the GSM, the so-called telefonino europeo [little  European cellular phone] which is much more than just a cellular  telephone set. It is a system of voice and data transmission  that will change our everyday lives. The "telefonino europeo"  [smaller and lighter than the "telefonino tradizionale" which in  popular usage identifies with Italy's present conventional  SIP-operated cellular system] will make it easier to call a taxi  and find a hospital bed. For the price of a local call we will  be able to exchange written messages. Motorists will be kept  constantly informed of traffic conditions. A revolution that in  a few years, in Italy, will have enlisted at least 4 million  subscribers, and that, to the network carriers, will be worth  3-4 billion lire a year. In keeping with a European Community  directive against monopolies, the GSM carriers will be two: the  public sector's SIP and a private-sector group.    The competition is entering the heated stage. On Saturday 15  January the private-sector candidates formally stated their  interest in participating in the bidding that between April and  May will decide who the second GSM carrier will be. In the days  preceding this first step, the maneuvers had become increasingly  intricate, ending in the surprise alliance between the team of  companies of the ENI group and the consortium led by Fiat and by  Fininvest (publisher of PANORAMA among other things). The next  two weeks will usher in another decisive step: The much awaited  call for bids, with the rules that will regulate the new market.    The fight for the big money-making GSM market will be  extremely harsh. On one side SIP, which until now has enjoyed  the telecommunications monopoly and is determined to sell its  skin dearly. On the other, all the big Italian groups that have  entered the arena, in competition with each other, and are ready  to invest 1.5 trillion lire over the next five years. A risky  investment? Apparently not. Rather, a good opportunity. From  Olivetti to Fiat, from Fininvest to Marzotto, backed by  international telecommunications giants, everybody is well aware  of the success of Italy's traditional cellular telephone system:  1.2 million subscribers, 200,000 in the last three months alone,  in spite of the recession; and billings totaling 1.5 trillion  lire.    But, in view of the extremely tough underground battle the  SIP is already waging, the GSM's big money-making potential  could also prove to be not very profitable for the  private-sector carrier during the initial years of operation.  First of all, thanks to heavy investments and contained rates,  through its public monopoly and with sights set on the future  GSM, SIP has been able to push its marketing of cellular  telephones to the limit, and has thus captured a sizable market  advantage. Secondly, through the political pressures it has been  applying, SIP could pull off a surprise coup: Demand  indemnification for the loss of its monopoly, at the expense of  the second carrier.    At any rate, by the end of 1995, by which time the European  "telefonino" is expected to become fully operational, the  state-owned carrier will enjoy a commanding position. "In two  years, SIP will have 2 million subscribers between its  traditional and GSM cellular systems, whereas the second carrier  will have at most 300,000," says Franco Morganti, vice president  of Teknibank, a high-technology-market research company. "The  private-sector company will not have an easy road. SIP will be  in a position to suggest to its subscribers who might be tempted  to go to the competition's GSM that they continue subscribing to  its traditional cellular telephone service at slashed rates,  inasmuch as, by that time, its investments for the old network  will already have been amortized."    It will certainly not be easy to defeat SIP with a price  war,  considering that, thus far, its public-sector GSM rates are the  lowest in Europe (even though subjected to a tax system that is  less favorable than in many other countries). SIP's GSM rates  average 663 lire per minute, versus Great Britain's 830 lire,  and the lowest-priced German carrier's 1,154 lire.    Services, for the most part, will thus be the field on which  the game will be played. And from this viewpoint, the GSM has  enormous potential. Far more than that of mere cellular  telephone service! While traditional cellular terminals are of  the analog type, requiring transmission by way of sounds, GSM  terminals are full-fledged microcomputers that talk to each  other in bit language, and permit contact with all of Europe's  connected areas without national limitations. They can transmit  data without using modems or faxes, which are costly and  generate annoying distortions. Two bursts will suffice to send  the equivalent of a two-page document. The telephone-answering  system will signal the presence of recorded calls. The billing  facility will no longer be connected to a terminal, but instead  to a microprocessor-equipped card that can be moved from one  suitably equipped telephone set, fax, or modem to another.    But there is much more. The connections to central offices  capable of providing services will be easier to make. By  installing the GSM card in a microcomputer such as Apple's  Newton, for example, the motorist can have a navigation system:  A map of the zone in which he finds himself will appear on his  video screen, together with a recommended itinerary for reaching  his destination. Subscribers will be warned if there is fog on  the road. And a service center will be able to keep parked cars  under surveillance in order to foil robbery attempts. And there  is more. It will be possible to send an identical message  simultaneously to groups of subscribers with the same  requirements: to every stock-exchange investor, for example, who  is to be advised in case the Comit index exceeds a certain  threshold value. It will also be possible to operate taxi and  TIR fleets. And Olivetti has already developed a system to  optimize the dispatching of police cars.    The network carriers will be able to offer all these  services  directly or through third parties with whom they will share the  receipts. "SIP's aspiration is to generate traffic" says an  analyst. "SIP will therefore subcontract the services, settling  with the contractors within 60 days, and earning a banking  profit. The private-sector company instead will be inclined to  offer services directly, aiming at value-added returns."    But which privately owned group will be the winning  private-sector GSM carrier? In the absence of presently  unforeseen developments, according to observers, the top  contenders are Unitel and Omnitel.    Unitel gained strength on Tuesday 11 January by allying  itself with the group headed by ENI. Thus, as of today, this  consortium consists of Finintel (51 percent Fiat and 49 percent  Fininvest) with 54 percent of Unitel's stock; Vodafone 20  percent; SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company], AGIP Petroli  [Italian National Oil Company], and Italgas [Italian Gas  Company] with a total of 13 percent; Bell South 10 percent; and  minor partners including Salvatore Lingresti's Premafin. Omnitel  consists of Olivetti with 51 percent, Bell Atlantic 16.6  percent, Cellular Communications International 14.7 percent,  Telia 9.7 percent, and Lehman Brothers 8 percent.    Both groups can count on important strong points. Both have  international allies that have already acquired eminent  experience in the sector. Francesco Caio, president of Omnitel,  can count above all on Olivetti's computerization expertise and  on its capacity for integrating computer, telecommunications,  and fax technologies. The group, moreover, has already begun  developing the software to operate certain specialized services.    Unitel, on the other hand, headed by Niccolo Nefri, besides  its know-how in the operation of national networks, and its  ownership of many sites suitable for antenna installation,  already possesses private telephone lines today that will tend  to minimize the difficulties of covering the territory.  "Furthermore, Italgas's contribution should not be  underestimated," says Nefri. "This company knows everything  there is to know about the business of billing, which is a very  important technical problem."    According to international analysts interviewed by Reuters,  the group headed by Olivetti has long been the number one  favorite, but the Fiat-Fininvest group's chances appear  increased by its association with ENI. "That agreement was not  good news for Olivetti, because it strengthens Unitel in the  very areas in which it lacked technical experience" says Jan  Macleod, a NatWest analyst. "As far as software is concerned,  Olivetti remains the strongest" Alberto Rella from Milla &amp; Co  notes. "But as regards hardware, Unitel is now ahead. Moreover,  by joining forces with ENI, Unitel has gained strength from  political contacts."    In fact, private-sector groups will have to know how to  lobby  effectively in Rome. Because the problem will be not only that  of defeating a market leader as strong as SIP in the  marketplace. Some obstacles could be of another nature. The  government had established relatively burdensome prerequisites  from the outset, for privately owned companies. These included  capitalization requirements for eligible consortiums, tight  deadlines for submitting applications; and a commitment to cover  40 percent of the Italian territory with the GSM network within  18 months.    But the next moves will be the crucial ones. By the end of  January, the Telecommunications Ministry, headed by Maurizio  Pagani, will publish its call for bids, a 50-page set,  approximately, of specifications on which the interested  consortiums must base their definitive bids. "The important  pages of that call for bids will be mainly three," says an  expert: "Those containing the rules that will regulate relations  between SIP and private-sector companies." The problem is one of  the thorniest. Telephone calls made by subscribers of the second  carrier--and especially those made to traditional  telephones--will in fact have to transit portions of SIP's  networks. And SIP's charges for this transit could be high  enough to cause financial problems for its competitor.    "The governments of all countries of the world," says  Unitel,  "regulate relations in such way as to guarantee the conditions  governing competition." In Italy, this cannot be taken for  granted. SIP wants to be compensated for the loss of its  monopoly and is expected to request the government's  authorization to compensate for its losses at the expense of the  competition, by making the private-sector carrier pay through  the nose, at very high rates, for the public-sector lines it  will have to use, thus exacting a toll that could cost the  privately owned company hundreds of billions of lire. Might this  suffice to convince the privately-owned groups to throw in the  sponge? Some experts believe the possibility exists. SIP's  indemnification could be borne by the state, of course. But  Palazzo Chigi is turning its deaf ear in the direction of this  proposal.    Another analyst argues, however, that "SIP cannot be having  peaceful dreams, because the intent of the antitrust authority  is specifically to prevent any abuse of dominant position."  Indeed, in this market, the competition will quickly broaden to  include new carriers, for the very reason that the GSM is a  European system. Between 1996 and 1998, at the very time, that  is, when the new system becomes fully operational, deregulation  will also enter into effect. This means that an Italian in Italy  will be able to subscribe to the service even in Denmark if he  finds it more advantageous to do so, and that lobbying  strategists for the protection of market shares can expect to be  given their walking papers.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: OLD-TIME SANDWICH SHOP IN OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> There aren't many places that would lay claim to serve something called "ugly  fries," and even fewer that would brag about it.  </P> <P> An eatery that does boast of its hard-to-regard spuds is Renee's Sizzling  Sandwich Shop in Oceanside, a place that stakes its reputation on the supreme  edibility of its skin-on, French fried potatoes.  </P> <P> This might seem to be a small potatoes claim to fame, which in fact, it is. The  restaurant, a tip from a reader who waxed enthusiastic about the "steak combo"  sandwich, may not rate a special trip, but it is a good, rare example of an  old-fashioned sandwich shop that prepares foods fresh to order and is worth a  try if you happen to be both hungry and in the vicinity of Mission Boulevard.  </P> <P> Renee's style is on the casual side, to say the least, although orders placed  at the counter will be delivered with an enthusiastic smile, an offer of such  condiments as jalapeno peppers and no evident expectation of a tip. The place  occupies a storefront in yet another strip mall, this one graced by the  presence of batting cages, which may account for some of the wall-mounted  sports memorabilia, which range from bumper stickers extolling the thrills of  surfing to a banner decorated with autographed shoe soles from a winning soccer  team.  </P> <P> To dive right into the cuisine, which one perforce must, since there are no  preliminary diversions here, pick up one of the hot pink menus at the counter  and run down the list of sandwich specials. The hottest numbers all revolve  around the theme of thinly sliced steak grilled Philadelphia style, which can  be had with onions, mushrooms or bell peppers or with all three of them plus  mozzarella cheese.  </P> <P> This particular sandwich, served on a choice of a 6-inch or 12-inch roll (the  latter would have to be for really huge appetites), has most of the virtues of  a Philadelphia steak-and-cheese and some of its failings: The meat is chewy and  fairly flavorful, and the onions and peppers add a good, sharp accent. The  cheese and mushrooms disappear in the general rush, however, and the sandwich  is greasy -- tradition may call for it to be greasy, but greasy it is, so much  so that one of those famous, all-American, foil-packaged "moist towelettes"  would be a welcome supplement to the paper napkins.  </P> <P> Other hot sandwich choices include Polish and Italian sausage subs, a BLT, ham  and cheese and the dreaded tuna melt; there are also hamburgers in all  varieties (including one with Ortega chilies) that are good enough to make one  pine for the days when the corner tavern served the best lunch in town, and the  golden arches had yet to be erected.  </P> <P> None of these, of course, is quite complete without a plastic basket of ugly  fries. Skin-on spuds generally lack charm and are notable for their toughness,  but Renee's takes the trouble to fry these signature spuds to a fine crispness  and they are, to be brief, quite tasty. They also arrive in quantity and, once  again, a caveat applies that a large order would appeal only to a truly healthy  appetite.  </P> <P> As unassuming as it may be, Renee's does mark a return to the old-fashioned  breakfast and lunch counter by serving what it calls "eye opener" breakfasts  between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. None of these were sampled for this column, but the  list is appealing. It opens with such Mexican specialties as machaca (highly  seasoned shredded beef), chorizo with eggs and huevos rancheros (all served  with beans and tortillas) and continues with various egg dishes, French toast  and buttermilk pancakes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RENEE'S SIZZLING SANDWICH SHOP  </P> <P> 3320 Mission Blvd., Oceanside  </P> <P> Calls: 722-8017  </P> <P> Hours: Open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday; closed Sundays.  </P> <P> Cost: Sandwiches range from $2.95 to $5.30, breakfasts from $1.75 to $4.50.  </P></p>

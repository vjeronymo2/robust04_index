			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: BHF bank shows 30% improvement THE OPERATING profits for Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, advanced 30 per cent in the first four months of the current year compared with the previous corresponding period. Partial operating profits - excluding the contribution from trading - increased by 21.5 per cent, Mr Klaus Subjetzki, outgoing senior partner, told the bank's annual meeting. Total assets climbed by 5.2 per cent to DM28.1bn (Dollars 17.6bn), while interest income was up 5.5 per cent and commission income up 20 per cent. The results are in line with strong results from other German banks which have also reported good figures for the early part of the current year. The results follow a record year for the German banking sector and suggest that there has been only a moderate slowdown in loan demand in spite of a sharp downturn in German economic activity. The sector is also benefiting from a recent improvement in conditions in the domestic stock market.</p>

The parties are the National Party, Democratic Party,  African  National Congress, Pan-Africanist Congress, Freedom Front,  Minority Front, Dikwankwetla [strong], Worker's List Party and  Soccer Party.    The IEC said in a statement the payments made varied from  just over R48,000 [rand] to about R1.2 million after the parties  had submitted either an acceptable opinion poll indicating their  support or a list of signatures from supporters. It added the  money was for the exclusive purpose of conducting election  campaigns, and the parties had complied with section 74 of the  Electoral Act.    "An amount of R11 million, half of the R22 million available  in the fund, will be distributed among participating parties  before the election and the balance afterwards," the IEC said.    Parties that have not yet applied had been given until 4.30  PM on Friday, March 25, to submit lists of signatures as  required by the Electoral Act. "If they supply adequate and  proper lists, money from the electoral fund will be paid to  them," the statement said.</p>

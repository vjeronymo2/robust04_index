			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairman of the Russian government Viktor  Chernomyrdin completed a two day working trip to St. Petersburg  where he delivered a speech at an annual meeting of the EBRD  Council of Managers and visited a number of enterprises.    On Monday Chernomyrdin visited one of the major joint-stock  enterprises in St.Petersburg -- the Kirov plant. Near the plant  he was met by a picket organized by the local independent trade  union, whose participants demanded that the plant be able to  work without interruption. As Interfax learned at the managing  board of the plant, the Kirov plant has not been working full  working weeks, and in some workshops there are cases of delayed  payment of wages.    At a meeting with plant officials Chernomyrdin promised to  grant financial aid to the Kirov plant and supported plans of  the directorate to launch production of modern equipment for  gas-pumping stations on the basis of German technology, as well  as equipment for gas and steam-turbine electric power stations.    Chernomyrdin suggested that plant officials consider  producing a new modern bus meeting Russian requirements in  cooperation with the KAMAZ automobile maker. On Monday evening  Chernomyrdin will return to Moscow.</p>

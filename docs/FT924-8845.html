			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / International Company News: Youghal Carpets Youghal Carpets went further into the red in the half year ended July 5, reflecting lower turnover, higher operating losses and exceptional charges. The group is based in Ireland but 75 per cent of sales are made in the UK. Pre-tax loss for the period was IPounds 2.17m, or Pounds 2.35m, against IPounds 1.69m. Reorganisation costs this time accounted for IPounds 121,000. Turnover fell 6 per cent to IPounds 22m (IPounds 23.4m) reflecting the depressed UK market and a slow down in Ireland. Operating losses were up from IPounds 660,000 to IPounds 977,000. The benefits of cost savings offset the lower volumes to produce an overall operating result for UK activities in line with the previous year. Lower consumer demand in Ireland affected volumes and margins leading to a deterioration in the trading performance. Short time working also affected the result. Losses per share came to 4.82p (3.8p).</p>

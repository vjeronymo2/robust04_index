			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Noriega begins defence against drug charges: Panama strongman was US ally, lawyer says LAWYERS for former Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega opened his defence yesterday with the claim that he was a key US ally in the war against drug traffickers. Defence attorney Jon May said in a federal district court in Miami the defence would seek to show that Gen Noriega provided unprecedented co-operation to the US in its efforts to stem the flow of illegal narcotics into the country. Gen Noriega, who was arrested by American troops after the December 1989 invasion, could get up to a 140-year prison sentence on drug and racketeering charges. Mr May said defence witnesses would include three former administrators of the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA agents who had worked in Panama and 'placed their lives in the hands of Gen Noriega', a former US ambassador to Panama, the former head of intelligence for the US army and two Central Intelligence Agency officials . Mr May said Gen Noriega's assistance had covered a number of areas, including assistance in the seizure of drug ships on the high seas and in identifying and apprehending people in Panama charged with US drug crimes. He said there would be testimony regarding sensitive and secret joint operations by US and Panamanian law enforcement officers. In proclaiming the general's innocence to the jury, Mr May described Gen Noriega as a trusted and stalwart ally in US drug interdiction efforts. Following the opening statement the defence called its first witness, Mr Peter Bensinger, who was the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration from 1976 to mid-1981. The trial judge, Mr William Hoeveler, allowed Mr Bensinger to be treated as a hostile witness. His testimony, which was guarded, illustrates one of the difficulties that will face the defence, which relies heavily on the evidence of current and former government officials. Even before the US invaded Panama, US policy treated Gen Noriega as an adversary, so government officials may find themselves being asked to give testimony which contradicts the US rationale for hostility toward the general. A second defence witness, Mr John Lawn, in charge of the DEA from 1985 to 1987, was more forthcoming. He acknowledged having praised Gen Noriega for his 'continued success in fighting the drug menace which affects all of us'.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: After all, what are good fronds for? THE PUBLICATION of two comprehensive books on ferns is of importance, as the popular literature on this great group of plants is not extensive and much of it is intended for the specialist. In The Cultivation of Ferns (Batsford Press, Pounds 25) Andrew Machugh does address himself to gardeners in general, his book is nicely illustrated with good colour photographs and line drawings. There are good ideas about growing ferns where space is limited, by making raised beds with soils to suit particular types, and advice and lists of desirable varieties. The second book was published last year, and is called Ferns in Your Garden (Souvenir Press, Pounds 18.99). Illustrations, in colour and black-and-white, are excellent and, although author John Kelly does not claim to be a fern specialist, he is a general writer and broadcaster on horticultural subjects. He has clearly mastered his subject and, like Machugh, deals with it exhaustively. But a whole book on ferns, is clearly for people who are going to cultivate them seriously, probably regarding them as a speciality and aiming to build a collection. That would be easy: according to Machugh, there are 67 fern species native to northern Europe with a further 250 species in temperate north America. Many ferns - and this seems to be particularly true of native British species - produce all manner of variations in the character of their fronds. In Victorian times there was great interest in collecting and exhibiting these minor varieties and giving them long, pseudo-botanical names. All this can be great fun for those who enjoy such things, but at the present time I see no prospect of a return to this kind of obsession. What could be achieved with the right kind of information - and more ready availability of hardy ferns in garden centres - would be a much greater use of ferns in mixed garden settings; sometimes in mixed borders, along with other herbaceous plants; sometimes in woodland or, if that sounds altogether too grand, growing beneath a few trees; a natural habitat for many ferns. Some are also natural rock plants, and there are those, like wall rue, Asplenium ruta-muraria, and the rusty back fern, Ceterach officinarum, which thrive in the crevices of limestone walls, seemingly extracting a living from virtually nothing but stone and a little accumulated debris. By contrast, there are the luxuriant moisture-lovers, such as the Royal Fern (Osmunda regalis), which grows in fens and has great fronds up to 10 ft high. In Britain it used to be more common than it is today, and no one would want to start another mad hunt for Royal Ferns to dig them up and bring them into the garden. But there is no need for this. Wild ferns are easy to raise from spores, which are produced very freely, and also by other means. If there were a steady demand for a few dozen kinds, it would be possible for nurseries to produce them quite cheaply with no deprivation of the environment. The Royal Fern is by no means the only fern that is ideal for planting beside a pool or stream or in a damp hollow. Another, which I am especially fond of, is the ostrich feather fern, or matteucia, a wonderfully green fern with long, rather narrow fronds, that grow almost straight up, like a narrow shuttlecock. This fern looks wonderful in a damp spot, either in the open, or in semi-shade. Ferns are by no means always ferny. The hartstongue, in its common form, has undivided, shining green fronds, and will lodge itself between rocks or around the boles of trees. I have one that I found growing wild in my garden, and moved to a cleft between the roots of a cut-leaved elder, where it has made itself at home. It shares the ground with hardy, ivy-leaved cyclamen, which are colonising this part of the garden. The two plants both enjoy such moderately shady places. But, although typical hartstongue has undivided fronds, there are forms which are pruned or crested, the fronds splitting at the top into smaller sections. These forms are no more beautiful than the general type. Indeed, it could be said that they are freaks, but they add interest to a collection. By contrast some ferns have fronds which are almost unbelievably complex. The polystichums tend to be of this character, and the hard-shield ferns (polystichum aculeatum) and the soft-shield fern (P. Setiferum) are of this type. I grow the latter in the same mixed border as the hartstongue fern, but in a place where there is much greater depth of soil, and it does very well. There is a fascinating form of it, named Proliferum, which forms little baby ferns all along some of the fronds. If you take the trouble to hold these fronds flat to the soil with stones or pieces of bent wire, the little plants will root and start to grow vigorously. After a while, the while frond can be severed and the separate plants, with roots, can be cut out singly, giving quite a crop. Many ferns grow in hedgerows, usually most abundantly on the shady side, and this gives a clue to the conditions in which ferns like to live. The male fern, Dryopteris felix-mas, is one of the commonest of these, and it appears frequently as an intruder in my garden. It makes large, well-divided fronds, not among the prime beauties, but very acceptable in the rougher parts of the garden, where its dead fronds in winter are not a nuisance. I would like to see more garden-owners taking up ferns in this rather relaxed way.</p>

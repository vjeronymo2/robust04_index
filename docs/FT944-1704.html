			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Evading US fiscal reality US politicians have spent the weeks since the congressional elections 'learning the lessons' of the Republicans' victory. Most now believe they must promise the voters a dubious fiscal cocktail in the years ahead. The US is not the only country in which economic realities seem increasingly at odds with political ones. Few, however, can boast such a powerful consensus in favour of ignoring the first. The post-November strategy which Mr Clinton finally unveiled last Thursday centres around middle-class tax cuts and departmental downsizing. He pledged to 'be straight with the American people' about the real consequences of these budgetary decisions. On paper, at least, the plan does add up rather better than many of the competing proposals currently on offer on Capitol Hill. But none paints an honest picture of the economic realities facing the US in the short and medium term. Mr Clinton offered tax cuts for 'middle-income' households worth about Dollars 60bn over five years. He observed the post-November rules of the game by promising to offset these with cuts in discretionary government spending, rather than tampering with federal benefits to individuals ('entitlements') or raising other tax revenues. As many remarked, the speech echoed many a latter-day Republican theme as well as some of his 1992 election campaign. Characteristically, he aimed to please everyone and so, perhaps, pleased relatively few. Certainly there was little to prompt either Republicans or Democrats to forsake their more ambitious tax-cutting gambits when passing next year's budget. Reform package It is to Mr Clinton's credit that he merely echoed these proposals, many of which were on show last week, rather than trying to out-bid them. But a more courageous president would have picked another model altogether for his efforts, namely the ambitious fiscal reform package put forward a few days earlier by Senators Robert Kerrey and John Danforth. The Senators' plans are unique in admitting that neither tax cuts nor an unchanged system of entitlements is consistent with long-term US fiscal stability. The federal budget deficit will begin to rise again in 1996. Interest payments and social benefits will, on the basis of current commitments, consume nearly three-quarters of all federal revenues by 2003, and 100 per cent 10 years later. By 2030, total federal expenditures are projected to exceed 37 per cent of GDP, compared with just 22 per cent today. If policies remain unchanged, by then this year's modest Dollars 22bn surplus of Social Security tax revenues over outlays would have turned into an annual deficit of over Dollars 450bn. It should go without saying that this will not happen. The only question is when, and how, it will be stopped. Small steps Messrs Kerrey and Danforth proposed a few measures to stop the rot, such as gradually raising the retirement age from 65 to 70 and means-testing some benefits, fewer than a fifth of which go to poor households. Mr Clinton was not alone in finding these and other measures unthinkable. None of the other members of the commission on entitlement reform - chaired by Mr Kerrey - could stomach them either. It broke up agreeing on only the need for fundamental reform, and some minor, though useful, changes in the procedure for assessing the budget. Mr Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction package included some very small steps towards lowering benefits for wealthy households. With the recovery entering a buoyant fifth year of recovery, the short-term case for further retrenchment is now even stronger. Meanwhile, the Republicans claim that their corporate and individual tax cuts would be accompanied by enough spending cuts to be consistent with further deficit reduction. Yet they hope to reverse even Mr Clinton's modest 1993 changes to entitlements. The president was right on Thursday to admit, implicitly at least, that the budget would never be balanced without benefit changes at least as ambitious as the Kerrey-Danforth programme. He may also be right in thinking that endorsing the latter would be political suicide in the current US climate. In the long run, however, voters are unlikely to reward either Mr Clinton or Congress for suggesting that this type of reform could painlessly be deferred.</p>

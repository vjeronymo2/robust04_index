			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Ital-Thai Development prices issue Italian-Thai Development, which dominates the Thai construction sector, has set its initial public offer price for 25m shares or 10 per cent of the company at Bt175, valuing the company at Dollars 1.72bn. Analysts say the price, at the top of the indicated range of Bt150 - Bt175, leaves little room for immediate trading gains after listing. Nevertheless Italian-Thai, south-east Asia's biggest construction company based in a country requiring decades of infrastructure development, will prove attractive to foreign and local investors. Subscription is on July 6 - 8. Last year Ital-Thai made a net profit of Bt1bn (Dollars 40m) on turnover of Bt11.61bn.</p>

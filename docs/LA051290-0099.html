			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL VOTES FUNDS FOR LAPD ASIAN  TASK FORCE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council members voted Friday to fund the Los Angeles Police  Department's Asian task force, which had been threatened with losing its budget  allocation.  </P> <P> Police officials had warned that the unit would be disbanded this year if the  city declined to fund the unit.  </P> <P> For the last 14 years, Mayor Tom Bradley and the council had repeatedly turned  down equipment and funding requests, forcing the task force to rely on money  from the Police Department's general fund.  </P> <P> In Friday's vote, the council allocated $361,000 from the city's 1990-91  reserve fund to provide the 12-officer division with equipment and upgrade the  pay and rank of some of the officers.  </P> <P> The proposal now goes to the mayor for approval.  </P></p>

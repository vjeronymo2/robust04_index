			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Vosper staff accept 7% pay deal VOSPER THORNEYCROFT, the shipbuilder, announced yesterday it had reached a two-year, 7 per cent pay agreement with its workforce of 2,000. The deal involves a 3 per cent basic wage increase this year with a further 4 per cent in 1994. But the pay increase was conditional on the workforce accepting the introduction of a three-shift system of working and the introduction of individual worker certification of quality levels in prod-uction. Two small improvements in benefits were included in the agreement. Manual workers will be able to claim company sick pay from the first day of sickness absence and not the second, bringing them into line with white-collar staff. The rate of the sick pay will rise by 3 per cent this year and a further 4 per cent in 1994. Mr Martin Jay, the company's managing director, said yesterday that the new deal would improve steel shipbuilding manufacture. 'Our order books are at a record high,' he said. 'There has been a 50 per cent improvement in productivity in steel shipbuilding over the past six years. The new deal will give us even greater flexibility than we already have.' The Vosper Thorneycroft workforce voted 58 per cent in favour of the pay agreement, with 42 per cent against.</p>

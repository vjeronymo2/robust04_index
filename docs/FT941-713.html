			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Technology: Thrills on the modern stage - A look at developments in special effects Theatre has come a long way since someone flicked a light switch on and off to create the impression of lightning. Audiences these days want to be thrilled by special effects, and at times these can become the star of the show. Everyone who saw the Phantom of the Opera remembers the falling chandelier, and those who saw Miss Saigon remember the helicopter. On the modern stage, characters appear from nowhere, and vanish suddenly. Boats sail on-stage, war scenes are lit by sparks and flames, and fog envelopes the scenery. 'We have to compete with other forms of entertainment like films, television and amusement parks,' says Steven Terry, executive vice-president of the New York special effects group Production Arts Lighting. 'You can do almost anything on film these days, and audiences are demanding more and more excitement. Since theatre tickets often cost Dollars 60 (Pounds 40) a head, you have to provide something special if you want to stay in the game.' Computerisation of lighting and scenery has provided much of the impetus for greater use of special effects. Dozens of stage hands were once needed to shift scenery and operate lights. With the help of a computer, one person can easily control up to 1,000 fixed lights - not uncommon in big productions - plus a series of moving lights. The same computer can also control complex scenery movements: a trap door opens here, a car swings on to the stage there. It usually does this by sending signals to robot-like machines which shift the stage pieces around, or automatically activate switches. 'The new sophistication comes largely from the extent to which special effects are used,' says John Paull, technical production manager for the Phantom of the Opera in New York. Complex scenery shifts such as the intricate use of screens in Miss Saigon, Paull explains, would be impossible without computer automation. 'With humans operating scenery movements, the pieces are more likely to crash into each other or happen at the wrong time. Now we use a closed-loop system with constant feedback through the computer. Everything is pre-programmed so that errors are very rare. The computer knows where everything is.' The new dependence on computers is also driven by the high cost of labour in the heavily unionised theatre industry. 'The old rule was one man, one set of lights,' says Terry. 'Now, one man can operate thousands of switches, and that makes it all a lot cheaper.' Other advances are contributing to the special effects craze. Stage managers have been making much use, for instance, of a new way of producing theatrical fog. Glycol-based fog, produced by vaporising and cooling mineral oil, has largely replaced dry ice, which is just as effective but more expensive. New machines chill a mineral oil and water mixture, and the cold temperature causes the resulting smoke to lie low on the stage. The new machines have become so popular, it is the rare Broadway production that does not have at least one fog scene. Some actors have complained about the effects of glycol fog on their health. 'We are very concerned about complaints about everything from respiratory problems to headaches because of the new fog,' says Helaine Feldman, of the Actors' Equity Association, the actors' union of New York. It is conducting a survey of the health effects of glycol and may press managers to cut down on its use. Laser lights have so far mostly been confined to rock shows, but some designers see lasers as a way of producing fresh-looking lighting effects, and believe their use may increase. 'Lasers used as an alternative type of light source can enhance certain effects,' says Gregory Meeh, president of US special effects company Jauchem &amp; Meeh. Scenery movements have also been aided by greater use of infra-red remote controls. 'We used to use radio frequencies, but those can go through walls,' explains Paull, who used infra-red to control a boat in Phantom of the Opera. 'We had some problems with interference. It kind of takes away from the production if the scenery starts heading into the audience.' Pyrotechnics - the explosion of fire crackers and fireworks or the use of flames on the stage - produce a dramatic effect, but still depend mainly on traditional methods. One innovation, though, is a mushroom spore called lacapodium, which when aerated and combined with an electric spark, resembles a flame. For many designers, the technology of the future is projection. 'I think we'll see more integration of film with live characters,' predicts Jeremiah Harris, production supervisor and president of Harris Production services. Film projectors are now capable of packing in large numbers of frames per second. Many are able to handle 72 frames per second, a speed which can accommodate a very bright light source behind the image. With a stronger image, designers can use projection to create life-like scenic backdrops. 'You can get much bigger visual images this way,' says Harris. A wooded scene, for instance, could be played against a backdrop film of a forest, with flying birds and swinging branches. Some people in the industry worry that the spectacle detracts from the traditional enjoyment of the actors' craft. In the worst case, they argue, special effects may serve as a substitute for good writing and acting. However, Paull says that special effects cannot turn weak drama into success. 'The best combination is strong theatre with strong special effects. You need to have something more than scenery movements and lights to draw people in night after night.'</p>

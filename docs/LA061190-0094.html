			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> REFUSE REUSE CATCHES FANCY OF LARGE HOTEL  </P> <P> About six months ago, a worker at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotel realized  that recycling trash made sense economically as well as environmentally.  </P> <P> He sold the idea to his bosses, and now one of the largest hotels in Orange  County is recycling thousands of tons of trash in one of the most extensive  programs of its kind.  </P> <P> "We didn't do it because we wanted to save the planet Earth -- we're all aware  of that, and we'd like to think that we're helping," said Michael Brancazio,  purchasing director for the hotel and organizer of the program. "On the other  hand, there's a monetary benefit for the hotel,"  </P> <P> When hotel maids go in guest rooms to make the beds, they also dig through the  trash containers and collect aluminum cans.  </P> <P> Bartenders in the hotel lounges retrieve customers' beer and soda bottles. And  Sunday brunch servers break up the cardboard boxes that once held hundreds of  bottles of champagne so they can be recycled.  </P> <P> In all, the company expects to recycle 400 tons of refuse annually through the  recycling program. The effort will save the company about $30,000 a year by  cutting down the size of garbage collection and selling the recyclables to the  disposal company. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

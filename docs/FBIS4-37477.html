			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algeria: Tripartite Committee To </F> Topple Sifi's Government"]    [Text] Algeria -- Reliable Algerian sources have told  AL-HAYAH that the group of Boubakr Belkaid (former interior  minister), Selim Saadi (former interior minister), and General  Mohamed Touati (adviser to the defense minister and member of  the Dialogue Committee) has been making intensive contacts for  weeks with the Algerian opposition parties, and circles of  political movements and societies in Tunisia, Morocco, and  France to undermine Mokdad Sifi's government, accusing it of  "political impotence against the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS],  economic failure against a background of deteriorating social  conditions, and failure to take a firm stand against terrorism."    That group, the sources said, offers itself as an  alternative  "to the current political line and is preparing to topple the  present government." They quoted people close to Sifi's  government as saying that "behind that move, there are judicial  files against Selim Saadi who formed a number of companies in  Tunisia in the names of his relatives when he was agriculture  minister and then interior minister, as well as large files  against Boubakr Belkaid and one of his in-laws since Boukaid was  construction minister, then higher education minister, then  information minister, and finally interior minister." They  added that it is not unlikely that "the political activities of  the trio opposed to dialogue and reconciliation with the  Islamists are just a reaction to protect their political and  financial interests."    The sources believe that these figures "are trying to use  the  card of [the anniversary of] the late President Mohamed Boudiaf  (former chairman of the Higher State Council) to support Saeed  Saadi, leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, in a move  to stage a procession on 29 June despite Saadi's denial that he  was exploiting Boudiaf's assassination anniversary to stage the  procession."    Media sources in Algeria say that Selim Saadi, interior  minister under Redha Malek, "had seen himself as the successor  to Ali Kafi (Higher State Council chairman) because of the  support he was and still is getting from his ally Gen. Mohamed  Touati and his group. That was clearly evident in the meetings  Saadi held with local officials in Algerian provinces. It was  noticed then that he was speaking not in his capacity as  interior minister but rather more like a head of state, a matter  which created extreme sensitivity between him and Ali Kafi and  then between him and the current President Liamine Zeroual who  dismissed Redha Malek's government because of the attitude of  Saadi who exceeded his limits to the point of speaking on behalf  of the military establishment."    While the "trio" is planning to topple the government, the  latter is proceeding with its plan to define its policies, solve  new problems such as those related to the official certificate  examinations, and introduce central administrative changes at  Algiers University and some institutes.</p>

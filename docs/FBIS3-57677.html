Speaking at a press conference in  Bishkek on Thursday [27 January], the president emphasized that  the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the  visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin planned for  February "would assist with settlement of the issues concerning  support of Kyrgyz industrial enterprises which directly depend  on economic relations with Russia." "If we break these  relations, there is a risk for the Kyrgyz to go back to their  traditional nomadic life of cattle breeders," the president  pointed out.    For the time being, it is impossible to resolve the current  economic issues, like supplies of equipment and fuel material  and lubricants, without the assistance provided by Russia. This  also threatens the future of agriculture.    In connection with this, the president emphasized that  double  citizenship would conform with the interests in preserving the  economic potential of Kyrgyzstan, since this would help to  maintain the working potential of plants where most workers were  Russians. He refuted the assertion that this might lead to  destabilization of inter-ethnic relations.    Commenting on the changes in the Russian Government, the  Kyrgyz president said that the situation should not be  exaggerated. "The reforms in Russia will continue since now they  are irreversible," Akayev pointed out. In his opinion,  Chernomyrdin was the man who could carry out the policy of  economic reforms in Russia.</p>

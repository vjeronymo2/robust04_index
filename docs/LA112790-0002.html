			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD ABUSE CASES INCREASE  </P> <P> In response to two Times articles, "Report on Child Abuse Finds Agencies  Deluged" and "County Delays Cutting Mental Health Funding Amid Pleas for  Services" (Nov. 14):  </P> <P> Mental health funds should not be reduced! Los Angeles County must see the  correlation between mental illness, the abuser and the effect on the abused.  Yes, children addicted to drugs or alcohol do need protection and therapy.  </P> <P> Yes, government agencies should communicate with one another about individual  cases. We need the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health to serve  children, families and adults.  </P> <P> I urge Pete Wilson to find the funds to support the Los Angeles County  Department of Mental Health and urge the public to call their county  supervisors to register their concerns. The abused frequently becomes the  abuser in the next generation. Help stop the cycle! Help save our children and  the future adults of Los Angeles County!  </P> <P> MARK BODENSTEIN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Financials firm Financial stocks in both the banks and insurance sectors underpinned the rise in the market yesterday. In banks, whose reporting season kicks off later this month, it was a bullish joint note from Robert Fleming and Dun &amp; Bradstreet that fuelled the rise in Barclays. Both brokers pointed out that the bank had the biggest exposure to the UK property sector and it was a likely beneficiary from its expected recovery. The shares gained 11 to 483p, in thin trade of 2.1m. Speculation that Lloyds was about to off-load its 4.68 per cent stake in Standard Chartered helped the former harden 10 to 580p, and the latter to relinquish 5 to 778p. Renewed talk that TSB had at last found a buyer for Hill Samuel, its merchant banking arm, helped it gain 2 to 195p. In insurance stocks, most of the day's main action centred around the composite insurers. The biggest rise was in General Accident where the shares jumped 19 to 623p, after two leading brokers visited the group's US operations, coming away with a very positive picture. The appointment of Mr John Carter as the new chief executive of Commercial Union cheered the market and the shares advanced 14 to 615p, with a slight squeeze having played a part in the rise. Also firm was Royal Insurance Holdings where the shares closed 5 better at 315p, while Sun Alliance put on 6 to 357p.</p>

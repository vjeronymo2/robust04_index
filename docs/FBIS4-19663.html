			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna-Leena Pyykkonen: "Ahtisaari's Advisor, Alpo </F> Rusi: President Wants To Listen to Nation's Pulse"]    [Text] New winds are blowing in the president's  administration. Alpo Rusi, Martti Ahtisaari's foreign policy  advisor and a member of his cabinet, told us about them. He held  forth at an Association of Political Editors lunch conference on  Wednesday [30 March].    Rusi said that a direct referendum will also force us to  look  for new ways of taking action. One of these is the president's  direct contact with citizens. "The president wants to listen to  the pulse of the nation. He can also instill courage in citizens  in this tight spot we are in," Rusi said.    According to Rusi, Ahtisaari's first meeting with citizens  in  central Finland was a pleasant experience. The president wants  to be in contact with citizens in the future "without waiting  lines."    Rusi was pressed for an answer to the question as to whether  the wielding of power or even competition with the government in  the area of domestic policy will also be associated with [the  president's] rounds in the provinces.    Rusi assured us that behind these visits there was at least  no deliberate effort to wield power or consciously impose a  political viewpoint.    "Direct dialogue with citizens has been lacking from Nordic  democracy," Rusi said. He also alluded to our possible  membership in the EU, and noted that, as the supranational  exercise of power increases, one's own democracy must be in good  working order.    Rusi said the president also wants to be "more  communicative"  and he is accustomed to "rapid communication."  <H5>  "Spokesman," a New Practice </H5>   The number of the presidential advisors has been increased  by  four. The advisors from the cabinet, in which Rusi is on loan  from the Foreign Ministry, constitute the most important ones.  He most recently served in the ministry as a foreign policy  advisor. Before that, he served as chief editor and researcher  on the Centrist paper LALLI, among other posts.    Rusi takes care of the president's relations with the  international press and reports on events occurring in  connection with visits. He may also issue statements, that is,  he may act as a sort of "spokesman." This practice is new in  Finland.    Rusi was asked how the cabinet has been preparing for the  visit of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of Russia's Liberal  Democratic Party, to Finland.    Rusi said that they are closely following Zhirinovskiy's  behavior. "We will certainly hold onto our own authority," he  went on.    Zhirinovskiy is coming to Finland this Easter with Russia's  Council of Europe delegation.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the Oliver L. North case advised the court as soon as they found  out one of their office secretaries was related to the jury foreman, James  Wieghart, speaking for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, said. Wieghart  said the matter was brought to the attention of the U.S. District Court in  Washington and North's attorneys "when we learned of the relationship from the  secretary" at the end of North's trial. Denise Anderson, the jury foreman, said  in an interview in People magazine that she bumped into her cousin Gertrude  Griffin, but did not discuss the case with her and did not report the meeting  or the relationship to the court. The jury convicted North, a former National  Security Council aide, on three felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair.  </P></p>

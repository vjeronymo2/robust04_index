			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Improvement at American Brands AMERICAN Brands, the tobacco and consumer products conglomerate, yesterday reported an 8.7 per cent increase in second-quarter profits, at Dollars 202.6m after tax, writes Nikki Tait. Total revenues rose by 10.5 per cent, to Dollars 3.25bn, and net profits for the first six months of the year were up by 11.3 per cent at Dollars 447.8m. Yesterday, the company's chairman, Mr William Alley conceded the economic environment had been tough, and price competition had intensified 'in almost every market'. Operating profit from tobacco, the largest single division, increased by 7.2 per cent in the second quarter, to Dollars 231.2m, while life insurance profits were up by 15.9 per cent, at Dollars 42.9m. The drinks side saw the largest profits improvement, up 35.3 per cent at Dollars 44.5m, but this partly reflects the acquisition of seven spirit brands from Canada's Seagram at the end of 1991.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Loss at Clyde Blowers widens to Pounds 0.5m Clyde Blowers, the maker of equipment for boiler cleaning and materials handling, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 514,313 in its seasonally unfavourable half year to the end of February, compared with a deficit of Pounds 17,632 last time. The result was in line with forecasts made in April. Turnover nearly trebled, from Pounds 2.27m to Pounds 6.14m. Clyde has been transformed since Mr James McColl bought a 29.9 per cent stake in 1992 and became executive chairman. In 1993 the company bought Sturtevant Engineering, a Brighton-based maker of pneumatic conveyancing equipment, and Boiler Products Engineering, a boiler cleaning concern based in Belgium. In April this year it bought Simon-Macawber, a maker of pneumatic pressure and vacuum conveyancing equipment, from Simon Engineering for between Pounds 4m and Pounds 4.5m, funded by a Pounds 5.2m rights issue. Mr McColl said the loss reflected the continued restructuring of the core company and its acquisitions, and to the fact that the first half is traditionally slow because of weak orders for spare parts in the winter. He expected a profit for the full year; profits for the 12 months to end-August 1993 amounted to Pounds 205,000. 'We have now got to the critical size we want to be, with annualised turnover of about Pounds 27m, with the Simon-Macawber purchase adding Pounds 14m annual sales,' said Mr McColl. 'We're going to concentrate on organic growth rather than acquisitions for the next year to 18 months.' The company is negotiating to sell part of its site at Clydebank for conversion to a discount food store. The development potential of the rest of the site is being examined and the company may move to a better facility. Losses per share widened to 9.79p (0.53p) but the interim dividend goes up to 1.5p (1.33p).</p>

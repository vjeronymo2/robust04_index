			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Severn Trent to pay Pounds 33m for East Worcester Water SEVERN TRENT, the Midlands water and sewerage group, is buying East Worcester Water, a small supplier, for Pounds 33.1m. East Worcester is the latest in a string of acquisitions this year by the 'big 10' water and sewerage companies privatised in 1989, but the first of the 22 small water companies to be purchased by one of the 10. The deal has been cleared by Ofwat, the water industry regulator, after assurances that a high proportion of the prospective savings would be passed on directly to customers. Ofwat said it expected to see East Worcester's former customers gain an average of Pounds 18 each over the next two years as their prices come into line with those of Severn Trent. Mr John Bellak, Severn Trent chairman, said the arrangement had 'strong commercial logic. The activities of East Worcester are well known to Severn Trent and the two companies have a long history of working together'. East Worcester's 100,000 customers, all south of Birmingham, are among the 3.3m receiving sewerage services from Severn Trent. East Worcester is owned by Biwater, the water engineering group which also owns Bournemouth and West Hampshire Water companies. Its 1992 results, released earlier this week, showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.88m on a turnover of Pounds 13.7m. Mr Alan Booker, Ofwat's deputy director general, said Severn Trent's customers would benefit from greater security of supply and East Worcester's from lower prices. He cited the 1990 Three Valleys merger, cleared by the government after a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as a precedent. The 'big 10' are the sole providers of sewerage services, and supply water to more than three quarters of households in England and Wales. Of the 22 small suppliers, almost half have been acquired in recent years by three French companies - Compagnie General des Eaux, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez and SAUR. Eight have shares listed on the Stock Exchange. Mr Bill Dale, water industry analyst at Warburg Securities, said Severn Trent's move was unlikely to lead to a rush of bids by the 'big 10' for the smaller companies. 'Looking around the regions, there are not any other immediate candidates.' In December Severn Trent reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 141m, with an interim dividend of 7p out of earnings of 37.5p a share. It was criticised by Ofwat for 'erring too much in favour of shareholders and too little on the side of the customer.' In response, Mr Bellak pointed to Pounds 585m of investment in the previous financial year and an understanding that dividend growth was 'above inflation.' Severn Trent is the seventh of the 'big 10' to make a sizeable acquisition this year. Earlier this week Welsh Water paid Pounds 56m for Acer, the engineering consultant group. See Lex</p>

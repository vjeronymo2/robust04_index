			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Kynoch down 67% and shares fall sharply Kynoch Group, the specialist healthcare company which underwent a capital reconstruction at the beginning of the year, yesterday reported a 67 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126,000 for the first half of 1993. The company also warned that with the expected improvement in orders in the second half not materialising, full year figures were likely to be well below the previous year's Pounds 958,000. The shares reacted via a 9p fall to 38p. Mr John Salkeld, chairman, said results were hit by lower turnover in the steriliser and disinfector business, together with higher overhead costs. The fall in steriliser sales resulted largely from budget restraints in the National Health Service. Remedial action was however, being taken. Half-year turnover increased to Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 6.99m), but earnings per share fell from 1.6p to 0.3p.</p>

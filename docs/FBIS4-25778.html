			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Delegates from 75  countries, including China, met here on Tuesday [14 June] to  discuss a draft nuclear safety convention on new safety  standards for nuclear power plants.    The three-day international conference, organized by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will vote on the  draft convention which will require its signatories to close  down unsafe nuclear power plants.    The agreement will be formally signed at an IAEA conference  scheduled for this September if it is approved at the meeting.    According to the convention, signatories will be responsible  for choice of location, planning, building, operation,  distribution of personnel and capital, and safety assessments of  their nuclear power stations.    Under the convention, signatories are also obliged to report  on the implementation of the agreement at regular iaea meetings.    More than 420 nuclear power plants are now operating in some  30 countries worldwide.</p>

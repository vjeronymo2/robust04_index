			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["alm, go"-signed report: "Thrash It Out Some More, Klaus </F> Said Referring to his Alleged Arrogance Toward Castle"]    [Text] Prague -- "Thrash it out some more," Klaus  responded on Wednesday [18 May] to the observation made by RUDE  PRAVO that the tense relations between the president and the  prime minister are being thrashed out, and that the statement  "No comment," so popular with both of them, results in even more  speculation.    Klaus was already refusing to comment on the claim that he  behaves arrogantly towards President Havel on Tuesday [17 May].  Targeting Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social Democratic  Party, who had made this claim, the prime minister said in the  Czech Radio Radizurnal program, among other things: "Regarding  famous and world renowned arrogance, he should consider himself  and let others live their own lives." Zeman said at the Czech  Social Democratic Party conference on 13 May: "We have a  certain empathy with the lonely man in Prague Castle, who is now  and then bombarded with arrogant telephone calls from the Czech  prime minister." Free Democrats (Civic Movement) Chairman Jiri  Dienstbier replied to the RUDE PRAVO question concerning  Friday's conference: "There are political forces here that are  attempting to keep the president in the Castle as isolated as  possible."</p>

Of course, peripherals such  as digitizer tablets and plotters are also suffering. However,  even though users are experiencing an economic downturn, they're  not giving up on R&amp;D. Rather, there is a trend because of the  recession to put energy into developing new products that will  distinguish themselves. Since CAD is essential to development  departments, it has been hurt by recession, but not as much as  machine tools, robots, and other production equipment.    According to industry estimates, the CAD systems market was  &yen;600 billion in 1992. Given that the price of hardware has  also fallen, the market is expected to fall significantly to  &yen;400 billion in 1993. There isn't the kind of new demand  there would be in a good economy. Revenues can be raised mainly  by replacing other companies' equipment or by providing support.    CAE hasn't been hurt as much as CAD/CAM. Although until now  CAE has been viewed as a tool used by specialists such as  analysts, recently it's begun to be used by individual  engineers. There appears to be considerable hidden demand for  CAE. However, there are some cases in which negotiations have  been held up by contract extensions and freezes.    The market for plotters (CAD drawing output devices) is  about  one-tenth that for CAD systems or about &yen;60 billion to  &yen;80 billion. Demand from recession-ridden Europe has fallen  dramatically and price decreases have lowered average prices, so  the plotter market has shrunk by about 25% from the previous  year and is in much worse shape than anticipated. Inkjet  plotters, the only plotters encountering favorable conditions,  sparked the price cuts. Manufacturers of pen plotters and  thermal plotters introduced low-cost machines and cut prices in  response to inkjet plotters. Fierce price competition has  resulted. However, sales of low-cost machines are so-so compared  to those of high-speed, high precision high-class machines.    Rapid prototyping systems, which can be considered as a kind  of three-dimensional plotter, have also suffered from soft  demand. But, growth is expected in this field because MITI has  decided to support the rapid prototyping industry. 1993 sales  are expected to go no higher than about fifteen systems, but  about 40 sales are expected in 1994. The keys to increased  demand will be the establishment of an industry organization and  the resolution of technical and price issues.    The market for digitizer tablets (input devices) is less  than  that for plotters since they're aimed at designers who are  oriented toward inputting using mice or keyboards. The market is  &yen;10 billion, including exports. Those for the small computer  graphics market are doing well, but, in general, digitizer  tablets are doing worse than plotters. There's a trend for the  rate of tablet attachment to CAD systems to decline. Some  manufacturers have been directing their efforts toward pen input  computers which can input almost like using a pencil to draw  letters or a diagram.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OPERA TEACHER WHO PLANNED NEW TROUPE DIES  </P> <P> Michael Kurkjian, a former Cal State Fullerton music professor who had  ambitious plans to start a new Orange County opera company, was found dead  Monday in his Laguna Beach home. He was 56.  </P> <P> The cause of Kurkjian's death was unknown after an autopsy and is under routine  investigation, the Orange County coroner's office said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "At this time we do not believe foul play was involved," Police Sgt. Robert  Rahaeuser said.  </P> <P> Kurkjian, who had been a member of Cal State Fullerton's staff since 1972, was  director of its opera workshop from 1976 until he announced his early  retirement this spring after problems with the administration of the  university's school of the arts. He was formerly artistic director of the Lyric  Opera of Orange County, the Laguna Beach-based troupe that eventually became  Opera Pacific.  </P> <P> Kurkjian's problems at the university stemmed from troublesome personal  relationships, according to Benton L. Minor, music department chairman.  </P> <P> "Michael was a very intense, talented individual, musically," Minor said  Tuesday. But "he had a lot of highs and a lot of lows, from an emotional  standpoint. . . . The fact that he reacted to crises strongly, in his personal  life with his friends, caused some difficulties with his assignment here."  </P> <P> Additionally, during his last two semesters, Kurkjian was away on sick leave at  least half of that time, said Minor, who declined to elaborate on the nature of  Kurkjian's absenteeism.  </P> <P> Burton Karson, CSUF professor of music and artistic director of the annual  Corona del Mar Baroque Festival, said, "He often had problems with the  (university) administration and with his personal relationships with colleagues  and students, but he was a splendid musician, and he was able to give musical  ideas and techniques of great value to his students."  </P> <P> Kurkjian, considered an important force behind the local opera scene, recently  announced plans to launch a new Orange County opera company. The Laguna Opera  Theatre was reportedly planned as a small, professional repertory troupe geared  for young singers breaking into the field.  </P> <P> Lloyd Rodgers, a composer and Cal State Fullerton music professor who was to  have been the company's artistic associate, said Tuesday that the project will  probably not proceed.  </P> <P> "Tentative plans had been made for three little mini-seasons next year at the  Forum Theatre," a 230-seat venue in Laguna Beach, Rodgers said.  </P> <P> But the company existed "mostly in Michael's head and on paper and needed  another couple of months of organization and planning to get it to the point  where it could continue without him," Rodgers said. "With his death, I'm sure  it will probably not continue."  </P> <P> Kurkjian received a bachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis  in 1952 and a master's degree in piano at the University of Illinois, Urbana.  </P> <P> Aspiring initially to be a concert pianist, he was a soloist with orchestras in  the Midwest but switched his focus to voice after developing arthritis in his  hands, according to Minor.  </P> <P> Information on funeral arrangements was not available Tuesday.  </P> <P> Freelance writer Robert Pierre contributed to this report.  </P></p>

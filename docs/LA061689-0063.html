"We are very much concerned about the  safety and freedom of innocent people who have done nothing wrong but only  organized peaceful demonstrations or spoken against the Chinese government  based on truth and out of their own conscience," said an open letter from the  association. The letter said, "It is apparent that some of the arrested have  been sentenced to death." Three activists were given the death penalty by  Chinese officials for setting a train on fire in Shanghai.  </P></p>

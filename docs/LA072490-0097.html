			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PASSES CHILDREN'S TV BILL TO SET LIMITS ON ADS  </P> <P> A bill aimed at limiting commercial aspects of children's television moved a  step closer to President Bush's desk Monday when it was unanimously approved by  the House of Representatives.  </P> <P> Swift action by the House had been expected following last Thursday's approval  in the Senate of a nearly identical children's TV package.  </P> <P> Like the Senate bill, the House measure would re-establish advertising time  limits in children's programming, on both broadcast stations and on cable  channels. Commercials would be limited to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and  10 1/2 minutes on weekends -- standards already being met by most broadcasters  and cable operators.  </P> <P> The House bill also requires broadcasters to show how they have met the  "educational and informational needs" of children in their overall programming  when seeking license renewal from the Federal Communications Commission. During  the deregulation-oriented 1980s, license renewal had become a routine matter of  mailing in a postcard.  </P> <P> The final provision of the House bill instructs the FCC to conclude a  court-ordered inquiry into toy-based children's programs, which proliferated in  the years following deregulation in 1984. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),  sponsor of the bill, said that Monday's passage "will provide broadcasters and  children's program producers with the necessary incentives to educate our  nation's children creatively rather than to exploit them economically."  </P> <P> The House bill differed from the Senate measure in one significant way: It does  not include a mandate establishing a National Endowment for Children's  Television, which would administer grants to produce children's programs.  </P> <P> That difference between the two measures means that the House measure now  returns to the Senate before going to a conference committee, which will work  out the final proposal to be sent to President Bush.KARI GRANVILLE  </P></p>

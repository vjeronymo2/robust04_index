			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second and last installment of an unattributed commentary: </F> "In the Margin of the President's Remarks"]    [Text] One of the interesting points in the remarks the  president made at the gathering of students of Martyr Beheshti  University and in his remarks when presenting the bill on the  Second Five-Year Plan as well as the bill on the budget to the  Majles was his reference to the fact that oil and oil prices  will not have a major impact on the country's economy and  reconstruction. The president told the students: "Even if oil  prices fall to $10 a barrel, we will not face a problem."    In his remarks to the Majles when presenting the budget  bill,  he said: "Oil is one of the country's major sources of income  and recently income from this important resource has dropped 20  to 30 percent and has affected our Plan. This made us review  and readjust our Plan and our budget. This was a very difficult  task; hence, the two-week delay in presenting the budget."    The basic problem is that the main slogan of our economy  after the Islamic revolution has been the need to try to  decrease the role of oil in our country's economy; and one of  the major objectives stated in the First Plan was the need to  alter the country's economic infrastructure and to gradually  decrease the role of oil. If today we compare our budget with  our budget four years ago, we will not see a perceptible change  in the true dependence on oil incomes, and this point was  extremely clear in the president's remarks as well. Now we  should try to see why--despite extensive plans that have been  implemented and the extensive investments that have been  made--our dependence on oil incomes has not perceptibly changed.    In part of his remarks to Martyr Beheshti University  students, the president stated that the drop in the exchange  rate is due to the psychological atmosphere that has been  created and that the drop in oil prices is a plot by world  arrogance. The issue is that if we have really reached a stage  where even the drop in oil prices to $10 a barrel is not a  problem for us, then why--during the past one month--has there  been a 100 percent rise in the exchange rate of the dollar? If  between 20 to 30 percent of this stems from the psychological  atmosphere and because of middlemen, then the remaining 50 to 60  percent definitely stems from the drop in oil prices that form a  large part of our country's foreign exchange income. Or if we  glance at the figures in next year's budget, we can see that  more than 50 percent of our country's incomes will be from the  sale of oil.    Under these conditions, can the sudden drop in the price of  oil to almost half--a resource that represents 50 percent of our  income--not create acute problems for us? It is true that  within the framework of our macroeconomic plans, a large part of  foreign exchange allocations for basic and industrial products  has dropped but because of uncalculated economic and commercial  policies, this foreign exchange economizing has not  materialized. On the contrary, an unrestrained quantity of  foreign exchange has been spent for the import of consumer and  luxury goods. In these four years, because of the  implementation of positive economic projects such as the  petrochemical, aluminum, steel, and other industries, we have  been able to save on between $1-$2 billion in foreign exchange  each year--which is an extremely optimistic figure--but we have  spent billions of dollars to import luxury items such as color  television sets, household goods, cars, Coca Cola, chocolate,  clothing, and other unnecessary items. If we accept the  above-mentioned facts, then we will see that these unrestrained  imports have wasted all our savings or our foreign exchange  incomes from our exports of industrial and non-industrial goods.  This is why oil and income from it during the past four years  have continued to play a key role in current expenditures and in  economic and development plans. And it is because of this that  the fluctuations in the dollar and foreign exchange rates have  been between 100 to 120 percent. This fluctuation and drop is  because of the weakness of our national currency, and the  weakness of our national currency is because of the fact that  our true gross national product is low. If economizing in  foreign exchange and in foreign exchange incomes coupled with  economic projects could have led to economic investments, the  gross national product could have increased and a rise in the  gross national product could have paved the way for a brighter  future and the repayment of our foreign debts. And if correct  plans had been drawn up, we would not have faced acute problems  that we are facing today in meeting our foreign exchange  commitments. Saying that such debts should not have existed in  the First Plan is unprincipled. But the fact these debts have  reached the level they have during the past four years is  because of our failure to create a balance between incomes and  expenditures and the implementation of economic plans.    Stating these points is in no way a criticism and should be  considered only to be within the framework of our interests  because basically, the ability to see realities and to create a  correct basis for plans and programs can help the government  achieve the objectives that it has laid out.</p>

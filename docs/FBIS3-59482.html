			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 21 December issue of the Zagreb  weekly DANAS in Serbo-Croatian on page 4, commenting on the  recent murder of 12 Croats in Algeria by Muslim fundamentalists,  states that the murder directed world attention to Algeria as a  new focus of international terrorism. DANAS notes that the  murder of Croats in Algeria is closely linked to the war in  Bosnia, adding that the Croats were murdered "because the  Islamic integrationists have been expanding all over the world,  and, it seems, have linked the Croats, just as the Serbs, to the  suffering and slaughter of brother Muslims in Bosnia." DANAS  claims that Bosnian Presidency Vice President Ejup Ganic, "the  greatest integrationist and Croat-hater among the Bosnian Muslim  leaders," had recently visited Algeria and, earlier, Libya,  adding that it is known that a large number of Algerian  mojahedin have been fighting on the side of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The West will perhaps now understand the  danger of creating an Islamic state in Bosnia, in which radical  and extremists leaders would prevail," DANAS concludes.</p>

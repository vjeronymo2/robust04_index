			<p>BFN     [Text] Wroclaw, 8 Apr--New parliamentary elections are a  foregone conclusion and will be held within a year. Any excuse  suffices for the president to dissolve the present parliament,  the leader of the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN],  Leszek Moczulski, maintained in an interview with a SLOWO  POLSKIE journalist on 8 April. According to him, the "KPN  parliamentary floor group as well as several other political  groupings in the Sejm are capable of providing the president  with such an excuse when the time is right for them." Moczulski  is also of the opinion that a breakup of the governing coalition  is unavoidable. Should it happen, it will be difficult to  establish a majority in the present Sejm.    The KPN leader warns that Poland is facing events similar to  those of 1980. According to him, none of the problems put  forward "so forcefully" then have ever been resolved. "If  society realizes now that the confidence placed in all corners  of the political scene, apart from the Confederation, has been  ill-placed and that it has been let down, we are going to have  events similar to those in August [1980]," Moczulski maintains.</p>

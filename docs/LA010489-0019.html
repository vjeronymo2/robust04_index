			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAJA GOVERNOR QUITS JOB EARLY  </P> <P> The governor of Baja California said Tuesday that he will step down early to  take a position with a federal banking agency negotiating to reduce Mexico's  foreign debt.  </P> <P> The surprise announcement by Xicontencatl Leyva Mortera at a press conference  in Mexicali, the state capital, fueled speculation that he is being forced out  by Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Leyva's term was to  extend to the end of October, 1989.  </P> <P> Some Baja commentators have suggested that political leaders in Mexico City are  unhappy with Leyva, whose five-year administration has been marked by several  prominent scandals and political defeats. In July, 1988, Salinas was defeated  in Baja by leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Poorest LDCs face decline, says Unctad PER capita incomes in the very poorest developing countries have fallen for the past three years and fragile economic reform programmes are threatened by recession and inadequate international support, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said yesterday. In its latest annual report* on the 47 least developed countries, as defined by the UN, Unctad projects a 1.4 per cent increase in total LDC output this year, after no growth in 1991 and a slight decline in 1990, but expects per capita incomes to show a new decline. The recent economic performance of LDCs, which have a total population of 500m, compares with growth averaging 2.5 per cent a year between 1985 and 1989. LDCs have also lagged behind developing countries as a whole, whose output rose by over 3 per cent in 1991. The Unctad report highlights big divergences in performance between LDCs. In many countries afflicted by civil war and natural disasters, such as Somalia, Afghanistan, Liberia, Mozambique and Ethiopia, 'the development process has come to a virtual standstill'. Elsewhere, some more politically stable countries have achieved respectable growth rates and raised per capita incomes, including Botswana, Lesotho, the Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh and Uganda. But Unctad, main UN forum for debate of north-south issues, says external factors have also been responsible for the LDCs' problems. The recession has limited trade, falling commodity prices have cut revenues, and private remittances from abroad, a big source of foreign exchange for some LDCs, have declined due to foreign-labour cuts in industrialised and developing countries. Rich countries, it adds, have failed to fulfil pledges made in the UN action programme for LDCs agreed in 1990, including increased aid flows, action to tackle LDC indebtedness (most of which is owed to governments) and measures to improve LDC access to industrial markets. The report notes fears that eastern Europe's financing needs may further reduce the resource pool for LDC development. Failure by the west to support painful reforms in LDCs risks halting or reversing the process, with far-reaching consequences including 'social and economic collapse, ecological damage, food insecurity, and huge population displacement.' *The Least Developed Countries: 1992 report, UN Sales No. E93.11.

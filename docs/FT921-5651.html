			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: HK at record high after difficult period HONG KONG came back to lead the world last week, after a period of edginess and some profit-taking in mid-February. Its best day was last Thursday when the Hang Seng index rose by 2.1 per cent, but on Friday it closed higher again to leave the index at yet another record high. Thursday's gain came on better-than-expected results for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's Australian subsidiary and the failure of the US Senate to pass, by a two-third majority, a law seeking to apply conditions to China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. But brokers and analysts say that a more relaxed attitude to the US dollar by international investors has been important for the market. Because Hong Kong dollars are freely convertible for US dollars at a fixed rate, the local market offers investors access to what are effectively US assets. Domestic brokers say that buying interest was broadly based on Thursday. Local, mainland Chinese, European and US investors were all in the market. Particularly aggressive were mainland Chinese investors who have not been seen to be active for a long time. In London, Mr David Bates of Asia Equity has seen a strong trend of US institutional buying last week, indicating a large switch of US money into Hong Kong. The 'atmospherics' surrounding the Hong Kong market appear to many in the market to be propitious. The southern Chinese economy is growing rapidly and that is to the benefit of a lot of Hong Kong companies which have investments there. On a more fundamental basis, analysts are expecting earnings growth for Hong Kong companies of between 16 and 18 per cent this year. To many the market still appears to be undervalued. The Asia Pacific region also took in the worst performer in the FT-Actuaries World Index series last week, namely Singapore. Mr Bates says that there has been a switch from Singapore to Malaysia and Hong Kong over a period; meanwhile, last week saw a budget categorised as a non-event. 'Corporation tax was cut by a percentage point,' he adds, 'but people thought that the package would be a lot more generous.' The major equity markets made a restrained, but positive showing last week and the World Index reflects this with a rise of 0.6 per cent, Europe leading other regions with a 1.1 per cent increase. Spain came out top in Europe following record midweek highs on Wall Street, and the cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate by 25 basis points. Mr Stephen Hughes at Nikko Europe in London, says that Madrid's most recent rally has been based mainly on the strong performance of a limited number of blue chips. He notes that the banking sector has underperformed significantly, and that a short-term consolidation will be necessary before the market pushes on again.

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Paramount's Books to Be Examined: Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider said he  expects to appoint a "special master" to examine Paramount Pictures' books  before the court sets damages in Art Buchwald's suit over the film "Coming to  America."  </P> <P> Attorneys for both sides said they would accept Franklin Johnson, an  entertainment expert with the Price Waterhouse accounting firm, as the court's  independent expert. Schneider asked the attorneys to schedule a hearing with  Johnson in coming weeks to agree on a "game plan" for the examination.  Schneider has already ruled that the film, starring Eddie Murphy, was based on  a story by Buchwald, despite Paramount's claims.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 173(c)(1), which was added in the 1990 amendments, specifies conditions on the location of emission reductions that may qualify as offsets. EPA intends to continue to require the net air quality benefit test consistent with prior practice, so that it can be assured that the area affected by the source progresses toward attainment on balance. It need not be interpreted as requiring an air quality improvement at every location affected by the new source (44 FR 3279, (January 16, 1979)), but rather assuring progress toward attainment for the area where the new source is locating. Also, as explained in the Offset Rule, the reviewing authority should consider atmospheric simulation modeling for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , particulates, and carbon monoxide sources. Also, EPA's view in the Offset Rule continues to apply that in most cases the permitting authority may assume that offsets obtained from an existing source on the same premises or in the immediate vicinity of the new source and from the same effective stack height satisfy the net air quality benefit test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it is prudent for states to reserve the right in their regulations to reject emission reductions proposed to satisfy offset requirements which do not provide a net air quality benefit in the nonattainment area where the proposed emission increase will occur. EPA does not believe that a new source should be permitted which will inhibit progress toward attainment due to the fact that the offsets are obtained from an inappropriate location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey's approach toward a net air quality benefit analysis is inadequate. This is because the Air Quality Impact Analysis Section does not specifically require a dispersion modeling analysis which demonstrates a net decrease in ambient impacts on balance in the nonattainment area where the net emission increase is proposed. This test is required for major new or modified sources whose emission decrease (offset) does not meet the location requirements specified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. This test need not be performed at every location but rather on balance in the nonattainment area of the proposed emission increase (refer to Technical Support Document). EPA requires that the NJDEP modify subchapter 18, 7:27&hyph;18.4 to 18.5 to include a net air quality benefit test. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Calculation of ``Net Emission Increase''. EPA has identified a problem with the provision which requires the calculation of ``Net Emission Increase.'' As part of EPA's review of New Jersey's revised nonattainment NSR rule, EPA evaluated whether the formula used to determine whether a source is subject to this rule follows EPA guidance for determining applicability. New Jersey's rule determines a ``net emission increase'' by using a modified ``potential to potential'' test. However, 40 CFR 51.165 requires that an ``actual to potential'' test be performed. Consequently, EPA cannot approve this methodology and New Jersey must correct this deficiency in its rule. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Definition of ``Contemporaneous''. New Jersey defines ``contemporaneous,'' in reference to the construction of new or altered equipment as ``*&blank;*&blank;* occurring within a time period which includes: 1. The five years prior to the initiation of the construction; and 2. The period between the initiation of construction and the initiation of operation of that new or altered equipment.'' However, New Jersey has not specifically defined the terms ``initiation of construction'' and ``initiation of operation.'' Consequently, EPA cannot approve this definition of ``contemporaneous'' and New Jersey must correct this deficiency in its rule. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

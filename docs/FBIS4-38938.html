			<p>BFN     [Text] Aivars Vovers, under-secretary of state for Eastern  Affairs at the foreign ministry, and leader of the Latvian group  of experts at the upcoming joint talks with Russia, said today a  group of experts from Latvia and Russia will have ten agreements  on mutual economic cooperation ready for signing. The experts  have mainly worked in preparation for the visit of Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin to Latvia, scheduled for late June. It is  possible that the two countries' leaders will sign the prepared  agreements on Latvian-Russian cooperation in transportation, on  mutual protection of capital investments, on handing over to  Russian ownership of the Amber Coast sanatorium, and on  cooperation in the protection of industrial property. The  experts are coordinating the text of a declaration on the trends  in and prospects for the two countries' economic cooperation.  During Chernomyrdin's visit they will also discuss questions  relating to the two countries' prospective cooperation in  educational, cultural and information areas. In addition, the  leaders might discuss the issue of the construction of an  international gas pipeline through Latvia.</p>

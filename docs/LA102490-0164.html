			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 'RACIST' BILLBOARDS STIR AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> Advertising billboards blasted as racist have brewed up a storm in Australia,  where South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela is visiting.  </P> <P> Hahn Brewing Co. said today it would consider withdrawing its advertisements  after complaints that they are racist and ridicule black people.  </P> <P> The advertisement urges drinkers to "Get Your Laughing Gear Around This." One  depicts a black person with an elongated neck adorned with rings, while another  shows a wide-eyed black man balancing a bottle of beer on his lip.  </P> <P> "Imagine Nelson Mandela's reaction, coming to Sydney and seeing ads like that,"  a New South Wales state politician said.  </P> <P> Hahn Managing Director Chuck Hahn said the advertisements, which were approved  by state advertising authorities, are making a humorous comment about the beer.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: UK sales setback for Betterware Betterware, the direct home-shopping group, yesterday reported a 48 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits after its core UK sales shrunk by 9 per cent. The group's shares shed 1p to 36p, well down from its peak of 278p in July last year. The drop in total turnover to Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 34.4m) was blamed on 'a loss of momentum' among its sales force. Betterware lost around 1,000 salesmen, or more than 9 per cent of its distributors, after opening a Pounds 10m distribution centre in Birmingham in January. The company said it had now recovered from the centre's 'teething troubles', which included unreliable stock delivery. Analysts cut their full-year forecasts for the second time in less than a month, from Pounds 9m to about Pounds 6.5m, in spite of company assurances that recruitment was improving and that average orders were holding steady at Pounds 8. Betterware lost more than a third of its market value two weeks ago, after issuing its third profits warning in five months. Mr Peter Hartley, finance director, said the poor pre-tax profit figure was partly the result of the group's investment companies reporting an operating loss of Pounds 405,000 (Pounds 151,000 profit). Profits for the 28 weeks to September 10 also suffered from new investment in computer-aided product design and start-up costs in Germany and Spain, which form part of the company's strategy of international expansion. Last month, the company committed itself to providing up to Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.1m) over time in a joint venture with Avon, the direct seller of beauty products, to sell household goods in North and South America. 'I would point to the Avon deal as an absolute demonstration that the strategy of internationalisation is the correct one,' said Mr Hartley. 'I understand that the market needs short-term profit, that you cannot just promise jam tomorrow, but you also have to continue on a strategy that will develop in the future.' Earnings per share were halved at 2.53p (5p). The interim dividend was 0.85p (0.65p).</p>

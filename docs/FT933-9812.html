			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Victorian values back in vogue: How the ERM debacle has invigorated the gilts market Predictions that the loosening of the shackles of the European exchange rate mechanism would spell the end of the long-standing bull market in UK government bonds proved inaccurate this week. In the event, the shake-up in Europe's currency markets has given gilts a new lease of life. Continental European countries are not rushing to ease interest rates, now that they no longer need to keep them at artificially high levels to support their currencies - unlike the UK, which slashed rates after sterling's hasty exit from the ERM last September. Therefore the incentive to switch into continental bond markets is less pressing. In the meantime, long-term bond yields are still higher in the UK than in many other European markets, and foreign investors are confident that sterling will hold steady. As a result, foreign investment flows into gilts and Eurosterling bonds have shot up: the latest figures, for June, show gilt purchases of Pounds 1.1bn. The inflow will help absorb this year's Pounds 50bn supply of gilts, which is needed to bridge the widening budget gap. Above all, the latest leg in the gilt-edged market's rally can be attributed to the fact that 'people have become extremely optimistic on economic fundamentals', according to Mr Chris Anthony, an economist at UBS, the Swiss bank. Low inflation and low growth are both positive news for the gilts market. For economists, these factors point to a fall in real (with inflation stripped out) yields, as well as nominal yields. If this happens, investors with money in short-term deposit accounts could find themselves earning negative interest, in real terms. 'If you wait until that happens, you will have missed the boat,' because the market will already have rallied, said Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu, the gilts market maker. Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, also believes the gilts market is an attractive buy. 'The only reason you can still get 7 3/4 per cent yields at the long end of the gilts market is that investors have yet to appreciate fully that inflation is down and is staying down this time,' he said. Many economists are arguing in favour of index-linked gilts, which protect investors against inflation and could outperform conventional bonds. Index-linked bonds are also, adds Mr Juckes, 'as good a protection as you can get against things going wrong'. Although most investment institutions are perennial holders of gilts, the question remains whether private investors will rediscover the market. In the past, Britain's inflation record has discouraged retail investors. Investors who bought Pounds 100 of gilts in 1945 would have seen the real value fall to Pounds 29 by 1981, even if they had reinvested the gross income each year. Furthermore, short-term interest rates have been higher than long-term rates for sustained periods during the past 20 years, giving private investors little incentive to venture into the bond market. The government has now recognised the role that private investors can play in meeting its increased funding needs. In April, it published a booklet explaining the complexities of the gilts market, and produced simpler application forms for investors wishing to take part in its issue of 7 1/4 per cent 1998 stock. The National Savings Stock Register, which operates through post offices, is a cheap and relatively easy route for private investors to buy gilts. Nevertheless, there are still some snags. Many gilts trade at above face value, which means that an investor who holds an issue until maturity will suffer a capital loss. Choosing an issue from the wide range of maturities and coupons - or interest payments - can be bewildering for investors accustomed to the relative simplicity of an instant access account. The answer appears obvious - bond funds. These buy portfolios of gilts and then sell units to private investors, who are thereby relieved of the problem of choosing the right gilts issue and (if the fund is well managed) likewise of the problem of capital loss. Bond funds have yet to take off in the UK market, with less than Pounds 2bn of such funds under management onshore, out of a Pounds 76bn total for all unit trusts. One problem may be that the management charges take a chunk out of the yield of the funds and make them less attractive to investors. But in the US and continental Europe, private investors commonly hold their savings in the form of bonds. In the 19th century, wealthy Britons used to hold bonds for income - the family in John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga put their trust in government-issued Consols. Perhaps this is one Victorian value which is making a comeback.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Observer: Third time lucky? The search for Barclays Bank's new chief executive has only just begun, yet long-time Barclays Bank watchers sense that the real power struggle between Barclays Bank chairman Andrew Buxton and his deputy, ex-Treasury chief Sir Peter Middleton, is also in its infancy. For an executive who has been on board less than 18 months, Sir Peter has assumed a surprisingly powerful role at Barclays. It is not just the prominence of his picture in the annual report - normally Barclays' chairmen are pictured solo - but the size of the share options granted to Sir Peter which catch the eye. He has more than any other executive. The conventional wisdom is that Sir Peter's route to the top of Barclays has been blocked by chairman Andrew Buxton's decision to split the top job and hire a new chief executive. Bringing in an outsider undermines the need for a strong executive deputy chairman. Is Sir Peter, who has just turned 59 and is five years older than Buxton, destined to serve out the rest of his days as a loyal number two at Barclays? Given that he was beaten to the top job in the civil service by his younger ex-colleague, Sir Robin Butler, and also missed out on the governorship of the Bank of England, it would be odd if Sir Peter didn't secretly dream of crowning his career with the chairmanship of a big London clearing bank. After all, if Sir Nicholas Goodison and Sir Christopher Tugendhat can be given bank chairmanships, why not Sir Peter? But the clock is ticking and unless Sir Peter moves soon the prize may escape him. How he must envy his other ex-Treasury colleague, Sir David Walker, Lloyds Bank's new deputy chairman. Sir David, 53, is a dozen years younger than his chairman, Sir Robin Ibbs, who turns 67 this month. If Sir David keeps his head down, the chairmanship of Britain's premier bank should soon be in his grasp. The irony is that Sir Peter would probably be a more popular choice as a clearing bank chairman, in some quarters of the City, than Sir David.</p>

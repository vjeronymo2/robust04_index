			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on article by Russian Prime Minister, Victor </F> Chernomyrdin, on Russia's commitment to economic reform: "No  Exits on the Road to Market"]    [Text] In the past three months the west's view of Russian  reform has undergone a significant evolution.    From the panicky statements about a "reactionary turn in the  economy" to the forecasts of a burst of hyperinflation which  prevailed in January, the world's media has begun to offer a  more considered and objective view. And though at the beginning  of the year some ultra-radicals, including some of our own in  Russia, called on the west not to give a cent to the "red  directors" who had taken control of the Russian government, the  International Monetary Fund still took the symbolic decision to  assign to Moscow the second tranche of a $3bn loan in exchange  for commitments to market reform.    What happened in these first 10-12 weeks of this year to  justify the IMF's decision? There was no great turnover of  ministers in the Russian government. The economic reform  programme, adopted in August 1993, did not change. Most  significantly, events themselves have refuted the unscrupulous  allegation that our course would change, an allegation that  proceeded simply from the political ambitions of those who made  it.    The continuation of reform, financial stabilisation and  structural change remain the core of Russia's economic policy.  The economic evidence of the first three months of this year  attest to that. Between February and April, the monthly rate of  inflation fell to 10 per cent. We do not expect the picture to  change in May. In the planned 1994 budget, the deficit is pegged  at 9 per cent of gross domestic product. By observing these  parameters, we will see inflation lowered to a monthly rate of  7-8 per cent by the end of the year.    To achieve this goal we must adopt the most resolute  measures  aimed at limiting the budget deficit and the emission of  credits. In particular, we took a difficult decision to increase  state revenues by changing a range of previously-fixed taxes,  customs and excise duties. And we did that against the backdrop  of a 25 per cent fall in production in the first quarter of this  year compared to the corresponding period in 1993. At the same  time we continued to carry out a tight monetary policy to which  the central bank interest rate -- significantly higher than the  inflation rate in the past few months -- bears witness.    It is vitally important that every member of the Russian  government fully understands that a strong rouble is the  indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy,  and the Russian state as a whole. Naturally, as elsewhere in  the world, ministers will lobby for more resources. However as  every member of the Russian government knows, the important  thing is not the amount of money they receive; rather it is that  the money they get should have a real and lasting worth. It is  counter-productive to have a currency which in one month alone  loses about a quarter of its value. Such has been the fate of  the rouble.    Our common task is thus clear: to ensure that Russian  citizens should know that everything their government does is  directed towards protecting the purchasing power of the rouble,  so that with these roubles Russian citizens will be welcomed  anywhere in the world.    The question naturally arises as to why we do not introduce  an even tougher financial policy and limit even more tightly  budgetary expenditure so as to bring down inflation more  rapidly. We are told by critics that in other countries, in  eastern Europe and the Baltics for instance, the authorities  have managed to achieve financial stabilisation more quickly.  And when we insist, in defence, that Russia is fundamentally  different from these countries, our critics retort that all  countries are different but that economic laws work in the same  way everywhere.    Posing the question in this way reveals an inadequate  understanding of the specifics of the Russian situation. In a  small state the government can follow what happens in every  large enterprise and, where needed, take urgent action: in  Russia, however, the geography of the country significantly  reduces such a possibility.    If a disaster strikes a small country and its economy grinds  to a halt, the world community will come to its aid. Even  Russia, in spite of its worsening economic crisis, continues to  help its neighbours in trying to overcome their poverty. Indeed  Russia's donor status vis-a-vis the member countries of the  Commonwealth of Independent States is parallel to that of the  Group of Seven leading industrialised countries vis-a-vis Russia.    In other words, while economic laws work the same in all  countries, the possibility of a government responding to them  depends on the historic particularities of that country's  economy.    For 70 years, the former Soviet totalitarian economy  accumulated vast structural disparities. Tackling these  problems demands prolonged effort and huge expense. It is clear  that we cannot sanction mass closures of our exhausted plants  since that would usher in an unsupportable rise in unemployment  and sharply worsen both the political and the social situation  in the country. Besides, it would be simply unreasonable, since  many enterprises have significant reserves with which to improve  their financial position. All industrial enterprises should get  the chance -- and that means time -- to overcome their present  difficulties.    Today, we can define three groups of basic industries in  Russia:    Enterprises that have successfully completed a period of  adaptation to new market conditions and are already increasing  turnover.    Enterprises which have yet to undergo such a period of  adaptation, but which display the necessary potential to do so  and have some hope of succeeding. It is these enterprises which  should get help from the government. This group is by far the  most numerous.    Enterprises which are beyond salvation and should be closed  down in accordance with the law on bankruptcy. A list of such  companies is already prepared. We do not, however, want to  throw the baby out with the bathwater; and we cannot ignore the  social consequences of each step on this road.    Imagine a provincial Russian town, built up around a big  defence plant set up some years ago. The entire population of  the town -- maybe 100,000 people -- works at the defence plant,  including those engaged in the service sector. Assume that the  plant has long since ceased to have any social use and no longer  receives orders. Should we shut the enterprise without  considering the consequences for its employees?    Consider another example: a northern mining town with a  population of 50,000 which was established to work the coal  reserves. The extraction of the coal is carried on with huge  losses, the reserves are near to exhaustion, the equipment is  obsolete and the cost of transporting the coal has gone up  several times. There is no other settlement for 500km. There  are hundreds of such cities and towns throughout Russia.    What should be done? We have no choice but to study  carefully each case and patiently find a solution.    We do now feel there is some understanding in the west for  these problems. The talks last month between the Russian  government and representatives of the Group of Seven during the  annual meeting of the European Bank of Reconstruction and  Development in St Petersburg showed that our colleagues in the  US, the UK and other countries recognise the importance of  assistance in the social sphere. They intend to take an active  part in the search for a way to separate out from the  enterprises the social components traditionally provided by  them, such as schools and kindergartens, so as not to threaten  the basic living conditions of millions of people. The issue  here is the possibility of channelling the international credit  given to Russia towards the resolution of, above all, social  problems. We can cope with the other issues ourselves.    We recently finished a round of talks in Moscow with the  IMF;  our approach met with understanding and support. Our relations  with the IMF, to which we have furnished the most complete  information both on the economic situation on what we intend to  do to correct problems in that sphere, have become a symbol of  our new openness in economic matters. We believe that the  agreement with the IMF will lay a good foundation for our talks  with the Paris and London clubs of sovereign and commercial  creditors on the restructuring of Russia's foreign debt which we  inherited from the Soviet Union. Successful co-operation with  our creditors should also assist our efforts to achieve  financial stabilisation.    The further integration of Russia into the world economy  fully accords with our interests. We have left behind the  former artificial exchange rate of the rouble, the state  monopoly of internal trade and other former obstacles and  limitations. We welcome foreign investment in the Russian  economy and very much count on attracting further foreign  investment -- even though we understand that much will depend on  the success of our economic reforms and the improvement of the  legal and tax regimes for foreign investors.    At the same time we will continue to insist on the  establishment of equal trading relations, on the ending of the  discrimination against Russian exports. In that regard, we are  determined to push through Russia's application to join the  General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. In the near future  Russia will take its proper place in the system of world trade  and it will benefit both Russia and its trading partners.    I know that much of this appears over-optimistic. Indeed the  country has still to emerge from its deep economic crisis. At  the same time, we see the first signs that our efforts are  bearing fruit. The privatisation of small businesses -- shops,  restaurants, workshops -- is almost complete. As a result, the  look of Russian cities is changing: in place of the dejected  and sombre queues to which we were accustomed we see smart  advertising hoardings and attractive, lively goods. We count on  the privatisation of the larger companies to produce the same  positive effect.    The first stage of privatisation, based on the use of  vouchers issued free to every citizen, will soon be complete.  From 1 July the remaining shares in state hands will be sold  not for vouchers but for money. This new approach should  replenish the state budget and also strengthen the financial  position of the enterprises themselves.    The strengthening of political stability is also an  enormously important condition for successfully addressing the  economic crisis. Last year, a new constitution was endorsed by  the people in a popular referendum, marking the end of the  long-drawn out and weary confrontation between the executive and  legislative powers. The other important step in the development  of the democratic process was the holding of parliamentary  elections, also in December.    There are differing views on the results of the December  parliamentary elections. Yet the first 100 days of the federal  assembly's work shows that the new parliament is a great  improvement on the old Supreme Soviet. We count on close  co-operation between the government and the parliament as a  necessary condition for the creation of a legal base for the new  economic environment. Political stability has been further  strengthened by the achievement of a civil accord of national  reconciliation, a process led by President Boris Yeltsin and now  endorsed by a broad range of Russian political parties,  enterprises and associations.    In today's Russia we are seeing a new beginning: a time for  those who know how, and have the ability, to do business. We  are now living through the trough of the economic crisis. In  the next few months we can make a break from the basic negative  tendencies which have held back our development in the past two  or three years.    I am certain that we will make the break. Russia has only  one path to tread -- that of reform, and it will not depart from  it.</p>

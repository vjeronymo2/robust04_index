			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Tomiichi Murayama, Social Democratic </F> Party of Japan, SDPJ, chairman, with unidentified domestic  reporters at SDPJ headquarters in Tokyo -- live]  txt}[Text] [Murayama] I am going to read a comment by our  party to make our position clear. Please listen.    Today, at both the House of Representatives and the House of  Councilors sessions, we elected Mr. Hata as our 80th prime  minister. The SDPJ made an all-out effort to elect Mr. Hata as  prime minister. We expected a meeting of the ruling parties  heads to be called after the election, and that Mr. Hata would  show us a basic plan for the cabinet formation. However, we did  not receive any calls. A meeting of the ruling coalition heads  was called after 08:00 P.M. [1100 GMT] this evening. However,  it was only called to change the coalition's framework, and at  the meeting, Mr. Hata did not present a cabinet formation plan.    The following is what happened and what our position is:    1) As our party was waiting for the call to notify us of the  meeting, preparatory work for the formation of a parliamentary  group "Kaishin" [Innovation] within the Diet -- which is said  to have been proposed by Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]  Chairman Ouchi to former Prime Minister Hosokawa -- secretly  took place without consultations with the SDPJ. We found that  the new parliamentary group made a report to the House of  Representatives on their formation after 08:00 PM [1100 GMT].  In the past, the idea of forming a parliamentary group called  "Kaikaku" [Reform] among the coalition was scrapped. In view of  this, we believe the purpose of the formation of the new  parliamentary group -- which is a renamed version of "Kaikaku",  and which took place immediately after the nomination of the  prime minister -- is to break the faith with the coalition's  framework. We can not help feeling that there is a certain  strategy behind such a move.    2) We, taking advantage of forming a new government,  recently  reconfirmed policies agreed upon after sharp debates by the  coalition partners at the ruling parties heads meeting. That  agreement was to affirm the coalition's position to take over  the Hosokawa government's reform policies, based on an agreement  the coalition reached last July. The agreement among the  coalition partners is an outgrowth of the coalition's all-out  efforts in maintaining reform policies and the Hosokawa  government's framework. The coalition has agreed that the  formation of the new cabinet was supposed to be discussed at a  meeting of the ruling parties. In this sense, the fact that  certain parties and individuals of the coalition members have  ignored such a process and have selfishly broken the coalition's  framework is intolerable.    3) The SDPJ believes that such an intentional manipulation  of  the coalition's framework is nothing but an attempt to increase  the people's distrust in the politics of the new coalition  government and cannot tolerate it. Therefore, the SDPJ cannot  remain in the coalition. The party is now determined to promote  reform politics with the people, and thus, it is impossible for  us to cooperate with the new government in reshuffling the  cabinet. However, our party is resolved to make all-out efforts  to fulfill what we have pledged to the people, including the  adoption of the budget bills for fiscal 1994 in an attempt to  revive the economy. This is the SDPJ's statement.    [Unidentified moderator] Now reporters may ask questions.    [Reporter] Is there any possibility that the SDPJ will  support the new government from outside?    [Murayama] Yes, there is a word of support for the cabinet  from outside. But in fact, I am of the opinion that it will be  difficult to do so. But as for the budget bill, which was  proposed by the Hosokawa government, and which the SDPJ took  part in, we will do our utmost to pass it because our party has  a responsibility to carry out what the party has pledged.    [Reporter] What do you mean by certain intentional strategy?    [Murayama] The ruling parties originally agreed to decide on  the nature of the coalition's framework and form a cabinet after  coordinating policies. But other ruling parties have  drastically changed such a framework without consulting our  party, thus breaking the coalition's original agreement.  Judging from this, we can clearly see that what lies behind  their move is their intention to bisect the coalition. I  believe that such an attempt is unpardonable in view of the  coalition government's character that places emphasis on  managing the government through a democratic process.    [Reporter] Do you mean they are trying to kick the SDPJ out  of the coalition?    [Murayama] I am not sure whether it is appropriate to say  they are tying to do so. But in short, we can clearly see that  they are trying to control the management of the coalition by  making use of their superior numbers. This is intolerable.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Murayama] I cannot go that far. But judging from what they  have done, we cannot help thinking so.    [Reporter] Has the SDPJ's position already been conveyed to  the prime minister?    [Murayama] Yes, we informed the prime minister of our  position.    [Reporter] Directly to the prime minister?    [Murayama] Yes.    [Reporter] What did the prime minister say?    [Murayama] He repeatedly said he wants us to reconsider our  position. But we have no time, you know.    [Reporter] What time did you inform him?    [Murayama] Immediately before I came here.    [Reporter] Are you going to attend a coalition party  leaders' meeting?    [Murayama] No, I am not.    [Reporter] Is there room for discussion?    [Murayama] No, there is not.    [Reporter] Is this a decision approved by all SDPJ members?    [Murayama] That is right. The council, composed of three  executives, was entrusted with the task of making decisions. I  do not mean to say that we were entrusted with making the  decision to secede from the coalition. However, it was too late  at night to convene a party meeting. Also, this is something  that could not wait until tomorrow. Therefore, we took the  responsibility to make the decision on our own.    [Reporter] Did you expect this to happen?    [Murayama] No, we did not.    [Reporter] Is the SDPJ going to quit the coalition's  decision making bodies too -- including representatives'  meeting, the policy executive council, and the tax system  research council?    [Murayama] That is right.    [Reporter] Can you explain how you felt before making the  decision?    [Murayama] We were unable to have budget deliberations for  more than two weeks. However, we did not waste time during that  period. We had serious discussions and agreed to form a better  administration. We united our party and did our best to approve  Mr. Hata as prime minister in both the upper and lower houses.  However, I was told that a party leaders' meeting might be held  at around 4:00 [0700 GMT] immediately after the prime minister  was elected. I was waiting for it at the Diet members' office  building. But, the party leaders' meeting started around 2000  [1100 GMT] without informing me. Notification of the new  parliamentary group's formation was completed immediately before  holding the party leaders' meeting. They held the meeting after  completing all the necessary procedures for formation of the  parliamentary group. Formation of the group will change the  framework of the coalition and it is goes against the promise we  made with each other. They did not keep the promise. We  thought the coalition government would not function well if such  a thing should happen often. We tried to talk with them, but it  was too late because notification of the new group's formation  had already taken place. Under such circumstances, we gave the  matter careful consideration and unanimously agreed that the  secession was unavoidable.    [Reporter] Are you planning to call for a general election  after approving the draft budget?    [Murayama] We have not thought that far. We have to see how  the situation will change.    [Coordinator] One more question, please.    [Reporter] What about the coalition platform? Is it invalid  now?    [Murayama] This is an agreement we made at the time of  forming the coalition government. We will not be restricted by  it because we are going to secede from the coalition government.    [Reporter] Can we say that the SDPJ will split from the  coalition rather than saying that it will cooperate with the  government from outside the cabinet?    [Murayama] That is right.    [Reporter] Do you feel angry, mortified, or betrayed?    [Murayama] What?    [Reporter] Do you feel angry, mortified, or ...    [Murayama interrupting] What are you talking about? This is  not an emotional issue. The coalition government was formed on  the basis of mutual trust. It will not function well if there  is no trust. Under such a circumstance, we are just not  confident that we can steer the coalition government well.  Therefore, we came to the conclusion that we should split from  it.</p>

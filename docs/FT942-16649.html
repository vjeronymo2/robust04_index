			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (4): Process has environmental benefits - Coil coating One type of industrialised wet painting has been growing steadily for about the last 15 years, in spite of the emission of copious quantities of volatile organic compounds during the process, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. The process is called coil coating. Its environmental advantage is that it enables manufacturers to get rid of their paint shops altogether. The metal they want to bash or bend comes ready-painted with coatings so tough they remain undamaged during production. Coil coated steel or aluminium is now formed into hundreds of products, from profiled cladding for buildings to consumer durables like refrigerators and washing machines, to teltronic products like video recorders and sound systems, to non-stick cookware or components for cars. The process is largely automatic. A roll of steel or aluminium - called a coil - is unrolled and passed flat through pre-treatment tanks to clean and degrease it before being sprayed automatically with wet, solvent-borne paint. The coated strip then moves through a heated tunnel, where VOC solvents are driven and the mixture of resins and pigments polymerise into some of the toughest paints ever designed by chemists. VOC emissions are not a problem because they are collected and incinerated. The resultant heat is then recycled back into the production process to help with the stoving, thus saving energy. With all the potential for pollution in one place - including run-off of pre-treatment chemicals - it is contained and dealt with efficiently. Coil coated products barged into the market initially because of labour cost-savings from eliminating individual paint shops in the 1980-82 recession. The cost to the remaining small shops of environmental compliance is now likely to provide another boost. Mr Roger Walters, chief executive of Euramax and chairman of the UK Coil Coaters' Association says that 'for virtually the whole of the 1980s, our industry was growing at 10 per cent a year. 'Since 65 per cent of the market is in the construction sector, there has been a slowdown in the recession, but things are still healthy.' Mr Peter Burling, who runs British Steel's thriving coil business is president of the European Coil Coaters, says 'our products are perceived to be good for the environment. 'As legislation becomes tougher, in-house painting will become more costly. We expect to take more market share from traditional industrial paints.' Beckers, the Swedish-owned paintmaker, claims about 25 per cent of European coil markets. Mr John Lyon, managing director of Beckers' UK business, who has overall responsibility for coil, says 'environmental compliance is an opportunity. Coil takes all the problems away from the manufacturer of coated articles. 'It also involves a marriage of coater, pre-treatment specialist and paint supplier in which quality and consistency are more important than price. This makes it a good business to be in.'</p>

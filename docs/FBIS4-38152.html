			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has urged the  business community to keep the national interest uppermost and  not to go on strike. The government's door for negotiations is  open. They should talk to the minister of state for finance to  remove differences, doubts, and suspicion as he is in charge of  the budget. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime  minister said the people's government does not want to burden  the poor and the middle class and it is for this reasons that  taxes have been imposed on the upper class. She said the  business community should take into account various incentives  and concessions given in the budget. In this connection, she  referred to withdrawal of import duty and reduction in tariff  rates. However, she declared, the government will not succumb  to any pressure or blackmail. She said the government has taken  measures aimed at reducing dependence on bank loans. She said  for the 1993-94 budget, 60 billion rupees were borrowed from the  State Bank. In the new budget, bank borrowing has been  curtailed to 15 billion rupees only. This will reduce the  budget deficit and enhance industrialization. The prime  minister said the business community is not opposed to the  budgetary measures, rather they are averse to the government's  decision to file wealth tax returns along with income tax  returns. She said in the United Kingdom, India, and other  countries, if someone is found concealing his income he has to  pay 10 times the evaded amount. If the business community comes  to the negotiations, then we can start with penalties four times  of the amount evaded and would gradually increase it to 10  times. But, if they carry on with their strike call, then we  will enforce penalties 10 times the amount at once. The prime  minister said the government wants everybody to pay tax  according to capacity because the prevalent system taxes the  poor but does not bring the rich into the tax net. She said the  government has initiated a moral crusade against tax evasion.  She said:    [Begin Bhutto recording] I do not believe the community's  strike is to going to be effective. I believe that they are  going to strike and it will peter out. And I believe that the  reforms that we have introduced are necessary for transforming  Pakistan into a modern nation state. We cannot be a nation of  borrowers. We cannot be a nation which lives beyond our means.  We cannot be a nation that goes on increasing our deficit and  paying our government salaries through borrowing. (?It has) to  stop. And what we have to do is generate employment and reduce  inflation for which we have taken steps. [end recording]    The minister of state for finance, Makhdum Shahabuddin, has  said the claim of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and  Industry [FPCCI] that the government will suffer a loss of 18  billion rupees per day if the federation's demands are not met  resulting in a two-day strike is false, exaggerated, and  alarmist. In a statement issued in Islamabad today, Makhdum  Shahabuddin said it is clear that the strike, the success of  which is questionable, will not affect agriculture, the  principal productive sector of the economy, or energy or mining.  He said even if it is assumed that the entire manufacturing and  trade sector shuts down, which is virtually impossible, the loss  to the economy would not amount to around 1.5 billion rupees per  day. These irresponsible estimates of the FPCCI are meant to  alarm the public, cause panic, and pressurize the government  into taking action which may not be in the best interest of the  country. Makhdum Shahabuddin said the federation is not serving  the true interests of its constituents or the country by  resorting to confrontation, alarmist predictions, campaign to  break the law, and obstructing constructive dialogue on the  budget between the government and trade and industry.</p>

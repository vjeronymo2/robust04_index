			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ROTATION DOESN'T BOTHER VALENZUELA, 5-1  </P> <P> Showing no ill effects from moving up a day in the new four-man rotation,  Fernando Valenzuela pitched seven strong innings and the Dodgers took advantage  of an inept Houston Astro defense for a 5-1 victory Tuesday.  </P> <P> Before a Cap Night crowd of 45,054 at Dodger Stadium, Valenzuela evened his  record at 5-5 and handed the Astros their 11th consecutive road loss.  </P> <P> The victory came at the expense of Mike Scott, who fell to 4-7 despite giving  up only one earned run. The Dodgers scored four times on only one hit in the  fourth to give Valenzuela all the runs he needed against the Astros' weak  attack.  </P> <P> Valenzuela had problems with his control in the first two innings, giving up  only a single but walking three and having to contend with two baserunners in  each inning. He stranded a man at third in the first inning.  </P> <P> But he found his groove in the third inning and retired 10 consecutive batters,  striking out four of them.  </P> <P> Scott matched Valenzuela for three innings but was victimized by his defense  and his own control problems in the fourth. AlexTrevino, playing his first game  this season at first base in place of ailing Glenn Davis, couldn't handle Kal  Daniels' grounder to open the inning and was given an error.  </P> <P> Eddie Murray followed with a single, and with one out and the runners moving,  Mike Scioscia grounded to shortstop Eric Yelding -- who tried to tag second but  was beaten by Murray, loading the bases. Scott walked Mike Sharperson on four  pitches, forcing in the first run. Alfredo Griffin followed with a run-scoring  fly to medium center, and when the throw home wasn't cut off, the runners  advanced to second and third.  </P> <P> That cost the Astros two more runs when Yelding threw Valenzuela's grounder  into the dirt for the second error of the inning. All four runs were unearned.  </P> <P> Murray produced the Dodgers' fifth run, hitting a two-out home run deep into  the right-field bullpen in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> Valenzuela's shutout ended in the seventh when Casey Candaele hit a one-out  homer -- his third this season and second off Valenzuela this year. Valenzuela  also gave up two subsequent singles, but left the runners on base by striking  out pinch-hitter Dave Rohde.  </P> <P> With a four-run lead and 110 pitches thrown, Valenzuela was given the rest of  the night off, with Tim Crews and Jim Gott pitching a scoreless inning each.  Valenzuela said he would have continued if Candaele hadn't homered.  </P> <P> Valenzuela was pitching on three days' rest for the first time, he said, since  1986 or '87. "It's been a long time," he said.  </P> <P> Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said Valenzuela "said he could do it. We'll see how  it works."  </P> <P> Ramon Martinez will also pitch on three days' rest tonight.  </P> <P> "You're not going to see a difference the first start or second start," catcher  Mike Scioscia said. "But if you keep someone on three days' rest for a long  period of time, it's going to take its toll. (Valenzuela) has been very  consistent lately. We're looking for six to eight strong innings from him start  after start, and that's what we've been getting."  </P> <P> The Astros have been equally consistent -- losing their 11th consecutive road  game and falling to 9-24 away from home, the worst record in the majors.  </P> <P> "I don't have any answers," Scott said. "We had one good stretch but . . .  we're having a hard time winning games."  </P> <P> Said Astro Manager Art Howe: "This whole road trip we haven't been able to come  up with the big hit. I thought (Valenzuela) was ripe to be had."  </P> <P> The victory, the Dodgers' third in a row, pulled them to within a game of .500  and kept them within a game of third-place San Diego.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> After grounding out in the fifth inning, Kal Daniels left the game because of  discomfort in his left hamstring. Daniels was to be examined today. . . .  Outfielder Stan Javier has hits in eight consecutive games and he has increased  his average to .309. During that streak Javier has hit .435 and scored eight  runs. The switch hitter is batting .368 right-handed and figures to continue  seeing playing time because of the injury to Kirk Gibson. . . . Fernando  Valenzuela came into Tuesday's game hitting .400 with a home run, six runs  batted in and a pinch-hit double. He has at least one hit in seven of 13  starts. . . . The Dodgers entered Tuesday's game without anyone in the NL's top  10 in any offensive category except stolen bases -- where Juan Samuel is tied  for second with 24, but he has been benched since Friday. . . . The Dodger  bullpen, which has a 7-10 record and 4.08 earned-run average for the season,  has given up only three runs in the last 19 innings, a 1.40 ERA. . . . Jim  Gott, who struck out two in a pressure situation Monday, said he felt  "fantastic" the day after. "I'm ready (to pitch) every night now," he said.  </P> <P> The Astros have had their own injury problems. National League home run leader  Glenn Davis was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game Tuesday  because of a sore lower back. Rookie Eric Anthony, who has been limited to  pinch-hitting because of a hamstring injury, was examined by Dr. Frank Jobe  Tuesday and pronounced sound. Anthony, who last month became only the second  Houston player to hit a home run into the upper deck of the Astrodome, said he  expects to return to the lineup today. And infielder Ken Oberkfell, who left  the field Monday because of a rib cage strain, was placed on the 15-day  disabled list. The Astros recalled Dave Rohde from triple-A Tucson in his  place.  </P> <P> The Dodgers' rookie league teams, Great Falls (Mont.) and Kissimmee (Fla.),  begin play today. The Great Falls roster includes No. 1 draft choice, pitcher  Ronnie Walden, as well as twins Mike and Mark Mimbs, both left-handed pitchers,  and pitcher Pedro Martinez, 19-year-old brother of Ramon Martinez. The younger  Martinez is scheduled to pitch today's opener at home against Medicine Hat.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: European M&amp;A European mergers and acquisition specialists must be green with envy as they contemplate the bumper year being enjoyed by their US counterparts. Though the level of European M&amp;A activity has picked up, it does not compare with the flow of multi-billion dollar deals on the other side of the Atlantic. There three sectors in particular are being convulsed by restructuring: pharmaceuticals, defence and media/telecoms. On the surface, conditions look ripe for a similar burst of activity in Europe. Like the Clinton administration, European governments are trying to keep the lid on healthcare bills and cut defence spending. So it makes sense for drugs and defence groups to merge and reduce capacity. The technological forces reshaping the boundaries between telecoms and media sectors are also a worldwide phenomenon. Indeed, Europe has seen some activity in all these sectors. The UK's independent television system has been consolidated. Tentative steps are being taken to rationalise the European defence industry. And European pharmaceutical groups have been prominent in buying US drugs companies, though few have themselves been targets. But European M&amp;A activity lags US deal-making for two main reasons. First, political sensitivities make cross-border restructuring hard in industries such as defence and telecoms. Second, with European recovery still sluggish, many managers are reluctant to splash out on big deals. Memories of recession will undoubtedly fade and M&amp;A activity pick up. But bumper conditions are unlikely to return for some time.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / South Korean TV makers take a bold grip on Europe THE small French town of Fameck near the Luxembourg border recently became the site of Europe's third South Korean television manufacturing plant when Daewoo Electronics, the electronics subsidiary of South Korea's Daewoo Group, opened its Dollars 30m factory. Samsung started TV production for the European market in Billingham on Teesside a few months ago and Goldstar has opened a factory in Germany. The added capacity to European TV production comes at a time when the European industry is experiencing some of the most difficult trading conditions in recent history. Television manufacturers throughout Europe have been under intense pressure as recession has slashed demand and prices have fallen. 'The market is basically flat in Europe,' says a representative at Philips, the largest manufacturer in Europe, which dominates the market together with Grundig, the German manufacturer in which it owns a controlling stake. Television sales in Europe declined 2 per cent from 22.5m units in 1990 to 22.1m units last year, while in terms of sales value the drop was greater at 6 per cent from Ecu8.49bn (Dollars 11.88bn) to Ecu7.99bn. The television division of Grundig, which has a strong base in Germany, is expected to be one of the most affected by the group's decision to cut its overall workforce by 3,000. It has already closed a TV factory in Barcelona. Ferguson, which is owned by Thomson Consumer Electronics, closed a television factory in the UK last autumn. Philips introduced short-time working in the first half of this year, although its plants are back to capacity now. Nokia, the Finnish group, expects to ship just 1m television sets out of a total capacity of up to 2m. The Japanese manufacturers which set up in the UK have also been hurt. Panasonic, which has a television manufacturing plant in Wales with a capacity of 1.2m units a year, announced last month that it was moving to a four-day working week. Unruffled by the climate in Europe, South Korean manufacturers have steadily built up a presence with Samsung claiming brand leadership in the 20-inch colour television market in the UK. 'Our strategy is to develop a local business,' says Mr Matthew Simmons, marketing manager at Samsung in the UK. Mr Chan Jong Lee, deputy general manager for electronics at Daewoo, echoes his sentiments. 'In order to sell in local markets it is better to manufacture locally. We are doing this with the European people,' he says. Both Daewoo's new factory, which will be producing sets ranging from 14 to 33 inches, and Samsung's factory in the UK, have a manufacturing capacity of 500,000 sets each. Compared with the European market of over 20m units sold in a year, that may be a 'pin prick' as one of the leading European manufacturers said. The European manufacturers also enjoy strong brand loyalty in markets such as Germany and France. However, the South Korean presence in Europe will doubtless intensify competition in a market where European manufacturers are already feeling the heat from Japanese manufacturers. 'In terms of brand share development, the overall positioning of European manufacturers has slightly decreased over recent years,' according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the market consultants.</p>

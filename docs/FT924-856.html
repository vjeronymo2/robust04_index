			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Russia set to bring in own currency RUSSIA was said yesterday to be on the verge of introducing its own currency, a move which would force all other republics to introduce their own and deprive them of direct influence over Moscow's monetary policy. At the same time, however, Mr Valerian Kulikov, central bank deputy chairman, outlined, in an interview with Izvestia newspaper, a shift in credit and finance policies which would weaken whatever currency replaces the old Soviet rouble. 'We will correct the policy of the central bank in accordance with the government line announced by the new prime minister,' he said, referring to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's promise to stem a fall in industrial output and wipe out the debts accumulated by state-owned enterprises. New measures included negative annual interest rates of 3-10 per cent for central bank loans for investment in industry and, apart from introducing new tax benefits, even waiving reserve requirements for commercial banks which lend to priority sectors, such as consumer goods. Social security minister Ella Pamfilova has offered to quit the Russian government, the first member of former acting prime minister Yegor Gaidar's cabinet to do so, Interfax news agency said yesterday.</p>

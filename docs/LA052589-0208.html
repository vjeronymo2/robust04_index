			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAKASONE TELLS OF HIS ROLE IN JAPAN SCANDAL  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone emerged virtually unscathed today after  testifying before Parliament on his role in Japan's biggest postwar political  scandal.  </P> <P> Nakasone, who had initially refused to testify, took the stand in a crowded  parliamentary committee room where he coolly shrugged off questions, as well as  some bitter jibes from members of his own ruling Liberal Democratic Party.  </P> <P> He revealed for the first time that he received about $325,000 in illegal  political donations from Recruit publishing and telecommunications company  while in office.  </P> <P> The Recruit shares-for-favors scandal occurred during his term as premier  between 1982 and 1987 and Japanese tradition calls for a leader to take full  responsibility.  </P> <P> In answer to one question, Nakasone said he felt deep responsibility for his  role in the scandal but would continue as a member of Parliament.  </P> <P> His words were almost drowned out by an interruption from fellow LDP member  Koichi Hamada. "We ourselves are in deep trouble because of him," Hamada  shouted.  </P> <P> Other LDP members jeered throughout the session, sometimes making it hard to  hear Nakasone.  </P></p>

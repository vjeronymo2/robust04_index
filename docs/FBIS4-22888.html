As a consequence, a  new approach to studying the biological activity of natural  oligopeptide whereby the investigation proceeds from the  structure to the function, i.e., in a direction opposite to that  of existing approaches, was developed by the authors. It is  rooted in the understanding of the structural arrangement of the  low-molecular peptide molecules, a direct correlation between  the conformational capabilities of a number of peptide hormones  and their physiological action, and an assumption of the  principal similarity of the physical and chemical origin of the  hormone-receptor and enzyme-substrate interactions. The natural  oligopeptide structural-functional organization principles  underlying the approach are outlined. The study pursues two  goals simultaneously: to establish the structural-functional  arrangement of the angiotensin II molecule with the help of a  known approach to examining natural oligopeptides (a more  particular task) and testing the approach used in the specific  analysis and assessing its actual capabilities (a more general  task). The study shows that the angiotensin II molecule  organization is, in essence, described by a set of low-energy  conformational states of several groups which are easily  transformed one into another. The two most energy- and  entropy-wise efficient groups are identified and the geometrical  parameters of their representatives are summarized. The values  of the dihedral angles of the backbone and side amino acid  hormone residual chains are calculated, and the energy of the  intra- and inter-residual interactions of all potentially  physiologically active conformations is evaluated. The findings  are compared to numerous published sources. Figures 5; tables 7;  references 45: 13 Russian, 32 Western.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Train builder set to shed 900 jobs ABB TRANSPORTATION, the UK's biggest train builder, said yesterday it is making nearly 900 of its 6,134 employees redundant across its operations at York, Derby and Crewe because of a severe reduction in UK orders. The announcement underlines the plight of the UK's railway equipment industry, which is running out of orders because of the uncertainty created by rail privatisation plans, and what it sees as underinvestment in the UK railway network. The Railway Industry Association, the equipment suppliers' trade body, said yesterday that the cuts 'could be the beginning of a process about which we have been warning the Government for the best part of a year'. The association has said that privatisation puts about half the equipment industry's 30,000 jobs at risk immediately, and all of them in the long term. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said the cuts were 'directly due to the bumbling incompetence of a government which has failed to throw the railway engineering industry the financial lifeline it has in its grasp'. The brunt of yesterday's job cuts at ABB Transportation - formerly known as Brel - falls on York, where 532 of the 1,600 jobs are to go. Derby will suffer 273 job cuts, while 91 workers will be made redundant at the Crewe heavy overhaul works. The immediate cause was the news late last month that ABB Transportation had lost the battle for a Pounds 36m order from Strathclyde Council for 21 commuter trains. Mr Bo Sodersten, ABB Transportation's managing director, warned that the company would be assessing its manpower and workload requirements. Brel, the old workshop arm of British Rail, was privatised in 1989 and since last year has been 85 per cent owned by Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group. ABB said yesterday it had transformed the subsidiary into a 'first-class company'. But the York plant, on which Pounds 50m has been spent since privatisation, is due to run out of work next May when it finishes a Pounds 140m order for Networker trains from Network SouthEast. Mr Sodersten has warned that the plant could close if it does not win significant orders this year. Its future could depend on winning a Pounds 150m order from BR for more commuter trains which may be awarded in August. In Derby, the 273 redund-ancies came as a shock. 'We didn't think things had got to that stage,' said Mr John Jennings, chairman of the Conservative-controlled City Council's economic development commit tee. Over the last three years the ABB Derby workforce has been cut to just over 3,000 from 4,000. Unemployment in Derby has been running at 12.6 per cent and the retrenchment at ABB coincides with reductions at Rolls-Royce, the city's other major manufacturing employer. Mr Sodersten said yesterday: 'We see great long-term possibilities for our products and services, both here in the UK and overseas, but it is essential that our domestic customers are in a position now to continue a programme of steady order placement if Britain's railway industry is to survive.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elzbieta Maczynska: "The Machine-Building </F> Industry on the `500 List'"]    [Text] The machine-building industry fulfills the function  of carrier of technical progress and modernity, throwing  practically all sectors of the economy into development. Thus it  is vital to analyze the tendencies and developmental trends in  this sphere. Overall, 134 enterprises of the machine-building  industry (26.8 percent of the total studied; in 1991, the number  was 28 percent) are on the `500 List,' and every industry sector  is represented on the list by several units.    The share of enterprises of the machine-building industry in  the sales value of all 500 List enterprises is 19.3 percent (in  1991--20.4 percent), or one-sixth of total sales value.    Of the 134 enterprises of the machine-building industry on  the list, only 98 operate at a gross profit. The other 36 take a  gross loss on the sale of their products. In addition, these  losses are increased by the dividends these enterprises pay and  by the tax on above-the-plan growth of wages [popiwek]. With  these latter included, an additional 10 enterprises (for a total  of 46) show negative net financial results.    The 98 profitable enterprises of the machine-building  industry showed a gross profit of 5 trillion zlotys [Z] (in  1991, Z6.2 trillion). However, the 36 loss-bearing enterprises  showed a gross loss of Z9.2 trillion (in 1991, Z7.2 trillion),  which significantly exceeded the profits of the other  enterprises. Thus, these 134 showed a negative gross financial  balance of over Z4.2 trillion (in 1991, Z903 billion). When  mandatory costs are included, the negative net financial balance  comes to Z8.6 trillion. This reveals the catastrophic rise in  the machine-building industry's debt.    As analysis of the data thus indicates, the machine-building  industry is characterized by deficit, as in 1991, and that  deficit is increasing. The profitability indicator, calculated  as the relation of gross financial result to sales, equals 2.1  percent (in 1991, 1.4 percent); net profitability equaled 87.4  percent. The profitability of sales came to minus 6.8 percent.  For the entire machine-building industry, the deficit earnings  were even higher in 1992, coming to minus 9.6 percent (in 1991,  minus 8.3 percent). So the profitability of the machine-building  industry continued to worsen.    Enterprises of the machine-building industry absorbed over  68  percent of supplementary payments and subsidies made to the 500  enterprises on the list; their share in costs (18.9 percent) was  slightly less than their share in sales (19.3 percent). These  enterprises, however, are characterized by the highest relation  of costs to financial result--55 percent. The sum of these  costs, Z4.4 trillion, is close to the sum of gross profit (Z5  trillion).    The current liquidity indicator of the enterprises of the  machine-building industry on the 500 List was higher than the  average for the list, coming to 2.1 (for the 500, the indicator  was 1.9). The same is true for the indicator of rapid  liquidity--the so-called quick ratio (0.9 and 0.8 percent,  respectively), and that of immediate solvency (0.3 percent).  Such a low indicator level shows that these enterprises are  encountering difficulties with the realization of current  obligations and payments.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>    -  Enterprises of the machine-building industry have a  significant share on the 500 List both of value of sales (19.3  percent--second place after the food industry) and of employment  (36.4 percent--first place).    -  At the same time, the share in  payments and costs required by the state budget is similar to  that in sales--18.9 percent.    -  The share of these enterprises in  total subsidies and supplementary payments is also high, and  growing, in comparison to 1991.    -  As in 1991, the enterprises of  the machine-building industry show the second-highest deficit on  the 500 List, after enterprises of the consumer goods  industry.    -  The machine-building industry's indicators, which are  unfavorable in the context of the 500 enterprises, are the more  ominous because there is a clear divergence between the volume  of sales and the size of financial surpluses. Many of the  enterprises with the highest sales show a negative financial  result and/or a very low profitability indicator. The  transportation industry has both the largest share of sales in  the machine-building industry and the highest deficit of gross  and net sales.    -  Enterprises with the highest employment are often  deficit operations; this may be, on the one hand, a brake on  restructuring, while, on the other, indicate the necessity of  such action.    -  Enterprises of the machine-building industry on the  500 List incur on balance a total net loss of Z8.5 trillion. The  profits of the 98 profitable enterprises are thus negated in the  context of the 36 unprofitable enterprises. In this sense, the  situation worsened in 1992 in comparison with that in 1991.    -  At  the same time, the link between the level of deficit and the  amount of dividends and popiwek paid is clear. It is not  uncommon that an enterprise earns a gross profit, which, after  the payment of income tax, in insufficient to pay dividends and  the popiwek; the enterprise thus enters the loss column. This is  so for 10 of the enterprises with a gross profit.    -  Many of the  enterprises that are least profitable are also payers of the  popiwek--for example, most of the shipyards. At the same time, a  large portion of the enterprises paying dividends and the  popiwek show large sales.    -  One can thus formulate a preliminary  hypothesis that one of the most important barriers to the  development of the machine-building industry is the low  productivity and ineffectiveness of the mechanisms for  rationalizing employment and pay--above all, the popiwek.    -  The  deficit situation of many enterprises of the machine-building  industry and that industry's great technical and personnel  potential demands careful preparation and implementation of  complex programs of restructuring.</p>

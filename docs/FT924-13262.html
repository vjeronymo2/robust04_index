			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM, Philip Morris lead Dow into reverse Wall Street APART FROM disappointing third quarter earnings from IBM and Philip Morris - which contributed to a sizeable fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average - US stock markets were mostly flat yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.80 at 3,174.68, above its lows for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, firmed 0.30 to 409.67, while the Amex composite ended just 0.54 lower at 365.63 and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.43 to 578.65. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 205m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 879 to 805. The Dow's decline was almost entirely due to losses in IBM and Philip Morris, which were hit by poor quarterly results. According to Birinyi Associates, the New York market analysis firm, all but a couple of points of the decline in the Dow was due to the big losses in IBM and Philip Morris, two of the largest constituents of the Dow. Analysts said that the S &amp; P 500 and other secondary indices provided a better measure of market performance, which suggested that despite some bad corporate news the market was relatively stable. The day's economic numbers were not particularly significant. A 16,000 drop in weekly jobless claims and a 0.2 per cent increase in September consumer prices were positive for the market, but were offset by a big fall in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity and a similar-sized decline in the ABC/Money Magazine index of consumer confidence. IBM dominated trading after the giant computer group reported third quarter net income of 15 cents a share, well below the 75 cents a share forecast by analysts. The news from IBM set off a stampede of selling, which delayed the opening of trading in the stock for more than 30 minutes. After a hectic day's trading, IBM shares eventually closed down Dollars 5 1/8 , or 6.5 per cent, at Dollars 72 7/8 , the stock's lowest close for more than 10 years. Turnover was 6.2m shares. The day's other big story was Philip Morris, which plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 in turnover of 9.5m shares. Although the bottom line numbers from the company were not so bad - a 16.4 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 1.29bn - investors were disappointed by falling domestic cigarette shipments and warnings from the company of a much larger fall to come in the fourth quarter. AMR, parent group of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 after the company announced plans to cut 1993 spending by Dollars 300m and reduce payroll costs by 10 per cent through management job cuts. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed in moderate dealings, held back by a slumping real estate sector. The TSE 300 composite index gained 0.75 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 3,196.14, with declining issues outpacing gainers 297 to 211. Volume was 23m shares valued at CDollars 252.1m against the previous 23.6m valued at CDollars 215.6m.</p>

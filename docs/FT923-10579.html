			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Breakthrough elusive in farm talks TWO DAYS of informal talks between Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, aimed at averting farm trade conflicts between the US and the EC ended inconclusively in Ireland yesterday. The two sought a compromise over the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation proposals - blocked for 20 months by a US-EC dispute over cuts in EC farm subsidies - and the US threat to impose punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn worth of EC exports in retaliation for damage done to US farmers by the EC's oilseed subsidy scheme. Mr MacSharry said after the talks at Dromoland Castle in the west of Ireland that he remained optimistic that the Uruguay Round would be successfully concluded by October this year, but said that many issues remained to be resolved. 'The major problem is still export volume,' he said, referring to the need to cut both the volume and the value of subsidised EC farm exports, especially cereals. He and Mr Madigan were making 'a big effort' to avoid a trade war between the EC and the US, he said. The latest discussions had been a 'stocktaking exercise' during which both sides had reviewed the other's positions on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the oilseeds dispute. In the oilseeds dispute, the US government is expected to publish in three weeks' time the final list of Dollars 1bn in EC agricultural exports which will be subject to punitive tariffs if the EC does not reform its oilseeds subsidy regime. Two Gatt dispute panels have supported a US claim that EC oilseed subsidies have harmed US soyabean farmers. The most recent EC proposals for a compensation package were rejected by the US in Geneva on Monday. Mr Robert Green, US Agriculture Department under-secretary, this week told the American Soyabean Association (ASA) that the EC compensation offer was unacceptable because it provided no advantage to injured soyabean producers. The Bush administration is expected to proceed with sanctions unless the compensation is satisfactory to the ASA. Mr McSharry, the Irish appointee to the EC Commission, has been angered that some Dollars 200m of Irish products have been targeted in the initial US 'hit-list' published in June. This would cause a disproportionate share of retaliation to fall on Irish producers and prove particularly damaging for the Irish dairy processing industry, officials say.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Curb on baby milk adverts attacked Manufacturers of formula milk for babies yesterday attacked government proposals to ban consumer advertising of the product as a 'scandal' which would result in tougher laws than for tobacco. The government finishes consulting on the proposed rules at the end of this week and plans to have regulations in place by June. Health officials want to see an increase in breastfeeding, which is considered better for babies. The changes also follow a European Union directive. Manufacturers in the UK are allowed to advertise to the retail trade, health professionals and mothers through promotional literature distributed by health workers. The new rules would allow advertising to health professionals only, and would be much stricter than the requirements of the EU directive. The Infant and Dietetic Foods Association, which represents the main baby milk manufacturers including Wyeth, Cow &amp; Gate and Milupa, said the milks were 'a perfectly legal food but they are attempting to impose more restrictions on us than on tobacco'. The Advertising Association, which represents advertisers, said yesterday that the ban was 'illogical, inappropriate and unnecessary'.</p>

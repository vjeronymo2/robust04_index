			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Czech Republic Criticizes Mock"] </F>   [Text] Prague -- The planned award of the "European  Charles IV Prize" of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft to  Foreign Minister Alois Mock, Mock's interview on Sudeten German  issues as well as the invitation for Czech politicians to attend  the 45th Sudeten German congress in Nuremberg have given rise to  harsh criticism in Prague.    By awarding the "European Charles IV Prize," which is not  identical with the Charlemagne Prize awarded in Aachen, the  Landsmannschaft next Saturday [21 May] wants to pay tribute to  Mock's intensive work for "a just order of people and states in  Central Europe."    On Tuesday, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus expressed surprise  about the fact that the prize will be awarded to Mock. He said  in a radio interview that he does not believe this is an  Austrian initiative.    An article by Mock in the latest edition of the weekly  SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the organ of the Landsmannschaft, has  also caused some excitement recently, since the foreign minister  came out in favor of establishing a dialogue between the  Landsmannschaft and the Czech Republic.  <H5>  The Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Distances </H5> Itself    Mock's "shoulder-to-shoulder stance" with the leadership of  the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft is not only an affront to the  Czech Republic but also to the coalition's good neighbor policy,  SPOe International Secretary Karl Schramek said.    Mock reacted to the storm of criticism by saying that he  will  continue to advocate the safeguarding of human rights and to  oppose their violation.</p>

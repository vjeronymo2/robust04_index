			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Manufacturers lift investment in innovation BRITISH manufacturers started to increase investment in innovation last year, before the latest signs of economic recovery started to emerge, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry and National Westminster Bank has found. The more encouraging picture for UK corporate spending on innovation and research and development, which companies expect will continue this year, was welcomed as further evidence of an increase in manufacturing confidence and activity. Between 1989 and 1991 companies had cut spending on innovation and R&amp;D but there was a marked upturn last year. Dr Bryan Smith, chairman of the CBI's research and innovation committee, said the survey - conducted among 425 companies in October and November last year - said the findings were consistent with evidence of improved business conditions found in other surveys. He said: 'We hope the results also reflect a fundamental recognition of the importance of innovation to companies if they are going to compete successfully in increasingly tough world markets. 'The prospects for sustaining economic recovery in the medium term hinge on the competitiveness of manufacturing industry and its ability to develop new products and processes. That is what makes these results so encouraging.' Although the survey showed a significant balance among companies reporting increases in capital investment to support innovation last year, most did not expect spending to rise substantially this year. Most non-manufacturing companies expected to reduce innovation investment. Innovation Trends. CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford St, London WC1A 1DU. Pounds 20 CBI members, Pounds 40 non-members.</p>

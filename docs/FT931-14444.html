			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Damage goes on display in Baghdad IRAQ was at pains yesterday to show the world the civilian damage inflicted by the allied missile attack on Baghdad two years to the day since the beginning of the Gulf war, with President Saddam Hussein visiting the injured in hospital. But his propaganda machine left the main point of interest and the reason of Sunday's attack a mystery. Three sites hit by missiles have been confirmed: the lobby of the Rashid hotel in Baghdad was badly damaged, a house in the suburb of Karada was half-demolished and a factory in Zafaraniya, 10 miles south of Baghdad and the announced target of the allied attack, was hit. Western journalists, despite being escorted to the two civilian sites, were denied access to the factory at Zafaraniya. Described as a nuclear site by the allies and a facility for manufacturing industrial equipment by the Iraqis, an army official prevented an organised Ministry of Information tour of the site, despite the fact it had been viewed by some journalists immediately after the bombing. 'Yesterday was one day, today is another, he said. The government took advantage of the high-profile Rashid bombing by holding a funeral for the two people who were killed in the hotel. Escorted by a ceremonial army brass band, a large group of dignitaries, hotel staff and mourning relatives, the coffins of Ameriha Toma, a receptionist at the hotel, and a female guest were marched to a burial site to the accompaniment of a funeral dirge. Soon afterwards, more than 1,000 delegates at the Sixth Islamic Conference, who were removed to another hotel after the bombing last night, descended on the hotel to conduct the day's proceedings, and Rashid staff attempted to convey a sense of business as usual. It was the same all over Baghdad. Iraq has been under seige in military and economic terms almost continually since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980; coping in tragic circumstances has become a way of life. However, a sense of despair was apparent after Sunday's attack, and disbelief that the capital was once again under fire from the allies. At the Karada site, where one woman was killed and her two daughters injured when their house was hit by a missile, Dr Mohammad Dowee, a military doctor and neighbour whose three daughters were injured by shattering glass, accused the allies of not caring about Iraqi civilians. 'If people (in the west) saw the exact picture, they wouldn't agree with what happened here. Killing ordinary Iraqis will not help enforce their demands,' he said.</p>

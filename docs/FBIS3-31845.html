			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Why Does Virgil Magureanu Keep </F> Silent?"]    [Text] I think that everyone has been able to note that  Virgil is silent. Some might respond to such a statement by  saying that it is precisely the duty of a man like Virgil  Magureanu to keep silent. He is the director of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI]. In this position, it is not only  his duty, but also a priority to be as discreet as possible in  the area of our public activity. In this respect, Virgil  Magureanu is an exception to the rule. For a long time, he was  a true star of present-day Romania: Statements in the press and  on television, long conversations in magazines and on various  wavelengths, more or less flattering photographs, and televised  talk shows. Lately, however, Virgil Magureanu has no longer  displayed the same self-possession in public. He no longer  gives so many interviews or news conferences, and especially, no  longer makes public appearances. From the difference between  his former and current conduct, we may draw the conclusion that  Virgil Magureanu keeps quiet.    In [writer] Marin Preda's "Delirium" there is an extremely  interesting scene. It takes place during the night of the Iron-  Guard uprising. Horia Sima's supporters are destroying stores,  setting fire to houses in which Jews live, and attacking  soldiers. Bucharest is reverberating with gunfire. There is  tension in the streets. Gathered in a room, a few figures in  this novel ask themselves with concern: Why is the general  keeping silent? The general being, of course, Romania's future  Marshal Ion Antonescu [wartime military dictator]. Many strange  things are happening in our country these days. A number of  people belonging to the executive power have been accused of  espionage for a foreign country. The minister of defense,  Niculae Spiroiu, one of the most fervent advocates of army  modernization and integration in North- Atlantic structures, has  been accused of corruption. The campaign against him is based  on information that is believed to have come from the Romanian  Intelligence Service. The son of General Marin Pancea,  secretary of the Supreme Defense Council and presidential  adviser, has been accused of being involved in dishonest deals.  One of his partners, Radu Popa, was crudely arrested. Iosif  Boda, the presidential adviser most convinced of the need for  dialogue with the opposition and Romania's orientation to the  West, is to leave for Switzerland as ambassador. True, the  country is thus gaining an intelligent representative abroad.  It loses, however, because the group of reformers around Ion  Iliescu is weakened, while the conservative group represented by  Marin Pancea and Vasile Ionel triumphs. Although it is clear to  everyone that this will harm Romania's image abroad,  negotiations are conducted to create a nationalist-communist  government, the government of the so-called Red Pentagon. On  his return from Washington, Petre Roman said the State  Department would not like such a shift to the left. The leaders  of the Red Pentagon, mainly Adrian Nastase, wince and say the  Americans did not broach the subject. These are strange things.  They do not, however, match the strangeness of those during the  Iron-Guard uprising. Virgil Magureanu is not Ion Antonescu  either. Nevertheless, keeping a sense of proportion, we can copy  the characters in "The Delirium" and ask: Why does Virgil  Magureanu keep silent? There is, however, a connection between  Ion Antonescu and the strange things during the night of the  Iron-Guard actions. The order in the country depends on the  leader of the state. It was normal for simple citizens to ask  themselves why the general keeps silent. In this respect, one  could argue that there is no connection between the strange  things of late and Virgil Magureanu. And that, thus we cannot  ask, as in Ion Antonescu's case, why the SRI director keeps  silent? Close study, however, shows that this argument is  unjustifiable. The strange things these days are closely linked  to Virgil Magureanu. Not only because he could clarify the  enigma of them, but also because they began to happen exactly  when Virgil Magureanu fell silent. There have been so many  strange things since the SRI director withdrew from the public  scene that we would risk nothing by asking another question: Do  they not happen, by any chance, just because Virgil Magureanu  keeps silent?</p>

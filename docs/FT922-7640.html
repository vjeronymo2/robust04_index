			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Kohl agrees more power for Lander CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday agreed in principle to rewrite the German constitution to give the 16 German states much wider powers to control any future transfer of sovereignty to the European Community. The potentially sweeping agreement was outlined at negotiations in Bonn between the chancellor and the state prime ministers, as a precondition for their ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union. Senior officials are fearful the deal - not yet finalised - will severely restrict Germany's room for manoeuvre to negotiate with its EC partners. It means in future any transfer of sovereignty to Brussels must be approved by two-thirds majorities in both chambers of the German parliament, including the Bundesrat, representing the states. The deal proposed by the states would not be simply restricted to those responsibilities which already belong to the 16 states - such as education, police or tourism - but extend to any area of European political union, such as defence and foreign policy. The new article in the constitution to be drafted in the coming weeks will set a 'united Europe' or 'United States of Europe' as a formal goal of the German state, provided it is compatible with the principles underlying the German constitution, democracy, federalism, rule of law, and social justice.</p>

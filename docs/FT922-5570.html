			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: BankAmerica to close 82 branches BANKAMERICA Corporation is to close 82 branches in four states as it begins to consolidate its own branches with those of Security Pacific Corporation, with which it merged in April, an official for the bank said in Los Angeles yesterday. He said BankAmerica had notified customers that it would close 21 branches in Arizona, 32 in Washington, 22 in Oregon and 7 in Nevada. The official would not comment on how many branches BankAmerica would close in California, although some analysts have estimated the number at 300. The Dollars 4bn merger of the two banks, both west coast-based, was the biggest takeover in US banking history. BankAmerica's chairman, Mr Richard Rosenberg, said recently that BankAmerica would not begin the consolidation process in California until September. As part of the merger, BankAmerica had been required to divest 220 branches in four states.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry  rejected the claim that Tehran supports one side of the conflict  in Yemen and is dispatching military assistance to that country.  He stated: From the start of the conflict the Islamic Republic  of Iran clearly expressed its regret over the outbreak of the  war and expressed its concern about the possible separation of  the Muslim brothers in Yemen. He added: By adopting a neutral  stance Iran has announced its readiness to mediate.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed: Iran is in favor of  Yemen's unity and resolving the existing disputes through  peaceful means, bearing in mind the national interests of the  people of Yemen.</p>

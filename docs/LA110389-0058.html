			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER QUAKE RELIEF TAX ASKED;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE: LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY FAR MORE THAN A QUARTER-CENT INCREASE IS  NEEDED. THE GOVERNOR CONTENDS THAT, ALONG WITH RESERVE FUNDS, IT WILL BE  ENOUGH.  </P> <P> The Legislature convened in special session Thursday to act on an earthquake  relief package and was immediately confronted with requests from local  officials to raise the sales tax more than the quarter-cent being proposed by  Gov. George Deukmejian and key lawmakers.  </P> <P> The local officials got no encouragement from either Deukmejian or legislative  leaders.  </P> <P> City and county officials said non-highway damage alone in Northern California  communities hit by the Oct. 17 earthquake will total $6 billion, about $1  billion more than estimates by the state Office of Emergency Services.  </P> <P> The proposed quarter-cent tax increase in the 6-cents-per-dollar state sales  tax would be in effect for 13 months beginning Dec. 1. It would raise an  estimated $800 million. Deukmejian contends that the quarter-cent increase,  along with hundreds of millions more from reserves, will be enough to finance  the state's share of earthquake costs. President Bush has signed a  $3.45-billion disaster relief bill, most of which will come to California.  </P> <P> But local officials, with support from some lawmakers, claimed that far more  money will be needed to put the San Francisco Bay Area and the Santa  Cruz-Hollister regions back on their feet.  </P> <P> "The answer to the question is not a quarter-cent sales tax increase for 13  months," Santa Cruz County Supervisor Fred Keeley told members of the Assembly,  who met as a committee of the whole. "If you agree to that, you are agreeing to  sentencing them (earthquake victims) to a continuing disaster. We are proposing  a one-cent sales tax increase. And it is penny-wise and pound-foolish not to do  that."  </P> <P> Earlier, Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata told reporters that earthquake  damage in his county alone will total $2 billion. "We are going to need a whole  lot more than $800 million," he said.  </P> <P> Keeley, Perata and other city and county officials spent the day in an intense  lobbying effort to get more financial aid for earthquake-stricken areas. They  want a total of $2.7 billion in state aid alone, not counting federal disaster  relief.  </P> <P> In a written statement to the Legislature, Deukmejian conceded that the tax  increase itself would not be enough to finance all the repairs and financial  aid that will be needed. He said extra costs will be "almost certainly incurred  as damage reports are updated and completed." He explained that other money for  earthquake relief will come from the state's budget reserve. The nonpartisan  Commission on State Finance has said that the reserve now contains $674  million.  </P> <P> The Republican governor was in Los Angeles to attend a black-tie arts awards  ceremony Thursday night. He is expected back in Sacramento at noon today.  </P> <P> Deukmejian Chief of Staff Michael R. Frost told a delegation of local officials  Thursday that a quarter-cent sales tax increase would be sufficient. Frost said  anything more would put the state over the restrictive spending limit approved  by voters in 1979 and run into other political problems.  </P> <P> His assessment was backed up by both Democratic and Republican legislators.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Opposition  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said those who have asked for  more money have yet to prove it is needed. "The governor has done his homework.  He has come forward with a figure. He has matched that figure with a  revenue-raising figure. The speculators ought to produce or shut up," Brown  said.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said one of the  considerations in proposing the relatively modest quarter-cent increase was  that it would not be large enough to endanger the proposed gasoline tax  increase that voters will be asked to approve next June to finance a 10-year,  $18.5-billion transportation program.  </P> <P> "I don't think we should do anything to jeopardize its passage," Roberti told  members of the Senate at the start of the special session.  </P> <P> Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville), the GOP vice chairman of the  Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said he was not convinced that even a modest  sales tax increase is needed.  </P> <P> "We want to do all that needs to be done," he said, "but we don't know how much  money is necessary."  </P> <P> Finance Director Jesse R. Huff told the Assembly that he expects the state  responsibility for matching federal assistance to come to about $855 million.  Tax relief associated with the quake should total another $150 million at  least, he said.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) accused the Administration  of planning to shift funds from health and social service programs to  earthquake relief even as it was saying that the sales tax increase will be  sufficient to cover the damages.  </P> <P> Speier released a Health Services Department internal memo that listed about  $20 million in programs that she said were being put on hold by Administration  officials. The programs ranged from AIDS prevention and prenatal care to  pesticide regulation.  </P> <P> "I don't think we want to hold the rest of the budget hostage to deal with the  earthquake," she said.  </P> <P> Huff conceded that he favors delaying expansion of some social programs and  redirecting the money toward earthquake relief. But he emphasized that the  Administration is still debating the question. "No decisions are final until  the governor makes them final," he said.  </P> <P> Several Assembly Democrats complained that the quarter-cent tax increase is too  low. Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee, described the governor's plan as "cheap and chicken."  </P> <P> In the Senate, Sen. Nicholas Petris (D-Oakland) said the quarter-cent increase  "is far too low. We ought to at least go to half a cent."  </P> <P> But even as some Democrats were pushing for more funds, Assemblyman Tom  McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) proposed that the state freeze increases in  spending for the first 12 weeks of the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.  He said this move would produce a saving of $800 million, equivalent to the  amount that would be collected by the proposed sales tax increase.  </P> <P> On top of the proposed tax increase, Deukmejian is asking the Legislature to  approve a package of 11 bills.  </P> <P> The governor is asking for both the money and legal authority to finance the  state's share of repairs to highways, roads, bridges and buildings. He also  wants legislation that will make nonprofit agencies and higher education  facilities eligible for state matching funds.  </P> <P> Another proposal is for the state to "ease the financial burden facing local  government" by picking up their costs of repairing roads, highways and public  buildings.  </P> <P> Included in the package are proposals for low-interest loans for homeowners who  suffered damage in the quake and a plan to provide temporary housing to  displaced renters and homeowners.  </P> <P> Also on the table is a proposal to provide cash grants of up to $10,000 each  "to those disaster victims in the greatest need," and a request for the legal  authority necessary to put highway and freeway repair work on the "fast track"  by exempting contractors from certain government permit requirements.  </P> <P> Additionally, Deukmejian said he wants the Legislature to approve a special  damage compensation fund for victims of the earthquake who were killed or  injured in the collapse of a stretch of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.  </P> <P> Lawmakers also came up with many of their own proposals.  </P> <P> About three dozen earthquake-related bills were introduced in the Senate alone.  Many of the bills would add to the financial aid package proposed by the  governor. One of the bills, drafted by Roberti, would make it a felony to do  earthquake repair jobs while acting as an unlicensed contractor, architect or  structural engineer.  </P> <P> The special session is expected to last until Saturday. Two years ago, the  Legislature met in similar extraordinary session, also in November, to approve  a $91-million package of benefits to aid victims of the Southern California  earthquake. Many of the bills are redrafted versions of the legislation passed  two years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> When California lawmakers left the Capitol in September, they did not  anticipate returning until January, when the legislative session was scheduled  to resume. However, Gov. George Deukmejian called the legislators back to  Sacramento this week to find ways to pay for destruction left by the Oct. 17  earthquake that shook Northern California.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Carl Ingram and Jerry Gillam contributed to this story.  </P> <P> NIMITZ STUDY -- A seismic study checked roadbeds, not columns, of Nimitz.

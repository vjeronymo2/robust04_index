He is one of the Arab world's most respected diplomats. In 1989 he brokered the Taif agreement that brought a measure of peace to Lebanon. His departure late on Wednesday underlines the prime minister's desire for unchallenged authority and his unwillingness to allow even a long-standing political friend any great authority over his own department.

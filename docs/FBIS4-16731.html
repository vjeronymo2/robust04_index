			<p>BFN     [Text] CONTACT news agency has supplied us with information  from the press service of the Georgian cabinet of ministers that  an Armenian Government delegation arrived today on a working  visit in Tbilisi. The delegation is led by Armenian State  Minister Gagik Martirosyan. The delegation was met at the  airport by Deputy Prime Minister Irakli Menagharishvili.    A meting was held at the cabinet of ministers where the  issues of securing the railways, oil and natural gas supplies,  and the situation in trade and economy were discussed.    The Armenian delegation expressed its discontent over  Saknavtobprodukti [Georgian oil products]. It was noted that in  an immediate future, a north Caucasus-Transcaucasus gas pipeline  would soon be put in operation, which would enhance gas supplies  two-fold both to Georgia and Armenia. Martirosyan said that a  group of the Armenian Government delegation had left for Batumi  to monitor the transportation of cargo and humanitarian aid  destined for Armenia.    The members of the Armenian Government delegation will  continue work in the appropriate ministries and departments.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Uchida's Schubert and Schoenberg Programming those two great Viennese composers Schubert and Schoenberg together, which might have seemed an odd thing to do, at best a worthy ruse for securing listeners to the modernist, actually felt inevitable and right in the first, last Thursday, of Mitsuko Uchida's three such piano recitals at Queen Elizabeth Hall. A more antithetical pair it would be hard, in many respects, to name. Whereas Schubert's music, particularly in his piano sonatas - of which Uchida is giving six - is renowned for its generous spread of events, its sublime spaciousness, profound repetitiousness, what Schumann (thinking of the ninth symphony) called its 'heavenly length', Schoenberg's music is always crammed with incident, intensely compressed - never more so than in the Six Little Piano Pieces, Op. 19, which we heard - but nonetheless bursting at every seam, avoiding repetition and anything much like ease. On the other hand, the two composers are involved in the same classical tradition and concerned with resolving essentially the same problems of form and content. Extremes of brevity and length look suspiciously like different sides of the same coin, and so it proved in Uchida's fabulously sensitive and accomplished projection of both their idioms. I have seldom if ever heard such wonderful Schubert playing as in her account of the two movements he completed of the so-called Reliquie sonata in C major D840. To the 'late', even other-worldly manner of the writing here she brought a wise serenity, a limpid lyrical poise which did not exclude some briefly feral climaxes, but contained them, indeed, with perfect shapeliness. Her spacious ease - the first movement's Moderato tempo was beautifully judged - never lacked for interest and dramatic surprise; and how subtly and poignantly she voiced that curiously dissonant chord that recurs in the first movement and that no less jolting turn of the harmony that is a feature of the C minor Andante. Such moments of 'advanced' harmony made a satisfying and instructive link to the next item, Schoenberg's Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11, for which a free-floating harmony provides the structural and expressive base. Uchida showed how glintingly lyrical the music can be, how richly it invites plasticity of phrasing, how full it is of dynamic nuance, in short, how close to her Schubert - an impression clinched by her again feral way with the furious outbursts of the third piece. The fast fourth, very tiny, of the Six Little Pieces was despatched with pure savagery, but the strange chords of the static sixth had the eerie expressionistic glow of a painting by Kandinsky or Schoenberg himself. The return to Schubert was exhilarating and moving, and if Uchida's reading of the C minor sonata D958 did not, for me, have the perfected intensity of her earlier sonata, there was no disputing the hefty grandeur of its outer movements or the meditative, lyrical warmth of the Adagio. The series promises to be superb.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Alcatel stands by Guichet The board of Alcatel CIT, the French telecoms equipment company, yesterday refused to accept the resignation of its chairman, Mr Pierre Guichet, who has been detained in prison by a magistrate investigating alleged overbilling of France Telecom, one of the company's biggest clients. Mr Guichet, who was imprisoned on Monday evening, had tendered his resignation to avoid damage to the company's relations with France Telecom. But the board, which said it was shocked by the detention order, rejected the move in a show of support for Mr Guichet. A spokesman for Alcatel described Mr Guichet's detention as completely unjustified and said the investigation would prove his innocence. A company official indicated, however, that the chairman's request to step down could be considered by a future board meeting when Mr Guichet is able to participate. Mr Guichet's detention in a prison to the south of Paris pushed shares in Alcatel Alsthom, the parent company of Alcatel CIT, down by more than 2 per cent to FFr411. They later recovered some of their losses, but remain more than 50 per cent below their January level. Industry analysts said that shares would remain vulnerable as a result of the continuing corruption investigations. 'The group is very much in the magistrates' sights,' said one electronics analyst at a French securities company. He added that investors had also been unsettled by the damage to relations with France Telecom.</p>

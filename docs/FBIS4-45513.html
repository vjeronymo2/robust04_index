While the government is willing to invest about $21 million  in alternative development as the coca surplus is being  eradicated, Quiroga revealed that the coca leaders are visiting  the settlements of Carrasco Province in the Cochabamba  Department to convince the growers not to eradicate coca.    Quiroga announced that to correct this situation, the  government will do "something" to lower the price of coca.    He said: "If we don't get the price of coca produced for  drug trafficking to drop, the policy of voluntary eradication  will fail."    According to the minister, the only reason coca is well paid  by drug traffickers is because there is no adequate control  system for marketing coca.    This has been proven by the government, which is sure that  when the main coca market in Sacaba operates without control the  price of coca increases some 20 to 25 percent.    "As soon as the Sacaba market is put under control, the  price  tends to drop," said Quiroga, who indicated that coca prices  will drop if the five coca markets are kept under control.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / LWT forecast strengthens defence London Weekend Television yesterday unveiled the heart of its defence against the hostile takeover bid by the Granada group - a pre-tax profit estimate of Pounds 43.8m for 1993. The better-than-expected figure representing a 43 per cent increase on 1992 was backed up by pro forma earnings per share of 28.4p, a rise of 50.3 per cent. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), promised that growth would continue - the company has increased its pre-tax profits from Pounds 16.2m in 1990. 'Television is a good business and that's why Gerry Robinson (the Granada chief executive) wants to get into it,' Sir Christopher said. 'They are a recovery stock, they are a conglomerate and they are a highly geared business.' Sir Christopher likened Granada to a heavyweight boxer. 'But all the weight is round the belt and round the bum,' he said. Granada, poured scorn on 'another unconvincing document which fails to rebut the value and logic of Granada's offer'. But the profit estimates, including an increase in trading margins from 17.9 per cent to 28.2 per cent - nearly 40 per cent in the case of the LWT Broadcasting - increased pressure on Granada to improve its offer. Granada, which has interests ranging from television and rental to leisure, industrial catering and computer services, will tomorrow extend its deadline for acceptances to February 4, the last possible date. The terms presently stand at six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares, valuing LWT at around Pounds 700m with a 528p cash alternative. Mr Neil Blackley, analyst at stockbrokers Goldman Sachs, said the LWT estimate was good. 'I think it really puts the ball into Granada's court. They have got to increase their offer,' he said. Granada is thought to be considering improving two aspects of the deal - paying a final dividend to LWT shareholders and increasing the cash alternative. Yesterday Granada closed at 572p, down 8p, with LWT down 2p at 673p. LWT, which tried and failed to set up a tactical takeover with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, has not ruled out the possibility of another deal. However, yesterday Granada asked if LWT had bid enough to compete in the new deregulated ITV, why had it entered discussions with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. 'The fact is that LWT has acknowledged the need for scale, but its own strategy for achieving it has failed,' Mr Robinson said. Lex, Page 26</p>

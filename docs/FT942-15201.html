			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Hard to make a sum of the parts: Jurek Martin asks whether Clinton has an overall strategy for foreign policy The very senior White House official was in a reflective mood this week. Of course the US had 'clear strategic goals' for foreign policy - and he ticked them off as any good adviser should  - but he conceded this was a whole new world, lacking any 'existential' threat. 'We really are making case law as we go along, setting precedents'. Even the most intractable peacekeeping problems, in nations tearing themselves apart, had to be seen not in isolation but as components of a whole. A document under preparation, known as Presidential Directive 13, would make the connections, he said. There has rarely been a trickier time to define the whole than now. In the last week alone President Bill Clinton's foreign policy plate has been piled ever higher with disparate courses  - Bosnia, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, China, Japan, Rwanda, Haiti, even the accidental shooting down of US helicopters by US jets over Iraq  - each commanding attention but all demanding apparently different responses. It is a menu which could test the limits of coherence. It also tests a president whose background and passions are not in foreign affairs. As public opinion polls consistently show, this does not render his country uncomfortable, though it distresses the foreign policy establishment. Les Gelb, one of its pillars both as a former New York Times columnist and now as head of the private Council on Foreign Relations, sniffed in a recent article that the country might be 'content', but there were 'smouldering concerns' among the 'experts and pundits' which he pleaded with Mr Clinton to address by providing a strategic vision of US leadership. The Gelb hypothesis, allied to the drumbeat of attacks on individual members of the president's foreign policy team, has been a constant refrain for a year. One well-known Harvard professor last month began a lecture on 'Clinton's foreign policy' with the words: 'This may be the shortest seminar on record.' Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, was pilloried for having been 'humiliated' yet again, this time by the Chinese crackdown on dissidents when he was in Beijing last month. William Perry, the new secretary of defence, took some hits for saying he could not conceive of a military intervention in Gorazde, a week before US Nato jets bombed Bosnian Serb emplacements. The administration mostly responds by restating a handful of its fundamentals, especially the linkage of domestic and foreign policy, by putting economics in the front rank of diplomacy. This approach is not trouble-free, with many of the US's leading trading partners suspicious of any lapse into mercantilism, a charge that US officials dismiss as nonsense. But the president's last big foreign policy speech was in Brussels in January and it was aimed at Europeans, not Americans. Anthony Lake, national security adviser, did speak with precision about Bosnia 10 days ago and so did Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce, on China policy in a carefully vetted speech supporting the Christopher line last Monday. Yet mostly there is an inclination not to mix it on the opinion pages but to get on with business at hand. The view from the inside, culled from a series of interviews with unidentifiable administration officials this week, does in fact look different, even allowing for the inevitable spin. But the broad message is also endorsed by one influential western ambassador, who argues that the president and his men are now getting their foreign policy act together better. Each item on the long laundry list of issues, however, has the potential for becoming seriously soiled again. None is more immediately caught in the wringer than China  - 'in a jumpy mood', according to one official  - with Mr Clinton's own deadline for the renewal of most favoured nation (MFN) trading status less than two months off. Contrary to much speculation that the US is looking for a way off the hook of the president's insistence that China improve its human rights policy in order to retain trade benefits, the current Washington word is deliberately different. 'Whatever you think about linkage,' said one official, 'there is an executive order of the president, which is a commitment.' Sanctions falling short of cancelling MFN present legal and practical problems, said another, 'though it may not be harmful to have the Chinese know that there are intermediate options'. There was nothing by way of concession in Mr Garten's speech, even though he represents the government department most sensitive to US business interests. Speaking in the presence of China's trade minister, he stated: 'It must be said that bonds between China and the US are not based solely on commercial considerations.' But the official who found China 'jumpy' detected 'no spillover' from MFN into Beijing's willingness to help solve the problem of North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The US has little idea exactly what China is doing to put pressure on Pyongyang, but 'it is a clear question of Chinese self-interest  - they want North Korea to be reasonable and they want us to be patient' by not demanding UN sanctions. In fact the UN and International Atomic Energy Agency clocks are ticking, with the Security Council due to consider North Korea again next month. Still, officials insist the US will do nothing hasty, offsetting the stick of sanctions with the carrot of a third round of bilateral negotiations. Though its messages change almost daily, the latest from Kim Il-Sung's redoubt at least emphasised jaw not war. A similar qualified optimism even applies to Russia  - and not only because Moscow's adverse reaction this week to the Nato air strikes on Bosnian Serbs was considered modest. An administration specialist on the Russian economy suspects Vik-tor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is 'beginning to hold it together' economically and politically. He has been bolstered by the Dollars 1.5bn IMF credit and by private telephoned consultation with US vice-president Al Gore. Mr Chernomyrdin's political position in the centre, on this view, keeps the old communists from collaborating with Vladimir Zhirinovsky's nationalists more effectively than would a purely reform-ist government. The official also denies any disarray in administration policies towards Russia, which seemed to be reflected in a far harder line on economic reform by the Treasury than by the state department, specifically by Strobe Talbott, the Russian expert and now deputy secretary. 'Strobe may have been too cute by half' with his 'less shock, more therapy' pronouncement last December, but reports of policy differences were 'so overblown'. Through the mediation of Vitaly Churkin, its special envoy, Russia is still being helpful on Bosnia, but the US approach is to a degree at the mercy of daily circumstances, highlighted in a week which began with Nato air strikes and ended on a mixed note. Mr Churkin's efforts to get the Bosnian Serbs back to negotiations offered hope if endorsed by Moscow, but some UN peacekeepers were held quasi-hostage, Sarajevo came under sniper fire again and hostilities threatened to break out in other Moslem enclaves. But at least Mr Lake, in a speech last week, sought to provide some underlying guidance on when the US might intervene and how. 'Direct threats to our nation or our people require us to be prepared for a unilateral military response. Iraq's attempted assassination of President Bush fell into this category and we did not hesitate to respond on our own. 'A second category justifies only a limited use of force and generally under international auspices. Peacekeeping would generally fall under this category. A third category may require our strong diplomatic engagement but not the deployment of our forces.' Mr Lake's formulation does not answer every question. The administration has already imposed tight conditions on the dispatch of any US peacekeeping contingent to Bosnia (in his second category) and, even if they are met, no troops would leave without some form of approval from Congress. The senior White House official drew lessons from congressional endorsement ahead of the Gulf war. 'I'm not say ing that, in legal or constitutional terms, we have to have congressional support, . . . but the Gulf model is very much in the mind of congressional leaders who are now more open to the idea of Bosnian involvement than before.' Such an assertion may be debated. The Gorazde air strikes were welcomed by some long-standing critics of US Bosnian policy, such as the New York Times. But they also brought a welter of contradictory warnings about being too little to make a difference (from Laurence Eagleburger, former secretary of state and long sceptical of intervention) and about slippery slopes (mostly from isolationists on both left and right). Pictures of the slaughter in Rwanda and the accident in Iraq also do nothing for the cause of humanitarian intervention. It is also far from clear how the Lake formula on US intervention would be applied to Haiti, which is rapidly moving again to the front burner of foreign policy problems. The pressure on the administration to 'do something' about the military regime in Port-au-Prince escalated this week in the face of growing evidence of atrocities. Randall Robinson, respected head of the Transafrica Forum, a Washington lobby, started a hunger strike by accusing the president of moral bankruptcy. Congressman David Obey from Wisconsin, no gung-ho firebrand, demanded that the US invade Haiti to restore democracy. All this is not coming from the foreign policy ivory towers but from Mr Clinton's friends, which hurts. It is also coming from states such as Florida, which this week sued the federal government to recover some of the costs it has born in sustaining hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, many from Haiti. This administration says that it always listens to domestic voices on foreign policy  - Mr Clinton certainly did to the Greek lobby protesting at US recognition of Macedonia. Applying a grand policy vision to all the above, not to mention Japan's political dramas, would be a tall order. But at least Mr Clinton and his team might be consoled by the fact that the grand old man of US diplomacy does not think it necessary. George Kennan, the diplomat-scholar, reflected at a 90th birthday party recently on what advice long-dead great statesmen might give the current generation grappling with an array of problems. 'Each has to be judged on its merit. Discard, then, this traditional American fondness for trying to solve problems by putting them into broad categories. What you need are not policies  - much less a single policy. What you need are sound principles . . . that accord with the nature, the needs, the interests and the limitations of our country.' Good advice, but easier said than done.</p>

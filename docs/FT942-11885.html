			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Sri Lanka economy ahead by 6.9% Sri Lanka's economy grew 6.9 per cent last year, despite the turmoil caused by the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa and the continuing civil war in the north, an official report released this week says. The country saw the highest growth rate since 1978, the report published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka shows. Growth was fuelled mainly by a recovery in agriculture and a 24 per cent increase in investment. The report comes amid mounting concern about prospects for this year. The ruling United National party, preparing for presidential elections in late 1994 and a general election early next year, suffered its first serious defeat in 17 years in provincial polls earlier this year. Reacting to criticism from within his party, President DB Wijetunga has launched a populist programme of tax cuts and hand-outs which could strain the government's resources. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Freedom party, the main opposition, has been gathering support at rallies, notably a May Day rally attended by 200,000 in Colombo. The Colombo Stock Exchange's all-share index, which rose 62 per cent last year, has fallen rapidly this year, with further sharp falls this week. The all-share index lost 48.24 yesterday, falling to 1,002.61 for a two-day loss of 8.7 per cent. The report says the inflow of foreign capital soared 47 per cent to SDR490m (Pounds 466.97m), taking accumulated foreign assets to SDR1.5bn in December 1993, as foreign fund managers poured money into the Colombo Stock Exchange. Foreign direct investment picked up, notably in Colombo property. Remittances from Sri Lankans working overseas rose 17 per cent to SDR454m. Exports were SDR2.1bn and imports SDR2.9bn. Inflation rose slightly to 11.7 per cent, due partly to higher defence costs in the north.</p>

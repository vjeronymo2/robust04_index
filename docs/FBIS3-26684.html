			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From David Healy in London] </F>   [Text] China has launched a fresh attack on Britain with a  tough new warning designed to dispel any doubts it will  dismantle all Hong Kong's political structures in 1997. The  message came in a last-minute letter from China's London  ambassador, Ma Yuzhen, to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs  Committee (FAC), just as they finished taking evidence last week  in their high-profile inquiry into Sino-British relations.  Senior committee members said the letter was "political  dynamite" and "a bombshell".    Mr. Ma accuses Governor Chris Patten and other senior  British  officials of being "irresponsible and grossly misleading to the  British public and the people in Hong Kong" for saying Beijing  may not carry out its threats "for fear of international  pressure." He also claimed China made major concessions during  the 17 rounds of political reform talks in Beijing and agreement  was "almost in sight" when Britain unilaterally terminated the  negotiations.    Mr. Ma's letter is seen as a last-ditch attempt to influence  the committee's impending report, following revelations that the  all-party group intends to back Mr. Patten and his proposals to  widen the territory's democratic base. The ambassador has been  waging a behind-the-scenes campaign to undermine support for Mr.  Patten in London.    News of the letter came as China's Vice-President, Rong  Yiren, was yesterday reported to have reiterated that Beijing  will stand by its agreements with Britain over Hong Kong's  future. XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) quoted Mr. Rong as  saying whatever happens, China will adhere to the principles of  "one country, two systems" and "letting the people in Hong Kong  administer Hong Kong".    Mr. Ma says in his letter to FAC chairman David Howell he  "felt a need" for a fuller explanation on Chinese efforts to  resolve differences over Hong Kong, adding he welcomed further  opportunities to discuss them and other questions of common  interest. He also demolished suggestions by the Governor and  others that Beijing will not necessarily dismantle the  Legislative Council, Urban and Regional Councils and District  Boards in 1997.    "May I say that they [British officials] are grossly  mistaken  if they really think so," Mr. Ma says. "In the absence of an  agreement between China and Britain, China will definitely  disband and re-establish Hong Kong's three tier councils on July  1, 1997.    "Politically, China will resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong and Britain's executive power will terminate on  June 30, 1997, together with the end of British-Hong Kong  authorities' institutions.    "As a matter of course, China will re-establish Hong Kong's  three tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the  Basic Law. To say otherwise and dismiss China's justified action  as something impossible is irresponsible and misleading to the  British public and the people in Hong Kong."    Mr. Ma also accuses Mr. Patten of violating the Joint  Declaration with his call for "fair, open and acceptable"  elections.    "Another oft-repeated view consists in working for an  `arrangement for a fair and credible election in Hong Kong',"  the letter says.    "According to the proponents of this theory, this is what  the  Sino-British Joint Declaration is all about. This is a travesty  of the spirit of this important document. The central theme of  the Sino-British Joint Declaration is the resumption of and the  exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and the handover  of Hong Kong by Britain to China on July 1, 1997, as well as the  implementation of the concept of one country, two systems.    "It is totally different from the transfer of political  power  from one political party to the other in Britain. The  implementation of the concept of one country, two systems,  including the holding of elections, will take place according to  the basic law under China's sovereignty. This can in no way be  confused with what Britain is doing in haste without prior  agreement with China."    Mr. Ma concludes by claiming China made major compromises in  an effort to reach agreement during last year's political reform  talks in Beijing. "Contrary to the assertion that China only  made one concession during 17 rounds of talks, China actually  made great efforts on three questions," he says.    "Firstly, the Chinese side agreed to lower the voting age;  secondly, it accepted the British proposal for using the single  set, single vote method in the elections of the district boards  and the two municipal councils; thirdly, although the Chinese  side held different views on the abolition of appointed seats in  the local organisations, it went on to propose a solution to  accommodate the British position, i.e., Britain may go ahead  with abolishing the appointed seats in the 1994-95 elections  while after 1997 necessary adjustments may be made by the  government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the  light of relevant provisions of the Basic Law."    Mr. Ma attempts to lay the blame for the breakdown of the  talks firmly on the British. "We were completely puzzled why  the British side, while talking about time constraints, blocked  the reaching of an agreement which was almost in sight, and let  that opportunity slip by," he says. "That things should come to  such a pass is not the making of the Chinese side."</p>

Russia is putting forward quite strict terms  for this; in particular, it is ready to accept Georgia in this  zone provided Georgia refuses that part of the foreign  countries' debt which, after the disintegration of the Soviet  Union, belonged to it, and refuses foreign assets, gold mines  (if such are available or will be available in future), and  independent credit emissions.    According to the reports by the same source, Russia may also  demand that nominees for the posts of finance minister and  president of the national bank be chosen only with Russia's  participation.</p>

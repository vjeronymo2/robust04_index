			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Central Bank of Russia Chairman Viktor </F> Gerashchenko by Vladimir Katin, RIA correspondent at the EC, in  Luxembourg "last week," specially for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA;  carried under the "Finances" rubric: "Viktor Gerashchenko  Favors Giving Foreign Banks Measured Access to Russia. The  Central Bank as an Ultra-Patriot of the Russian Banking System"]    [Text] Luxembourg is home to more than 200 foreign banks  from all over the world. Billion-dollar operations take place  here every day, and the financial powers that be are frequent  guests in this city. Viktor Gerashchenko, chief of the Central  Bank of Russia, who was in Luxembourg last week, answered  questions concerning the admission of foreign banks to the  country's financial market.    [Katin] State protectionism of the banking sector in Russia  is one of the obstacles that prevent our country from forging  partnership relations with European business. This obstacle has  also long held up the conclusion of an agreement on trade  cooperation with the EC. But recently a shift has emerged in  which foreign financial institutions seem to be given  significant concessions that appear to be coming from you  personally, the Central Bank. Is this really so and what do you  think about that?    [Gerashchenko] Let us first, so to speak, take a glimpse at  the overall picture of banking activity in Russia. In my view,  the way the banking sector is currently developing is not bad,  it is even doing well. I absolutely disagree with those who say  that we already have more banks than we need. At present there  are approximately 2,100 banks in the country. Plus 600  applications to open new ones. Given that in addition they have  4,500 branches strewn over the country, it will make over 6,000  banking units. Still, I cannot say that this is enough, that the  banking system has covered all areas, has penetrated all  capillaries of society and the economy. One reason for such an  unsatisfactory -- so far -- status is the overconcentration of  banks in one place -- Moscow, which accounts for around 38-40  percent of all banks. This, however, is normal, this is a  tradition for large cities in all countries, all the more so for  capital cities.    So, the current banking system, despite its clear trend  toward evolution, toward expansion, alas, still is not fully  capable of servicing small and medium-size businesses. In  addition, national banks sometimes try to call the shots. That  is, they attach fairly tight or expensive conditions to their  loans or when carrying out one transaction or another.    Now we are faced with the need to give foreign banks access  to the Russian financial market. I would like to underline,  however, that this access should be measured. The evolution of  the entire modern banking system in the world, where each  country sooner or later arrives at this particular decision,  speaks in favor of opening national borders for foreign banks.  There was a time where the Spaniards, the Australians, or the  Dutch did not let in foreign banking capital, but in the end all  of them have changed their approach.    [Katin] What is the reason for such a shift in some  countries and such an interest in others?    [Gerashchenko] When a foreign banks appears in an unfamiliar  country that may be even unknown to its traditional customers,  it helps them, first, to invest their money in its economy in  the best possible fashion. Second, the bank helps create an  international climate in interbank cooperation. This has a  direct bearing on Russia. If we are seriously and actively to  take part in the international division of labor, to become an  inalienable part of the world economy, and to enter the world  market, we cannot do without cooperating with the banking system  on an international scale. You cannot but agree that it would  be simply ridiculous and naive to reason as follows: Yes, we  will pass a law on foreign investment and agree to give it  access to industrial production, trade, mediation services, but  it will be not allowed in the banking sector, no way! All these  things are organically intertwined, after all. Doubtless, we  should not admit all the -- excuse the phrase -- riff-raff only  to have problems with them afterward. This is precisely why we  need measured access.    [Katin] Will you please expand on this principle: How  should this formula be applied in practice?    [Gerashchenko] The situation is as follows. Under current  Russian legislation, the admission of foreign banks falls under  the jurisdiction of the Central Bank, which sets a measure or a  quota for foreign banking capital on Russia's financial market.  Recently, in accordance with our powers we made a decision that  the capital of foreign banks that will receive licenses from us  to operate in Russia may not exceed 12-15 percent of the overall  capital of national banks put together. This is one side to the  problem. Another principle of the measured access formula is  our right to select those who will be best suited to operate on  the Russian financial market. We will choose what they call the  first- class names -- the most respectable banks that can really  help their customers invest their money in the development of  the Russian economy. Let us imagine the following situation.  Say, a foreign bank has had a mission in Russia for 10-15  years, and its exposure to Russia stands at $1 billion. This is  our state foreign debt that we are for the time being unable to  repay on time and so we are negotiating its rescheduling. So  why shouldn't we allow such a bank to have its office here, in  Moscow, to do its business, its wheeling and dealing, as the  saying goes? In this case, the frozen portfolio of Russian  assets will look entirely different to the bank's shareholders.  A psychological factor will also be at work -- there will be a  rising tide of confidence.    [Katin] In your account the Central Bank of Russia's stance  appears fairly clear and convincing. What do the chiefs of the  numerous private banks that you referred to at the beginning of  our conversation think about the prospective arrival of foreign  banking capital in Russia?    [Gerashchenko] I will say this: When our commercial banks  say that giving access to foreigners amounts to selling out,  they are for the most part guided by parochial interests. They  simply do not want healthy competition, that is it. No, we do  not call for the Russian sector of commercial banks to be  stifled with help from foreigners, just the opposite, we want to  give the banking sector a boost! I want to take the opportunity  to state through NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: We, the Central Bank of  Russia, in this sense are even ultra-patriots of the development  of a serious banking system in our country. Who is crying and  protesting loudest against foreign banks? It is mostly the  small Russian banks and those who are not involved in long-term  economic development. In doing their business, they are ready  to give loans at huge rates while giving no thought at all to  what this loan will be spent on.    [Katin] I would like to hear your opinion on the  astronomical interest rates offered by some of our banks to  their customers, such as "We guarantee 1,000 percent on ruble  and hard-currency deposits!" I hope you are aware of such  advertisements, you read our press after all. What is it --  swindling?    [Gerashchenko] Yes, I read our press, and sometimes I even  watch television. I believe that these advertisements are made  by organizations that are unscrupulous or not entirely  comprehensible to me. I wonder from whom they could obtain  licenses for their activity, without which it is prohibited to  attract people's money for any operations. Only the Central  Bank or the Finance Ministry is entitled to issue such licenses.  Admittedly, we still have lots of twilight zones whose activity  is not covered by law -- that is the problem. In short, I would  not rush to an institution that offers 1,000 percent on a  deposit.    [Katin] How do you, from the standpoint of your post as the  country's chief banker, assess the ruble's health?    [Gerashchenko] In my view, our ruble is a completely healthy  currency. This can be proved, for instance, by the following  fact: Many people no longer buy foreign currency to save their  rubles from inflation, but place their money at Russian banks  precisely on ruble deposits. Yes, the ruble exchange rate is  declining, this is a normal phenomenon given the current  inflation, but it is far from a tragedy. In addition, it is  declining much more slowly than exporters, who are interested in  this decline, would like it to.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles exceeds Pounds 42m TIGHT CONTROLS on working capital helped Courtaulds Textiles boost pre-tax profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 42.2m in 1991 despite a drop in turnover to Pounds 922m from Pounds 983.8m a year earlier reflecting the toughness of trading conditions and disposals in the spinnning business. The profit increase from Pounds 40.3m in 1990 came in spite of a sharp rise in exceptional charges relating to closures of Pounds 4.7m, compared with Pounds 1.3m. 'The slight improvement in UK market conditions last autumn has not come to much,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive. 'We are not assuming that the trading environment will become more helpful to us during 1992.' Net cash inflow before financing slipped to Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 45.7m), although this was better than some analysts' expectations. It contributed to net borrowings falling to Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 74.6m) leaving gearing at the year end of 14.1 per cent (29.6 per cent). The fall in borrowings helped the interest charge fall from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 6.3m. The increased tendency for UK retailers to order shorter runs of more fashion-oriented items helped reduce working capital. Total capital employed fell to Pounds 290.6m (Pounds 329.5m) leading to the return on capital employed rising from 16.1 per cent to 18.3 per cent. A final dividend of 8.8p lifts the total by 5.7 per cent to 13p. A continued programme of plant closures in sock and lingerie manufacture, cut staff by 20 per cent. At the same time, capital spending rose to Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 22.7m). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 10.4m) covers leaving combed cotton spinning, the sale of the French acrylic spinning unit and the closure of two fabric making operations. COMMENT Courtaulds Textiles has won the confidence of the City with its effective financial management. This has been reflected in the outperformance of the shares. But can the company's resilient performance continue if the consumers of the world fail to buy more clothes? It can to some extent. There is still room for margin improvement on the manufacturing side: the profitability of the money-spinning lace business has set new targets for the rest of the company. If these are achieved, profits for 1992 could be as high as Pounds 50m. Some areas of concern remain, however. The sterling/dollar exchange rate is uncomfortably volatile and the introduction of a minimum wage, were a Labour government to be elected, could put pressure on costs. But with gearing having fallen from about 50 per cent to less than 15 per cent in two years, the company is ready to buy a solid business in Europe, perhaps spending more than Pounds 100m in the process. There might be a rights issue, but institutions would be happier with one call from Courtaulds Textiles than from just about anyone else in the sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Tokyo conference organized by the alliance in  an attempt to get money to assist communist Vietnam to continue  its aggression and occupation of Cambodia through the two-headed  government, their common puppet, was a failure.    This conference failed because:    1. No country promised to provide aid to the two-headed  government;    2. Only the United States, Japan, and Australia pledged to  provide some aid. [sentence as heard] The two-headed government  is not very hopeful that a significant amount of money is  forthcoming even from these pledges.    At the previous Tokyo conference, these countries also made  promises. In concrete terms, the money came in trickles. Many  countries and international organization at the meeting proposed  that peace and security be established first for their aid to be  efficient. These countries made this proposal not believing  that the two-headed government can carry out what they have  proposed.    1. Who can the two-headed government convince about economic  rehabilitation and Cambodia's reconstruction if its mouth talks  about national reconstruction while its hands are constantly  fueling the war of communist Vietnam?    2. How can national reconstruction take place when the  government is so corrupt? What country, apart from bad elements  in the alliance, is going to throw money into a bottomless pit?    These are the major reasons that cause the failure of the  Tokyo conference.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREATS MIGHT KEEP COLOMBIANS AT HOME  </P> <P> Colombia's soccer federation will decide after an investigation into death  threats against national team members and their families whether to send the  team to Los Angeles this month for the Marlboro Cup.  </P> <P> According to a report Tuesday by the French Press Agency, Colombian President  Virgilio Barco ordered the country's security chief, General Miguel Maza, to  investigate the threats, which were made last Thursday by a group calling  itself Purge Colombian Soccer.  </P> <P> The group warned Coach Francisco Maturana not to use players from four  professional soccer teams that are believed to have connections with drug  cartels. The majority of players on the national team have contracts with those  teams.  </P> <P> "We must get to the heart of this so the team can prepare normally for the  World Cup," Barco said.  </P> <P> Colombia is scheduled to play at the Coliseum on Feb. 20 and 22 in a tournament  with the Soviet Union, Costa Rica and a Mexican team, Chivas of Guadalajara.

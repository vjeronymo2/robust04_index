			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): London's worries re-emerge The sun shone on the London stock market in the final quarter of 1993, and a successful year was rounded off by a spectacular burst of strength over the Christmas period. In terms of total return, the FT-SE 100 Share Index, London's favoured yardstick, returned 13.3 per cent for the quarter, making 25.2 per cent for the year. Relative weakness in Japan and the US was significant, because UK equities benefited from inflows of international investment cash. US mutual funds, in particular, saw London as an attractive investment target. London's advance can be ascribed clearly to growing confidence that an era of low domestic inflation and interest rates has begun. Economic recovery, although somewhat hesitant, is perceived to have taken hold, taking the UK to 'a more advanced stage in the economic cycle than the continental European economies,' as NatWest Securities, the investment arm of the UK bank, has it. A moment of doubt was suffered in the market towards the end of November, when some analysts feared that the new chancellor might raise taxes and thus threaten economic recovery. Such fears proved premature. Tax rises have, in effect, been put off until the spring, when Social Security, VAT and mortgage tax adjustments will revive the market's old fears. Just ahead of the Budget, the stock market was also granted its base-rate cut, whereupon it immediately began to discount the next one. The outlook for the this year remains optimistic, although the exceptionally vigorous December performance has brought a cautious reaction. On the economic front, prospects are not greatly different from last year. And there are no serious political worries, because the government has plenty of time in which to recover its standing in the opinion polls. The driving force for the London market has been the huge outflow of US investment funds, which had already reached about Dollars 75bn by the end of the third quarter. Much of this went into European, but also Pacific Rim, markets. London benefited, both directly (from its share of the US funds) and indirectly (because the City is the financial channel through which many international fund flows reach continental European markets). These US outflows could well fall, or change direction, this year, if only because both Wall Street and Tokyo are likely to improve their relative performances. Also, London was briefly upset before Christmas by fears that the Federal Reserve might be obliged to push US interest rates up to curb the economic rebound. The possibility of higher, rather than lower, rates has already begun to trouble the UK. While conventional long-dated UK government bonds returned 34.4 per cent last year, index-linked gilts gave a return of 20.6 per cent, indicating that not all the fears of inflation have been laid to rest. This combination - uneasiness over inflationary pressures, and doubts about whether last year's cash inflows can be repeated - lies behind analysts' predictions for this year. Most expect further progress in the short term, with a further cut in base rates providing the encouragement. Valuations on UK equities continue to discount a great deal of optimim for economic recovery. The optimists would remind us that 'Bull markets climb a wall of worry', but others would prefer to see the next round of corporate results. Confidence in the depth of the recovery in the UK economy has still to be fully justified, and any doubts could bring a correction in share prices.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Swedes 'vital to larger EU' Enlargement of the European Union could be jeopardised if Swedes vote No in their referendum, Mr Esko Aho, Finnish prime minister, warned yesterday. His warning introduced fresh uncertainty into plans to admit Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway into the Union by January 1 1995. The Finnish premier suggested that some of the existing 12 member states might refuse to ratify the accession treaties for Austria, Finland and Norway if Sweden, which will be a net contributor to the EU budget, declined to join. The treaties must be ratified by all 12 EU member states. Polls show solid support for EU membership in Austria and Finland, though many remain undecided. In Sweden a well funded campaign coupled with an unpopular government has left the outcome of the referendum in doubt. Norwegians are seen as the most resistant to membership. The Finnish government is in the middle of difficult internal negotiations on the size of compensation to be paid to Finnish farmers who must drastically reduce their producer prices to EU levels once Finland joins the Union. The cost to the national budget is likely to be 10 billion markkaa (Dollars 1.8bn), Mr Aho said. Mr Aho's centre party is split over membership, because of its ties to the farming lobby. But behind his remarks lies a broad concern about Finland joining a future Union without Sweden, its large and wealthy neighbour. This has led to divisions within the government about the timing of the Finnish referendum. Mr Aho said he favoured holding a referendum on the same day as Sweden, that is some time after the Swedish general election in September. But president Martti Ahtisaari said he supported an early Finnish referendum before the Swedes vote. 'There is no question that our vote will have an effect on others. If we vote Yes, we can do a favour for ourselves and a service for Europe as well.'</p>

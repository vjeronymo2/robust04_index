			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Development Luis Carlos Palacios </F> by Luis Manuel Escalante; place and date not given]    [Text] On the occasion of his investiture as the new  minister of development by Gustavo Perez Mijares, Dr. Luis  Carlos Palacios announced that his ministry will immediately  turn its attention to drafting a new industrial policy.    He explained that in this process, there is no intention of  returning to the past schemes that have now become outdated,  "but neither can we allow the market to dictate everything."    He also announced that his ministry is prepared to undertake  a review of all of the integration agreements the country has  signed, with a view to improving those that can be revised, in  terms of the international relations situation, to the benefit  of Venezuela.    Minister Palacios made these points during his brief address  following the investiture ceremony and the signing of the  pertinent record of investiture by Dr. Gustavo Perez Mijares.    The outgoing minister mentioned his brief service in the  Ministry of Development, and he expressed his thanks for the  support given him by the personnel and the professionals he  called upon to work with him in what he called "this process of  transition."    He noted that the Ministry of Development is an economic  ministry, although during his short term of service he gave it  the social weight it should have. He said he is satisfied with  the work done. "I am aware that I could have done more, but time  moves on inexorably." He also admitted that he might have made  mistakes. "We are all human." But he added that "we have also  had our successes, and that is the important thing."    Following the formal ceremony, which included the swearing  in  of Dr. Werner Corrales Leal as the new director general of  development, Dr. Luis Carlos Palacios met with the group of  journalists who had attended the transition ceremony. Seated at  his new desk, he answered their questions cordially.    [Escalante] Minister Palacios, what is the nature of this  new  industrial policy you have announced?    [Palacios] It will be a policy requiring that the action of  the state be convergent with the action of the market. It should  not be presumed that the action of the state should be allowed  to disappear, in the belief that the market will govern  everything.    [Escalante] Wouldn't this be something like establishing  freedom for the market to function, while at the same time  imposing norms and controls?    [Palacios] Well, there are always norms to which adherence  is  necessary. Such exist in every institution. Markets can exist  because the institutions exist, and the economic agents must  conform to their rules and restrictions.    [Escalante] What kind of support would this new industrial  policy give the manufacturing sector, with a view to its  development?    [Palacios] You see, the main idea is to encourage growth  from  the inside out. In addition, this growth must be convergent with  all of the other factors in the economy, and, naturally, the  sectorial aspect must be taken into account. Both the industrial  policies and the specific sectorial aspects must be oriented  toward a single goal, which is the development of the country.  In this connection, industry, because of its ability to promote  and link the technological advances and innovations with the  increase in productivity, will obviously play a key role in  Venezuela.    Palacios then went on to note that Venezuela is an  oil-producing country. A large part of the national income comes  from this product, but its capacity to generate jobs stands at a  mere 1 percent in relation to the other sources of jobs. "For  this reason, we have to realize that oil is not everything."    In view of this circumstance, he warned that "any country  looking toward the 21st century must base its development on the  strengthening of its industrial sector, making use of its  comparative advantages and developing its competitive  advantages."    [Escalante] Does this growth from the inside out involve a  revision of the current customs system and the establishment of  some measures to protect certain areas?    [Palacios] While continuing to respect the international  agreements signed, we will review all of the integration  agreements, in an effort to ensure that our participation in  international trade is participation that truly promotes  development, rather than merely a naive and indiscriminate  involvement.    [Escalante] This will be done with regard to the existing  agreements with Central America and the Caribbean?    [Palacios] With all of them.    [Escalante] Including the Andean Pact?    [Palacios] Including the Andean Pact, of course.    [Escalante] What will be done where the mechanisms already  established in the country to combat antidumping measures and  subsidies are concerned?    [Palacios] All of the existing tools, and how they mesh with  the needs, will be reviewed in order to enable us to draft an  efficient industrial policy.    Minister Palacios made it clear that it is very likely that  this policy will be ready by 1995, and that "the role of the  government will be to present it to the country."    "The industrial policy we will implement will be that which  the country produces."    [Escalante] On the level of the consumer public, could this  new industrial policy mean an increase in the basic market  basket and in controlled prices?    [Palacios] In his address, President Caldera appealed for  compromise and solidarity. In economic policy, this could be  reflected in an effort to achieve a price agreement, so as to be  able to eliminate the inflationary inertia without causing  supply problems or sudden rises in prices.    [Escalante] Will there be a specific policy for small and  average industries?    [Palacios] The new industrial policy that will be presented  to the country will include special treatment for small and  average industries, as Dr. Caldera indicated in his address.    In conclusion, Luis Carlos Palacios, the new minister of  development, said that "this will also mean seeking some  convergence with the financial sector, in order to resolve the  problems of financing and reorganizing the state bodies that are  involved with this issue."</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish farmers long for free competition - Price cuts would be acceptable if they applied to everyone Mr Niels Rovsing, a large pig producer in the Danish village of Balle, complains that low pork prices are making it hard for him to make a living. But he would be happier with lower prices if everyone in the European Union experienced them. 'We need to go towards world prices, but every time we get close to them other producers scream for subsidies from their governments,' he complains. Danish producers are angry at reports that the French government has been paying out aid for its pig producers who are also suffering from EU overcapacity. The European Commission is investigating the alleged subsidies after complaints from British farmers. Pig prices are not supported by the EU, but exports outside of the union receive a refund to compensate for high internal grain prices. Mr Rovsing would like to see everyone competing on the world market, which would help to eliminate roughly 3 to 4 per cent overproduction in the EU. He reckons that about 5 per cent of Danish producers went out of business over the past two years, when pork prices dropped from Dkr13.40 (Pounds 1.36) to Dkr8.40 a kilogram. But remaining farmers are unlikely to increase their production to fill the gap. A Danish law limits stocking density so that slurry can be disposed of. If they do not have enough land, farmers they must be able to show contracts for disposal by selling the slurry to their neighbours. This rule limits the size of herds on most holdings. Mr Rovsing grows winter barley, wheat and oilseed rape on his 65 hectares of gently rolling farmland. He uses some of his grain to feed his 6,400 piglets and 280 sows which are kept indoors all year round. The number of Mr Rovsing's pigs makes him a large producer by Danish standards. Farming is intensive, but most holdings remain family concerns. Land ownership laws favour owner-occupiers and prevent large corporations from buying agricultural holdings. Mr Niels Peter Skrubbeltrang, chief adviser at the Danish Agricultural Advisory Service, believes that, although the number of farms is likely to shrink in the next 6 years, holdings will not necessarily get much larger. 'Danish farmers will not survive by getting bigger, but by making quality products and that is easier to do with smaller farms,' he says. Estimates put the number of Danish farms at 56,000 in 2000 compared with 72,000 today with the number of full-time farmers halving from 35,000. Dairy farms are likely to increase in size as technology makes it easier for farmers to deal with more animals, Mr Skrubbeltrang believes. But even the expected increase in the average number of cows from 34 to 60 by 2000 would still leave Danish dairy operations fairly small by UK standards. 'One of the big challenges for Danish farmers is to increase production with the same cost base, making them more efficient. That is the way they need to operate in the more competitive world after the Gatt agreement,' Mr Skrubbeltrang explains. Mr Jens Jakob Jakobsen, a dairy farmer with 112 cows, expects milk prices to be reduced to world levels in the next five to 10 years. He thinks Danish farmers will remain competitive as long as feed prices are lower. 'I am optimistic; I've just spent Dkr2.5m on building new barns, I expect my son to take over from me and have a future in farming,' Mr Jakobsen stresses. But his son will have to pay for Mr Jakobsen's farm at a price only slightly below the commercial value. Danish law does not allow farmers to bequeath their holdings to their offspring. This can build up large debts in the business which some farmers believe restrict their room for manoeuvre. The strong co-operative movement in Danish agriculture enables most farmers to have a marketing edge that would be lost to them alone. Farmers will be looking to the co-ops to keep carving a market for them in the new competitive world of Gatt.</p>

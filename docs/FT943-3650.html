			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Europe's top banks warned over costs of switch to Emu Large European retail banks would have to spend up to Ecu225m (Pounds 177m) each to adapt technology and operations for a single European currency, according to unpublished research carried out for the Ecu Banking Association. The association's 90 members include most large banks in Europe. In a report published yesterday, it warned that banks in countries that do not take part in the European Monetary Union will face extra costs and competitive burdens. However, its own research estimates that large banks in Emu countries may have to spend Ecu100m-Ecu150m each to adapt, and costs could be 50 per cent higher if countries keep domestic currencies in parallel for a transitional period. A working paper says 'such raw figures could of course provoke an unnecessarily alarmist reaction throughout the EU' if published. Association leaders said yesterday they wanted to emphasise Emu's opportunities. Mr Walter Damm, chairman of the EBA committee studying Emu, said it had 'wanted to avoid the impression that Emu is such a costly exercise that it is not worth the candle'. Emu is due to start by 1999 under the Maastricht treaty. Mr Damm said banks in countries such as the UK and Denmark, which have opt-out clauses from monetary union, could face disadvantages because they would lack an Ecu funding base and would have to operate in parallel currencies. The published report warns banks to prepare for the costs of transition to Emu, but says these could be 'marginal' if they are absorbed as part of continuous development of information technology. Banks' loss of revenue from foreign currency exchange, and related financial derivatives, after monetary union could be balanced by a bigger market in Ecu exchange with currencies such as the US dollar, it says. However, it adds every European bank will have to redefine its geographical spread after Emu. The Impact of Emu on Banks' Activities; Ecu Banking Association, 4, Rue de la Paix, F-75002, Paris.

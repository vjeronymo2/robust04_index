			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUGAR QUARTERBACK ROSENBACH CONSIDERS GOING PRO, FRIEND SAYS  </P> <P> A friend of Washington State's Timm Rosenbach says the star quarterback is  considering making himself eligible for the National Football League  supplemental draft in May, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> Cougar tight end Doug Wellsandt, a close friend of the 6-foot-2, 210-pound  quarterback, told the Spokesman-Review of Spokane that Rosenbach's decision  hinges on whether coach Dennis Erickson accepts the University of Miami, Fla.,  head coaching job.  </P> <P> "Yeah, we've talked about it," Wellsandt said. "We don't know if we're coming  back."  </P> <P> Rosenbach, a junior who led the nation in pass efficiency last season and is  considered a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, led the Cougars to a 9-3 record  last season.  </P> <P> Rosenbach could not be reached for comment at his campus fraternity nor was he  at his mother's home in Pullman this morning. "As far as I know, it's a rumor,"  said secondary coach Craig Bray.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev has sent a message to  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, the president's Press Center  reports.    The message points out that Bulgaria's position on the  crisis  in former Yugoslavia is a consistent and principled one.  Bulgaria opposes the direct participation of Balkan countries  and countries bordering on former Yugoslavia in eventual  military measures aimed at establishing peace in the region.    The Bulgarian president thinks that even partially lifting  the arms embargo for the fighting sides would tend to exacerbate  the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The message assesses the ultimatum of the NATO Council as  the  last and radical warning for forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina that  do not accept the UN Security Council resolution and hinder  peace negotiations.    In conclusion, President Zhelev expresses confidence that  after signing the Partnership for Peace, relations between  Bulgaria and NATO will enter a new and more sound stage that  will also positively affect relations with Turkey.</p>

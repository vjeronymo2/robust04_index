			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: Growth industry in analysing output figures Productivity figures rarely make the headlines. When they are next issued in the UK on Thursday, the figures - giving output per head - are likely to be overshadowed by the latest unemployment news published the same day. But recent official reports, pointing to strong productivity growth in UK and US manufacturing industry, have caught the attention of economists. Higher productivity is to be expected during economic recovery as orders flow in and capacity utilisation rises. But output growth per head in US and UK manufacturing industry has been particularly strong when set against the hesitant and patchy recovery in the US and the moderate growth of British production. As productivity is such an important indicator of a nation's underlying economic strength, these trends raise the question as to whether or not the present recovery is qualitatively different from earlier economic upturns. Figures last month from Britain's Department of Employment showed productivity in manufacturing was 8.2 per cent higher in the second quarter than in the same period of 1992: much faster growth than the 3.1 per cent rise in manufacturing output in the same period. The US Commerce Department reported last week that output per head in manufacturing grew by an annualised 5.2 per cent in the second quarter and by 7.7 per cent in that part of industry making durable goods: an intriguing development considering that the US administration has revised down its economic growth forecasts. Admittedly, broader measures of productivity have performed less well in both countries. The most recent UK figures show year-on-year productivity growth of 4 per cent across the whole economy in the first quarter. The US, perhaps reflecting the recent uneven nature of its recovery, reported a seasonally adjusted 1.3 per cent annualised fall in non-farm productivity in the second quarter, revised from earlier estimates of a 2.5 per cent decline. There is also no consensus among economists about the meaning of recent productivity trends. In a recent paper published by the Brookings Institution of Washington, two distinguished US scholars, George L. Perry and Charles L. Schultze, discovered a notable development in US productivity last year. They said that after six quarters of recovery, non-farm productivity in the US rebounded past previous trend growth (by 1.6 per cent at an annual rate) even though US gross domestic product had been stagnant. But, while describing this as a 'striking fact', they were unable to reach a conclusion if this marked a surprise break with established patterns. Others are less cautious. Mrs Sylvia Ostry, head of the Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto and a former chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, believes that far-reaching structural changes may be bringing the US 'close to a higher growth trajectory'. She suggests that the strong manufacturing productivity growth could reflect technological change, especially in information and communications technology, and investment by multinational corporations. These forces have transformed production methods and organisation of companies. Heavy lay-offs among US white collar workers and the exceptional increase of sales of computer equipment, which doubled between the end of 1989 and the first quarter of this year, are symptoms of this transformation which has been under way in manufacturing over the past decade, she contends. Mrs Ostry believes that the services sector is about to experience similar changes. Such changes involve costs: job losses among previously highly paid middle managers could help explain why consumption has been so weak in America. But eventually the greater productivity growth should benefit the economy and give the US a new edge over international competitors. Some City economists see echoes of the US experience in Britain. Writing in this month's Gerrard and National Monthly Economic Review, Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research and one of the chancellor's seven-man panel of independent forecasters, says UK manufacturing productivity 'is doing well, much better than would normally be expected from previous cyclical patterns'. UK companies appear to be importing state-of-the-art machinery and copying best practices abroad, while foreign companies are investing in Britain to take advantage of relatively cheap labour, he says. Two economists at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, Mr Albert Edwards and Mr David Owen, say British industry has followed the US example of investing heavily in computer equipment that will facilitate corporate restructuring. Mr Don Smith, an economist with Midland Global Markets in London, expects that increased investment as the UK economy recovers 'will introduce a vast amount of new technology into industry and commerce'. With the British labour market more flexible than at any time since the 1960s, resistance to change in working practices is at historically low levels, he says. As Prof Congdon points out, UK manufacturing productivity has been growing strongly for some years. The average annual increase was 4.8 per cent between 1979 and 1989, the highest level of any Group of Seven country. Mr Smith believes that UK productivity growth for the whole economy will hover around 2.75 per cent in the 1990s, and so be close to the very high growth rates achieved in the 1960s and the early and mid-1980s. But it needs to be. The gap in productivity between Britain and its main international competitors is so large, that 'even if UK productivity growth was consistently 1 per cent higher than other countries, it would be perhaps 15 to 20 years before the UK could catch up with France and Germany, and more than 50 years before it could catch up with the US,' he says.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Brazil's Congress in corruption row BRAZIL'S Congress has been hit by allegations of corruption which could impede work now under way on an important constitutional review and which could further undermine the body's credibility ahead of next year's elections. The allegations were made by a former government official, Mr Jose Carlos Alves dos Santos, who was responsible for the annual budget under former presidents Jose Sarney and Fernando Collor. Mr Collor resigned last year because of unrelated corruption charges. According to Mr Santos, more than 20 members of Congress, as well as acting and former government ministers, were involved in the corruption scheme, which channelled 'fees' from construction projects to members in return for having the projects cleared in the annual budget. Mr Santos, who was arrested last week after police found forged banknotes at his home and cocaine in an aircraft he had used, claims he received Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 800,000) for his role in the scheme. It is not clear Mr Santos can prove his allegations that payments were made to members, who include three acting state governors and a friend and close adviser to President Itamar Franco. Several have said they will sue Mr Santos. Late yesterday the two acting ministers said they were prepared to resign to contest the claims in court. Nevertheless, the allegations have rocked Congress and follow accusations that 'transfer fees' were paid to members who switched allegiance to a small political party earlier this month.</p>

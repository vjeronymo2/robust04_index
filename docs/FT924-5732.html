			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Refinancing planned for HunterPrint as loss grows HUNTERPRINT, the troubled specialist printer which ousted Sir Ian MacGregor as its chairman in August, has called on investors for the second time in two years to fund a rescue cash injection. The call came as the group revealed almost doubled pre-tax losses, after exceptionals, of Pounds 12.2m for the year to September 27. The group announced a Pounds 20m placing and offer to cut debt and a financial reorganisation to eliminate its onerous lease obligations dating from a Pounds 34m investment in a printing factory at Corby, Northamptonshire, in 1988. It has also agreed a Pounds 5.2m convertible preference issue to creditors and a capital reorganisation to allow the payment of dividends. Finally, new banking facilities of Pounds 14.9m have been agreed with Barclays Bank. The company yesterday warned shareholders that if the plans were not approved, HunterPrint's directors believed the group would 'not be able to continue trading'. Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive, said the cash call was not a sign that the management installed two years ago had failed to turn the company round. 'Our order books are extremely strong,' he said. 'Management has done everything right. They have just run out of cash.' HunterPrint, which was on the brink of collapse in 1990 when it raised Pounds 13.6m in a share issue, has now offered investors one for every 10 shares held at a placing price of 50p to raise a net Pounds 18.3m. The placing follows a proposed capital reorganisation to consolidate every 10 existing shares into one with a nominal value of 50p. The shares will be split into one ordinary of 15p, which will carry the voting rights, and one deferred of 35p. Last night the shares closed 1/2 p down at 5 1/2 p. Out of the placing proceeds, Pounds 15.6m in cash will be used to pay lessors of printing equipment, which along with the Pounds 5.2m convertible preferences would eliminate HunterPrint's Pounds 36m lease obligations. The lessors have also agreed to take up to Pounds 3.9m of the placing shares. The new shares will represent some 69 per cent of the enlarged equity. Mr Caplin said the company was expected to return a profit in the current year and it expected to pay a dividend for the first time since 1989. The increased losses of Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 6.3m) this time were after a Pounds 3.8m exceptional charge. The largest element of the charge was a Pounds 6.1m provision for the write-down of fixed assets and Pounds 1.7m of costs for the refinancing. This was partially offset by the estimated Pounds 5.8m gain on restructuring the leases. Sales rose to Pounds 52.2m (Pounds 49.6m), while trading losses were cut to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 7.25m). Losses were 6.8p (4.2p). has HunterPrint has paid Sir Ian MacGregor Pounds 285,000 in compensation for loss of office and a further Pounds 35,000 for fees and legal expenses.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Moses] </F>   [Text] The swift-moving events of our generation are  producing rapid changes demanding a high level of adjustment.  The outstanding example of this is the technological-economic  sphere, which is indirectly affecting our social and spiritual  life. Our language and the culture of interpersonal relations  are changing, with implications for the political and national  sphere as well.    Hayim Ramon overran the old and hated fort of the Histadrut  and gave a green light to speeding up replacement of the  leadership of the old and intermediate generations. We can look  forward to further assaults bringing down the strongholds of the  old Zionism, to dissolution of the Histadrut, the Palmach, which  had seemed wiped out to all of us, the Jewish Agency and the  rest of Zionism's archaeological relics. In his impulsive  reaction to the state comptroller, Rabin reminded everyone that  he still belongs to the old Palmach boys. The terms "monkey's  uncle" and "drivel" are indeed native Israeli, but old-fashioned.    The right camp is stuck in a desperate struggle to block the  "peace train," which naturally, and as expected, has been built  in and stops at the Gaza and Jericho stations. One may hope for  "Gaza and Jericho first--and last," at least during the current  government's term.    The right camp, in its conservatism, must not preserve the  party institutions' outdated structure. National feedback  circles must be created, the public must be stirred with ideas.  Perhaps the Meymad movement and the Takhelet circle will  generate momentum leading, in time, to "new life" in the center  and the right, but every other initiative and mass ferment is to  be blessed in this transition period.    Religious Zionism finds itself at a crossroads. The NRP's  [National Religious Party] exclusion from the government is  causing a crisis in many spheres of activity in which the  national religious public [as published] had been a leading  factor. One may hope that the natural processes that will make  "Gaza and Jericho first--and last" will enable a new settlement  scheme to take the socioideological place of religious Zionism.  The time has come to mark whether the national religious public  is advancing religious Zionism or, on the contrary, burying it  in a corner of the national right. In the past, the role of  "counterweight" permitted religious Zionism to stand in the  center of the map. It may be that what is needed today is  integration into the major parties in order to spearhead the new  Zionism. This issue must be put on the agenda in the upcoming  party elections. The national religious public's success depends  on the extent of the public's disgust with the big parties, but  on the scale of a midsize to small party, a situation will be  perpetuated in which the national religious public exists by  grace of the government.    One of the areas in which the NRP is an initiator and leader  is that of immigration and Jewish-Israeli activity within the  former Soviet Union. The Labor Party's myopia on this issue is  typified by the conduct and attitude of Deputy Education  Minister Mikha Goldman, and reached a peak regarding youth  immigration, about which I wrote in a previous article  (published 12 May 1994). In that article, I called for "new  life" in the Jewish Agency and for youth immigration with Rabin  in peace." The reply of Eli 'Amir, who is in charge of youth  immigration, to the article "National Project," which was  published in HATZOFE on 26 May 1994, argues for a "national  monopoly" of the Jewish Agency and youth immigration. This  monopoly is a sure prescription for atrophy, mediocrity, and a  low level of services. There is no need in the modern period and  the current situation of "expiatory fowl" to engage in a "cock  fight"; what we need is to foster a healthy competition between  two plans. In the case of immigration and immigration 16, the  very one who feared a professional defeat took advantage of his  proximity to authority and obtained a political, nonprofessional  decision. Israeli society's great fear is that the "expiatory  fowl" of the various immigration bureaus will undergo a negative  psychological process of "identifying with the aggressor," the  authority culture of those who receive them. Such psychological  dynamics will perpetuate the culture of "expiatory fowl," and  the only thing that will change is the sacrifice of the week.    Eli 'Amir's rhetoric demonstrates that he has become more of  a Mapainik than the Mapainiks. That is not big news for students  of youth immigration. On the contrary, the culture of  immigration absorption in Israel, which is causing an outbreak  of delayed aggression by those absorbed, and by no means in  creative and positive channels, has to be changed. We need a  culture of authority and absorption that is more refined, one in  which Israeli society imbues immigrants with esprit de corps and  opens itself to study and change. Direct, open and mutual  absorption, not haughty and unilateral provision of shelter. The  challenge for Yehi'el Leqet, acting chairman of the Jewish  Agency, is to take measures before it is too late and to make  reforms that will prevent him from being branded with the image  of "the Haberfeld of the Jewish Agency." He now has on his desk  the problem of youth immigration, which is one of the tests of  his ability to absorb the spirit of the times.    Rabin, who is fighting for his position against 'Arafat, and  was dragged down to 'Arafat's level of expression in  Johannesburg, is incapable meanwhile of rising above himself,  neither with youth immigration nor with the Palmach, not even at  the expense of 'Arafat and the PLO. As the leader of a modern  state with a new spirit, a vast center of power residing in his  office, he finds it difficult to break free of both the near  past, the Rabin-Peres camp, and the remote past, the days of the  Palmach and the victory of the Six-Day War. Perhaps we are  dealing with a crisis intrinsic in the office, as Nahum Barne'a  and Shim'on Schiffer have analyzed in YEDI'OT AHARONOT, but the  fear still exists that the problem is a deeper psychopolitical  one. It is difficult to see how, without advisers and  strong-willed younger men, he can adapt to a changing reality  and guide a new Zionism, a Zionism that embraces management of a  modern competitive economy and breathes fresh ideas into  national values. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that  new Zionism depends on "new life" and a young, fresh leadership.</p>

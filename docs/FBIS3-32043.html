			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gonzalo Palacios from Potpun, Peten Department] </F>   [Text] Everything here is calm in terms of the  referendum--except for an almost total abstentionism. There are  16 booths located in this municipality, and a few moments ago  there were tables where nobody had gone to vote. It may be due  to the fact the media's power of persuasion was not effective.    The teachers of Peten held a general meeting on 28 January  and decided to urge the rest of the people not to vote. The  teachers issued a communique, which states at the end: The  teachers urge the citizens in general not to be deceived by the  publicity campaign to vote yes or no in the upcoming referendum.  Do not go vote in the referendum. This was one of the  arguments raised by the teachers to El Peten residents.    The few individuals who have gone to vote are Indians. They  were trucked into Poptun Municipality. We had the opportunity  to listen to Benedicto Lucas, municipal mayor, who spoke in  dialect to those who arrived, telling them to vote yes, because  that was the thing to do. Everything has taken place normally.  Only the UCN [Union of the National Center] installed its  delegates but no other delegate at the polling booths. We will  report on what is taking place throughout the rest of the  department during the remainder of the day.</p>

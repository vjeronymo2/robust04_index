			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429) written in Beijing on 13 March 1994: "Inside  Information on Why China Is Taking a Tough Stand Against the  United States on the Human Rights Issue"]    [Text] In mid-March, Chinese and U.S. leaders carried out  a face-to-face struggle in Beijing on the human rights issue and  the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue. In response to U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher's demand that China must make  marked improvement in the field of human rights in order to meet  the requirements set forth by President Clinton for extending  China's MFN status, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen, Premier Li Peng, and President Jiang Zemin all  explicitly indicated that China resolutely opposes the linkage  of the human rights issue with MFN. "China and the United  States can discuss their differences on the human rights issue  on the basis of equality in order to increase mutual  understanding, and no one should exert pressure on the other.  China will never accept the U.S. viewpoint on human rights. If  the United States rescinds China's MFN status, China will not be  the only victim, and the losses incurred by the United States  will not be less serious than those by China. China mainly  relies on its domestic market, and has a strong ability of  self-reliance. The United States will lose a huge market. It  is hoped that the United States will properly handle this  matter." At the same time, China also detained dissidents such  as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan for a short time before  Christopher's arrival, and "invited" them out of Beijing in  order to prevent the reoccurrence of private meetings between  U.S. officials and Chinese dissidents.    This time, China's tough attitude on the human rights issue  has deeply perplexed some people overseas. If the United States  also responds in a tough manner and flatly denies China's MFN  trading status, would both sides suffer losses? This would  certainly cause losses to Hong Kong. Did China actually  consider these consequences?    According to sources in Beijing, the Chinese leaders were  not  prompted by a sudden impulse to adopt a tough attitude and  decide not to stoop to compromise; instead, their response to  the U.S. demand was based on careful consideration, and their  decision was made after they weighed all the advantages and  disadvantages. The critical factor was a secret meeting between  a senior American official and Wei Jingsheng.    In February, the United States sent Assistant Secretary of  State Shattuck to visit Beijing in order to make arrangements  for Christopher's visit. This was an official visit, and  Shattuck should have respected diplomatic protocol and arranged  his schedule and itinerary in coordination with his host.  However, Shattuck privately met with Wei Jingsheng and other  dissidents without notifying the Chinese Government and  consulted the dissidents about whether China's MFN status should  be maintained. Some of the dissidents demanded that the United  States rescind China's MFN status, while others asked to meet  with Christopher. China lodged a protest about this event with  the United States, but the U.S. side insisted that its diplomats  had the right to meet foreign citizens as they liked. In these  circumstances, the Chinese public security authorities summoned  Wei Jingsheng and other dissidents in early March, and the  purpose was to give a message to the U.S. authorities and  Christopher, who would visit China in mid-March, that China was  not weak or easy to bully and they must not think that China  would kowtow to the United States on the human rights issue in  order to keep its MFN status.    In view of the action taken by the Chinese public security  authorities, it was likely that the United States would once  again threaten to rescind China's MFN status, but China was  determined to stand firm and not yield. Through its propaganda  organs (primarily the left-wing newspapers in Hong Kong), China  explicitly indicated: "A country must safeguard its sovereignty  and security and guarantee that there is no interference in its  internal affairs. Foreign countries must not be allowed to  support the trouble-making activities of domestic political  dissidents. Moreover, Wei Jingsheng remains a convict on  parole, who must abide by the parole rules. If he violates  these rules, the Chinese public security authorities certainly  have the right to summon him and give warnings to him in  accordance with the law. The United States tried to interfere  in China's law-enforcement procedures and parole rules, and such  behavior violated international law."    Furthermore, when meeting with Christopher, Qian Qichen  blamed Shattuck for "disregarding China's laws and taking  actions of interfering in China's internal affairs" without  naming him. Qian said that this "deeply disappointed China."  Jiang Zemin also criticized the U.S. official without naming  him when talking with Christopher by saying that, in the United  States, "some people did not really care about the rights,  interests, and well-being of the vast number of Chinese people;  instead, they were only concerned about a very small number of  people who attempt to subvert the Chinese Government and  undermine China's stability. This is in fact a political and  legal issue rather than a human rights issue." The remarks  uttered by Qian and Jiang made people realize more clearly the  essence of the United States' "human rights" diplomacy.    According to the sources, although China gave the United  States a message that it would not yield on the human rights  issue in order to keep its MFN trading status, this did not mean  that China does not care about the continuation of MFN status.  Instead, according to their assessment of the current domestic  and international situation, the Chinese authorities thought  that the United States would not recklessly rescind China's MFN  status.    According to WAISHI DONGTAI [TRENDS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS], an  internal newsletter distributed to those cadres engaged in  foreign affairs, shortly before Christopher's visit to China, a  Chinese diplomat gave a speech at a seminar in the CPC Central  Party School and reviewed the Sino-U.S. struggle over the MFN  issue in the past. He said: "Not only in China, but also in the  international community, a great deal of research has been done  on this issue, and all of the researchers reached a common  conclusion: MFN status must still be given to China, because  the national strength of the United States has substantially  declined, and it needs economic cooperation with other  countries. On many international issues, the United States can  no longer impose its own ideas on its Western allies. For  example, in Bosnia and Somalia, the United States ran into snags  again and again; even when dealing with affairs in Haiti and the  Philippines, the Unites States can no longer continue its club-  wielding policy." The diplomat said: First, the recent spy  scandal caused a rift in U.S.-Russian relations, and Russia  stopped following every instruction dictated by the United  States due to domestic pressures; second, there have recently  been trade frictions between the United States and Japan, and  Japan has seen rising domestic demand for trade equality, even  though the United States is using "Super 301" as a heavy weapon  to force Japan to open its market; third, Clinton himself has  been seriously plagued by the "Whitewatergate affair," and  people are watching to see whether he will be forced to step  down like Nixon in the "Watergate incident." Therefore, some  people are saying that Clinton is being besieged on three sides.  If he decides to discontinue China's MFN status, he will  certainly be facing opposition from U.S. business circles and  will then be "besieged on four sides."    On the other hand, through reform and opening over 15 years,  China's economy is continuously, rapidly, and stably developing.  It primarily relies on its domestic market and has a strong  ability of self-reliance. It will be able to withstand the  impact of the discontinuation of its MFN trading status in the  United States. Moreover, China may join GATT within the year,  and, if this comes to pass, MFN will no longer be an issue.  Even if the United States does not extend China's MFN status,  China will not have to endure the unfavorable effects for a very  long time.    The comprehensive analysis shows that both the domestic and  international situations are favorable to China, and China does  not have to soften its principle and position on the human  rights issue for the sake of maintaining MFN trading status. Of  course, a compromise may still be made on some minor issues so  that the other side may find it easier to save face, and this  will help solve the problem in the end.    All this shows that the Chinese authorities had made good  preparations when facing the U.S. challenge this time, and they  had full confidence in the final results of their plan.    The sources also said: Although China is opposed to linking  human rights with MFN, and the differences between the two sides  over their approaches to human rights were not narrowed, China  still expressed its understanding of the U.S. Government's  situation, in which it must give a report on the number of  political prisoners to the U.S. Congress. Therefore, without  giving up its principles, the Chinese side also made certain  concessions in order to make it easier for the Clinton  administration to save face. Before leaving Beijing,  Christopher said at his news conference that China gave him  detailed information about 235 prisoners and agreed to provide  information about another 106 Tibetan prisoners in the near  future. China also agreed to continue discussions with the  International Red Cross about visiting Chinese prisons, and, for  the first time, China expressed its willingness to discuss  putting an end to its practice of jamming VOA broadcasts to  China with the U.S. side. The five- point cooperation agreement  reached by the two sides during his visit to China also include  a statement signed by the two sides on "the memorandum on  products made with prison labor."    China also decided to send a trade delegation, the largest  one in the past 15 years, to the United States in April to seek  U.S. investment for nearly 800 industrial and agricultural  projects.    The Chinese side maintained that, if Sino-U.S. economic and  trade relations can be freed from the interference of the human  rights issue, not only China will benefit, but U.S. economic  circles will also meet a rare historic opportunity for  developing economic and trade cooperation with China.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN DEAD, WIFE HURT AFTER CRASH WITH FLEEING YOUTH  </P> <P> A 15-year-old youth being chased by police as he drove a stolen  four-wheel-drive truck at 80 m.p.h. ran a red light early Monday and smashed  broadside into a compact car that carried a Santa Ana couple, police said.  </P> <P> The truck struck with such force, police said, that the couple inside the car  were thrown onto the pavement at the intersection of Fairview and First  streets.  </P> <P> Victor Manuel Monroy-Barrales, 32, died shortly after the crash; his wife,  Maria Garcia Calderon, 33, was critically injured.  </P> <P> The youth -- whose name was withheld because he is a minor -- was treated for a  minor head cut and taken to Juvenile Hall. He is being held on suspicion of  murder, auto theft, possession of stolen property and evading a police officer.  </P> <P> The collision ended a short pursuit in which police said the youth drove on the  wrong side of Fairview before running the red light and striking  Monroy-Barrales' 1980 Datsun.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said the incident began when an officer  noticed a Toyota 4-Runner weaving in traffic at 3:45 a.m. while headed west on  McFadden Avenue, near Raitt Street.  </P> <P> When the driver apparently saw the officer behind him, he abruptly turned into  the parking lot of a shopping center and speeded up in an apparent attempt to  evade the officer, Helton said.  </P> <P> The officer was still behind the truckwhen it emerged northbound on Fairview,  Helton said. The teen-ager then drove across a break in the median island and  headed north in the southbound lanes.  </P> <P> Helton said the officer radioed that he was pursuing but remained on the right  side of the median in the northbound lanes.  </P> <P> The youth speeded up to 80 m.p.h, Helton said, while the officer continued at a  slower speed.  </P> <P> Officers discovered that the vehicle driven by the youth had recently been  stolen in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Monroy-Barrales died at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana about two hours  after the crash. His wife remained in critical condition after surgery Monday  afternoon at UCI Medical Center in Orange.  </P></p>

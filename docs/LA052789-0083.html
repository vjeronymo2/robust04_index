			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> COLLINS AND BACH: BULLS' IMPROBABLE COACHING MATCH  </P> <P> On the surface, they seem an improbable match. The young, energetic,  impressionable head coach and the cool, elder assistant, a year shy of Social  Security, with the cowboy boots and military mind.  </P> <P> But it is a union of design and necessity, one of checks and balances that has,  in time, crossed the normal boss-employee boundary to become something more.  Something stronger. Something rare.  </P> <P> Doug Collins, the coach, saw his father, Paul, die in January 1979. He believes  he has found the next best thing in John Bach -- 26 years his senior -- whom he  hired as an assistant in 1986 when he took over as the Chicago Bulls head  coach.  </P> <P> "Since I lost my own father, Johnny almost has become a second father to me,"  Collins said. "He has sort of become the guy who watches out for me. I'm very,  very close to him."  </P> <P> The hyperactive Collins, 37, has sometimes needed Bach's safety net,  undoubtedly starting with the very first game in 1986 when Granville Waiters  was the starting center. Since then, the Bulls have known plenty of adversity  and frustration, and little of their present success, which has them tied 1-1  with the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals.  </P> <P> "Doug can get so emotional at times that he seems to be totally drained," said  Bach, who turns 64 July 10 and coached the Golden State Warriors from 1983-86.  "You have to hang close to him because he needs someone to talk to and absorb  the fears and disappointment. I feel that's my role, to be with him regardless  of the hour. I think that's one reason our relationship has developed so well."  </P> <P> Does he see himself in the role of surrogate father?  </P> <P> "That's very flattering, but no," Bach said. "Uncle, maybe. Or older brother.  But I knew Doug's father and I don't think I could ever be someone like that."  </P> <P> Paul Collins, according to his son, was a lot like Bach. Or vice versa. The  elder Collins was a political figure in the Benton, Ill., area, a county  treasurer and sheriff who named his son, Douglas, after Illinois senator Paul  Douglas. (Collins' full name is Paul Douglas Collins.)  </P> <P> "My father was a very stoic man," Collins said. "After a game, it was always,  'Nice game, son' and a handshake. That was all. I see a lot of my dad in  Johnny. The tough-mindedness. The pussycat interior. And Johnny is the type of  guy who'd do anything in the world for me. If I told him to rent a car and  drive to Cleveland right now, he'd do it. And he wouldn't ask why."  </P> <P> Says Collins, "Johnny is probably the most loyal man I've ever been around in  my entire life. I don't know of anyone in the world I'd want with me more than  him in a time of adversity because he sticks with you."  </P> <P> Their paths crossed for the first time 17 years ago, when Bach already had 21  years of coaching experience at Penn State and Fordham and had enjoyed a cup of  coffee in the NBA with the Celtics in 1948-49 (and wore No. 17). Collins was a  high-scoring, low-profile guard from Illinois State.  </P> <P> The setting was the 1972 U.S. Olympic team tryouts. Collins easily made the  team that Bach, as an assistant and Olympic Committee member, helped select.  </P> <P> After the painful defeat in Munich to the Soviets -- a game Collins seemingly  had won with two free throws -- the two drifted apart. Bach returned to Penn  State. Collins went back to Illinois State and later to the NBA with the 76ers.  </P> <P> Then, out of a job in 1986, Bach asked for an interview with the Bulls, who'd  just hired Collins.  </P> <P> "He absolutely blew me away with his organizational skills," Collins said.  "I've never seen anyone like him. You talk about someone proud of his work. . .  . "  </P> <P> Collins quickly discovered Bach was something more than just an experienced  hand. "He saw what didn't work for him at Golden State and he wanted to make  sure it didn't happen to me," Collins said.  </P> <P> And Bach quickly discovered that Collins, then 35, needed some guidance through  the NBA minefield, someone to run interference between the coach and a referee  or a dejected player or who knows what (a tall building? a sharp object?) after  a particularly tough night.  </P> <P> Even now, Collins said Bach provides a necessary dose of reality on a daily  basis. While Collins was celebrating victories over the Cavaliers and Knicks,  Bach already was looking ahead to the weightier task.  </P> <P> "We call him Dr. Doom. After we beat Cleveland, he comes in the next day and  says, 'OK, time to get on with it.' And after we beat New York, he did the same  thing," Collins said.  </P></p>

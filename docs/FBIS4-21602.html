			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The Russian Government's proposal for an eight-party  conference to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue has been  reportedly regarded as a strategy to strengthen its position in  the international community. It is also possible that North  Korea will use the proposal for propaganda purposes and to delay  the settlement of the nuclear issue.    A relevant high-level official of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] pointed out that Russia should not overlook  the fact that the UN Security Council is now discussing the  North Korean nuclear issue, even though its proposal is an  attempt to resolve the nuclear issue internationally and  politically. In addition, he stressed that problems may arise  in the positions of the UN Security Council and the IAEA, which  have made efforts for nuclear nonproliferation throughout the  world.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROSS GETS TRICKY TO WIN RACQUETBALL FINAL OVER ANDREWS  </P> <P> Andy Gross completed on Sunday what he began the day before, weaving magic on a  20 X 40 court by using his racquet as a wand.  </P> <P> Gross, 22, who amuses youngsters and stays loose himself by performing a  sleight-of-hand routine between matches, completed a sweep through the open  division of the Summer Shootout racquetball finals at Sequoia Club/Racquetball  World in Canoga Park.  </P> <P> Gross routed Ed Andrews in the championship match, 15-10, 15-4, taking home  first prize of $500. Andrews won $250.  </P> <P> Andrews, seeded No. 2, appeared to run out of gas in the second game as the  quicker Gross frequently passed him with unreturnable shots.  </P> <P> The top-seeded Gross, from Sherman Oaks, won without having to play a  tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Gross defeated Dave Genevae of Yorba Linda, 15-2, 15-5, in a semifinal match  played earlier in the day while Andrews, from Huntington Beach, reached the  finals by taking out No. 3-seeded Mark Silva of West Hills, 15-7, 15-6.  </P> <P> Gross later teamed with Andrews to defeat Chad Solter of Chatsworth and Kevin  Tisinger of Moorpark for the doubles championship, 15-4, 15-8.

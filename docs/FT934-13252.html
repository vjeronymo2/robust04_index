			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: US airlines The good news is that the US airline market appears to be bouncing back after incurring collective losses of more than Dollars 4bn last year. The fare wars which disfigured the market last summer have been abating: both American Airlines and Northwest Airlines have just reported rare third quarter profits. The bad news is that US airlines may still lose about Dollars 2bn this year. The market remains fragile. Even the few profitable airlines are making highly unsatisfactory returns. Traffic has been recovering slowly  - particularly on long haul flights  - while airlines have continued to cut costs. Several carriers have also reduced capacity by retiring aircraft early, deferring deliveries and slimming down schedules. Low fuel prices have also helped. However, progress will be slow. There remains too much capacity in the market for this stage of the cycle. Several loss-making carriers, which should have expired, have emerged reinvigorated from Chapter 11. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines is unsettling some bigger rivals by operating cut-price services. Continental, too, is now experimenting with this cheap and cheerless approach. Sadly, USAir, in which British Airways has a significant investment, has not yet benefited from the upswing, incurring a Dollars 177.6m third quarter loss. USAir is heavily exposed to the volatile short haul market and has been squeezed by Southwest. For the moment BA is sanguine because it receives a fixed income on its preference shares. It remains a disconcerting trend nonetheless.</p>

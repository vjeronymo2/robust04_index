			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Heilongjiang provincial government work </F> report delivered by Governor Shao Qihui at the second session of  the eighth provincial people's congress on 24 February]    [Text]Review of 1993 Work    Under the leadership of the provincial party committee, the  people of the province thoroughly implemented the guidelines of  the 14th national party congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  important speeches, further emancipated the mind, had courage in  practice, and worked in a down-to-earth manner, with the focus  on establishing the socialist market economy system and  comprehensively promoting socialist modernization, in the past  year. The work tasks for 1993 approved at the first session of  the eighth provincial people's congress were by and large  accomplished, and great achievements were won in reform and  development.    The national economy developed in a sustained and stable  manner. Despite contradictions in systems and structures, which  had yet to be resolved, and the rather serious restrictions  imposed by the bottlenecks, such as funds and transportation, we  managed to maintain a fairly high growth rate in Heilongjiang's  economy thanks to the efforts to rely on reform and opening up,  strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and overcome  numerous difficulties. The gross domestic product totaled 102.8  billion yuan, up 4.9 percent from the preceding year in terms of  comparable prices. Industrial production rose steadily, and its  economic efficiency improved notably. The annual industrial  output value totaled 131.6 billion yuan, up 6.2 percent in terms  of comparable prices. Proceeding from strengthening the  position of agriculture as the foundation and protecting and  boosting peasants' enthusiasm, we made conscientious efforts to  correct the irrational burdens (totaling 360 million yuan or  20.8 yuan per capita) on peasants when doing rural work, made  active efforts to eliminate "IOUs," increased money, science,  and technology input, facilitated the "four aspects of  integrated management," and thus promoted rural economic  development. Agricultural output value totaled 33 billion yuan,  up 2.3 percent. Grain output attained a new height to reach  23.91 million tonnes. Animal husbandry developed in a sustained  and balanced manner, and the proportion of its output value to  the total agricultural output value rose to about 25 percent.  An unprecedented good situation emerged in township  enterprises, which registered a growth rate of 53.1 percent,  increased their output value to a level that accounted for 60  percent of the agricultural output value, and were becoming the  major force of the rural economy. Key construction and  technical transformation were accelerated, and investment of the  entire society in fixed assets totaled 32.15 billion yuan, up  36.4 percent. Urban and rural markets remained thriving, with  the total volume of retail sales increasing by 12.3 percent over  the preceding year. Revenues rose steadily, and the financial  order improved.    We quickened the steps toward the socialist market economy  system. Enterprise reform focusing on enforcing the  "regulations on transforming the operating mechanism of the  enterprises owned by the whole people" and Heilongjiang's  "detailed regulations for implementation" made significant  headway. Enterprises' decision- making power was implemented  gradually, and, in particular, reform of the property right  system began to take a big step forward. Especially after the  third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, we  formulated and put into effect a series of major reform measures  in line with the guidelines of the "decision" and the national  economic work conference, which would notably accelerate our  transition from the planned economy system to the socialist  market economy system.    A good development trend continued in opening to the outside  world. Further developing the advantages presented by the  opening of border areas, we made active efforts to promote the  strategic escalation of opening to the outside world, emphasized  the building of the large passageway for international trade,  implemented the strategies of winning with quality and  diversifying the market, and made persistent efforts to push  large and medium-sized enterprises to the major battleground of  foreign economic relations and trade. Heilongjiang's total  imports and exports came to $3.06 billion, up 6.2 percent from  the preceding year.    All-round progress was made in various social undertakings.  With economic construction as the central link, development of  the economy and society was coordinated. Thanks to the profound  implementation of the strategic principle of "invigorating the  province through science and technology," more sciences and  technologies took root in the economy, more scientists and  technicians plunged into the main battlefield of economic  construction, and more scientific and technological research  achievements were translated into practical productive forces.  Adhering to the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and  being tough with both hands," we went all out to build the  socialist spiritual civilization. The cultural front presented  a group of fine cultural works that mainly reflected practical  lives. Harbin city successfully obtained the right to host the  Third Winter Asian Games. Great results were achieved in public  health, sports, family planning, press and publication,  broadcasting and television, environmental protection, and the  work of nationality, civil administration, overseas Chinese  affairs, and foreign affairs.    Living standards of urban and rural residents continued to  improve. Deducting the factors of price rises, the per capita  annual income of urban residents available for living expenses  increased by 5.2 percent over the previous year, and the per  capita net income of rural residents increased by 2.1 percent.  Savings deposits of urban and rural residents at the end of  1993 increased by 10.68 billion yuan, up by 22.6 percent. Urban  and rural construction was accelerated, and public facilities  improved somewhat. The per capita housing area of urban  residents was 6.4 square meters, 0.2 square meters more than in  the previous year. The per capita housing area of rural  residents was 14.53 square meters.    Construction of democracy, the legal system, and  administrative honesty was strengthened. Governments at all  levels conscientiously executed the resolutions of people's  congresses and their standing committees, attached full  importance on the role of the organizations of Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], democratic parties,  people's groups, and various circles in society in conducting  political consultation and democratic supervision, earnestly  received the letters and visits from the masses, and handled 178  proposals from people's deputies and 373 motions from the CPPCC  organizations. Remarkable improvement was made in drawing up  and enforcing administrative laws and in supervising law  enforcement. In line with the arrangements of the central  authorities and the provincial party committee, we positively  and conscientiously launched the anticorruption campaign among  government departments.    In the past year, many difficulties and problems remained to  the province's economic and social lives. Deep-rooted  contradictions in systems and structures were not resolved  effectively, overall economic efficiency was not good enough,  restrictions to economic activities remained very serious, the  margin of price hikes was on the high side, the people's living  standards improved slowly, the number of enterprises with  difficulties increased, some city and county organizations as  well as some schools had difficulties in paying wages or  salaries, and there unstable factors in society increased  relatively.  <H5>  Principles and Objectives for 1994's Provincial Economic and </H5> Social Development    The principles for the 1994 work of the province are: Under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should profoundly  implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the  third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  accelerate the building of the socialist market economic  structure and the modernization drive, vigorously readjust  economic structure and improve economic efficiency, safeguard  political stability, and promote the all-round progress of  society.    In line with this principle, the province's major targets  for economic and social development in 1994 are as follows:    The gross domestic product will show a 6 percent increase  over 1993.    The total industrial output value will show an about 5  percent increase over 1993.    The total agricultural output value will show an about 4  percent increase over 1993.    The investment made in the fixed assets of society as a  whole  will show a 20 percent increase over 1993.    The increased scale of social retail prices will be  controlled at about 10 percent.    The rate of natural population growth will be controlled  under 12 per 1,000.    In order to totally overfulfill the tasks and targets of  economic and social development in 1994, we must pay attention  to grasping the following points in ideology and work:    First, in developing the economy, we must proceed from the  province's reality. Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed:  "Development represents an essential criterion" and "the final  resolution of problems should also depend on economic  development." Particularly, in view of the province, we must  make efforts to bring about a change to the slow development and  to strive to achieve a faster growth. We will face many  favorable conditions for accelerating development in 1994.  However, we should also fully note that if we fail to  fundamentally deal with the systematic and structural  contradictions, such as the long-standing adversity cropping up  in the structure of industries focused on basic production and  natural resources, the large amount of losses of economic  results caused by the systems of highly mandatory plans and the  tortuous changes of prices, the high demands of investments, the  high cost of production, the weak capability of self  accumulation, and the low level of inputs, as well as the  restriction imposed on by the bottleneck of funds and  transportation, will continue to adversely affect the province's  economic development. Based on stabilizing the increase at  present, we can only exploit strong points and avoid  shortcomings; readjust the structure; and gradually provide  conditions for achieving fast development in the coming few  years.    Second, the way and hope to dealing with the problems  cropping up in the province's economic development lie on  deepening the reform. The state has issued major and important  measures this year for the fields of finance and taxes, banking,  planning, investment, foreign trade, and the reform of  state-owned enterprises. We should organize the departments  concerned to carefully enforce them. According to the target of  establishing the systems of socialist market economy, many  reform measures are beginning to be enforced this year. As soon  as these measures begin, we should do a good job in grasping the  direction and concentrate our efforts on formulating new systems  and mechanism. Efforts should be made to enhance the follow-up  analysis over the reform progress and to discover or resolve the  prominent problems cropping up along the advancing road. A good  job should be done in conducting the harmony, coordination, and  improvement of reforms. In making arrangements for the economic  work, we should create a more relaxed environment for reforms so  as to ensure their smoother progress.    Third, safeguarding and maintaining social stability  represents an overriding task. Without a stable social  environment, we are in no position to do everything. Localities  and departments whose stability situation is more serious should  spend some time and concentrate their efforts on vigorously  grasping the work of safeguarding stability as well as sacrifice  a little the development rate and adequately slow down the pace  of reforms.    Fourth, we should uphold the principle of "building the two  civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of  them." We should constantly grasp material civilization on one  hand and spiritual civilization on the other, grasp economic  construction on one hand and struggle against corruptions on the  other, and grasp construction on one hand and legal systems on  the other.    Develop Rural Economy in an All-Round Manner, With  the Focus on Increasing Peasants' Income    Maintaining the stability and development of the rural  economy constitutes an important foundation for ensuring  Heilongjiang's economic and social stability, and agriculture  should be put unfailingly in the first place of economic work.    We should deepen the rural reform. The original farmland  contracts should be extended another 30 years without change  when they expire. Paid transfer of land use right according to  the law should be permitted, and the optimal-scale operation  based on household contracted operation should be developed.  Rural socialized service system should be improved  continuously. We should accelerate rural market construction  and guide peasants to enter the field of commodity distribution.  In line with state arrangements, we should continue to maintain  the contracted grain purchasing quota and properly raise the  grain purchasing price when new grain begins to be marketed this  year. We should establish the grain risk fund and further  improve the grain reserve and marketing systems.    Guided by the market, we should lead peasants to adjust the  production setup and product mix of their own accord so that  agriculture will develop along the direction of high yields,  good quality, and high efficiency. The areas planted to  different crops should be properly arranged, and the emphasis  should be on development of the advantageous strains needed by  the market and the products of high commercial rate and capable  of earning plenty of foreign exchange. We should intensify  construction of capital farmland water conservancy facilities  and do a good job in afforestation. To facilitate sustained and  stable agricultural development, we should continue to increase  financial allocations, credit, and peasants' investment to  agriculture.    We should carry out the "leap-over project" of township  enterprises. The output value of Heilongjiang's township  enterprises should reach 50 billion yuan this year, up more than  50 percent from last year. The cooperative shareholding system  should become the major way of township enterprises' reform and  development, and cooperative shareholding enterprises  established with the funds pooled by peasants, who either  participate in their management or not, should be greatly  developed. Township enterprises should do a good job in  cooperation with coastal areas, scientific research units,  colleges and universities, and large enterprises. We should  strive to increase the investment in township enterprises and,  by pooling funds, inviting investment, and increasing bank  loans, increase the investment to 2 billion yuan this year. We  should give particular attention to the construction of small  township industrial zones and develop the large areas with the  concentration of these zones. We should coordinate the  construction of these small zones with the construction of small  cities and towns. Experiment should be conducted with the  reform of the household registration system in small cities and  towns, and peasants should be encouraged to invest in  establishing enterprises in the small industrial zones. We  should do a better job in building the bank of township  enterprises' projects, actively bring in and train personnel,  disseminate new technology, develop new products, and guide  township enterprises to increase the scale and raise the level.  We should replenish and strengthen city, county, and township  leadership force in charge of township enterprises and organize  the departments, enterprises, and institutions at and above the  county level and some units directly under the central and  provincial authorities to support and help township enterprises.  We should strive to attain one year ahead of schedule the  target of doubling the output value of township enterprises.    We should make unremitting efforts to reduce the burdens on  peasants. Fees and charges collected from peasants should be  put under strict control in line with relevant laws and  regulations of the state and the province. Departments directly  under the province and governments at and below the city or  prefectural level have no authority to stipulate the items of  fees and charges to be collected from peasants. We should  strengthen management of collective finance and keep the  percentage of township unified accumulation and village  retention within 5 percent of local peasants' net annual income  of the previous year.    Combine Reform With Renovation, and Successfully Run  State-Owned Enterprises, With Large and Medium-sized Enterprises  as the Mainstay    Heilongjiang is a province with more large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, and thus it must regard the successful  operation of state-owned enterprises, with large and  medium-sized ones as the mainstay, as the most important task of  deepening reform and accelerating development.    To successfully run state-owned enterprises, with large and  medium-sized ones as the mainstay, the most essential work is to  deepen reform, accelerate renovation, and organically combine  the two.    Enterprise reform should be pressed forward positively and  steadily in line with the decision adopted by the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on transforming the  operational mechanisms of enterprises and establishing the  modern enterprise system. At present, we should continue to  conscientiously implement the "enterprise law," the "corporate  law," the "regulations," and the "detailed rules" in order to  truly delegate various decision-making powers to enterprises.  We should rapidly establish the modern enterprise system, with  emphasis on reforming the property rights of state-owned  enterprises. Within this year, we should choose 50 enterprises  of different trades to try out the modern enterprise system and  then the system should be spread to all fields to accumulate  experiences. On the basis of standardizing existing  shareholding enterprises, with emphasis on establishing the  corporate system, we should make great efforts to explore the  organizational forms concerning the property composition of  state-owned enterprises, should vigorously develop the limited  liability corporations whose shares are purchased by legal  entities, and should spread in a planned manner the experiments  for establishing the limited corporations wholly owned by the  state. The 150 state-owned enterprises that have conditions,  large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in particular,  should be rebuilt or be newly built into limited-liability  corporations. Some large and medium-sized enterprises that are  of no hope to halt deficits should be chosen to try out the  bankruptcy system according to law. In the course of  consolidating and perfecting existing enterprise groups, by  combining the voluntary participation of enterprises with the  guidance of government, we should again organize several  enterprise groups of different categories that have industrial  or product advantages, with key enterprises as the head.  Through such major forms as the shareholding cooperative  system, the management based on leasing, and the selling of  property rights, we should make great efforts to completely  fulfill the task of reforming property rights of small  state-owned enterprises in this and the next years. To ensure  the success in reforming the system concerning the property  right of enterprises and to effect an innovation of the  enterprise system, we must make an inventory of and check the  stockpiles and capital of enterprises, actually reduce the  burdens of enterprises, and accelerate the establishment of the  social security system.    Technological transformation is as important as enterprise  reform, and they complement each other. So far as Heilongjiang,  in which enterprises are seriously aging, is concerned, it is an  urgent task to energetically promote the technological  transformation of enterprises.    Currently, fund shortage is the key problem hampering the  technological transformation of enterprises. We must seek the  way out by deepening reform and expanding the scale of opening  up. With the key technological transformation projects as the  backer, we should spread the shareholding system and collect  funds from enterprise workers and staff members and the from  society. The "grafting" renovation of enterprises should be  carried out on a large scale to attract foreign funds. We  should strengthen the self-renovation capacity of enterprises  through the method of accelerating depreciation. In the course  of running well large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises,  we should pay high attention to resolving the difficulties and  problems facing the state-owned enterprises of counties.  <H5>  Unfailingly Build Key Projects, Readjust Economic Structure, </H5> and Form New Economic Growth Points    To extricate Heilongjiang's economy from slow growth and  weak  momentum, we must pay attention to building a group of key  capital construction and technological transformation projects  with high starting points in technology, wide connections with  industries, strong competitiveness in the market, and good  economic efficiency. In addition, we must make great efforts to  cultivate the pillar industries that greatly affect  Heilongjiang's economy.    We should concentrate energy on grasping the construction  of key projects. It is necessary to accelerate the development  of five key pillar industries and 10 key projects as defined by  the provincial party committee. The completion and operation of  these projects will greatly upgrade the province's economic  development speed, efficiency, and reserve strength. In the  forms of striving for loans and stocks, we should concentrate  financial and material resources to vigorously and rapidly  promote economic development. It is necessary to deepen  investment and inter-regional capital movement systems and to  intensify the investment restriction mechanism. It is necessary  to intensify the development and scientific management of  projects; set up a warehouse of projects, including on-going  projects and reserve projects; and make positive efforts to  strive for new projects.    The readjustment of the economic structure should be  accelerated, and new growth points for the economy should  positively be cultivated. It is impossible to set up the  socialist market economic system and to register a faster  economic growth rate under the unitary ownership system and the  unitary economic structure. Therefore, we should vigorously  develop the tertiary industry; continue to develop  transportation, postal and telecommunications, scientific and  technological, and educational industries; and accelerate the  development of circulation, financial, insurance, tourist, real  estate, information consultation, and intermediate service  trades. It is necessary to boldly give free rein to the  development of individual and private sectors of the economy and  the three types of foreign-funded enterprises and to bring into  full play the potentials of various sectors of the economy. It  is necessary to implement the provincial party committee and  government's "regulations on several issues related to the  private and individual sectors of the economy." The state-owned  enterprises and enterprises with other forms of ownership are  encouraged to make mutual investments and to become  shareholders. It is necessary to develop the economy of various  sectors where property rights are clearly defined.    This year, as well as in the foreseeable future, we should  regard the intensive and precision processing of farm and  sideline products as a new economic growth point, prominently  attend to it, and regard it as a priority of the provincial  government and the governments at various levels. We should  regard dairy products, grain processing, forage, sugar refinery,  foodstuffs, wooden goods, flax products, and medical trade as  leading trades; come up with a unified plan; attain serialized  development; and accelerate the pace of development. It is  necessary to implement the provincial party committee and the  provincial government's decision on "making trade, industry, and  agriculture a coordinated process;" positively organize and  guide industrial and trade enterprises; and organize a  production- processing-circulation community in the forms of  contract, stock cooperation, and economic assistance. In line  with the precision and intensive processing of farm, forestry,  and livestock products, we should conduct technological  transformation among production enterprises and go all out to  develop new products. Through efforts in the next few years, we  should make the processing industries with farm and sideline  products as raw materials become a key force to affect the  province's economic development.  <H5>  Positively Pioneer Domestic and Foreign Markets and Promote </H5> the Opening of the Province to All Directions    Regarding foreign economic relations and trade, we should  take the deepening of the reform of the foreign trade system and  the unification of exchange rates as a favorable opportunity;  continue to upgrade the strategy of opening to the outside  world; gradually develop the opening of the province along  higher layers, wider spheres, and deep ranges; and further  enhance the functions for affecting the overall economy.    In the course of opening to the outside world, we should  regard the import of capital and technology as an extremely  important task. As for the contracts and agreements of intention  on conducting technological transformation with foreign capital  as signed by the provincial government on the two overseas  business invitation events, we should clearly define  responsibilities and pay firm attention to the fulfillment of  these contracts and agreements. Continuously in line with the  economic construction priorities, we should invite businessmen,  bring in capital, and expand inter- regional capital circulation  channels in a well-planned manner and through various channels.    Large and medium-sized enterprises are of main bodies in  the opening up and we should accelerate the pace of encouraging  these enterprises to enter international markets. Efforts  should be made to uphold the direction of unifying the policies,  carrying out open management and operation, enforcing equal  competition, adopting the responsibility system for both profits  and losses, conducting integration between industries and trade,  and promoting the system of acting as agent. We should also  accelerate the reform in the systems of foreign economic  relations and trade and open in an orderly manner the import and  export businesses to the outside world. Efforts should be made  to strive to delegate more self- determination rights of imports  and exports to large and medium- sized enterprises and to  delegate the cash trading right to border trading enterprises as  well as to encourage or support large and medium-sized  enterprises to carry out transnational business in foreign  countries and to have their products enter international markets.    The province will sponsor the fifth Harbin border and local  economic talks this year and the Asian Winter Games in 1996. By  regarding the sponsorship and arrangements for the talks and  games as a turning point, we should further improve the  investment environment and broaden the province's influence in  the world.    Markets for the province's products at present are chiefly  within the country. Therefore, while actively opening foreign  markets, it is imperative to intensively have the domestic  markets of the province's products achieve development. Efforts  should be made to broaden the marketing rate of local products  and particularly of famous-trade-mark ones. We should  accelerate the development of markets for various commodities.  A good job should be continuously done in perfecting the  markets for the products of north China's timber, petrochemical  industries in Daqing city, the province's machine-building and  electric industries, light industries, and of dairy farms, as  well as in improving the operation of these markets. We should  concentrate our efforts on developing or fostering the markets  of essential factors of production and take a new step in  developing the markets of funds, labor forces, technologies,  information, real estate, and property rights.  <H5>  Deeply Enforce the Strategic Principle of "Having Science </H5> and Education Make the Province Prosperous," Upgrade in an  Overall Way the Province's Economic Quality    A good job should be done in implementing or promoting the  "overall plan for the medium stage of having 'science and  education make the province prosperous'". By regarding the  thorough reform in the systems of the economy, science and  technology, and education as a main aspect in the strategy, as  well as the vigorous development of high-and-new-tech industries  and relying on science and technology to achieve extra  development of township enterprises as two flanks, we should  conduct integration between promoting the strategy as a whole  and making a breakthrough in the key aspects of the strategy and  concentrate the forces of various circles to enforce in an  organized and planned manner some key projects and items that  are exerting influence as well as should establish some  demonstration zones in this regard. We should give priority to  having science and education make industries prosperous and  deepen the enforcement of having science and education make  agriculture prosperous. Efforts should be made to increase the  input in science, technology, and education at multiple levels  and through multiple channels and to reinforce the strength of  supporting the strategy of having science and technology make  the province prosperous.    We should adopt realistic measures to promote the scientific  and technological progress. Efforts should be made to  accelerate the development of high and new technologies and of  industries of these technologies. A good job should be done in  further improving the management over the development zones of  high-and-new-tech industries in Harbin and Daqing. Cities and  prefectures that have conditions in development may establish  their high and new technical parks and their large and  medium-sized enterprises may establish their high and new  technical corners. Efforts should be made to accelerate the  pace of turning the scientific and technical results into  practical productive forces. In line with the principle of  applying the advanced technologies to equipping various  industries and trades in the national economy, we should  emphatically deal with the pressing problems cropping up in  developing agriculture with high yield, fine quality, and high  benefits; conducting the technical renovations of enterprises;  turning the military industrial technologies into civilian  industrial ones; and in assimilating and creating something new  in the imported foreign advanced technologies. We should  support or encourage the scientific research units to coordinate  with enterprises in conducting technical development and guide  the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to gradually  become the main bodies of scientific and technological  development. We should also encourage or support individuals to  operate the institutions of scientific and technological  research, vigorously foster technical markets, develop technical  intermediary organizations, and realistically protect the  intellectual property rights.    We should continue to put education in a strategic position  for development on a priority basis. Both reform and  development depend on improvement of the quality of all our  people. Governments at all levels should conscientiously  implement the "outlines of China's educational reform and  development" and the "PRC teachers law," accelerate educational  development and reform of the education system, and raise the  quality of education and the efficiency of running schools. We  should intensify elementary education and greatly develop  vocational and technical education and adult education. We  should encourage pooling of funds from all quarters of society  to run schools and establishment of nongovernmental schools. We  should deepen rural and urban overall educational reform and  facilitate the overall planning and integration of "agriculture,  science, and education" and "economy, science, and education."  We should optimize the structure of higher education and  particularly develop a number of disciplines urgently needed in  Heilongjiang's economic construction. We should fully develop  the scientific and technological, intellectual, and technical  advantages of schools of higher learning and secondary  specialized schools. We should step up efforts to improve the  contingents of teachers.    We should attach importance to and achieve success in the  work related to trained personnel. We should do a better job in  enforcing the provincial party committee and government's  "several policy regulations on fully developing the functions of  intellectuals to promote economic development" and establish a  good practice of respecting knowledge and respecting trained  personnel throughout society. We should make continuous efforts  to improve the conditions for the work, study, and life of  intellectuals. Intellectuals with outstanding contributions  should be generously awarded. We should achieve success in  stabilizing trained personnel and attract trained personnel from  foreign countries and from outside the province with  preferential policies.  <H5>  Persistently Pay Attention to Building the Socialist </H5> Spiritual Civilization and Facilitate Comprehensive Progress in  Social Undertakings    We should greatly facilitate building of the socialist  spiritual civilization. Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line and firmly focusing on economic construction, which  is the central task, we should advocate the major melody of this  era and intensify the education on patriotism, collectivism, and  socialism. We should conscientiously implement the principle  that the "important aspect of the spiritual civilization is in  building," carry out the activities to build civilized units in  a down-to-earth manner, and provide spiritual impetus and  intellectual support to establishment of the socialist market  economy system. We should intensify the education on  professional ethics, social morality, and family virtues,  promote improvement of social conduct, and greatly upgrade  people's ideology and morality and social morality.    We should strive to develop culture, press and publication,  radio and television broadcasting, public healthy, sports, and  science and technology. In doing cultural work, we should  continue the orientation of making literature and art serve the  people and serve socialism and the principle of "letting a  hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought  contend," put improvement of social benefits in the first place,  and strive to achieve unity between social benefits and economic  efficiency. We should deepen the reform of the cultural system,  make literary and art creation flourish, step up efforts to  achieve progress in grass-roots culture, manage well the  cultural market, and resolutely ban pornographic books and audio  and video products and illegal publication. In press and  publication work, we should comprehensively raise the quality of  newspapers, magazines, pictures, books, and audio and video  products in compliance with the demand for "upholding the  orientation, managing according to law, deepening reform, and  promoting development." In radio and television work, we should  continue to develop the spirit of solid work characterized by  the endeavor "to become the best and the leader" and raise the  quality and effective coverage of Heilongjiang's radio and  television programs.    Press and propaganda work should be  aimed at meticulously propagating the guidelines of the third  plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the current  economic situation of the province, and the achievements in  reform and construction. Press and propaganda work should be  oriented to correct guidance of the media. Social sciences  units should take an active part in the practice of reform,  opening up, and economic development and strengthen research and  explorations for invigorating Heilongjiang's economy. Public  health work should be focused on deepening the reform of  operational mechanism of medical and health care units and on  improving the quality of medical service. Emphasis should be  placed on building the village-level hospitals in rural areas  and spreading the primary health care service.    Good preparations should be made for the Third Winter Asian  Games, and the hosting of the games should be regarded as the  major event of the province. We should give wide publicity to  the games among the people to enhance their sense of  participation and the sense of playing the host. We should go  all out to make preparations for the games.    Family planning, protection of cultivated land, and  environmental protection constitute the basic policy of China.  We should simultaneously grasp materials production and family  planning and truly carry out the system of population quota  responsibility. We should actually protect cultivated land and  pay equal attention to management of resources and assets.  <H5>  Good Arrangements Should be Made for the Lives of the People </H5> To Promote and Ensure Social Stability    On the basis of developing the economy, we should make great  efforts to increase the actual income of urban and rural  residents and improve the living standards and living quality of  the people. Attention should be paid to resolving the people's  difficulties in clothing, food, housing, transportation,  attending kindergartens and schools, and medical treatment.  Efforts should be made to increase various kinds of service,  cultural, and recreational facilities and to enhance the level  of urban management with a view to providing convenience for the  people.    We should positively and appropriately press forward the  pricing reform and resolutely control the hiking margin of the  general level of commodity prices. We should further  rationalize the relations among prices, successfully grasp the  dynamics of the overall control over prices, carry out the  declaration system for the record for the prices of daily  necessities and service charges, strengthen guidance to and  coordination of the prices of such daily necessities as grain,  cooking oil, port, eggs, and vegetable. We should build well  foodstuff bases and vegetable bases to enrich the people's  "vegetable baskets."    We should show concern over the weal and woe of the people  in  poor areas, vigorously promote the reform of housing system,  actively press forward the reform of social security system, and  further strengthen the comprehensive management of public  security.    We should pay attention to the work related to  nationalities,  religion, overseas Chinese affairs, and foreign affairs. We  should vigorously build the political power at the grass-roots  level, reinforce the unity between the army and the government  and between the army and the people, and mobilize the positive  factors in all fields.  <H5>  Transform the Government Functions and Further Improve the </H5> Style of Work    We should actively and appropriately accelerate the reform  of  government organizations. This year, we should fulfill the task  on reforming the organs directly under the provincial  authorities, and successfully try out the reform of the organs  at the county and township levels. The public service system  should be popularized among state administrative organs. In  organizational reform, we should attend to transforming the  government functions.    We should establish and improve the provincial-level  regulating and control system compatible with the market economy  and meticulously organize implementation of the major reform of  the planning and investment systems, financial and tax systems,  and banking system. We should meet the needs of the market  economy system, give play to the macroeconomic, strategic, and  policy functions of plans, and intensify the research and  formulation of long- and medium-term economic and social  development plans, annual plans, and industrial policies. We  should strengthen the tracing, analysis, supervision,  examination, balancing, and coordination of economic operation  to improve the overall environment for economic activities. In  line with the principle of "making the grass-roots level prosper  first before making the province prosper," we should apply the  tax assignment system to the provincial financial system and  strive to enable all quarters to gain benefits and increase  vitality in the process of economic development on the premise  that continuous enhancement of the state's financial resources  is ensured. We should implement the state's monetary system and  cultivate and improve the money markets.    Government departments at all levels should greatly advocate  the practice of study, the practice of seeking truth from facts,  and the practice of investigation and study. Study and mastery  of the theories on the socialist market economy is an urgent  task for us. We should create provincewide a vigorous atmosphere  for the earnest study of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,"  the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee, and the basic knowledge on the market  economy. We should conscientiously improve work styles and  leadership methods, study more, attend fewer parties, conduct  more investigation and study, avoid subjectivism, renounce empty  talk in favor of practical work, learn about the masses' desires  and demands in a timely and accurate manner, and promote all  work in a positive, steady, and down-to- earth manner.    Strictly managing government affairs and making unremitting  efforts to build a clean government constitute a basic task to  build political power and also an important guarantee for the  smooth promotion of reform and development. We should continue  to carry out the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle put  forward by the party Central Committee, do a better job in  maintaining the honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres,  resolutely oppose and guard against unhealthy trends,  conscientiously investigate and handle major and serious cases,  strictly investigate and handle the cases on serious bureaucracy  and dereliction of duty, which have caused great losses to the  state, and conscientiously address the important issues that  seriously affect the government-populace ties and social  development.    We should strengthen democracy and the legal system. The  provincial government will designate some dates to receive  people's deputies and special telephone lines to establish ties  with them in order to listen to and handle their criticisms and  suggestions. We will take the initiative in strengthening ties  with the CPPCC, democratic parties, and people's organizations  and attach full importance to their functions of political  consultation and democratic supervision. We will establish and  improve the democratic and scientific policy-making systems,  attach importance to and develop the role of research and  consulting institutions and experts, and promote democratic  politics. Governments at all levels must learn to apply the  legal means to manage the economy and society.</p>

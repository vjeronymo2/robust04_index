			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / VW plans to reduce output next year VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume carmaker, has started laying plans to cut production next year, indicating continuing pessimism within the group on market prospects. Workers' representatives and management will start talks soon to discuss short-time working at the group's German factories for the first quarter of 1994, a spokesman said yesterday. The agenda would include a possible extension of the Christmas and New Year holiday shut-down, he added. He dismissed as speculation reports in a Wolfsburg newspaper that the local factory, the biggest in the group, with some 53,000 employees, would shut down for 47 days next year and that other plants could close for up to 60 days. The only concrete decision taken so far was to stop production for six days at VW's smallest works, a half-finished assembly plant in Mosel, eastern Germany. The VW group, which includes the Volkswagen and Audi marques, Seat in Spain and Skoda in the Czech Republic, cut output 19 per cent in the first six months this year. The group is certain to post a substantial loss for the full year following the recent disclosure of an unexpected deficit of DM1.25bn (Pounds 508m) at its Seat subsidiary.</p>

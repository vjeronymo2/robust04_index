			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Friendly </F> Fire"]    [Text] Jet fighter pilots are naturally aggressive. If they  were not, they would fly transportation airplanes or sell  insurance. That is why when they find two helicopters flying in  an exclusion zone it is not surprising that they would shoot  their missiles and down their targets. The problem comes  afterward, when they find out that the helicopters they downed  were American, like the F-15's they were flying in. The 26  American, British, French, and Turkish men who died as a result  of "friendly fire" in Iraq were truly victims of a series of  mistakes that, considering the first reactions of the U.S.  Government, will not be corrected very soon.    The helicopters were downed in full daylight. Apparently the  Friend or Foe Identification (IFF) systems of the two  helicopters, which were being followed by earth radars and an  AWACS, did not work. The equipment failure or the pilots'  forgetfulness in turning it on was a fatal element, but not the  only one. The F-15's made visual contact with the helicopters.  They confused American Blackhawk helicopters with Soviet Hinds,  but what is really strange is that they did not make any attempt  to positively identify or scare away the transgressors from the  exclusion area. This shows that the firing rules of the pilots  who patrol northern Iraq are extremely strict and leave crucial  decisions to the criteria of men submitted to extremely tense  conditions. This time, the too-quick finger on the trigger took  the lives of 26 fellow countrymen and allies.    The tragedy was the result of two prior decisions. The first  one, reflected in U.S. interventions in the past few years, lies  in the belief in air power as a solution to political problems.  Was it necessary to protect the Kurds in the north and the  Shiites in the south? Two air exclusion zones were established  and whatever flew there was to be downed. Are the Serbs not  bombing Sarajevo and Gorazde? Down them and silence their  artillery with air-to-ground fire. No matter how technologically  advanced the American air arsenal may be, it cannot solve what  should be solved by politics. The situation of the Kurds, the  Shiites, and the Iraqis in Iraq and the Moslems in Bosnia will  only be solved when somebody presents, at the appropriate  moment, a peace plan attending to the needs of all parties.    The use of the Air Force may in some cases speed up the  moment to which we are referring. But its use will always imply  siding with one party, and this decision cannot be made  independently of the conflict's context. The United States and  NATO cannot pretend that the air exclusion and confiscation of  heavy weapons are part of an ideal quest for peace and nothing  else. These measures reduce the military capability of the Serbs  without interrupting the hostilities. And when the Serbs realize  the limitations of the use of air power -- estranged from an  efficient policy -- they attempt to reduce or annul the threat.  When attacked from the air, the Serbs in Bosnia began to treat  the UN land forces as hostages and a foreign army that needs  special permission to move. From there to the recovery of the  confiscated weapons was nothing but a small step.    In Iraq the Kurds were used as a pretext to create  conditions  that were believed to lead to the downfall of Saddam Husayn. The  Iraqi dictator is only one of the Kurds' enemies. The other  enemies are the governments of Turkey, Iran, and Russia,  countries where the Kurdish nation is disseminated. The Kurdish  nation will only be able to build its desired national state  through the breaking away of one or several of these countries,  which is something practically unthinkable. Thus, the objective  of the exclusion zone is to prevent Saddam Husayn from  controlling the entire Iraqi territory. Ever since the exclusion  zone was imposed, the Kurds in Iraq have been bombed by the  Turkish Air Force, a U.S. ally through NATO. The 26 Americans,  British, French, and Turks did not die to protect the lives of  the Kurds. They were the victims of a confusing and inconsistent  policy.</p>

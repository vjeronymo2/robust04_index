			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Avoiding a Missile Race"] </F>   [Text] A spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office has  expressed concern over the Indian decision to deploy Prithvi and  Agni missiles on the grounds that it will greatly enhance the  possibility of a nuclear arms race in the region. While  Pakistan in the context of its security environment is more  concerned with the short range Prithvi missile, it is the  Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) Agni, that has a  range of 2500 km and can carry a heavy payload, which, to an  even greater extent, underlines India's aggressive defence  posture. A missile of this type, in the presence of a high  degree of accuracy, is significant not least because of its  ability to carry nuclear warheads over a long range. This has  caused even countries well beyond the region to question India's  intentions. However, given the unfortunate history of conflict  between India and Pakistan, the latter has felt more compelled  to take defensive measures with regard to India's ambitious  missile programme. Apart from attempting to develop indigenous  missile technology to the best of its ability, Pakistan has  incurred a small number of M-11 missiles from China. It has  argued in response to US pressure on this score that the  acquisition of these missiles does not violate the Missile  Technology Control Regime (MTCRL). However, the real issue here  is that if Pakistan perceives a major threat to its security as  a result of the imminent deployment of the Prithvi missile, it  is bound to take steps that provide it with the minimum  necessary level of deterrence.    The matter is further aggravated when India's activities in  this realm are seen in tandem with its ambitious and secretive  nuclear programme. It is in this context that the Foreign  Office spokesman has expressed legitimate fears. It is time for  India to consider the cost of a prohibitively explosive race in  the realm of missiles and nuclear weapons for the extremely  deprived masses of the region. Neither country can really afford  to enter into such a race. Certainly, Pakistan is already having  to spend far too much on defence primarily because of India's  continual enhancement of its already formidable defence  capability as well as its aggressive stance, not just towards  Pakistan, but the countries of the region, in general. Finding  a solution to the nuclear issue in South Asia remains a  difficult task not least as a result of India's intransigence in  this regard. But, meanwhile, it would be eminently sensible if  a beginning could be made on the missile front. If India were  to restrain the production and deployment of missiles, it would  contribute in bringing down the level of tension between the two  countries and score an important confidence building measure  that could possibly pave the way for progress on the more  complex nuclear issue. Perhaps US policy-makers could take up  the matter with the Indian prime minister on his upcoming visit  to the United States. It would be even better, of course, if  India were willing to make the issue a subject of meaningful  bilateral negotiations with Pakistan.</p>

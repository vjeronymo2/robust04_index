			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrod: "Cruise Missile: </F> Aerospatiale Opens the Door to Matra"]    [Text] Nice -- The president of Aerospatiale, who intends  to settle his proposed alliance with his partner Deutsche  Aerospace [DASA] in missiles and satellites by the end of the  year, is ready to envisage a division of labor with Matra on the  future cruise missile which is included in [Defense Minister]  Leotard's military programming law.    The only major new program included in the 1995-2000  military  programming law, the famous "French cruise missile," for the  time being known as the "APTGD" [long-range precision weapon],  will not spark off a fratricidal war between Aerospatiale and  Matra, the two manufacturers currently competing for it.  Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois promised in Nice on  Saturday [7 May] that: "We welcome the launch of the APTGD  missile. It is likely that the two manufacturers concerned will  be interested in this program. If Matra's Apache missile is  chosen, there will be no problem (Aerospatiale has a share of a  little over 40 percent in this program); if the Defense Ministry  prefers Aerospatiale's ramjet solution, Matra will want to  participate in it...and the question of a division will then be  raised."    Indeed, neither of the two French missile manufacturers can  afford to be excluded from this deal, which represents 200  missiles for the domestic market alone and, in view of the new  threats, should raise strong demand on foreign markets. The two  proposals, which are equal in cost, are estimated at around 2  billion francs [Fr], including development and provision of  missiles, whereas Fr1.4 billion has been allocated for this  program over the period 1995-2000 of the programming law. A  decision by the Defense Ministry in favor of Aerospatiale's ASMP  [medium-range air-to-surface]-C missile or Matra's Super-Apache  is expected in the next few months.    Although he regrets that all the programs involving  Aerospatiale have been delayed or have seen their orders cut,  Louis Gallois, whose mandate is due for renewal next June, says  he has a "positive judgment" on the military program drawn up by  Francois Leotard. "The plan exists and we think that it is  politically binding on its authors," the Aerospatiale president  said, welcoming the .5-percent annual growth rate for equipment  funding, and especially the continuation of all the scheduled  programs. (His group has had to accept the sudden halting of  four major projects in four years, the S-45, Hades, and ANS  missiles in the military sphere, and the Hermes space shuttle in  the civilian sphere.) Louis Gallois can only applaud the launch  of the Helios-2 military observation satellite, the decision by  the public authorities to maintain ballistic and ramjet  competence, and the pledge on the FLA [Future Large Aircraft]  transport plane. He thinks that the launch of the latter is now  possible even if London does not order it and if British  industry does not participate in its production.  <H5>  Pivotal Position in Europe </H5>   "We share the objective of reducing the cost of programs  because this is also necessary for us to be able to export, but  it presupposes an effort by manufacturers, the DGA [General  Delegation of Armaments], and the general staffs," Louis Gallois  also explained. "The DGA's parameters, which are substantial,  must be placed on the table, like ours." While specifying that  the military programming law "must not be used to maintain  outdated industrial structures," the Aerospatiale president  thinks that the French firms are in a pivotal position in the  reorganization of the sector in Europe thanks to the Leotard  plan.    This is an advantage which comes at the right time because  Louis Gallois is currently negotiating two proposed alliances  with its German partner DASA in missiles and satellites. "It  should be possible to settle these projects before the end of  the year," he said, expressing the view that "we must aim at  something resembling a balance between the partners." However,  "these alliances are not ends in themselves, they are not  closed," the Aerospatiale president added, explaining that it  will be necessary to think quickly about a possible  rapprochement between the two Matra-BAe [British Aerospace] and  Aerospatiale-DASA tandems in missiles and an opening of the  Aerospatiale-DASA alliance to the French company Alcatel in the  satellite sphere. With regard to military activities, it will  then be necessary "to go and seek alliances in the United  States."</p>

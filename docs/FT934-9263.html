			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Disney's big dipper The real world keeps intruding on Euro Disney's fantasy. Yesterday's decision to change its accounting policies is a clear indication that the decks are being cleared for a fresh injection of equity. By charging start-up costs directly to the profit and loss instead of capitalising them on the balance sheet, the company is saving future depreciation. The returns to any future investors will thus look greater, even if the immediate result has been to decimate the balance sheet. Under US accounting standards, net assets per share work out at little more than FFr2. Shame on those who fought for the mandate to sell the paper to investors at 707p in 1989. Euro Disney's new management is applying itself with noble persistence to the task of boosting the project's revenues. But it faces two daunting obstacles. The first is that by cutting prices and adding facilities it is diluting the operational gearing that comes into play with increased attendance. The second is that the project can never generate enough cash to service its FFr21bn debt. Even with the help of eventual economic recovery and a weaker French franc, it is hard to see Euro Disney supporting more than half that amount. The equity injection will thus need to be at least FFr10bn to FFr11bn, which puts Walt Disney on the spot. Without its support the project may simply close, causing irreparable damage to the Disney name. But the amount is large for it to shoulder on its own. One solution might be to seek a trade partner who might find use for the excessively lavish hotels, perhaps by adding conference facilities. In the absence of a second park, the surplus hotel capacity is certainly a heavy drag. A more scary thought is that, having squandered the proceeds of its flotation, a restructured Euro Disney might come back to the market for more. That, as they say, is show business.</p>

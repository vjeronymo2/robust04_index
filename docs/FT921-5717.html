			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Arts: Sallinen's 'Kullervo' - Los Angeles Kullervo is Aulis Sallinen's fourth opera. Since in their different ways his previous three - The Horseman (1974), The Red Line (1979), The King Goes Forth to France (Savonlinna 1984, Covent Garden 1987) - rank among the most striking additions to the medium in the postwar period, their successor was impatiently awaited. It was written (between 1986 and 1988) to open the new Helsinki opera house. As, however, that momentous date in Finnish cultural history has been continually postponed by construction problems on site, the Finnish National Opera finally decided to give the first four Kullervo performances (from February 25) at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. By chance, this was the first-ever operatic premiere at the Center. Production (by Kalle Holmberg), conductor (Ulf Soderblom, company principal), cast of 13 - led by the internationally renowned baritone Jorma Hynninen - and chorus were all Finnish National visitors. The excellent Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra was the only local element. The miracle of the modern Finnish opera boom is a topic already more than once discussed on this page; the existence of this work and the quality of its first interpreters demonstrate that it continues undimmed. Opening night, altogether an exciting occasion, offered a superbly confident and disciplined ensemble performance, with absolutely none of the usual premiere problems. While hardly relieved in the brutality of its subject matter, Kullervo - in two acts, lasting nearly three hours, for large forces (including synthesiser) - is lit with counteracting flares of lyric tenderness and farcical irony, and grandly achieved: a modern operatic epic based on folk legend that proves to have alarming resonances for our own day. The source of the libretto, which Sallinen wrote himself, is the Kalevala, the epic folk-poem which since first collection and publication (in 1835) has inspired countless Finnish writers, painters and composers, Sibelius at their head. Sallinen drew on Cantos 31-36, for general inspiration and also for choral passages of direct quotation; but he also took the play Kullervo by the 19th-century dramatist Aleksis Kivi as a model for his expansion and sometimes free treatment of the subject. To judge from the English translation, the libretto is an inspired combination of dramatic directness and economy. Against a background of violence almost unabated, the figure of Kullervo - clan-leader's son become slave, murderer, unwitting incest-practiser, and finally warlord and arsonist - stands as focal point of the poem's, and the opera's, tragic pessimism. The feud between his father Kalervo and uncle Unto, which frames his youth in hideous acts of destruction and which he settles at the end, forms the foundation on which the narrative structure rests; the main theme - the causal connection between a violent society and a violent individual - is elaborated in the succession of scenes and episodes. Love, of Kullervo's mother for her son, of Kullervo and his youthful friend Kimmo, tempers the bleakness but not the inevitability of the 'forza del destino' which renders Kullervo something of a cross between Oedipus and Verdi's Alvaro. In two long acts Sallinen concentrates with mature authority on telling the tale, not underlining the 'relevance' of the message: he leaves that to emerge of its own accord, which it does with a baleful thrust. (The critic of the Los Angeles Times wondered what it all had to do with the host city; others alert to parallels with the city's gang-war epidemic saw the point without difficulty.) Sallinen's idiom, variously indebted to Sibelius, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Britten and Strauss yet entirely 'personal' in its linguistic command, will once again disconcert the modernists. He makes simple devices work wonders across large spans of theatrical time - long-held pedal points, sequential repetitions, unison lines of voices and instruments, a constant dramatic punctuation with percussion, lyrical phrases almost absurdly effective in their shape and placement. This opera is at root a theatrical ballad, using voices to carry the drama and instruments to provide the subcutaneous commentary - a conception of the medium perhaps old-fashioned (at least to some) but made potently modern, and tinglingly dramatic, by the accuracy and security of Sallinen's theatrical instincts. He appears to me to share with Poulenc, a composer otherwise so utterly different in approach, personality, and range, the ability to deploy 'received' material in unexpected ways. A pseudo-catchy air for a Blind Singer at the start of Act 2 is the single possibly ill-judged episode; for the rest, the power accrues unremittingly. Holmberg's production, in a mixture of modern and ancient dress set within a bleak grey concrete frame, steers clear of folkishness. At times the constant movement of characters on and off stage seemed quirky; on the whole the staging built up an explosive intensity, which was discharged most vigorously in the choral singing and in too many exactly focussed character-cameos to list here. Three outstanding principals deserve at least brief mention: the sappy, sweet-toned Kimmo of Jorma Silvasti, the achingly poignant Mother of Eeva-Liisa Saarinen and the great Hynninen (a singer regularly heard in every leading opera-theatre except Covent Garden - why?) as Kullervo. This last strikes me as one of the supreme performances of recent years: embodied with lean, hard, deeply troubled stillness and sung in tones darkened since the days of The Red Line but still matchlessly full, free and beautiful. How marvellous it would be if a way could be found for Finnish National Opera to pay London a visit, their first for a decade, with the express purpose of showing off this important new work and its magnificent leading man.</p>

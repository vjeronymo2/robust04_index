			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALICIA DE LARROCHA IN RECITAL AT ROYCE HALL  </P> <P> Alicia de Larrocha's latest recital program was a curious, but utterly  characteristic, thing of clear contrasts and an understated progression from  comparative abstraction to full-bodied pictorialism. Tuesday evening at Royce  Hall, she paired Schubert with an Iberian group; her previous recital here this  season had matched Mendelssohn and Albeniz.  </P> <P> In the overheated hall, the 65-year-old pianist began slowly, with a detached,  ill-balanced account of Schubert's C-minor Impromptu, D. 899, No. 1. She  communicated a much greater degree of involvement in a fleet performance of the  A-flat Impromptu, No. 4, in the same set.  </P> <P> The Sonata in A, D. 664, elicited a fully engaged performance. Larrocha allowed  the sentiment and lyricism gracious space, while keeping formal shapes taut, in  direct, evenly modulated playing.  </P> <P> After intermission, Larrocha switched from pastels to primary colors in oil for  a set culminating in Turina's "Sanlucar de Barrameda," appropriately subtitled  "Sonata Pintoresca." Her boldly etched, expressive playing clarified textures  and thematic links as well as painted moods with idiomatic flair.  </P> <P> Larrocha's complete control of rhythmic and articulative nuance, and her  formidable sense of concentrated direction, well served the "Tres Danzas  Caracteristicas" of Oscar Espla. She unwound the Habanera with sinuous ease,  let the Ronda Serrana glitter naturally, and drove the Sonatina Playera with  indomitable zest.  </P> <P> The "Sonatina pour Ivette" by Xavier Montsalvatge is at once austere and  playful, aristocratically ordered and vividly earthy. Larrocha set it forth  with clarity and brio, alert to inner tensions as well as surface sparkle.  </P> <P> In encore, Larrocha furthered the cause of sophisticated Iberiana with a  tenderly introverted account of Mompou's "El Secreto," and an intensely vital  performance of Falla's "Dance of Terror" from "El Amor Brujo," delivered as a  single fiery impulse.

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Premiers 'knew of illicit funding' Two former Christian Democrat prime ministers of Italy knew about the large-scale illicit financing of the party, a Milan court heard yesterday. Mr Severino Citaristi, party treasurer from 1986 until March this year, made the accusations against Mr Ciriaco De Mita and Mr Arnaldo Forlani. It is the first time in a court that a Christian Democrat party leader has been said to have had direct knowledge of illicit financing. Mr Citaristi has received 64 separate notices of investigation from 12 different sets of magistrates for corruption and illicit financing - the most of any single politician in the corruption scandals. He has not denied the charges but refused to accept political responsibility for his illicit money-collecting activities. Yesterday he described his activities when he gave evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a politically influential consultant close to the Socialist party who is alleged to have handled part of the L150bn (Pounds 60m) bribe paid by Ferruzzi-Montedison to arrange the reorganisation of the petrochemicals industry - the so-called Enimont affair. Mr Citaristi said his party needed up to L65bn in a normal year and L90bn in an election year, of which half came illicitly. He told the court how Mr De Mita, then party leader, told him to contact Mr Raul Gardini, then head of Ferruzzi-Montedison, to obtain a contribution. Mr Gardini handed over L2bn. Between 1988 and 1992 a further L7bn was paid by the group. In another development yesterday, the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission issued an alarming report on the influence of organised crime in the Naples area. The report specifically identified Mr Antonio Gava, a former Christian Democrat interior minister and now a senator, as being a key link figure with the Camorra, the Naples mafia. Mr Gava, already under investigation for such links, is said to have organised an influence-sharing deal with crime bosses in the distribution of L50,000bn funds for the 1982 Irpinia earthquake as part of a ransom for Mr Cirio Cirillo, a powerful local politician. The report also detailed the power of the Camorra's 111 clans and 6,700 members. It said 32 municipal councils in the Naples area had been dissolved for links with organised crime (against 19 in all Sicily), 16 out of 31 magistrates were under criminal investigation; while eight members of parliament risked prosecution for links with the Camorra.</p>

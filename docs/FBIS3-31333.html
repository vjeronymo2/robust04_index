			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Omer Vatric report from Mostar] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is very cold in Mostar, and  it is freezing in people's flats as there is a real fuel crisis.  There is no electricity for the eighth month running and it is  uncertain when there will be any. There is no drinking water  and no food has come into the town lately. No humanitarian aid  convoy has come for days. There are increasingly shortages of  medicine and those most needed are unobtainable for days at a  time. There is a constant crisis with medicines to cure ulcers,  epilepsy, (?hypertension), and many other diseases.    A special problem is the lack of fuel for the hospital  generator, municipal vehicles, and other vital needs of the  town. As the Mostar Commune War Presidency reports, it is  already the fourth time that the Croatian Defense Council has  turned back fuel that the UNHCR has tried to take to the  hospital on the left bank [of the Neretva]. In a word, the  situation in Mostar is critical and it is becoming increasingly  difficult every day.</p>

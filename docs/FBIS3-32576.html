This visit will contribute to strengthening the  bilateral ties between Colombia and Cuba following the  resumption, just over three months ago, of diplomatic relations  between the two countries.    Today Lage will meet with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  and, during his official visit to Colombia, will meet with the  ministers of foreign trade, agriculture, economic development,  and health.    Before returning to our country, Lage, who is also secretary  of the executive committee of the Council of Ministers, will  meet with the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic,  which sets and regulates the nation's financial and fiscal  policy.    Tomorrow, invited by the powerful National Association of  Industrialists, Lage Davila will attend a working breakfast with  representatives of that association, of exporters associations,  of financial institutions, and of small and medium-sized  industries, among others.</p>

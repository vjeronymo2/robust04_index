			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: HUGE LOTTERY PAYOUT RAISES SOME QUESTIONS  </P> <P> Question: The recent California Lottery that was worth more than $60 million  has raised a question in my mind. Winners are paid over a 20-year span. Suppose  a winner dies after only five years. Will all California Lottery payments stop  immediately, or will the winner's heirs continue to receive them for another 15  years? -- R.B.  </P> <P> Question No. 2: This trend in the lottery toward "pooling" money interests me.  Doesn't this greatly magnify the work -- the payout -- for the state when,  instead of a single winner, they have 10, 20 or 30 winners? -- K.F.  </P> <P> Answer: First question first -- a million dollars is a million dollars is a  million dollars. If you hold a lottery ticket worth a million dollars, to be  paid out over 20 years, then that's what you, or someone, is going to receive.  Yes, if you don't make it the full 20 years, then your heirs will pick it up.  </P> <P> Players have been "pooling" tickets since the lottery began. How popular this  practice has become, though, didn't really attract much attention until the  giant pay-out of $60 million, which involved two pools -- one of about 25  players and the other of about 16.  </P> <P> Because the average American moves about once every four years (there's another  average for you), and because during the next 20 years a few of the winners  will probably die, who's going to keep the records straight in making sure that  all pool members get their fair share every time the annual pay-out comes  around?  </P> <P> "We make only a single pay-out each year (to the person whose name is on the  ticket)," the Lottery's assistant director of public affairs, John Schade,  says. "The pools have to make their own arrangements about the division of it."  </P> <P> The lottery's advice for pool players: "They should definitely have a written  agreement spelling out the division and how the records will be kept. Our  lawyers say it probably isn't necessary to have it drawn up by a lawyer, or  even have it notarized, but everyone definitely must sign it."  </P> <P> Once a big win has been scored, of course, it might be a good idea to have the  agreement looked over by a lawyer, and it is definitely advisable to retain a  third party -- a trust company, bank or some other intermediary who will be in  business for a good 20 years -- which, for a fee, will keep the books, keep  track of address changes, keep track of the heirs of deceased winners and, once  a year, will make the actual disbursements.  </P> <P> "I suppose," Schade adds, "that in the case of out-and-out fraud, or someone  absconding with the money, or something like that, we, at the lottery -- since  it's spread over 20 years -- would probably step in and get a judgment to  protect the others. But, other than that, it's up to the players themselves."  </P> <P>  Campbell cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  consumer questions of general interest.

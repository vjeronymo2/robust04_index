			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS CRITICIZE D.A. ON PACE OF POLL-GUARD INQUIRY  </P> <P> A group of Latino Democrats, angry with the pace of an investigation into the  Republican Party's use of uniformed poll guards during last November's  election, had some sharp words for the Orange County district attorney's office  Friday.  </P> <P> "We express our outrage, our anger, and our shame at the absence of criminal  charges filed against those responsible for posting uniformed security guards .  . . at predominantly Hispanic polling places," said Rueben Martinez, county  Democratic Party treasurer, at a news conference in Santa Ana. "It has been 10  months since our pride as American citizens was violated; the district attorney  has yet to file charges."  </P> <P> The county Republican Party spent about $4,000 to station uniformed guards at  polling places in 20 largely Latino precincts in Santa Ana last Election Day.  They were hired at the suggestion of a political consultant for state  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who won the 72nd District election  by fewer than 900 votes.  </P> <P> County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes has said he authorized the hiring  of the guards because of rumors that illegal voters were to be bused in to aid  the Democratic candidate in the Assembly race, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach.  </P> <P> County Democrats and Latino groups say the stationing of the guards at the  polling places, and the guards' questioning of voters about their citizenship  status, violated state and federal laws against interfering with elections and  intimidating voters.  </P> <P> Martinez said Friday he was not pointing a finger at Pringle or Fuentes  specifically, but only wanted the district attorney's office "to use the same  diligence against those who steal our rights as those who steal our property."  </P> <P> Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, who is heading the county's  investigation into the incident, said no decision has been made yet on whether  to file charges. And, he said, he could not predict when the decision might be  made.  </P> <P> "The investigation's still going on," Wade said. "We have been doing  interviews, we've done some within this month. . . . We're analyzing some  written materials. . . . I can understand if some of the community members are  anxious to know what our conclusion is."  </P> <P> Wade said one reason the investigation has not gone more quickly is that it is  being conducted jointly with the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office. "We have  to coordinate with other agencies," he said. "There are just a whole bunch of  factors."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law a measure  prohibiting armed or uniformed security guards at polling places. The measure,  which met little resistance in the Legislature, was written in reaction to the  Santa Ana incident.  </P> <P> A civil lawsuit against Pringle, Fuentes and several other Republicans, which  was filed by six Latino voters who claim they were intimidated by the guards,  is also pending. One defendant, the security firm that provided the guards,  settled with the plaintiffs earlier this year for $60,000.  </P></p>

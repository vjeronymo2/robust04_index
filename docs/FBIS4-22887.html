The disease has been  referred to by various names, including sunflower phomopsis in  the Western literature. Sunflower stem brown-spot was first  detected in Russia in the Stavropol Kray in 1990. Foci of the  disease have since been recorded in the other regions of the  Stavropol and Krasnodar krays, Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, and  Rostov Oblast of the Central Caucasus and in three oblasts in  the Central Chernozem region. Mycological and phytopathological  analyses of specimens of brown-spot-infected sunflower stems  collected throughout the affected regions confirmed Ph.  helianthi, which was first identified as the cause of  sunflower stem canker in Yugoslavia in 1981 and first detected  in the former USSR in 1985, to be the causative agent. Studies  have shown that one of the reasons for the appearance of stem  brown-spot now is the fact that infected seed material from  affected regions of the former USSR are still being used.  Further spread of the disease through contaminated seed material  is also likely. Ph. helianthi has a definite  variability that is manifested in pure cultures in the form of  different colorations of the mycelium, in the formation of two  types of spores in the pycnidium (_a_- and _b_-spores in the  strains A and B, respectively), and in variation of its  pathogenic properties to sunflower specimens. Strains with _a_-  and _b_- spores in their pycnidia have been established to have  a similar pathogenicity upon artificial inoculation. Both  strains have shown definite intraspecial physiological and  morphological diversity. Ph. helianthi thrives at  higher temperatures than other sunflower pathogens  (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis  cinerea) do. In various nutrient media, Ph.  helianthi growth and spore formation are most intense  between 20 and 25C. Growth and development of the fungus  are sharply inhibited by 30C, and they cease completely at  35C. Field studies have shown the disease to be most  intense at air temperatures of 10 to 20C with absolute  temperature fluctuations from 5.6C at night to 28.3C  during the day. The most effective preventive measures appear to  be the use of resistant varieties and the use of fungicides.  Russian research to protect sunflowers against the disease has  been extremely limited. The sunflower lines VIR 130 and VIR 160  and the hybrid Krasnodarskiy 885 appear to have the highest  resistance to stem brown-spot, whereas the varieties  Berezanskiy, Yenisey, and Ultraskorospelyy appear to have the  lowest resistance. Studies conducted abroad have established  several fungicides that appear to be effective against the  disease. The fungicides Ronilan and Rovral have been approved  for use on sunflowers in Russia. Fungicides should be applied to  sunflowers three times: before they button, when or soon after  they first flower, and at the end of flowering. Tables 5;  references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING OUR EYES ON THE ERADICATION GOAL;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN QUESTION SPRAYING. BUT RATHER THAN GIVE IN TO THE  BUG, WE MUST PERSUADE THESE OBJECTORS THAT THE RISK IS VERY LOW.  </P> <P> At the height of the Santa Clara County Medfly War in the early 1980s, an  entomologist stirred up a storm by questioning whether the pest could be  eradicated. Now another entomologist has expressed those same doubts about the  current effort in Southern California.  </P> <P> Make no doubt about it, a UC Berkeley entomologist knows a thousand times more  about the science of entomology than most of us. So did the entomologist who  questioned the Santa Clara eradication effort. But history shows that the Santa  Clara infestation was eradicated and the entomologist was wrong.  </P> <P> There are many differences and similarities between the current Medfly battle  and the one in Northern California nearly a decade ago. Scientists can be found  on both sides of the issue. Some contend that you can win; others aren't so  sure. This is the nature of science, and it has become one of the most  frustrating parts of the ongoing food safety debate. Science is inexact and  ever changing.  </P> <P> But there is a consensus on one thing -- that rhetoric and fear have no place  in determining public policy regarding pesticides. The Natural Resources  Defense Council was irresponsible in scaring and confusing the public about the  pesticide Alar and apples. A person would have to eat more than 28,000 pounds  of Alar-treated apples every day for 70 years to approach the exposure levels  that produce ill effects in the laboratory. We need to be aware that our  interpretation of facts, based on our own experience and biases, will be  different from the interpretation of someone who has decided to make a living  exploiting the public's concern for the environment. Somewhere in the middle is  the public, not sure which scientist or which special-interest group to  believe.  </P> <P> Critics are correct when they note that what is regarded as safe now may turn  out to be dangerous later. What they don't say is that some risk is necessary,  or more correctly, inevitable and we should try our hardest to deal with it.  </P> <P> Many people don't agree with the UC Berkeley entomologist and others whose  "doubts are growing" over the potential success of the current eradication  efforts. These same people might listen to Roy Cunningham, who chairs the  state's Medfly scientific advisory panel and is a veteran of infestation  battles in California and elsewhere. He is "confident" the Medfly can be  eradicated. Cunningham is not alone in his optimism. A UC Davis entomologist  agrees with him.  </P> <P> Aerial application of the malathion syrup over populated areas has been  accepted as as a necessary means of eradication since the Santa Clara  situation. The big loser there was not the public but former Gov. Edmund G.  Brown Jr., who originally opposed the spraying.  </P> <P> Still, one cannot blame some residents for expressing concern when the  helicopter flies over, not once, but several times. They are confused and  rightly concerned. Then you have the opportunists and others who move in to  grab headlines and notoriety by feeding on those fears. They choose not to  accept the latest studies, also from the Santa Clara experience, which  disclosed no increase in health problems or birth defects after the Medfly  battle there.  </P> <P> Learning to live with the Medfly is not an acceptable alternative to  agriculture or the rest of California. Those who believe such cohabitation is  possible miss the real environmental concern -- the increase in pesticide use  that would have to be made in the back yards of Southern Californians to allow  them to grow their avocados and tomatoes and all the other myriad fruits and  vegetables that are favored by home gardeners. Add to that the increased  application that would be required in commercial agriculture, and you have a  good reason to resolve to fight the Medfly, not learn to live with it.  </P> <P> Certainly there are people in Southern California vehemently opposed to the  current Medfly eradication effort. Many of them are reasonable people. We must  persuade them that the risks, real or imagined, are so low, so remote that  eradication is the only logical course.  </P></p>

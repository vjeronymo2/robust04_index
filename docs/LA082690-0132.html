			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY DEATHS  </P> <P> Whoa! Just a minute. Since when is it Caltrans' responsibility to protect  lawbreakers ("Mother Learns Her Boy Died Crossing I-5," Aug. 17)?  </P> <P> It is a damn shame there have been so many killed while trying to bolt across  the freeways in their attempt to avoid the checkpoints. But let's put the blame  where it belongs, and it is not Caltrans.  </P> <P> It is squarely on the people who are doing the running, and in this case the  fault of the mother (sorry to say) who took six kids and tried to run across  eight lanes of highway. Please don't try to tell me she did not know it was  dangerous.  </P> <P> DON MORRISON  </P> <P> Ramona  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn with unidentified reporters </F> in Amman on 16 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Husayn] I would like to say that from the outset we  had the feeling that the peace process to which we have always  committed ourselves toward the establishment of a just, durable  peace for future generations to enjoy and cherish and protect,  because it is hopefully going to be a just peace and, therefore,  a durable one -- we realized from the outset that it was going  to take time and efforts and patience. But even by my standards  I believe that a lot of time has passed, and that it has been  wasted, and that the approach to peace has not been  characterized by the required determination by all parties to  the conflict, and all involved in trying to get it to achieve  its objectives are sponsoring these efforts; that all this has  with the passage of time caused a psychological setback so that  the overwhelming majority of people in this region who showed  great optimism and enthusiasm for peace have had their hopes  dampened with the passage of time.    As far as I am concerned, it is a time for all to reassess  and to move deliberately and seriously to achieve the desired  results. No more time can be wasted. As for violence, we abhor  and condemn it wherever it occurs. This is the history of  Jordan, which has suffered as a result of violence and which has  stood time and again squarely in the face of violence as it  affected innocent people anywhere in the world. This does not  change or waver. But violence in the recent times is most  disturbing and distressing and the zenith of violence was the  tragedy that occurred in Hebron on a Friday morning and in the  mosque. Beyond that, there have been actions and reactions and  our hearts go out to the victims and to the families of the  victims, wherever they be and whoever they are.    But in regard to that dimension as well, I feel that the  Government of Israel should admit, or have the courage to admit,  that it has, and it bears, a responsibility in terms of violence  that has been growing in the occupied territories and in the  region.    On the other hand, I feel very, very strongly that the  unfortunate target of the Hebron massacre or any other act that  has followed is the peace process, is the hope for a different  region were people can live under conditions which had been  denied us over a very, very long period of time, in fact, which  we haven't known throughout our lives. If this is the case,  then something has to be done about it, and there has to be the  realization that such acts are carried out to drive us away from  the goal of attaining and achieving a just, honorable, durable  peace in the region.    On an internal Jordanian matter -- before the prime  minister of Israel and the foreign minister of Israel made their  statements -- we, on the highest level of authority in this  country, have been looking at developments in the region and had  decided to reemphasize our unwavering position adopted after  deep discussion at the Rabat summit in 1974 recognizing and  nominating the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the  people of Palestine in response to a Palestinian wish and Arab  wish, with which we agreed. And ever since then we have tried  to our utmost to realize this position in terms in every action  that we have taken, including providing the umbrella for the  joint delegation, in other words, the Jordanian-Palestinian  delegation, to go to Madrid, the Palestinians being the  representatives of the Palestinian people regarding their rights  on their legitimate soil -- and despite the surprise of Oslo we  had to adhere, as we always do to our policy and perspective,  and we emphasize the need to support the PLO. And, more  concretely, we ratified the Jordanian-Israeli agenda following  the ratification of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in  Washington in support of the Palestinians and their right to act  in terms of the interests of the Palestinian people on  Palestinian soil, and to move to resolve our own problems. So,  this is the background.    As far as we are concerned on this land, the territories of  the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we do not recognize or accept  to cooperate with anybody representing or professing to  represent our Palestinian brethren except the Palestine  Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of  the people of Palestine, through its recognized organs and  representatives here in Jordan. Any other group is illegal in  terms of any actions it takes or position it feels or claims to  represent. And I call upon all Jordanians to realize this fact,  and to adhere to this consistent policy that has been that of  the government and the kingdom over so many years.    [Unidentified reporter] What is the legal status of the  Hamas  presence in Jordan, and are you planning to take any action  against them to ensure that the PLO remains the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinians?    [Husayn] There is no legal status.    [Reporter] I mean [Hamas leaders] Mr. Nazzal and Mr.  Ghawshah...    [Husayn,interrupting] I think that if they chose to behave  as  Jordanians, then that's fine, they will be amongst the other  Jordanians, members of this family. If they choose otherwise,  then they will have to answer for that, but there is no legal  status.    [Reporter] Your Majesty, it was the first time that since  the  beginning of the peace process that Jordan links its  continuation of its participation in the peace process to a  condition, which is in this case the lifting of the blockade of  al-'Aqabah. Now, can we deduce from here that in view of these  pressures it is becoming, and due to the declining enthusiasms  for the peace process, Jordan feels that the price of continuing  the peace process--in view of these pressures--is becoming too  high, and that Jordan at one point, due to public opinion  pressure, or due to economic pressure, reconsider its role in  the peace process, or its participation to begin with?    [Husayn] Nothing could be further from the truth. I think  others should review their positions regarding the peace  process. Jordan has not backed away, nor has Jordan showed any  reluctance to serious dialogue and negotiations towards  achieving the resolution of all our standing problems as  outlined in the Jordanian-Israeli agenda leading to the desired  peace and peace treaty as a crowning achievement of resolving  these problems. We have been ready. We don't see anybody  responding to that yet.    So we hope that not only on this track but on every track  we will see movement so that the final result is a comprehensive  peace that we all seek for this entire region.    Regarding al-'Aqabah, we feel that there was a deliberate  policy to pick out Jordan from all the neighbors of Iraq  following the tragedy of the Gulf and to treat it in a manner  that is unacceptable. We've tried to correct this by every  means possible over the years, but things have reached the point  where we would like to know what is this policy and what is its  objective and who is behind this policy. Is it the Security  Council? Is it one single nation? Is it the coalition of  countries of the Gulf war? We find it deeply humiliating and we  find that one of the obvious objectives is to tarnish the  credibility of Jordan. We accepted Security Council resolutions  as they affect Iraq and we implemented them and we are  implementing them. But the integrity and credibility of this  country is something that we can't bargain over.    And in fact these recent accusations of Jordan and Jordan's  involvement with terror, contrary to everything else known about  this country, may unfortunately, whether intentionally or  otherwise, fall in the same stream.    Regarding the Gulf crisis, our position was honorable and  was  one of concern regarding all in this region, and then eagerness  to try to resolve the terrible mistake by Arab means and within  the context of the Arab family. Unfortunately, we were unable  to do nothing that would have brought us close to our targets,  we were unable to succeed with either side in terms of the  powers that stood facing each other until the disaster occurred.  We are unhappy about the conditions of the people of Iraq. We  are really concerned with them. As far as the policies of the  government and the leadership of Iraq, we have nothing to do  with their policies and unfortunately the last time I was able  to discuss policies with the leadership in Iraq was the time I  visited Baghdad before the war, and I came back brokenhearted  because I met failure there, as I had met it with the coalition  and with the other parties to the terrible tragedy that has  occurred there.    We have accepted the Security Council resolutions. We have  implemented them. We are implementing them to the best of our  ability. So what is the sense of continuing this situation as  far as al-'Aqabah is concerned? We would like to know what is  happening and we would like to have assurances that we are close  to the end of this situation before we are able to determine  exactly where we go from here. But as far as the peace process  is concerned, we are very interested in it. In fact, we did  more to get it to move in the first place than any. And here,  I'd like to point out that we did not go as a government alone.  We had, to the best of our ability, a debate in this country  through a meeting that was attended by all elected bodies in  this country and representative bodies looked at our options and  decided to go. We did not go there because of any pressure. We  do not succumb to pressure, from any quarter. We go... [pauses]  whatever we do in this world, driven by our conscience and our  sense of responsibility towards our people and the people in  this region and the future of all.</p>

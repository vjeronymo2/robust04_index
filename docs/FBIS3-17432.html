The Russian leader also said, "What stirs our admiration is  that Italian authorities interpret partnership between Russia  and Western countries in the true sense of the word. This makes  it possible to construct equitable and productive relations,"  added Yeltsin.    Also taking part in the meeting were Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and the president's advisor on international affairs,  Dimitriy Ryurikov.    At the end of this meeting, Andreatta went to the Kozyrev's  residence where the two foreign ministers continued their talk.    The Italian minister arrived in Moscow in the evening  yesterday. In the afternoon today, after a meeting with  journalists at the Italian Embassy here, Andreatta will leave  Moscow to travel to Tallinn and Vilnius for talks with Estonian  and Lithuanian leaders.    Andreatta arrived here in his role as duty-president of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Group  of Seven ministerial councils. His talks were expected to  center on Bosnia, the CSCE activities and on greater  participation by Russia in the context of the Group of Seven  leading industrial nations, scheduled to hold their annual  summit in Naples in early July.</p>

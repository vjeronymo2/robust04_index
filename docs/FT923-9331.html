			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Examination of high-security psychiatric care announced THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced an examination of high-security psychiatric care in the wake of evidence of bullying, and physical and sexual assault at Ashworth Hospital, Merseyside. Seven members of the hospital's staff have been suspended. They face charges of gross misconduct and three are accused of assault. The health department said that Dr Joseph Sylvester, Ashworth's medical director, was relinquishing his post and Mr Brian Johnson, the general manager, was being moved to other duties. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said she was 'deeply disturbed' by the findings of an inquiry led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission. This was set up to investigate the death of Mr Sean Walton, who died in a locked seclusion room at the hospital in 1988. Mrs Bottomley said that the report identified urgently needed changes in the way Ashworth looked after its patients. Some practices described in the inquiry report could not be defended. A task force would ensure that changes were carried out at Ashworth. Another working party, which is studying the care of mentally disordered offenders, would look at the wider role of top-security special hospitals, which house offenders and other people with serious mental illnesses. While mental health organisations generally welcomed Mrs Bottomley's announcement, Sir Louis described the government's proposed action as a 'less than wholehearted response' to the inquiry's request for a fundamental review of the special hospital system. The report's recommendations include ending the use of controversial control and restraint techniques, setting up a patients' advocacy service, training staff in handling complaints and urgently reviewing the dress and demeanour of staff to see whether they are appropriate to a therapeutic environment. The report describes managers at Ashworth as having little power. As a result, it says, the vacuum was filled by members of the Prison Officers' Association whose main priority was security. The POA said that allegations of brutality by Ashworth staff were not supported by firm evidence. Mr David Evans, general secretary, said staff had undergone police and internal inquiries that had failed to produce hard evidence.</p>

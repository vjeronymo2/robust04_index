			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with South Yemen Vice President 'Abd-al-Rahman </F> al-Jifri by "m. ans." in Aden; date not given: "We Will Never  Surrender, We Will Fight One Street at the Time" -- first  paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Aden -- A huge sapphire ring on his finger, his red  and white kaffiyeh elegantly resting on his shoulders,  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri stroked his short, square beard.  Yesterday he was elected South Yemen's vice president -- and  ever since head of state al-Bid took refuge in his native  Hadramut region, in the east, al-Jifri has become the highest  political authority in Aden. Before starting the interview,  al-Jifri -- who is 55 years old, and a long-standing member of  Yemen's Socialist Party -- checked that the telephones were not  bugged. Finally, he lifted one himself, looked underneath, and  said: "No bugs, we can begin."    [LA REPUBBLICA] Doctor al-Jifri, the war between North and  South Yemen broke out after a union which lasted barely four  years. What has come between Sanaa and Aden?    [Al-Jifri] The problem is Salih. At a certain point, the  northern leader took it into his head to control everything and  everybody, establishing definite hierarchies. They have a  certain system and they want to bring it here, but this is  impossible because we have a democratic orientation and we do  not accept impositions from anybody. Apart from that, we know  Salih well: You cannot trust anything he says. He tells heaps  of lies. Breaking the cease-fire is a blatant example...    [LA REPUBBLICA] However, you also broke the cease-fire by  firing a Scud into Sanaa.    [Al-Jifri] We did not fire any missiles.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Who was it, then?    [Al-Jifri] I repeat, we did not break the cease-fire.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Doctor al-Jifri, what then is the military  situation around your al-'Anad air base?    [Al-Jifri] The situation is excellent. We had a few problems  in the beginning. They took the initiative first, and we  responded.    [LA REPUBBLICA] However, there was then a partial withdrawal  on your part...    [Al-Jifri] This was purely tactical. In fact, our move took  them by surprise, and now the southern area is entirely in our  hands. They are still shelling us from the north.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What distance are the northerners from Aden?    [Al-Jifri] Sixty kilometers. However, we recently destroyed  one of their trucks, blocked eight of their tanks. In short, we  chased them back beyond the mountains. Aden is safe, no problem  there.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Let us suppose, for a minute, that the north  manages to close in, aiming to conquer Aden...    [Al-Jifri] They are incapable of that. The people will  fight, fight, fight. This is the key point.    [LA REPUBBLICA] However, war is not simply a matter of will.    [Al-Jifri] We have a just cause to defend our country. And  we will do so, if need be, one street at the time, one house at  the time. Furthermore, we have new, fresh forces joining us all  the time.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Meaning conscripts, rounded up and sent to  the front.    [Al-Jifri] No, they are militiamen, in short, reservists.  They need a couple of days' training and then, indeed, they do  go to the front.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What steps are you taking at international  level to try to put an end to this war?    [Al-Jifri] We are striving to obtain other nations' full  consensus, and many of them have requested the northern leaders  to stop. But if the latter do not, what can we do? Salih does  not at all mind killing civilians, he only wants money and power.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you think the situation will now  develop?    [Al-Jifri] I believe our Yemen is here to stay, and that it  will become a modern state. We are convinced of this. I do not  believe the people in the north will accept that corrupt regime  which has divided the country and caused so much suffering.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you see in all this the possibility of a  diplomatic solution, or rather the continuation of war?    [Al-Jifri] I believe in diplomatic means to achieve peace.  But if diplomacy does not work, there are other means of  achieving peace.</p>

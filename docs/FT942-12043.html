			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Machine tools see Pounds 9m trade surplus Britain's machine tool industry notched up a trade surplus of Pounds 9m last year - its first since 1983 - spurred by strong growth in exports to countries outside the recession-torn European Union. Figures this week from the Machine Tool Technologies Association said total exports rose 4.4 per cent to Pounds 338.8m last year compared with 1992, while imports fell 19.9 per cent to Pounds 329.7m. The export performance is seen as particularly encouraging given the sharp fall in demand for machine tools in continental Europe, which has traditionally accounted for 55 per cent of UK exports. Exports to the European Union fell by 23 per cent, with sales to Germany, which is by far the largest market in Europe, recording a fall of 46 per cent. In contrast, exports to non-EU countries rose 25 per cent to Pounds 225m, with the main growth coming from the US, the biggest market for UK machine tools, to which exports rose 38 per cent to Pounds 70m. Spain jumped to second place with an increase of just under 300 per cent to Pounds 33m, while exports to China soared by 295 per cent to Pounds 25m. Exports to Pacific rim countries also grew significantly. The figures lend credence to claims by the industry, which is the eighth-largest such industry in the world, that it is well placed to win export business because of its productivity and competitiveness. The fall in imports to the UK last year is due partly to the arrival in 1992 of a large quantity of foreign machine tools for Japanese car plants. This contributed to a 1992 UK machine tool trade deficit of Pounds 82m. The export figures come as machine tool builders are seeing a sudden surge in inquiries and orders from UK manufacturing industry, which is regaining the confidence to buy equipment after the recession.</p>

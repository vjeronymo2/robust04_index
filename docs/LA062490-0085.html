			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOLDT BRIGHTENS WEST'S OUTLOOK IN 10-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Sean Boldt had played in the shadow of teammate Pat Treend for a long time.  </P> <P> Saturday, with not even a vestige of shade at the sun-drenched El Camino Real  High field, the right-handed pitcher made the most of his chance to shine,  scattering seven hits and six walks in Woodland Hills West's 10-0 victory over  Panorama City in an American Legion District 20 game. The win evened the  defending Legion World Series champion's record at 4-4.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 168-pound Boldt, who will be a senior this fall at El Camino Real,  watched Treend, the City Section 4-A Division co-Player of the Year, and Ryan  McGuire combine for a 19-2 record in leading El Camino Real to the City 4-A  championship game. Boldt played right field the last half of the year.  </P> <P> "I feel lost in right field," said Boldt, who pitched 2 2/3 innings without  giving up a run for the Conquistadores this past season. "There's nobody to  talk to."  </P> <P> It seems he might have found himself on the mound. Only in the top of the sixth  inning was Boldt in any real trouble against Panorama City, and by that time,  his offense had given him a 7-0 lead. After surrendering a double, walk and an  infield single, Boldt (1-1) got Panorama City's Robert Kite to ground into a  4-6-3 double play. That was effectively the last breath for Panorama City  (9-3). West scored two more runs in the seventh and one more in the eighth  before the 10-run rule was called into effect.  </P> <P> West Coach Don Hornback was pleased with Boldt's performance in light of his  limited work.  </P> <P> "Boldt was wonderful today," Hornback said. "He didn't even pitch three innings  all year and he throws like this. He is such a good athlete that he could get  up out of bed in the middle of December and throw strikes."  </P> <P> Paul Geller led West's offense with a single, double and three walks. Jason  Cohen and Del Marine added home runs.  </P></p>

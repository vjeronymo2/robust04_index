			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan is considering  dispatching peacekeeping troops to the Golan Heights, a Tokyo  daily reported Wednesday [2 March].    But top government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura denied the  TOKYO SHIMBUN report, saying, "It is not true that the  government is weighing the possibility of sending Self-Defense  Forces (SDF) units to the Golan Heights."    In the frontpage story in its Wednesday morning edition, the  TOKYO SHIMBUN reported Japan may dispatch around 50 members of  the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) to the Golan Heights, an  area occupied by Israel since it seized the territory from Syria  in 1967.    A total of 1,120 troops of the UN Disengagement Observer  Force (UNDOF) monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Syria in  an area determined by a May 1974 agreement on disengagement.    The report, quoting government sources, said the government  of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is seeking another  destination for Japanese peacekeepers after the current mission  in Mozambique finishes its duties following July elections there.    Takemura told a morning news conference that Tokyo has  received no request from the United Nations to join peacekeeping  operations in the Middle East.    The report quoted the sources as saying Japan is eyeing the  Middle East for its third peacekeeping mission, following SDF  dispatches to Cambodia and Mozambique.    Japan joined UN peacekeeping operations for the first time  in  1992 when it sent an engineer corps to Cambodia to help build  roads and bridges. It was the first time for Japanese troops to  go abroad for such duties since World War II.    The sources also favored the Middle East in light of  criticism of Japan's decision not to put its own citizens at  risk in the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, the daily said.    At the time, Japan made a 13 billion dollar financial  contribution to the U.S.-led multinational forces arrayed  against Iraq and also to three affected states of Egypt, Jordan  and Turkey, but after heated domestic debate decided against  sending military personnel.    The daily suggested that Japanese peacekeepers could be sent  to the Golan Heights to replace some of the logistics personnel  from Canada, but this would require arrangements with the UN and  Canada.    The UNDOF, which includes troops from Austria and Poland,  and  logistics personnel from Canada, has seen 31 fatalities but  there have been virtually no cease-fire violations since 1977.</p>

Debating with Left Democrat leader Achille Occhetto, his  main  electoral rival, Berlusconi was asked about a declaration from  an imprisoned Mafia boss late in February who said Sicilian  organised crime would be voting for Berlusconi. The Milan-based  tycoon, who threw his hat into the political ring in January,  first said he thought it was impossible to speculate if the  Mafia would vote in any one way.    When asked for an outright disclaimer, he then said he  failed  to see how a party entering an election for the first time could  be accused of links with the Mafia; then remarked that "anyone  can say they are going to vote for anyone else," leading  Occhetto, a major figure in the Progressive Alliance fighting  Berlusconi and the right-wingers, to comment: "I take note that,  three times over, no response was forthcoming."    The radio debate, a transcript of which was released  yesterday evening, went on the air amidst allegations to Go  Italy's left, from the moderate conservatives to radical  leftists, that ancien regime figures and ties are being recycled  in the new party's ranks, especially thanks to Berlusconi's  long-standing relationship with ex-Premier Bettino Craxi and his  discredited Socialist Party. At the same time, rumours began  circulating yesterday evening that Marcello Dell`Utri,  managing-director of Berlusconi's advertising arm Publitalia,  and already under investigation in Milan with others for false  company accounting, had been linked by a Mafia state's witness  to organised crime bosses.    Judicial sources would say only that Mafia boss Salvatore  Cancemi had been questioned recently by prosecutors from various  Italian cities, but refused to specify about what. The chief  prosecutor in Caltanisetta, Sicily, Giovanni Tinebra, added  today that the alleged links made with Cancemi's testimony were  "absolutely gratuitous."    Tinebra also joined the school of judicial thinking that  takes Cancemi's disclosures with a strong pinch of salt. The  turncoat, whose codename is Omega, has yet to be admitted to the  official witness protection programme.    Usually reliable judicial and investigative sources in Rome  said, however, that questioning of other Mafia witnesses seemed  to corroborate Cancemi's claims.    Other reports from judicial circles in Palermo said that one  line of investigation against Dell`Utri claims he was  responsible for recycling Mafia drug trafficking funds.    Allegations of links between Berlusconi, Dell`Utri and the  Mafia date back to the 1980s. Testimony from Berlusconi in June  1987 confirmed that, in 1975, Dell`Utri got Berlusconi to give a  suspected Mafia drug trafficker, Vittorio Mangano, a job as  bailiff at his villa at Arcore near Milan.    Other testimony from a financier, Filippo Rapisarda,  reported  conversations in late 1978 in which one Mafia boss, Domenico  Teresi, visiting the office of Rapisarda's then partner  Dell`Utri, told him Berlusconi had suggested he should enter a  partnership with him in a private TV station, in an operation  "worth 10 billion lire." 1978 was about the time when  Berlusconi started building his TV and media empire.    Fighting these and other allegations such that Sicilian  branches of his department store chain, Standa, are run jointly  with Mafia figures, Berlusconi, arriving for a Go Italy rally at  Palermo's Mediterranean Fair, pledged that the votes his party  receives "in Sicily, Campania, Calabria and throughout Italy"  would all be votes against the Mafia. He also voiced his "deep  appreciation" for churchmen whom he described as "heroes" in the  front line against organised crime, a reference to yesterday's  slaying of a priest near Naples.    Over 7,000 supporters were reported as attending the rally  for which Berlusconi's TV networks created a live nationwide  tie-up. Figures released by the Berlusconi polling institute,  Diakron, for March 1, before the publication ban on poll  results, claimed about 30 percent of the vote for Go Italy and  40 percent in Sicily. Other polls have cited Go Italy at 20.25  percent nationwide.    In other points, Berlusconi answered northern demands for  federalism by saying that Italy will enjoy growth only if "North  and South march together."</p>

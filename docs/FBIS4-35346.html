			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] From the moment the secessionist rebels started the  fire of the all-out war in Yemen, certain strange positions  emerged. These positions raise questions regarding the hidden  intentions and reasons of those who adopted them.    The UN Security Council member states have announced that  they back and support the Yemeni unity. This stand was based on  the fact that the world community as a whole has recognized the  Republic of Yemen as a single political entity. However, very  regrettably, we began to hear whispers, and smell something  strange, that defy the legal and historical facts regarding the  formation of the Republic of Yemen from certain countries  despite their recognition of it.    Yemen is not like other countries that have racial,  religious, and ethnic problems. Paradoxically enough, we hear  at this stage some people trying to compare the Syrian-Egyptian  unity to the Yemeni unity. Here, we do not have to list the  excuses and proof of the invalidity of such thinking. All Arabs  know very well the difference between Yemen's unity and the  Syrian-Egyptian unity.    But as much as we are concerned for our unity, we the  Yemenis  are looking forward to the achievement of the comprehensive Arab  unity. On the other hand, the Yemeni unity, which is supposed to  form the cornerstone for a regional and, consequently, an Arab  unity should win the support of every Arab everywhere. Thanks  be to God, the brothers in most of the Arab states and the Asian  and African Muslim states, as well as our friends in Europe,  America, and Asia--chief of which are the UN Security Council  permanent member states-- support the Yemeni unity and  constitutional legitimacy, which exemplifies the effectiveness  of democracy and political pluralism.    Based on the above, we can say that the rebels who are  pursued by the constitutional legitimacy, the authority of the  Yemeni unity, are mere gangsters who violated the national  unanimity. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy  have the right to mete out to them the punishment stipulated by  the Constitution and the state laws. This is a right of  sovereignty and no one has an excuse to interfere in the  internal affairs of the Republic of Yemen since what is going on  is an internal matter.    The position of the UN Security Council permanent member  states was fair and dominant and it should be followed by other  countries. It is wrong to think otherwise. It is also wrong to  view the Yemeni affair as an Arab or world affair. We say this  despite our appreciation of the concern over stability in our  country displayed by our brothers and friends.    It should be known to those who present themselves as  sympathizers with the Yemeni people's causes and affairs that  those who do not respect or appreciate these people's unity are  mistaken and are taking risks in matters that run counter to the  Arab League Charter, the UN Charter, and the international law.    The Republic of Yemen, which the entire world community,  without exception, had recognized, is a united political entity  with no religious, ethnic, or religious problems, and with no  problems that can infringe on its unity or sovereignty. The  current conflict is between the state authorities, represented  by the constitutional legitimacy, and the rebel forces of  treachery and secession.    Our Yemeni people, who are united in religion, language,  values, traditions, and direction are able to foil all schemes  regardless of their source. God will grant us victory over the  gang of apostasy and secession, who rebelled against the  constitutional legitimacy and the enemies of the Yemeni people  and their freedom, dignity, and progress.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETURN TO SQUARE ONE  </P> <P> The 18.5% of Irvine voters who bothered to go to the polls on Tuesday can't be  faulted for overwhelmingly rejecting a $57.5-million parks measure.  </P> <P> Dubbed by critics "the Cadillac of bond issues," it was a virtual wish list of  parks and recreation facilities that was far too ambitious in a time, and in a  city, where traffic and other more serious problems must share the political  spotlight.  </P> <P> The measure also contained a troubling provision to pay for maintenance of new  facilities out of bond money instead of out of the general fund, as is the  standard municipal practice.  </P> <P> The City Council, which put the measure on the ballot, should use the election  results as a guide in preparing another measure that would plan for the future  of this fast-growing planned community on a more modest scale.  </P> <P> The proposal, which needed two-thirds approval, was rejected by an astounding  76%-24% margin. It had something for everybody, apparently in the hope that  enough constituencies could be found to put it over the top.  </P> <P> There were to be new parks in Woodbridge, Westpark and Northwood; senior  citizen and child-care centers; biking, hiking, jogging and equestrian paths;  gymnasiums; tennis courts and athletic fields, and other park improvements.  There was even a model farm, a two-acre site complete with a farm building to  teach visitors about Irvine's agricultural history.  </P> <P> But the price tag for all of this was high: All told, the measure would have  cost about $300 million when debt service and maintenance and operations costs  were added to the actual cost of bonds. Each homeowner would have paid $120 a  year, with mobile homeowners paying half that amount and commercial property  owners paying significantly more.  </P> <P> Put on the ballot by the City Council after eight months of public hearings,  the measure had the support of two council members who are usually at odds:  Mayor Larry Agran, a liberal Democrat, and Republican Councilwoman Sally Anne  Sheridan. It was opposed by the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, whose members  objected to increased taxes on their property, and by a group of political  conservatives who don't much like Agran's style of governing.  </P> <P> But it was given a chance at passage because the city's voters had shown  themselves to be mavericks on tax issues: Irvine was the only city in Orange  County to approve Measure M, the half-cent sales tax for transportation, on  last November's ballot.  </P> <P> While the vote on the parks measure was decisive, it should not be interpreted  as a signal to give up on planning for the future. It is simply time to go back  to the drawing board. This time, the council should take into account the  economic and political realities of Irvine while it continues its tradition  among suburban communities of providing high-caliber parks for its residents.  </P></p>

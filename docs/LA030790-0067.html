			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SAYS HE LIED ABOUT LEAKING WIRETAP WARNINGS  </P> <P> In an effort to defuse potentially damaging prosecution evidence, U.S. District  Judge Robert Aguilar testified Tuesday that he lied when he told a lawyer that  he had leaked information about a wiretap.  </P> <P> In his second day of testimony in his own defense, Aguilar also accused a  series of prosecution witnesses of lying or being "mistaken" in saying they had  held conversations or meetings with him. They included a former secretary, a  friend who was secretly cooperating with the FBI and a deputy U.S. marshal.  </P> <P> The judge denied every accusation against him -- that he had tried to influence  criminal cases by approaching fellow judges, helped his former secretary remain  a fugitive, twice disclosed a wiretap to its target, lied to the FBI and told a  witness to lie to a grand jury.  </P> <P> He is charged with eight felonies, including a charge that he used his office  as a "racketeering enterprise" to obstruct justice, the first such accusation  against a federal judge.  </P> <P> In asserting that he had lied in the past, Aguilar was seeking to undercut the  impact of a secretly made tape recording of a luncheon meeting in which he said  he had relayed word to Abe Chapman, an elderly relative by marriage, that  Chapman was being wiretapped.  </P> <P> Aguilar is charged with illegally revealing the tap to Chapman twice, in  August, 1987, and February, 1988.  </P> <P> In May, 1988, attorney Ed Solomon, a friend and former classmate of Aguilar,  agreed with the FBI to wear a tape recorder to two luncheon meetings with the  judge. On one of the tapes, Aguilar said he had relayed word to Chapman about a  wiretap so that he would call on pay phones in the future.  </P> <P> That "was not a true statement," Aguilar testified Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I was bragging to Ed Solomon . . . trying to make him feel better," the judge  said, recalling that Solomon had appeared distraught about an FBI  investigation.  </P> <P> Aguilar added, "What I've said here under oath was absolutely the truth."  </P> <P> Aguilar, 58, of San Jose, a judge since 1980, faces a prison sentence of up to  55 years if convicted. He also could be removed from office by Congress  regardless of the verdict.  </P></p>

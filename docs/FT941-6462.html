			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Action by German public workers German public sector workers yesterday stepped up a nationwide campaign of disruption, while the IG Metall engineering union said it was confident of securing backing for a full strike next week, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. In both sectors workers have been angered by management calls for a wage freeze and benefit cuts against a backdrop of recession. The public employee protests have hit transport systems, hospitals, kindergartens and waste collection in large cities across Germany. Meanwhile, Mr Jurgen Peters, head of the IG Metall union in the north German state of Lower Saxony, said he was confident 100,000 engineering workers voting this week would decide overwhelmingly in favour of a strike. The first vote showed an 80 per cent turnout rate, IG Metall said, with a 75 per cent majority of votes needed for a strike. Government officials have talks set with the OTV public sector union for next week, but no talks are in prospect between the two sides in the engineering dispute.</p>

The profits included Pounds 3m from investment sales, which previously would have been shown as extraordinary items. Sales fell to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 31.1m). Helical said it was helped by falling interest rates, lower administration costs and recoveries of previous years' provisions. It sold Pounds 38m of property during the year with Pounds 30m completed before the year end. With the completion of the balance and sales of Pounds 11m since the year end, net borrowings will fall to Pounds 52m. Gross profits were Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 11.6m) which included rents of Pounds 13.8m. Net interest payments fell to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 15.4m) as a result of sales and the fall in interest rates. Fully diluted net assets per share rose 4p to 224p. Earnings were 29p (43.2p losses). A second interim dividend of 2.4p in lieu of a final has already been paid for a total of 4.8p (4p).</p>

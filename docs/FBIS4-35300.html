			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a letter from the Yemeni House of Representatives </F> to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and  the Arab League's permanent representatives on 30 May; place not  given -- read by announcer]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. For the scum disappears like froth cast out;  while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the  earth. [Koranic verse]    Esteemed Brother Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Arab League  secretary general; Esteemed Brother Permanent Delegates: A  message of respect and appreciation. Your Yemeni homeland is  experiencing critical circumstances as a result of the ordeal  imposed by a group of rebels who violated the constitutional  legitimacy, represented by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and those with him.  The sedition Yemen is experiencing poses grave dangers to  Yemen's present, future, unity, democracy, political system,  sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and cohesion  of its sons. At the same time, it is a serious sign not only on  the level of the Yemeni homeland but also on the level of the  entire Arab homeland's peoples and governments. It also  represents a challenge to our Arab League's charter, the  international organizations, and the bases on which states were  established. However, what calls for happiness and pleasure is  that our esteemed House and its members, who represent the  Yemeni people, see in our Arab League and in the peoples and  governments of its Arab nation both support and assistance  designed to champion it and understand its causes as well as a  helper and supporter designed to curb the insane adventures of  the rebellious secessionists and circumvent both dangers and  suffering, exactly as you have always done for this House.    Brother Arab League Secretary General, Brother Permanent  Delegates: For our people, the reestablishment of Yemeni unity  by setting up the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990--unity which  all Arabs had the honor of backing and supporting as an Arab  experience and a step on the path of fulfilling our Arab  nation's great dream of unity--was a pioneering civilized  achievement, a normal event, and a simple way to realize both  the cohesion of resources and the unification of efforts for  development and progress. It was also a reunification of  families which were separated by artificial borders during the  eras of colonialism and the hateful imamate rule, and which were  also scattered by the policy of confrontation during the eras of  the resented partition that was due to known reasons by which  all capabilities and resources were used in a lengthy conflict.  During this conflict, the differences were deepened and the  mutual trust was so weakened that its repercussions cannot be  measured by time standards. As a result of this conflict, all  the Yemeni people paid a dear and doubled price during all the  phases of the partition until, after much endurance, the people  achieved their objective of unity. For this people, unity was a  humanitarian salvation by all standards since there was a  project to restore the values of amity, good relations among  relatives, and tolerance among brothers and fathers, and also a  return to safety and reassurance for the people.    Yemeni unity also represented a civilized project to build a  modern Yemeni state based on democracy, political and party  pluralism, peaceful sharing of power, justice, equality, respect  for rights and freedoms, and supremacy of law. Through this  project, the Yemeni people irreversibly disposed of oppression,  tyranny, injustice, and persecution. Through this project, the  Yemeni people circumvented all the suffering, pains, the  catastrophes of time, the bereavement of wives, the wailing of  victims, and the destruction of families, which they long  suffered in the past as a result of the bloody conflicts and  painful armed confrontations throughout more than two decades.    Our esteemed Arab League, along with all Arab brethren, were  not far or absent from all this. As the highest body and most  important institution, the Arab League worked along with the  Arab brethren on the level of states and governments  collectively and individually. The Arabs sensed both the ordeal  and concerns of their Yemeni brethren, and made efforts to  contain the crises, and end and save the people from their  ordeal. The Arabs also worked by all means to help the Yemenis  achieve their sought objective and safe haven; namely, Yemeni  unity.    They also played a great role in extinguishing the fire of  war, which broke out from time to time in the country or in each  of the two parts of the country. They also worked very eagerly  to restore its cohesion by achieving unity. These positions,  which the Yemeni people have never forgotten and which will  remain as immortal as history in their memory, were adopted by  the brothers out of their pan-Arab responsibility, their  religious duty, and their true brotherly and human concern and  in accordance with the Arab League member states' agreement that  led to its establishment and that was included in its charter.  This is because they believed that the primary objective of  unity of the Arab nation, for which the Arab League was  established, should begin in full swing with Yemen, which  contains the real seeds of Arab unity and whose land and people  have enjoyed unity of doctrine, language, race, and fate since  time immemorial and since the creation of the world.    This is what our Arab governments believe within their  pan-Arab framework, the Arab League, in line with the Yemeni  people's belief, unanimity, and yearning for unity and in  harmony with the commitments of all their leaders that assumed  power in the so-called two parts of Yemen. In light of this,  the Arab League sponsored the first Yemeni unity agreement in  1972, which was worked out under the Arab League's canopy and at  its headquarters in Cairo, as well as the ensuing agreements in  Tripoli, Algiers, and Kuwait. The committees, which were formed  by the leaderships of the two parts at that time, worked for  that end. The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was  accomplished in 1981, a Constitution under which Yemen was  unified in 1990 and which united the parts of Yemen into one  unified Yemeni entity, ending the eras of partition, division,  wars, and destruction for good. A referendum was held for the  entire people in May 1991, and the first elections were held on  the level of the entire homeland in April 1993 based on  democracy, political pluralism, and multiparty system, and  peaceful rotation of power. The whole world acknowledged these  elections' success and fairness and all the forces blessed it.    All the legislations and unionist laws of the one Yemen were  issued in accordance with the Constitution, and the government  coalition, made up of the General People's Congress, the Yemeni  Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, was formed as a  natural result of the elections. The coalition document signed  by the three parties contained the basic pillars of the  government's program, chief of which was preserving Yemeni unity  and democracy. Article 1 of the Constitution stipulates that the  Republic of Yemen is an independent and sovereign state, that it  is a unity that cannot be divided, that no part can be  relinquished, and that the Yemeni people are part of the Arab  nation and the Islamic world. In light of this, new interests  and relations were reinforced among the sons of the one homeland  and on the level of the regions and the governorates.    Arab League Secretary General, Permanent Delegates: You know  well that the Yemeni unity did not take place between two  peoples, who are prevented by geographic, language, national,  cultural, and ideological obstacles from going ahead with their  unionist dreams. Neither was it an emotional unity and a mere  unification of interests. Rather, it was a unity of a nation  that will remain unified in terms of land and people. The  partitioning that occurred from time to time as result of  colonialism or power struggle was an exception. Those who  follow Yemen's old and modern history will discover an eternal  unity among the sons of the one Yemeni people, even during the  ugly eras. The sons of the Yemeni people were not treated  within the framework of the big Yemeni homeland as foreign  nationals. On the contrary, the people, the authority, and the  successive systems and rulers rejected division and its  imposition on the Yemeni people.    Brother Secretary General, Brother Permanent Delegates: Our  Yemeni people view Yemeni unity not as just a national and  pan-Arab gain but also as their salvation, their life, future,  dreams, and hopes. The proof that they deeply cherish unity is  by sincerely emphasizing that for them unity is life and that  any retraction from it or any harm to it is tantamount to a  death sentence and a crime against innocent people who have been  aspiring for a united homeland without barriers in which the  minds, spirits, and funds will be secure. Our people reject in  advance any step that partitions the homeland into entities that  have the rank of states, that slices any part of the Republic of  Yemen, or that constitutes a deviation from its legal status  that was proclaimed on 22 May 1992 and which was recognized  worldwide. From this premise, our people refuse any attempt to  take the Yemeni issue out of its sound and objective context as  a domestic issue, or that will lead them to catastrophes that  imperil the one homeland such as the step that was made by those  who have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, those who  have deviated from national consensus, those who have disavowed  the homeland and nationalism, the advocates of secession, 'Ali  Salim al- Bid and those with him.    Brothers, we do not doubt that our fraternal Arab people,  their governments, and their leaders, and our Arab League which  has nurtured and blessed Yemeni unity will accept nothing less  than the perpetuation of this unity. We also do not believe the  Arab League will stifle this unity's objective and dream, will  deal it a lethal blow, or pass a death sentence on an entire  people, thus definitively ending the Arab League's pan-Arab  project, the source of its pride and dignity and the safety  valve for its present and future.    We also do not believe that our Arab League and the leaders  of fraternal states who enjoy farsightedness will accept  al-Bid's treasonous step, or encourage any dangerous and strange  act by any adventurer who tries to partition homelands, or  permit that a rebel, adventurer, or whimsical person be given  the chance to establish a state to satisfy his ego and  intransigence, just because he has some military power and  harbors evil ambitions to assume power at the expense of  homelands and people and in defiance of their options and will.  It is really a very grave step that will transform homelands  into waste.    As for us, we find no words that are more eloquent than to  say that Yemeni unity is our destiny and our fate and that our  Yemeni people wherever they are will only agree to unity and  will not relinquish it, no matter what this will cost them. Our  people view any condoning of the crime by traitor al-Bid and the  secessionists who support him in the YSP command and his  proclamation as a disavowal of the bonds of amity and the blood  relationship, and a violation of conventions such as the Arab  League Charter, not to mention that this will be an unjustified  interfererence in their domestic affairs, a prolongation of the  rebellion and the war whose scope could expand, and a sedition  which has no limits.    Our people also view any stand by their brothers that  sympathizes with the rebellion as an illogical support for those  who have no status or legitimacy and an attempt to impose  tutelage on the Yemeni people.    We regret, and you are in a position to know better, that  what is taking place in our country is portrayed in a manner  that is different from what it really is, or in a way that makes  people call it something else. This is because the Yemeni  people are one people and there is no place for the word south  and north.    As representatives of the Yemeni people, we ask you to act  with responsibility, and support legitimacy and unity and not  the opposite. We greatly appreciate the support and assistance  you have offered in the past for the Yemeni revolution and unity  and we thank you for these noble stands. How can we not say  this when our Egyptian brothers had sacrificed their lives in  support for Yemeni revolution and in trying to unite our people  following the liberation of that part of Yemen that was occupied  at the time?    In conclusion, you are called upon to place right within its  proper place, and to safeguard Yemen. Safeguarding Yemen cannot  but be achieved through the preservation of its unity. As for  partitioning, it means destruction and continuous wars. We do  not believe you will accept this for a Muslim Arab people.    We wish that this letter be considered as an Arab League  document and that it will be distributed to the members. We  thank you for your understanding of our just cause. Please  accept our best regards.    Issued by the House of Representatives in the Republic of  Yemen, 30 May 1994</p>

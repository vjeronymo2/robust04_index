			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Hardwood curbs could deplete forests CURBS on world trade in tropical hardwood could result in more forest depletion rather than conservation, Mr Carlos Alberto Primo Braga, economist in the World Bank's International Trade Division, says. In a study of how trade policies have affected forest use in Brazil and Indonesia, he argues: 'Use of export restrictions visited additional environmental degradation on Indonesia's wet tropical forest than a proper resource management programme involving a tax on all timber at the logging stage would have done.' The findings challenge environmentalists who have fought for a ban on trade as a main plank in their push to protect the world's forests. Mr Primo Braga sets out the rate forests are being lost and shares environmentalists' concern over the plight of tropical wet forests. Forest depletion has already significantly affected the economy of some developing countries, like the Philippines, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, he notes. If the pace of deforestation continues unchecked through the 1990s, the number of net exporters of forest products among developing countries would fall from 33 to 10 by the year 2000. World Bank studies show that about 60 per cent of depletion is due not to trade but farming and cattle ranching, with the balance split between road building, urbanisation, fuelwood and logging: 'Activities geared to the domestic market ..are the main players in the deforestation process.' His case is vividly illustrated in Brazil, where commercial logging accounts for less than 1 per cent of GDP, and for under 1 per cent of export revenues. Much of this is concerned with coniferous and eucalyptus logging in the south of the country, rather than tropical forests. Of total hardwood logging, 10 per cent goes on to the export market, the rest being used inside Brazil. As a result, trade measures against Brazil's exports are useless. They have no influence on the deforestation process, and they lull environmentalists into a false sense that progress is being made. Instead, they should be focusing on the core problems: poverty, development projects, migration, and government subsidies for logging and cattle ranching. The error of trying to use trade measures to slow deforestation is shown differently in Indonesia, where hardwood products account for 14 per cent of export earnings, with over 40 per cent of production exported. Indonesia's outward orientation is not just due to government policies, Mr Primo Braga argues. Indonesian hardwood is more competitively priced, since its forests have higher densities of commercially valuable trees; the light colours of Asian hardwoods are preferred by consumers in developed countries; access to forests is easier; and it is closer to the world's main importer, Japan. Indonesia introduced trade curbs first on logs, then sawn wood, under a strategy of encouraging higher value-added production in the country. The result: intensified depletion of forests, since local processors using inefficient machinery need more logs for every unit of output than counterparts in Japan or Canada. 'If Indonesian sawmills and plywoods were operating at the world technological frontier, the same production of sawn wood and plywoods achieved in the second half of the 1980s could be reached with an annual economy of 3.3m cu m of logs.' This would have cut annual log harvests by 10 per cent. A ban on trade in tropical hardwood would tend to depress its price. An import ban would 'assign a lower value to forests, and (encourage) less careful management of the resource, providing greater incentives to convert forest land to other uses.'</p>

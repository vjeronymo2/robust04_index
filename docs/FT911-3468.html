			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firmer on drop in durable goods orders US GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday after a large decline in monthly durable goods orders revived hopes of another interest rate cut. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 5/16 at 95 5/8 , yielding 8.265 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 7.016 per cent. The morning news which sparked the gains was the 6.2 per cent fall in new factor orders for durable goods in March, a decline well in advance of market expectations. The figures suggested that the economy remains depressed, and they add to the pressure on the Federal Reserve for another cut in interest rates to get the economy moving. However, at a Senate committee hearing yesterday, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, hinted that recent inflation numbers did not justify another rate cut. His comments brought prices down from their highs, as did worries about the effect on the market of the upcoming Treasury note auction. NEWS that the Dutch state will launch its first 15-year bond boosted the Dutch government bond market yesterday. The new bond is due in June, 2006, has an 8.5 per cent coupon, and is not callable. It will be sold through a series of tap sales starting on April 25. Traders said there was strong demand among domestic pension funds and insurers. Many switched out of 10-year Dutch government bonds to buy the new 15-year bond in the grey market as the longer maturity provides a better match for their liabilities. The price of the new bond rose from 99.15 to close at 99.8, yielding 8.52 per cent. In Germany, bund prices edged up in what traders described as a technical correction following Monday's fall. News that the Bundesbank left its one-month security repurchase rate unchanged at 8.60 per cent also provided some support for bunds, traders said. The unchanged security repurchase rate was taken as a sign that the official discount rate would not be raised. However, currency players interpreted this as a lack of support for the D-Mark and wondered whether it would be allowed to slide against the dollar or whether central bank intervention would support it. Several central banks intervened in the markets, selling dollars for D-Marks yesterday. IN London, gilts moved up in quiet trading ahead of today's auction for a Pounds 1.2bn tranche of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996. Bids are due in the morning and traders expect most or all of the stock to be bought. The spread of bids is expected to be rather tight given the probable strong demand for the stock. The existing stock is already trading at around 98.2 in the market, but the auction stock has the advantage of being part-paid (investors need only pay 50 per cent of the price if their bids are accepted) with the rest of the money due at the end of May. JAPANESE government bond prices rose yesterday in quiet trading. The market expects the auction today to be for another tranche of the No 140 bond which is due in December 2001 and has a 6.6 per cent coupon. Traders expect about Y800bn of the stock to be auctioned but expressed concern over the lack of appetite for new issues. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened in Tokyo at 6.735 per cent, moving to 6.69 per cent, and trading in London at around 6.715 per cent.</p>

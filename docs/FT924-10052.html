			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Future of Panic hangs in balance THE political future of Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday hung in the balance after deputies to the Socialist-dominated parliament in Belgrade voted in favour of a no-confidence motion. The move signalled Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's resolve to dominate Yugoslavia even at the expense of provoking civil war. After a fiery debate, deputies to the House of Citizens, the lower chamber, voted against Mr Panic by 93 votes to 24. They accused the Belgrade-born Californian pharmaceuticals magnate of serving foreign interests and betraying Serbia. However, the no-confidence vote requires a majority in both chambers to pass. The upper chamber, the 60-member House of Republics which is divided evenly between Serbian and Montenegrin representatives, is due to vote early this afternoon. Montenegro, the other member of the reconstituted Yugoslav federation, has backed Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, in their power struggle against Mr Milosevic. But Mr Oleg Golubovic, secretary general of the Radical party which tabled the no-confidence motion along with the Socialists (SPS), said he was confident of victory in the upper house. President Milosevic, head of the SPS, has orchestrated the move to oust Mr Panic, who survived a no-confidence vote in September after the intervention of Mr Cosic and with the support of Montenegro. While Mr Panic has pledged to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, he wields little influence over Bosnia's Serbian leaders, some of whom yesterday said they were pulling out of the international peace talks in Geneva chaired by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. The Serbs were reported to be walking out until their 'basic demand' for an ethnic division of Bosnia was met. Mr Vance and Lord Owen are opposed to ethnic division and have presented a draft constitution that would divide Bosnia into between seven and 10 units along economic rather than ethnic lines, which the Bosnian Serbs say is unacceptable. Meanwhile, Moslem and Croat refugees yesterday continued to pour out of the central Bosnian town of Jajce, captured by the Serbs last Thursday, and headed for the nearby Croat-held town of Travnik. United Nations relief officials said at least 35,000 people had made the hazardous journey on foot or in horse-drawn carts in the largest exodus of the war so far. Elsewhere in Bosnia, Serb forces clashed with the mainly Moslem Bosnian government troops in a broad belt of towns north of Sarajevo. The besieged Bosnian capital, however, was relatively quiet after a weekend of ferocious fighting that coincided with the start of a 'week of tranquillity' called by the UN children's fund, Unicef.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Fall in building output forecast CONSTRUCTION output in the UK is forecast to fall by 5 per cent this year, its first annual fall since 1981, according to Dr Richard Roberts, construction economist for Barclays Bank. 'All sectors of the industry will experience weak trading conditions in 1991,' Dr Roberts says in the bank's latest UK Construction Survey. 'Private-sector non-residential construction is on the brink of a prolonged and sharp deterioration.' The bank expects commercial building output to fall by a quarter this year 'followed by another substantial reduction in activity in 1992'. Dr Roberts said a recovery in commercial building could be delayed until 1993-94. The only glimmer of hope was in private housing, which had recently seen the first signs of improvement since 1988. But any significant recovery was likely to be delayed until towards the end of the year. 'Other developments such as rising unemployment rates, the loss of higher-rate mortgage tax relief and the 2 1/2 per cent rise in VAT will provide a partial check to any improvement,' said Dr Roberts. He said there was unlikely to be any significant increase in public-sector building work, although some areas such as roads and education might pick up.</p>

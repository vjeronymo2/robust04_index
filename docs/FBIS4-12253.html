			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, April 6 (AFP) -- A prominent Algerian  businessman and opposition party leader, Mehdi Abbas Allalou,  was badly injured in an attack in an Algiers suburb Wednesday,  security officials said.    Allalou, leader of the small Popular Association for Unity  and Action (APUA) movement, was rushed to hospital after the  attack in the southeastern El Harrach district. Officials gave  no details of the circumstances.    He was the third party leader to have been attacked since  Moslem fundamentalists launched a bloody campaign which has  claimed more than 3,000 lives since the authorities in January  1992 cancelled the second round of a general election the  Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.    The FIS was subsequently outlawed.    The businessman, known for his close ties to the Gulf  countries and Saudi Arabia, took a stance in favour of Kuwait  when it was invaded by Iraq in 1991.</p>

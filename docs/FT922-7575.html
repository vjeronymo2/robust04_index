			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 20m Bristol road project The Bristol Development Corporation (BDC) has awarded the design and build contract for the Bristol spine road to BALFOUR BEATTY. The contract, valued at Pounds 20m, is due to start on site this month, although preliminary site works have already begun. The spine road, due for completion by May 1994, is believed to be the largest and fastest contract of its kind and the most important infrastructure project in Bristol. Significantly, for a major work of this scale, the contract is substantially under budget. The 1.5 mile dual carriageway road will link the M32 (M4/M5) in the north with the A4 Bath Road in the south, opening up the BDC's 900 acre urban area for major redevelopment. The spine road, together with the proposed Avon Weir, form the axis of the Corporation's regeneration strategy which is aimed at transforming Bristol's waterfront and linking the area into the national transport network. The spine road will relieve traffic congestion on the inner circuit road allowing capacity for the Corporation's flagship gateway development at Temple Meads and also open up the potential for new public transport initiatives. The Temple Meads project is a Pounds 500m mixed development, aimed specifically at office relocation.</p>

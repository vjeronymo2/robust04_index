			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: INPUT PUT A BETTER FACE ON 2 COASTAL HOTELS  </P> <P> Some architects would rather face a school of hungry sharks than the layers of  design review most projects go through these days. In particular, designing  buildings along the coast, where local sentiments run especially deep, can be a  touchy process.  </P> <P> Yet two elegant new oceanfront hotels -- the Sheraton Grande at Torrey Pines in  La Jolla and L'Auberge Del Mar -- prove that extensive design review can  produce better buildings. Feedback from local government and community factions  helped, in both cases, to produce thoughtfully designed hotels with minimal  impact on San Diego's precious coastline.  </P> <P> Overall, L'Auberge Del Mar is the more successful design. Inside and out, it  conveys a low-key, homey warmth through intimate scale and materials such as  brick and wood shingles and beams. The Sheraton, by contrast, is a sound,  modern building that suffers from a few lapses in detailing. Rooftop vents and  air-conditioning equipment, for example, are eyesores to motorists on North  Torrey Pines Road. An exterior of white stucco and reflective glass makes the  place about as inviting as a hospital.  </P> <P> A significant portion of L'Auberge's sensitive design is directly attributable  to concerned Del Mar citizens and politicians. Architects Jim Galvin and Joe  Cristilli of Galvin Cristilli Architects spent four years refining the project  to meet the community's desires. The $30-million, 123-room hotel, which opened  in July of last year, was subject to voter approval. It didn't pass until its  second time on the ballot in February, 1988.  </P> <P> The city had good reason to proceed with caution. The hotel site is a key  downtown corner at 15th Street and Camino Del Mar, where other corners are  occupied by a bank, the new Del Mar Plaza retail complex and Stratford Square,  a 1927 Tudor-style building. Strong traditions came with the location. Many  locals fondly remember the 1909 Tudor-style Inn at Del Mar that was torn down  in 1969.  </P> <P> But Galvin and Cristilli's new hotel suits downtown Del Mar well, even though  its Tudor-based design has a contemporary flair.  </P> <P> L'Auberge takes many of its cues from Stratford Square, which houses the  popular Carlos &amp; Annie's Cafe. Steep, gabled roofs and tan stucco walls  make the two buildings cousins. But the architects did not imitate Stratford  Square's Tudor half-timbering with its vertical, horizontal and diagonal boards  applied to exterior walls that give an appearance dating back to 16th-Century  England.  </P> <P> City officials and citizens were as concerned about the new hotel's siting and  size as they were about its style. Set back generously from the street, with  parking well concealed underground, the hotel is a gentle presence. Wood  trellises shade public areas and soften the hotel's visual impact. Lots of  brick adds to the Old World atmosphere.  </P> <P> A retail annex and the hotel's main restaurant are both near the street. These  public attractions also make the hotel an especially good neighbor.  </P> <P> The key corner of the project -- at 15th and Camino Del Mar -- is essentially  an offering to the citizens of the city, and comes complete with a small  concrete amphitheater. A park-like pedestrian entrance is enhanced by a  man-made stream and waterfall, which mask the din of nearby traffic.  </P> <P> Cars reach the project via driveways slightly removed from the corner, thereby  keeping the pedestrian entrance clear. And hotel rooms are arranged in three  wings, which are aligned with neighboring blocks of condominiums to the west in  order to save view corridors.  </P> <P> Inside the hotel's main entry off Camino Del Mar a gabled, glassed roof floods  the lobby with natural light. Overstuffed chairs, a Citizen Kane-sized brick  fireplace and big ceiling beams painted with a delicate floral pattern give the  place a country-style charm.  </P> <P> The $60-million, 400-room Sheraton, which opened in November at the edge of  Torrey Pines Golf Course near UC San Diego, could use more of L'Auberge Del  Mar's careful detailing, especially on the exterior.  </P> <P> Architects Welton Becket Associates of Santa Monica gave the building a stark  front of white stucco and copper-colored reflective-glass windows with green  mullions. With its wide concrete driveways, the Sheraton looks more like an  office building than a place you'd want to spend a relaxing weekend. By  contrast, the pocket decks, patios and outdoor public dining areas visible  around the edges of L'Auberge Del Mar make it immediately inviting.  </P> <P> In its favor, however, the Sheraton makes only a minimal impact on its coastal  bluff site.  </P> <P> Fearful of the crash danger posed by ocean-borne fighter jets leaving Miramar  Naval Air Station a few miles inland, the Navy played a key role in dictating  the hotel's low profile. Designed for maximum safety, the structure is partly  embedded in the bluff, with several key meeting rooms and a main restaurant on  lower floors.  </P> <P> Further, the University City Planning Group served as a watchdog during the  design process, making sure the hotel would suit its site and surroundings.  </P> <P> Architecturally, the Sheraton borrows from its neighbor, Scripps Clinic, which  was designed by Edward Durell Stone in the 1970s, as well as the Salk  Institute, architect Louis Kahn's 1960s concrete masterpiece. The hotel's  pattern of square windows vaguely echoes the squares of Scripps Clinic's  exterior. Rooms in the hotel's wings are angled to capture fantastic views of  the golf course and ocean, in the same way that the Salk Institute's labs and  offices gain their views.  </P> <P> The hotel is laid out with four wings strung behind the long front building,  which houses the lobby and main hallways. Between the wings, three large  terraces provide great ocean views. A pool in the middle courtyard is  surrounded by classical stone railings with large concrete posts topped with  flower-filled urns.  </P> <P> Inside, the Sheraton is a mixed bag. A high-beamed ceiling over the grand lobby  makes the space as comfortable as a Rocky Mountain ski lodge. At the back of  this impressive space, wide stairs descend to the Torreyana Grille restaurant.  Nearby, a curving wall of glass provides light and great views of a pool and  formal terrace outside.  </P> <P> The Sheraton is decorated in a vaguely Southwestern style with expensive  materials and furnishings, including slate floors, marble-topped counters and  odd metal lighting fixtures in the form of gnarled shrubs. A provocative art  collection ranges from abstract and figurative pieces to wiry metal coyotes  poised in niches. Sometimes the materials get too glitzy, as with the the  gigantic, copper-trimmed fireplace and the mirrors behind overhead planters.  </P> <P> Both hotels compare favorably with the best of San Diego's new hotels downtown,  as well as in the Golden Triangle near University Towne Centre.  </P> <P> Both hotels compare favorably with the best of the new hotels downtown and in  the Golden Triangle area, near University Towne Center. And both prove that  when architects lend an ear to outside opinions, they can create buildings that  please both their users and their neighbors.  </P> <P> Canceled: Because of limited audience response, a symposium on Frank Lloyd  Wright scheduled for Sept. 15 has been canceled. The program, organized by the  San Diego Architectural Foundation and sponsored by the foundation and the San  Diego Museum of Art, will not be rescheduled. Tickets can be refunded through  Ticketmaster.  </P></p>

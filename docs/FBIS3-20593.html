The author is from  Wuxian County's Changshu Town in Jiangsu Province's Suzhou City]    [Text] Chinese New Year will soon be here. When I asked the  village branch secretaries how they were doing, they all said,  "Things are tough."    Those who said New Year was a tough time fall into two  categories. The first are those from villages with a  fast-growing economy. The higher-level managing department  leaders have become frequent visitors to these economically  advance villages. If these were normal relationships established  in the course of work, one would see nothing wrong with them.  The problem is, there are always some department leaders who  want to bring home some native products or some handicrafts.  That is taken to be the usual practice. To forge better  relations, enhance friendship, and make things work smoothly,  the villages naturally are eager to oblige and ready to give  gifts on every visit. The village cadres have no choice but to  put on a happy face all day and be ready to socialize. It is  very hard indeed.    In villages where the economy has been developing rapidly,  the cadres are busy receiving and sending off guests at  year-end; they can hardly handle the amount of socializing. But  what about the poor villages? The village branch secretaries  have just as difficult a time. Few high-level visitors bother to  come, but many from below show up. Year after year, village  cadres are owed wages. Those who understand are less of a  problem, but those who don't understand simply walk away. The  villagers come to get medical expense reimbursement for an only  child; old people come in with the aid of walking sticks to  collect their 40 yuan pension; there are electric bills,  telephone bills, special allowances, and joint defense expenses;  there are taxes and fees which they cannot afford to pay. Those  who run the villages say that getting through New Years is  harder than finding refuge from disasters.    Alas, cadres at all levels, please understand the village  branch secretaries' problems. Go deep into the grass-roots level  to solve practical problems. One should add flowers to the  brocades -- make perfection still more perfect, but it is even  more important to provide charcoal in snowy weather --provide  timely help.</p>

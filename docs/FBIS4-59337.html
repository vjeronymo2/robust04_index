			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, member of the </F> People's General Congress, minister of planning and development,  and former prime minister, in Riyadh, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in  Cairo, date not given; on the "Dialogue from Afar"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Welcome to our program.    [Al-Iryani] Thank you.    [Al-Jundi] Concerning the conditions in Yemen and the fierce  clashes between northern and southern forces, without pointing  the blame at anyone, how can we contain the situation?    [Al-Iryani] I assure you that the northern forces are not  alone. Several southern brigades are fighting alongside the  northern forces. Other southern brigades have declared their  loyalty to the lawful government. The situation will be  contained once everyone shows respect for the Constitution and  the lawful government and once the Armed Forces obey the orders  of the state and their supreme commander.    [Al-Jundi] Some people say that weapons will not achieve a  solution and that a political settlement must be brokered.    [Al-Iryani] Of course, all wars end with a political  solution, regardless of their outcome. We welcome any political  solution in the context of Yemeni unity and constitutional  legitimacy. The Armed Forces should follow the orders of the  state, not those of a party or an insurgent wing of a party.    [Al-Jundi] Concerning a political settlement, do you think  that the Yemeni Presidential Council's rejection of any  mediation has helped a political solution?    [Al-Iryani] I think this is a distortion. The Presidential  Council has not rejected mediation. What it rejected was the  internationalization of the crisis, its transformation into an  international issue, and the dispatch of Arab or international  troops to Yemen to separate the fighters. This is what the  president told the House of Representatives. Some people  twisted these words to make it seem as if he was rejecting  mediation. What we reject is the internationalization of the  conflict and its transformation from a conflict between a  legitimate government and an insurgent group into a conflict  between two states. This is unacceptable for us. It would be  so in any other Arab or non-Arab country.    [Al-Jundi] Since we are discussing mediation, yesterday,  Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah visited Egypt. And  you are currently in Saudi Arabia together with 'Abdallah  al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives. Are these  visits linked with Egyptian and Saudi mediation?    [Al-Iryani] Two Arab League envoys are about to go to Jizan  and Sanaa. As long as there is Arab League mediation, I think  that most Arab countries would see this effort as sufficient.</p>

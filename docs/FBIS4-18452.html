			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/271: "Humanitarian Aid to the </F> Occupied Territories"]    [Text] The European Commission has decided to allocate  emergency humanitarian aid of ECU2,300,000 for the Palestinian  population of the occupied territories. In the aftermath of the  massacre at Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque, most of the occupied  territories were for a time under extended curfews; this  resulted in a sharp drop in economic activity and considerable  disruption to regular essential food supplies.    To alleviate this situation, UNRWA [United Nations Relief  and  Works Agency] carried out an urgent distribution of food rations  to some 75,000 families in the West Bank and 95,000 in the Gaza  Strip.    The present allocation of the European Commission will pay,  through ECHO [European Community Humanitarian Office], for a  further 8,500 tonnes of flour for distribution by UNRWA to  respond to the current needs of this emergency situation in the  occupied territories.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Tokyo shares at two-year high: Improving business confidence lifts Nikkei index to 21,552 The Tokyo stock market hit a new two-year high yesterday as investors were encouraged by positive economic data and positive comments over an early recovery by leading financial officials. The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares rose 157.63 to 21,552.81, the highest since February 1992. Heightened optimism towards the economy helped the index break a psychologically important 21,000 level last week, improving confidence among both institutional and retail investors. Yesterday's rise follows the release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly business survey last Friday which indicated an improvement in sentiment among managers for the first time in five years. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central bank, yesterday said before a parliamentary committee that there seemed to be a high possibility the economy had moved a step toward recovery. While cautioning that currency movements and stock adjustment among manufacturers still needed monitoring, Mr Mieno said interest rates were sufficiently low for companies to start capital investment. He also expects income tax cuts worth Y5,500bn (Pounds 35bn) to help recovery. Similar views were aired by Mr Jiro Saito, vice finance minister, although he refused to 'declare with confidence that the economy will head toward recovery'. Such economic optimism hurt Tokyo bond prices yesterday, as investors switched funds from bonds to stocks. And although the two-week rally has started to make some investors anticipate a correction, most are expecting the downside to be limited. 'We haven't had big jumps in the market and volumes have been encouraging,' says Mr Jason James, strategist at stockbroker James Capel. Since many banks and industrial companies still hold large amounts of shares in their investment portfolios, the rise in share prices is in turn expected to have a positive effect on business sentiment.</p>

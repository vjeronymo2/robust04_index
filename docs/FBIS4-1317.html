			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J. Saunders] </F>   [Text] Port Elizabeth April 26 SAPA -- The elderly and  disabled trickled to the polls without fanfare in the Eastern  Cape on Tuesday to cast their votes on the first day of the  country's first all-race elections.    The busiest voting booth was at Louis le Grange Square  police  headquarters in Port Elizabeth where over 400 police personnel,  who qualify for special votes, had voted by 10AM and 100-odd  prospective voters were standing in line. Elsewhere only small  queues could be found by mid-morning.    Local police liaison officers were however concerned at the  time taken by voting: five minutes and 20 seconds for one  person to cast a double ballot. "If it's still like this by  Thursday voters will be frustrated. If some don't get to vote  when the polls close I can guarantee you unrest," said Col Louis  Botha.</p>

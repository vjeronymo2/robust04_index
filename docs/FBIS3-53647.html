			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz from the Prime </F> Minister's Office -- live]    [Excerpts] The prime minister, the chief of staff, his  deputy, the coordinator of government activities in the  territories, and other senior defense officials, are meeting  with the U.S. team led by Dennis Ross. The details of  withdrawal will be addressed in Washington next week, when the  parties start discussing the fine print. [passage omitted]    According to his meeting with al-Asad, President Clinton  attributes much importance to holding the peace process in  public -- because Israel's political structure is democratic.  Clinton and the Americans believe it is important that the  process is not held in back rooms, except of course for tactical  issues and fine print matters. They want a public Syrian  commitment to the peace process. They believe that yesterday,  al-Asad made a giant step forward in this respect.    Bilateral U.S.-Syrian issues were also broached by the two  ministers yesterday. The most difficult of those issues is  terror. President Clinton brought up the issue, and noted the  fact that the rejectionist front organizations are located in  Damascus. He heard al-Asad saying something like: What can I  do about George Habash? I cannot dispel him.    Israeli officials discerned a degree of urgency by the  Syrian  president, conveyed by the U.S. team. Al-Asad feels there is  not much time and that peace should be completed before the end  of 1994. These are the main points the Americans brought from  the meeting President Clinton held with President al-Asad in  Geneva. [passage omitted]    This morning, Shim'on Peres, Yosi Beilin, Uri Savir, and  other senior Foreign Ministry officials met with the U.S. peace  team, headed by Dennis Ross. Their message was not startling:  The delegation heads will meet next week. Let us hear Foreign  Minister Peres:    [Begin recording] [Peres] Concerning the negotiations, we  have concrete results: The heads of the two delegations will  meet on 24 January. Negotiations with Syria will resume.    [Raz] After what you heard this morning, are you satisfied  with al-Asad remarks?    [Peres] I still believe that the details and the meanings  will have to be clarified in the negotiations. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

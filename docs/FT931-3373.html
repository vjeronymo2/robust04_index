			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Faded beauty of the Swedish Model THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SWEDISH MODEL by Hans de Geer Carden Publications Pounds 25, 208 pages THE Swedish Model seduced the outside world for a long time. For many overseas admirers the paradigm of the good society - rational, efficient, progressive - to its enemies it was Aldous Huxley's Brave New World of stifling conformity and well-meaning authoritarianism. Swedes themselves saw the Model less as an abstraction or prototype and more as a way of life in which a dynamic free market economy coexisted harmoniously with a huge and generous public sector based on high taxes. This corporatist system worked impressively for nearly 30 years and helped make Sweden one of the world's most prosperous economies. Today the Model appears to be drowning beneath the stormy waves of global recession. Sweden's mounting unemployment, its huge foreign debt and economic stagnation have combined to undermine faith in the country's exceptionalism. Now it is having to adjust painfully to outside pressures with its social and economic integration into western Europe. But adapt it will. The value of Hans de Geer's book lies in its focus on a neglected part of the Model, namely its dependence on the active role of SAF  -The Swedish Employers' Federation. Without the consent of capital it is difficult to see how the Model could ever have grown to maturity. Formed in 1902 in reaction to the rise of the LO manual worker union federation, SAF grew rapidly into a formidable association. With centralised sanctions over its disparate members and a firm commitment to the absolute right of employers to manage, it established a common fund to fight strikes and impose lock-outs. But SAF was never really an anti-union organisation. On the contrary - as De Geer shows - it agreed to recognise trade unions and collective agreements from its early days, while in return the trade unions gave up the principle of the closed shop. Sweden's industrial consensus was never a flabby middle way but a hard-headed bargain between capital and labour on their mutual self-interests. While SAF wanted 'unchanging labour costs' out of it, the LO favoured solidaristic deals based on wage equality. As the author emphasises, it was not until the mid-1950s that the central bargaining system emerged. Over the following 15 years SAF and LO often toured the world together selling the virtues of the Model they created. But by the end of the 1960s Sweden's Labour Movement had launched a workplace reform programme based on legislation, not negotiation, that brought an end to employer prerogatives, while the rapid growth of the public sector and arrival of an organised white-collar salariat weakened the symmetry of SAF-LO bargaining. Wage drift undermined national pay deals and labour costs grew uncompetitive. The strain this imposed on SAF was considerable. It brought a clear ideological shift with a more robust defence of free markets. In more recent years SAF began to shed its corporatist ways and champion decentralised pay bargaining. Its leaders talk more boldly today than they used to do about competition and private enterprise. But this is all a matter of degree. What de Geer calls Sweden's 'negotiation culture' remains intact beneath the surface of its industrial life. The power balance has shifted more towards employers and away from unions, but not dramatically so. As the book makes clear, continuity remains as strong as change in Sweden. The Model may after all just be having a face lift.</p>

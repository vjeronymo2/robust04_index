			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BITES : NUDE CHILI NEWS  </P> <P> At last weekend's chili cook-off held at the Treehouse Fun Ranch  Clothing-Optional Family Resort in Devore, Jim Beatty's "Sespe Creek Chili"  topped the field of 50 but the special award for Best Chili Cooked in the Nude  went to Jim Zack's "Buckeye Chili." In the beauty contest division, Steve  Gearry and Lisa Adkins were chosen Mr. Chili Sauce and Ms. Chili Pepper.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dude Pizza News  </P> <P> Non-fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be uninterested to learn that  the rock band of that name, based on the cartoon, movie, etc. about a gang of  turtles whose diet is limited to a single food group, will begin a 40-city  concert tour Sept. 6. The tour is sponsored, needless to say, by Pizza Hut.  </P> <P> In a possibly related story, McDonald's is trying out its own line of pizza in  the Midwest. Early reports say topping choices include Bacon Double  Cheeseburger.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Pastry Shot From Guns  </P> <P> In Azerbaijan, which is in the unenviable position of being half in Iran and  half in the Soviet Union, they have a lot of rice. How much rice? So much that  they've figured out a way of making rice baklava: They dribble rice batter on a  hot pan and use the doily-like sheets in place of filo. The resulting pastry  tastes like a cross between baklava and Rice Crispies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> There's No Egg or Cream In It -- Say, Let's Call It an Egg Cream!  </P> <P> The egg cream -- a mixture of milk, seltzer water and chocolate syrup -- is 100  years old this year, says Louis Auster, who claims the New York soda fountain  treat was invented by his grandfather, Stanley Auster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calling Cliff Clavin  </P> <P> Vegiforms Inc. of Cincinnati makes plastic molds you can place around a  vegetable blossom so that as your zucchini matures it will have a pattern  impressed into it: say, an elf, or Mr. Have a Nice Day. There's one that will  make a yellow squash look like an ear of corn.  </P> <P> That's if you only want to pay $10.95. For $2,500, the company will make a mold  with any pattern you want; Elvis, Clark Gable and Pat Sajak have already been  ordered. Owner Richard Tweddell prefers using eggplants for women's faces  because of the smooth complexion. "Linda Evans and Vivian Leigh," he reports,  "had a sheen to them, like a hood ornament."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Microwave of the Future  </P> <P> Single-microwave homes will be a thing of the past by the year 2000, a speaker  recently told a microwave industry conference in Chicago. There will be mikes  in all rooms of the house, he predicted; people will cook in their bedrooms,  microwaving canned coffee for breakfast ("Early morning routines will not be  disrupted by trips to the kitchen"). There will also be microwave ovens in  trains, buses and private cars (no need to stop at a fast food stand, just load  up with items at the gas station/convenience store).  </P> <P> One problem: Interest in microwaves may already be peaking. Microwave sales  went up 12.3% between '85 and '86 but only 2.3% between '88 and '89.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anybody Seen Old Harve?  </P> <P> Galliano is engaged in a titanic promotional effort for a new drink called  simply Galliano and Tonic (one part Galliano, three parts tonic, wedge of  lime). It has held a talent search to find six good-looking young Italians to  drive around the country in yellow Ferraris so they can visit happening,  upscale night spots and hand out yellow roses and talk to people about Galliano  and Tonic. Maybe now everybody will forget about the Galliano-based Harvey  Wallbanger. CHARLES PERRY  </P></p>

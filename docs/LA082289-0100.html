			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVER-UP BY POLICE IN CRASH DEATH ALLEGED BY EX-OFFICER  </P> <P> A former Torrance police officer testified Monday that it was common knowledge  within the Police Department that investigators covered up for an off-duty  police sergeant, even though they believed that he was drunk and was to blame  for a 1984 traffic accident that killed a San Pedro teen-ager.  </P> <P> Former officer Timothy Pappas also told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury that  supervisors in the county's third-largest police department condoned  drunkenness and other abuses, including unjustified arrests of blacks who  ventured into the mostly white city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wrongful-Death Suit  </P> <P> The testimony came near the end of the fourth week of trial of a wrongful-death  lawsuit filed by John Rastello of San Pedro, whose son, Kelly, died in the 1984  collision with Sgt. Rollo Green. The lawsuit claims that Green was drunk when  he turned illegally in front of the 19-year-old and that fellow officers  covered up Green's culpability as part of a pattern of concealing abuses by  police.  </P> <P> Torrance officials say they investigated the case impartially and found that  Rastello caused the accident by speeding.  </P> <P> Pappas' testimony could be critical because he is the first witness from within  the department to corroborate the coverup allegations.  </P> <P> In his brief appearance, Pappas pictured himself as a straight shooter who was  ostracized by fellow officers and superiors for doing things by the book. But  defense lawyers painted Pappas, 27, as a troubled cop with a motivation to get  back at the Torrance Police Department: He had been punished five times for  misconduct during his five-year career and was fired last December for  allegedly covering up the facts of an incident in which he shot a man.  </P> <P> Pappas was not at the scene of the fatal crash but he told the jury that there  was talk around the department afterward of a coverup.  </P> <P> "At the accident scene it was a known fact that Rollo Green was intoxicated,"  Pappas testified, "and that they wanted to get him out of there as soon as they  could. And that they wanted a Deuce Team (anti-drunk-driving team) there to  back them up to say that he had been checked. And that they didn't want a  blood-alcohol test because they knew it would be over 0.10 (the legal standard  for intoxication)."  </P> <P> In earlier testimony, Officer Daniel Metzger, a drunk-driving specialist,  testifed that he checked Green on the night of the accident and found that,  although the sergeant had been drinking, he was not drunk. Green was driven  home, not arrested, and no blood-alcohol test was ever performed, according to  previous witnesses.  </P> <P> Pappas testified that one of those at the crash scene, Officer Timothy  Thornton, came to him and admitted that he lied in a sworn statement about the  case taken by lawyers for John Rastello. Thornton told him that the  drunk-driving team had been called to cover for Green and that Green, then an  18-year police veteran, was driven home for his own protection, Pappas told the  jury.  </P> <P> Thornton and his lawyer could not be reached for comment. Thornton is the key  witness against Pappas in a pending criminal case in which Pappas is accused of  obstructing justice and falsely accusing another of a crime.  </P> <P> Pappas claimed that Torrance police officers knew they could stay out of  trouble if they drank in Torrance.  </P> <P> "It was known that if you were in the city of Torrance you would be safe,"  Pappas said. If officers were pulled over while driving, "it would be OK. At  the most you would be driven home."  </P> <P> Pappas also testified that training officers encouraged abuses, such as  targeting blacks for arrest when they came to the city.  </P> <P> Plaintiff's attorney, Browne Greene, tried to explore the issue of  discrimination further, but Judge Abby Soven said it was beyond the scope of  the trial.  </P> <P> Contacted later, Deputy Police Chief Jim Popp said, "We treat all people alike,  depending on their actions, not their color."  </P> <P> On cross-examination, lawyers for the city attacked Pappas' credibility,  pointing out that he was fired last year for misconduct.  </P> <P> Soven would not permit detailed questions about the incident, in which Pappas  allegedly lied to justify his shooting in May, 1988, of an unarmed man, Patrick  J. Coyle.  </P></p>

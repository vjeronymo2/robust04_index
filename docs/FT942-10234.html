			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (1): The periphery is just too far out - Afraid it may be consigned to the margins of the European Union, Spain is seeking ways to re-enter the international mainstream Europe  .. goodbye. That was how the headline ran. It was enough to make anyone stop short, coming as it did in the heat of final negotiations for enlarging the European Union from 12 countries to 16. Could it be that, eight years after Spain's long-awaited and enthusiastic entry, the experience of Europe had produced such disenchantment? belonged to Marca, Spain's biggest-selling sports daily. The story was no more than Real Madrid being knocked out simultaneously from European football and basketball competitions. Nobody in Spain is against Europe or even seriously Euro-sceptical. Joining fulfilled an aspiration of 40 years. For Spaniards, Europe is a synonym for modernity. But even so, in the words of one senior government official, 'Spain is losing its European virginity.' The terms for enlargement have created some bitterness. The new Nordic members - sometimes referred to as 'Vikings' - are felt to have been better treated than Spain. The EU's centre of gravity is perceived to be shifting towards the north and east. Having joined in order to end its historic isolation on the periphery of Europe, Spain sees itself in danger of being consigned back to the margins. Criticised by the opposition for not having exacted better terms for Spanish membership, Socialist administration officials are frustrated at not having obtained more leverage in the compromise over EU council voting rights. They feel that a country of 39m people should be less easily overruled. There is also a widespread feeling - partly the result of high expectations  -that Spain might have got more out of membership, although it continues to be a net recipient of EU funds. From its entry in 1986 until 1991, Spain enjoyed faster growth than the average among its European partners. Since then, it has fared worse than average. Last year's 1 per cent fall in gross domestic product was the worst performance since Spain began opening its economic borders under the Franco regime's 1959 stabilisation programme. And although activity shows signs of picking up, it is unclear when or whether Spain can regain its growth premium and start catching up again with its richer northern partners. The gilt from the showpiece year of 1992 - the Barcelona Olympics and the Seville Expo - has flaked off. Just as Spaniards were late in waking up to recession, which began that year, so too the perception of deep economic crisis still persists, despite the evidence of economic improvement. Unemployment - the actual size of which lies somewhere between the 18 per cent registered with the National Employment Institute and the 24 per cent classed as unemployed in the government's quarterly survey - is the highest among OECD countries. Spain has 1m households in which nobody has a job. Although its economy has grown almost threefold in the last 30 years and its population has risen by a quarter, there are no more jobs now than there were in 1964. The government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez needed a period of stability while nurturing the economy back to health. But its hopes have been dramatically shaken by a political crisis over corruption scandals. Public outrage over the cases of Mr Mariano Rubio, alleged to have salted away stock investment gains in a secret account while governor of the Bank of Spain, and Mr Luis Roldan, another Socialist appointee who managed to amass a real estate fortune while head of the paramilitary Civil Guard, has created a serious predicament for the government, provoking two ministerial resignations and the departure from parliament of two of Mr Gonzalez's former cabinet colleagues. Despite the resignations and promises of a crackdown on corruption and unrelenting prosecution of offenders, the Socialists' credibility has been gravely damaged by the affairs. The dirty linen of 11 years in power is being dragged out of the closet. More is likely to come out through a parliamentary committee set up to investigate party financing. Mr Gonzalez may have difficulty salvaging his own 'clean' image, which up to now has been a vital political asset. Both the conservative Popular Party headed by Mr Jose Maria Aznar and the communist United Left have done their best to pin responsibility for the affairs on Mr Gonzalez himself. The prime minister faces the probability of heavy setbacks in June in the European parliament ballot and in regional elections the same day in his home ground of Andalucia. His party, divided by clan rivalries, has lost much of its support among the young and in urban centres. Mr Gonzalez himself often appears remote, while government power has become increasingly concentrated in the Moncloa Palace, the prime ministerial complex outside Madrid. Most of his ministers are virtually unknown to ordinary Spaniards. Only two cabinet ministers besides himself have survived from the original 1982 team photo, and only three since 1990. it is clear that Mr Gonzalez is counting on economic recovery to revive the Socialist party's worn image by the next gen- eral election, due at the latest in 1997. Last year it scraped through to win a fourth term but in a hung parliament, depending on support from the 17 deputies of the Catalan nationalist party, Converg- encia i Unio. The alliance, like the one between the Socialists and the Basque Nationalist party in the Basque country, is delicate. The push towards ever greater autonomy in the two regions creates a constant, nagging unease at the centre of Spanish politics, made worse in the Basque case by the persistence of sporadic terrorist killings. How long a weakened Mr Gonzalez can rely on the parliamentary support he needs is uncertain. For the moment, however, the economically-conservative nationalists are willing to back the government in its pursuit of pragmatic free-market policies, aimed at opening up monopolies, curbing the budget deficit and creating favourable conditions for business and job creation. Against trade union opposition, the government is pressing ahead with a package of labour reforms to relax the notoriously stringent rules on hiring and firing. Although the idea of lifetime job security will be hard to dislodge, the Spaniards are coming around to the realisation that these rules might actually impede the creation of new employ- ment. As has been demonst- rated enough times before in the history of post-Franco Spain, seemingly entrenched attitudes do not necessarily survive from one chapter to the next. There can be no better example of this kind of sea change than the row over Nato membership, culminating in a 1986 referendum which almost unseated Mr Gonzalez from office within three months of Spain's joining the European Community. Spaniards today must wonder what the crisis was all about. These days Spain is virtually a full Nato participant and 1,400 Spanish troops serve alongside British, French and Canadian UN battalions in Bosnia- Hercegovina, the biggest force deployed outside Spanish territories since the Blue Division went to fight under German command on the Russian front. Spanish opinion is just as happy to have them there as it was hostile, a few years back, to any idea of having soldiers engaged abroad. The fact that Spain is now seen playing a prominent and responsible role, in the midst of a conflict with many echoes of its own civil war of a previous generation, is a token of its re-entry into the international mainstream.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESPERANZA BEATS EL DORADO, BUT NOT CONVINCINGLY  </P> <P> He looked at the final numbers on the scoreboard Friday night, but Esperanza  High School Coach Gary Meek knew they don't always tell the whole story.  </P> <P> "We'll take 26 points anytime," Meek said.  </P> <P> Meek left out was the "but . . . " But you could tell he was thinking it.  </P> <P> Esperanza scored enough to beat visiting El Dorado, 26-10, in an Empire League  game at Valencia High. But the game matching the top-ranked team in Southern  Section Division III against the league's cellar-dwellers was closer than the  scoreboard suggested. Consider:  </P> <P>  -- Esperanza (8-0, 3-0 in league), the county's fourth-ranked team, outgained  its crosstown rival by a mere 15 yards (290 to 275).  </P> <P>  -- El Dorado (1-7, 0-3), which hasn't won since the season opener, had to  settle for one successful field goal and three missed ones at the end of four  solid drives.  </P> <P> El Dorado scored its only touchdown on a seven-yard pass from Jason Bluth to  tight end Mike Roth. Bluth passed for a season-high 163 yards.  </P> <P> Esperanza scored on its first play, a 10-yard run by Garrick Emry after Jason  Perez's interception on El Dorado's first possession.  </P> <P> The Aztecs stretched the lead to 13-3 in the first quarter on a 32-yard pass  from Keith McDonald to Reid Pullen, who holds Esperanza's record for career  touchdown catches.

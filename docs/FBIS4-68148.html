			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Roman] </F>   [Text] In the middle of the guerrilla crisis caused by the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] in Chiapas, the  National Security and Investigation Center requested that  various military and police corps create an Antiterrorist Group  [Grupo Antiterrorista -- GAT] with agents' selection to be based  on a criteria of high levels of training and skills.    Among the institutions that were asked to cooperate are the  Federal Judicial Police, the "Foxes" [Zorros] squadron of the  Secretariat of Roads and Safety, the Army, the presidential  staff, and the Federal District's Judicial Police.    According to statements by several GAT members and sources  close to institutions involved, approximately 300 specialized  agents were trained by instructors from the United States,  Spain, and Argentina.    Police sources reported the objective of GAT was to create  an  organization to end terrorism, kidnappings, and prolonged  guerrilla violence such as bomb explosions in various cities of  the country.    GAT members took courses on explosives, explosives  investigations, assaults on installations, intelligence, and  photography. They received training to infiltrate organizations  such as the Independent Proletariat Movement, the Revolutionary  Workers Party, the Peasant-People Union Movement, and the EZLN.    Approximately 15 days ago, the agents were summoned to the  National Security Center to launch an antiterrorist operation  and, according to sources, they would be deployed in groups in  the States of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Jalisco, Chiapas, and  the Federal District and its contiguous urban areas.</p>

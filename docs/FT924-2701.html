			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Council incentives on business rate LOCAL councils will be given an incentive to collect the business rate from new or improved business properties, by being allowed to keep the extra for a year before it is transferred into the business rate pool from which the money is allocated by central government. Making the announcement, Mr John Redwood, the local-government minister, said yesterday that he was sure the cashflow benefit available to them would be welcomed by local authorities. The arrangements will apply from April next year.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / West urges Russia to ease trade curbs Russia could increase its share of the world's foreign direct investment from 1 per cent to 10 per cent within five years if it reduced its internal barriers to trade and promoted a more favourable image abroad, Mr Percy Barnevik, chairman of ABB, the Swedish-Swiss heavy engineering group, said in Moscow yesterday. 'The world knows about Russian oil and gas but it does not know of the advantages to be had in Russia from educated people and high technology,' Mr Barnevik said following a meeting of the Foreign Investment Advisory Council, a business forum designed to assist Russia's re-integration into the world economy. At the two-day meeting, western business leaders expressed their concerns to senior Russian officials and discussed means of attracting greater investment into Russia and promoting its exports more effectively. The Russian team, headed by Mr Anatoly Chubais, first deputy prime minister, and Mr Yevgeny Yasin, economics minister, said they welcomed the contributions from western companies - including Ernst &amp; Young, Mars, Coca-Cola, Thomson, BP and Procter &amp; Gamble - and would consider implementing the recommendations. Three working groups suggested Russia establish a more predictable tax and legislative environment for foreign investors and set up half a dozen business centres in foreign capitals to promote Russia's trade interests. Although many of the western executives publicly praised the extraordinary openness of the Russian government at the meeting, they added in private that it was critical for Russia to act on its good intentions. Mr Robert Wilson, chief executive of RTZ, the British mining company, said: 'You cannot polish the image if the substance is not right. One of the general concerns for the mining industry, in particular, is that we have to have access to world markets, we have to have world prices and we have to be able to use a fully convertible currency.' After taking a telephone call from Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, who is touring the Gulf states, Mr Chubais said: 'It was decided that we will hold a special session of the government to discuss the working plan drawn up by this meeting.' That task will be complicated by the fierce opposition of Russian nationalists, who have complained about Russia selling itself to foreigners.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren met here today with Yoshiro Takasaki, chairman of the  Toyo Seikan Kaisha Company, and Jinemon Konishi, chairman of the  Konishi Foundation for International Exchanges of Japan.    During the meeting, Rong spoke highly of the important role  that the late Tatsunosuke Takasaki, father of Yoshiro, played in  developing Sino-Japanese people-to-people friendship and  economic and trade ties, as well as in the normalization of  bilateral diplomatic relations.    He also praised the son for his continued efforts to further  the relations between the two countries.    "Chinese people will never forget the contributions  Tatsunosuke Takasaki made in this regard," the vice-president  added.    Yoshiro Takasaki said that, like his father, he would spare  no effort for the development of the bilateral ties.    In addition, Rong expressed his appreciation for the work  Konishi did to promote bilateral friendly co-operation.    Konishi, who used to be the chief secretary to Tatsunosuke  Takasaki, told Rong that to develop the friendship in a  sustained way, many famous entrepreneurs and politicians were  accompanying them on the visit.    Rong pointed out that more Japanese investment is flowing  into China, and the potential for two-way trade is very great.    The Japanese guests arrived here Wednesday at the invitation  of the Beijing municipal government.    During their stay here they have acquainted themselves with  Beijing's investment environment, and discussed new co-operative  projects with departments concerned, such as the Beijing general  agriculture, industry and commerce corporation.</p>

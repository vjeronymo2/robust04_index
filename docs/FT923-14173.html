			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Budgens at Pounds 4.6m as recovery continues BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain where institutional shareholders last year installed new management, yesterday claimed to have 'won round one in a fiercely competitive environment'. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m in the year to April 26, compared with a loss of Pounds 14.7m in the previous year. Sales, excluding VAT, were 6.8 per cent higher at Pounds 290.7m (Pounds 272.3m). Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said: 'We have made significant improvements on all fronts and in the face of strong competition. Current sales development is satisfactory. The company has demonstrated its resilience and the management continues with its medium-term plan to restore acceptable levels of profitability.' Sales grew less rapidly in the second half, reflecting increased competition and a reduction in Sunday opening. Having been one of the pioneers of seven-day opening, Budgens this year reduced the number of its 95 stores which opened on Sundays after leading food chains followed suit. Mr von Spreckelsen said distribution costs fell by Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 16.1m, despite higher sales and levels of service to the stores. This had been mainly achieved by increasing the efficiency of its distribution depot. Better buying disciplines had resulted in a modest improvement in gross trading margins. The group hoped to secure further benefits from joining a retail buying consortium under the auspices of the National Independent Supermarket Association. Since the year-end, Budgens has opened two new stores and will refurbish 70 of its existing outlets during the current year, all financed out of cashflow. The group is on track to introduce a full electronic-point-of-sale system by 1994. Trading profits more than doubled to Pounds 6.51m (Pounds 2.96m). Interest payments fell from Pounds 4.85m to Pounds 2.54m, reflecting a fall in gearing to 22 per cent from 40 per cent at the time of last July's refinancing. Earnings per share, after a reduced tax charge, were 3.5p, compared with a losses of 13.3p. On a fully-taxed basis, the earnings would have been 2.2p. Budgens said it would not be appropriate to pay a dividend until it could report further improvements in profitability. COMMENT So far, so good, but is there a long-term future for Budgens? That reaction, and doubt, encapsulated the City's response to these figures. Mr von Spreckelsen admits he felt the group was 'a sitting duck' 12 to 18 months ago, because of its high prices and limited range. He is now confident the stores are back on a recovery track, with store managers being encouraged to respond quickly and flexibly to local competition. There is no doubt more scope for improvement this year, but big stores such as Sainsbury and Tesco are increasingly looking away from superstores and back to the high street. The house broker is predicting annual profits of Pounds 8.5m and a 20 per cent tax rate, which would put the shares, unchanged yesterday at 41p, on a heavily discounted prospective multiple of 10. Other analysts take a more cautious view. Investors looking for a recovery play should be able to find companies facing less ferocious competition.</p>

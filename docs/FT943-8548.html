			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Polish inflation target attacked Poland's central bank has criticised the government's inflation target for next year as unrealistic. Mr Witold Kozinski, deputy president, told Nowa Europa newspaper that the 16 per cent target was unrealistic after this year's 27-28 per cent rate. The government's outline budget, he said, seemed to indicate a sharp rise in central bank financing of the deficit. Unless that share was reduced, the inflation rate would not be brought down. Mr Kozinski called for more information on what the government's financing requirements might be so that the bank could help.</p>

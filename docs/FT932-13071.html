			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Spare us the green shoots Mr Major: Because times are bad, says Dominic Lawson, most of us have never had it so good IT IS 25 months since I wrote the first of these columns, and history has come full circle. Twenty-five months and three Budgets ago, we were being told by Norman Lamont that there were signs of 'the green shoots' of growth in the economy. As it turned out, the only view of green shoots then to be obtained were from a position approximately six feet below. The British economy was still well and truly buried. Now, here we are, green shooting again, although this time John Major has taken on the mantle of garden soothsayer from Lamont, who, understandably, has abandoned the rustic rune business. Speaking as a responsible citizen and loyal employee of an ambitious organisation, I could not be more delighted that this time, as Chauncey Gardner said in Being There, there will be growth in the spring. Speaking personally, I am filled with gloom. For those of us who have kept our jobs during the recession - and we represent the overwhelming majority of the workforce - the bad times have been very good. First, there was the wonderful disintegration of the retail price mechanism. During the recession it was possible to haggle over the price of everything. A friend of mine a few months ago, for a challenge, attempted to get substantial reductions at the places one would least expect it. Asprey's, Claridges, Harrods: they all succumbed. Apart from anything else, the haggle was so enjoyable: it was like travelling to an exotic Middle eastern soukh without all the inconveniences of foreign travel. The economist Fred Hirsch, during the boom years of 1960s came up with a clever concept, which he named 'the positional good.' As I recall, the less one had to share something the more of a positional good it was. For example, a place on an uncrowded beach was said to be worth much more than the same place on the same beach, once it had become crowded. During the boom of the 1980s we came to understand this as the 'German towel on the beach' problem. In other words, if you accept Hirsch's concept, those of us who are doing so-so are actually better off in a recession, because we share the goodies with fewer people. The list of this type of benefit is a long one: the availability of taxis at all times and to all destinations , no matter how awkward; the ability to get a table at a good restaurant without booking; the ability to park a car in a City garage without queuing. Indeed, I do not think I have seen a queue at all in London for at least three years. There is another factor, which Hirsch did not write about: the joy at others' misfortunes. The Germans call it schadenfreude. But it is a particular hobby of the British. The sight of all those financial stars of the 1980s plummeting to earth - or water, in the case of the late Robert Maxwell - has been of enormous cheer to the British. We were uncomfortable with the extraordinary access to great wealth of the likes of Asil Nadir and Alan Bond, not because we thought their methods were suspect - what could we have known of those? - but because such dynamic growth in fortunes mocked our own innate aversion to risk, and our sluggishness. Worse still, during the growth years one experienced the ghastly shock of meeting old school friends whom one had written off as irredeemably stupid, and finding that they had made a great fortune in the City 'stripping mortgages' or 'washing bonds', none of which one understood. These people it seemed, were the only ones who could afford a property in London with their own front door. Are these bad times to come again? Property is the sorest point of all. It amazes me that the media and the public seem to interpret the economy as 'bad' when house prices are falling in real terms and 'good' when they are rising by more than the rate of inflation. I dread newspaper headlines trumpetting estate agents' claims of 'healthy' rises in property prices, and I say this as someone with a heavily mortgaged home. Like most people, other than the very old, I aspire to live in a bigger house. The further property prices fall, the more likely it is that I could afford such a home. And, just as I was planning such innocent self-advancement, along comes the recovery. It's a crying shame. Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator</p>

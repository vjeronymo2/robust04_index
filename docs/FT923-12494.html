			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Bank unveils second stage of its integration plans HONGKONG BANK yesterday disclosed the second stage of plans to integrate its operations with those of Midland Bank following last month's takeover. Mr Stephen Green, an assistant general manager at Hongkong Bank, is to head a combined group treasury from August 1. The treasury operations of the two banks are to be reorganised in London, New York and Tokyo, and the dealing operations of the two banks will be merged, including the capital market activities of Midland and the fixed income business of its subsidiary Greenwell Montagu. Over the last five years Mr Green has helped build up the group's treasury virtually from scratch. Mr Guy Heald, 47, one of a team of treasurers recruited by Mr Green from Chemical Bank in January 1989, is to become number two in the combined treasury operation with responsibility for global markets. Mr Heald currently heads Hongkong Bank's European and Middle East treasury operations, where he is regarded as the driving force in the group treasury. Mr David Clark, who currently runs Midland's treasury, will become Treasurer for Europe. Hongkong Bank hopes that the new group will be able to expand its share of treasury products in mainland European markets by marketing more European corporate products out of London. Other treasury operations in South East Asia will be run by Mr Chris Pavlou. 47, who has been with Hongkong Bank since 1987 when he joined from Barclays and currently handles its treasury operations in Hongkong. The combined treasuries of Hongkong and Midland Banks and James Capel, Hongkong Bank's stockbroking arm, employ around 1000 people including 505 dealers. The merger is not expected to lead to any job losses.</p>

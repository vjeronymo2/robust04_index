			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- All members of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) have been urged to study modern  science and technology alongside the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Deng  Xiaoping and general knowledge on building a socialist market  economy.    In today's world, the general office of the CPC Central  Committee says in a circular publicized today, technology is  developing rapidly and international competition in this field  is growing ever more fierce.    "Under such circumstances," the circular says, "we will find  ourselves in a passive condition if we hesitate to arm our party  members and cadres with modern science and technology or improve  the scientific and cultural level of the Chinese nation."    In studies, the circular says, special attention should be  paid to the thesis "economic construction should rely on science  and technology and scientific and technological work should  serve economic construction" promulgated by Deng Xiaoping so as  to shift the focus of economic construction and social  development to technological advances and the improvement of the  skills of workers.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Cummins in engine deal with Kamaz CUMMINS, the US diesel engine maker, and Kamaz, the Russian truck producer, are to build a Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) engine plant after a fire in April wiped out half Kamaz's uninsured engine-producing capacity. Mr Henry Schacht, Cummins' chairman, said the new plant, to produce 50,000 diesel engines a year, could come on stream in 1996-7, and marked a 'larger project on a much shorter time scale' than earlier plans for a joint venture to produce just 20,000 engines. He said the 'world class plant' would be financed by a mixture of equity investment by both companies, and loans from international financial institutions. These are likely to include multilateral organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The bank has been hard-pressed to find Russian investment projects, as western commercial banks have stopped financing Russian projects without official western guarantees. Mr Nikolai Bekh, chairman of Kamaz, said he hoped the new engines would enable Kamaz to increase truck exports to the west from 12 to 30 per cent of output.</p>

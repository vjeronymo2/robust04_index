			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICA SURPRISES TOP-SEEDED HART TO ADVANCE  </P> <P> Hart High School Coach Al Weil watched his team lose Friday in the Southern  Section 4-A quarterfinals by the same score as last year, 1-0, with the run  coming in the same half inning -- the bottom of the seventh.  </P> <P> Pacifica (16-8) eliminated top-seeded Hart from the playoffs to reach the  semifinals for the first time.  </P> <P> "We were coming out to win, not just come out to be satisfied with the season,"  said Rob Weil, Pacifica's first-year coach.  </P> <P> "You've got to score a run," Hart's Al Weil said. "It's the name of the game.  We score one run, we win. They score one run, they win."  </P> <P> The game was scoreless until the last at-bat, when Pacifica first baseman Dena  Villasenor, slowed by a knee injury, led off by bouncing a single over third  baseman Kim Curtis' head into left field. Villasenor hobbled to first, where  she was replaced by pinch-runner Carrie Parker.  </P> <P> Villasenor, a senior, went two for three, accounting for half of Pacifica's  hits. And her coach said he had decided to let her play before the game.  </P> <P> "She was questionable yesterday with a knee injury," Rob Weil said. "So I took  a chance with her, hoping for the base hit."  </P> <P> Parker stole second when catcher Stephanie Keeler hesitated on the throw,  following a strikeout by Susan Denny.  </P> <P> "That's another one (Parker) on the injured list that just came back," Rob Weil  said. "Carrie was out three weeks with a bad back. Usually, she's our starting  center fielder. But today's her first day back."  </P> <P> Pitcher Jennifer Surface came up, after having struck out twice, and ripped the  first pitch up the middle.  </P> <P> Hart second baseman Jamie Dean dove, but the ball got past her and rolled into  center field, and the throw to the plate was late.  </P> <P> "(Hart pitcher Kym Weil) had been pitching me risers all day," Surface said. "I  knew this would be my last chance. I had struck out twice, and I knew that I  had to chop it -- I had to come at a different angle, and I just mentally  pictured it."  </P> <P> "Jennifer focused herself well," Rob Weil said. "She's a perfectionist, and  she's been coming through and doing well. She's got a lot of composure for a  sophomore."  </P> <P> Surface, 15, struck out nine and walked one, with only two hits. And she is  unsatisfied.  </P> <P> "I feel there's always room for improvement," she said. "There's always  something to work on. Right now, I have to work on the location of my pitching,  concentrate on keeping the ball down, and I need to really work on my hitting."  </P></p>

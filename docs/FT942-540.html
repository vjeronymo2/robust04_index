			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Ciller to seek tax deal with industry Turkey's prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, meets industrialists in Ankara today in an attempt to keep her austerity programme on track, as companies call for tax cuts to offset the impact of shrinking demand and a depreciating lira. A deal seems likely which would see the government forgo some tax revenues, while industry would restrain or even reduce prices. Such an arrangement could make efforts to meet the fiscal reduction envisaged in the April 5 austerity package more difficult. However, with the country due to sign a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund in early July, Mrs Ciller is clearly keen to ensure the headline inflation figure continues to fall. The issue is vital at a time when the government is urging wage restraint in the current collective bargaining with public sector workers. Annual inflation rose to 117 per cent in May, from 107 per cent in April in the wake of what the government promised was one-off rises in official commodity prices. However, monthly figures fell from 24 per cent in April to 10 per cent last month and the government aims to cut monthly price rises to less than 3 per cent for the rest of the year. Mrs Ciller has already given ground on tax breaks for the car industry, perhaps the worst affected industry. This week, the government agreed to reduce the car tax from 12 to 6 per cent, and waive the 23 per cent value added tax for dealers in second-hand cars to try to boost demand. The car sector has laid off 20 per cent of its total workforce and sales have fallen 80 per cent, according to the motor manufacturers' association. The government is also negotiating with foreign petrol retailers who raised prices on May 31 to offset refinery losses following the lira devaluation and the rise in world oil prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Northwestern Province Deputy Minister Reverend Amos  Chisipawa has directed police in Mililunga to close two shops  opened on the Angolan border by a foreign investor. Addressing  public workers at Mililunga Secondary School, Rev. Chipawa said  that police in the area should not allow foreign investors to  establish shops in the border area. He emphasized that  investors interested in retail should establish shops at the  Boma [traditional authority] and not border areas because the  peace of the nation could be compromised. The minister called on  Zambians to be security conscious and report suspicions  characters to authorities.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY OKS $4.7 MILLION FOR THEATER PARKING  </P> <P> City officials signed a $4.7-million agreement this week to provide parking for  the Fox Fullerton Theatre, a decision that paves the way for the restoration  and reopening of the historic movie house.  </P> <P> The City Council voted 4 to 1 to spend the money to buy and demolish houses  behind the theater, relocate the tenants living there and build a 200-space  parking garage on the land.  </P> <P> Also, the council tentatively agreed to buy a former mortuary east of the Fox  to allow for better access to the parking structure and improve parking for  adjacent retail shops.  </P> <P> In exchange, the owner of the Fox, Edward G. Lewis, must spend up to $1.55  million to restore the theater's six Italian-style murals and stage decorations  and bring the building up to modern earthquake and handicapped-accessibility  standards.  </P> <P> That amount is in addition to the $1.1 million that Lewis said he has already  spent fixing up the building. Lewis also agreed to pay $150,000 toward the  purchase of the mortuary building, since he owns the retail shops that would  benefit from the added parking.  </P> <P> Councilman Richard C. Ackerman voted against the Fox project, saying the cost  to reopen the theater is too high.  </P> <P> The city came up with the $4.7 million through selling $4.1 million in bonds  last year for the Fox project and collecting $600,000 in interest from the  bonds.  </P> <P> City officials have cited the project as an important element in bringing more  shoppers to downtown Fullerton, especially in the evening.  </P> <P> "This is a big commitment (Lewis) is asking us for, but I think it's  justified," Councilman Chris Norby said. "It (the theater) really is the last  of a vanishing breed in Orange County." TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

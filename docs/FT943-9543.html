			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian farmers to get drought aid The Australian government yesterday announced an ADollars 14m (USDollars 10m) relief package for farmers in drought-stricken Queensland and northern New South Wales, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne. Mr Bob Collins, the primary industries minister, ordered the immediate release of ADollars 5m of the funds to New South Wales and ADollars 2.5m to Queensland. He said the government would top up the ADollars 14m if the drought persisted. The government has so far spent ADollars 75m in emergency assistance to farmers, in the form of interest and farm workers' wage subsidies, counselling and direct handouts. In Queensland, which faces the fourth consecutive year of dry weather, 35 per cent of the state has been declared a drought area. In New South Wales, which only last year had a good grain crop, almost 60 per cent has been declared to be suffering the drought.</p>

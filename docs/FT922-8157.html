			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Bahrain to change commercial law BAHRAIN is planning big changes in commercial laws which have been in effect for nearly two decades, as part of wide-ranging plans to revive its economy, Reuter reports from Bahrain. Mr Habib Kassem, commerce and agriculture minister, said yesterday the laws  -which will alter the rigid relationship between foreign companies and local agents - would be introduced by the end of May. He told the Gulf Daily News that the changes would address complaints from the international business community and promote free competition. One authorised trader in Bahrain has the monopoly of distributing any foreign product, and the contract drawn up between the two parties is unalterable. Bahrain last year broke with long-standing tradition by issuing laws that would allow wholly foreign-owned companies to operate in the country, providing they made it a regional base.</p>

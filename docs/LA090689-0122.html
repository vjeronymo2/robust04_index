			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MILSAP INSERTS SOME SOLID, AFFECTING MOMENTS IN GLIB, FORMULAIC SHOW  </P> <P> Ronnie Milsap's compromised country music practically epitomizes everything the  "new traditionalist" movement sought to overturn: His crossover style crossed  so far over that his records often sounded closer to Lionel Richie than to  Jimmie Rodgers, and, like Richie's, his songs could be so slick as to have no  hold on reality.  </P> <P> But in an odd way, the success of the traditionalists might make it easier for  some to appreciate Milsap's music. Now that country purists don't have to be  outraged by Milsap and other main-streamers squeezing the grittier country off  the airwaves, they might relax a bit and find that he can be a solid and  affecting performer.  </P> <P> He proved to be just that several times in his late show Monday evening at  Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Steak House and Saloon -- although those moments were  packed into a show that was largely glib and formulaic.  </P> <P> The blind singer/pianist and his eight-piece band opened with serviceable  versions of the wan hits "Don't You Know How Much I Love You," "Don't You Ever  Get Tired of Hurting Me" and "What a Difference You've Made in My Life."  </P> <P> He then crammed seven of his early hits into a medley where the truncated  versions were scarcely longer than their cumbersome titles. While such medleys  might be the only way Milsap could fit his many hits into the show, the  bite-size renditions were too brief to build any emotional effect. And some,  such as the tragic "It Was Almost Like a Song" and the novelty-item "I'm a  Stand by My Woman Man," were horribly juxtaposed.  </P> <P> A medley of songs by rock piano greats fared better, particularly when he  mimicked Ray Charles on "What'd I Say" and "Georgia." He even climbed atop his  piano and jumped off at the end of Little Richard's "Lucille."  </P> <P> Milsap had joked throughout the show about his blindness and his ability to get  around on stage. Although most of the humor and his patter with band members  seemed rehearsed, there was at least one unexpected moment: When he joked about  falling into the audience, commenting, "At 200 pounds, I'd ruin someone's  evening," an undaunted female fan shouted: "You can fall on my table!"  </P> <P> Milsap's gravity as a performer best came across, oddly enough, on his most  overtly crossover numbers. Although pumped by a disco beat and warbling  synthesizers, Milsap sang "Button Off My Shirt" and the encore "Stranger in My  House" with exuberance and spirit. It might not have been country, by any  hard-line definition, but it worked.  </P></p>

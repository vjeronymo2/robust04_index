			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] The fifth of Ordibehesht [25 April] this week  was the 14th anniversary of the U.S. abortive military attack on  Tabas. A glance at events during this relatively lengthy period  demonstrates that Washington has never abandoned attempts to  attack Islamic Iran by various means. But just as in its attack  on the Tabas desert all its attempts have somehow failed.    The continuous confrontation between the Islamic Republic of  Iran [IRI] and the United States since the victory of the  Islamic revolution has been one of the most complex  confrontations of the recent decades, which have engaged two  international political entities. Ploys and parameters  exploited by Washington in this confrontation are very diverse  and extensive. In the field of politics, the White House takes  advantage of its influence in such international forums as the  United Nations and Amnesty International. It does not miss an  opportunity either to persuade or force member countries of such  regional bodies as the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and the  Arab League to pressure and isolate Iran. [passage omitted]    At present Washington is carefully monitoring every military  purchase by Tehran. By exaggerating the Islamic Republic's  military objectives and by repeating allegations that Iran is  seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, it is pursuing some sort of  covert embargo. Also in the confrontation against the Islamic  revolution, the White House is extensively exploiting the lever  of economic pressure. American officials exploit their  relations with major European or Asian states to carefully  monitor any expansion of economic ties between Iran and these  states. To check the IRI's economic capabilities, the American  officials on occasion have been prepared to pay a high price.  These sorts of reactions by such a country as America seems odd  and incredible, unless one tries to analyze these stances by  understanding the depth of imperialism's grudge against Islam.    In the face of the diverse and extensive ploys designed by  the U.S. strategists to confront the Islamic revolution, the IRI  leadership, while being vigilantly aware of the complexity of an  all-embracing struggle, is relying on two basic axes: First on  Islam as a comprehensive and effective system to realize the  revolution's short-term or long-term goals; and second on  maintaining the people's presence to strengthen legitimacy of  the regime. On the surface these two factors seem so simple,  but they provide so much strength and have the potential to  divert the continuous Washington-Tehran confrontation to favor  the Islamic revolution in practice.</p>

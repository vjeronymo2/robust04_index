			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Loud cries of protest - As a new mother, Rachel Johnson reacts against the hard-sell tactics of the baby products manufacturers For most mothers-to-be in the UK, the marketing campaign starts at 12 weeks, peaks shortly after delivery and then never seems to end. On the National Health Service, women book into a hospital when they are about three months' pregnant. After blood tests and consultation with a midwife they are given a red plastic folder containing two items: a card detailing further appointments and a 'Bounty Pregnancy Guide'. No less than a third of the pages of this glossy booklet, which declares it is written with the help and advice of members of the Royal College of Midwives, feature the sort of sickly advertisements that could only be found in a specialist publication. Take the first few. 'No job's too big for Baby Fresh,' says the baby-wipes manufacturer; 'Come on, push, push, push, push, push,' runs the text accompanying a picture of a Mothercare buggy. 'I want to be the best mum in the whole world,' says the Prudential in its drive to sell products to make baby more financially secure in the future. Months later, the newly-delivered mother lies in her hospital bed snatching a few moments of rest between visiting hours. A trolley laden with large sealed gift bags, pushed by one of 260 distributors from Bounty, the Diss-based publishing and services company that charges mother-and-baby companies a fee for joining its syndicated sampling service, is making the rounds. If the woman accepts the assortment of Pampers nappies, Drapolene nappy cream, baby bath and other goodies without filling in a card saying she does not want to receive 'further free samples and product information', she goes on a list. For Bounty is at liberty under the Data Protection Act to put her name on its database, to sell on to the large number of companies hungry to tap into the baby products market - worth Pounds 1.5bn in 1990. Paul D'Inverno, publications director of Bounty, claims his company is the only one with a nationwide spread; neither competitor he mentions, Newborn or Lifecycle Marketing, has contracts with hospitals. Everyone is subjected to advertising from cradle to grave, not just pregnant women and new mothers. But advertisers do seem to reserve a peculiar intensity for these groups. 'Heinz carefully markets its baby food to parents to make sure they get the information they need and want,' said a Heinz spokesman. And Bounty's business, advertising mother and baby products, is perfectly legal - though some might say that women are exhausted and distracted by the free samples at the one opportunity they are granted to avoid an avalanche of direct mail over the coming months. Even so, many expectant or recent mothers will agree with Cathy Irons, the business manager of maternity services at St Mary's Hospital in London. She says that such women are particularly 'vulnerable to advertising from all sides'. There are at least two reasons for this. First is the natural urge to be the perfect mother, exactly the button the Prudential pushed in its financial services advertisement. At the same time, first-time mothers have little idea which of the myriad products manufacturers insist they need buy to strive towards this perfection are useful, and which are expensive extras. In the past, for instance, objections were raised because the Bounty pack included sweet, syrupy drinks which could lead to tooth decay. Philippa Need of the National Childbirth Trust says: 'You are made to feel everything is so essential. But a baby bath, for example, is a complete irrelevance.' According to the Health Visitors' Association, women spent on average Pounds 1,050 in 1990 on clothes and equipment in the first year. At the same time, one in four of these had been means tested to receive the Pounds 100 state maternity grant. Christine Gowdridge of the Maternity Alliance, which provides advice on maternity care and state benefits, says it is not uncommon for a woman to spend heavily on a new pushchair or steam steriliser to find she cannot afford the basic nappies and babyclothes. 'It's all too easy to succumb to well-targeted adverts,' she says. BT is just one of the 100 companies that bought Bounty's list of new mothers earlier this year. I was on it. In April, Bounty sent me - on behalf of BT - a glossy leaflet promoting mobile telephones and answering machines. 'Now that you're a new mum, you can't drop everything every time the 'phone rings, can you?' it wheedled, next to a picture of a dressing-gowned woman cradling a rosy-cheeked baby. I binned it with a practised flick.</p>

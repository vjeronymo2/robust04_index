			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, chief of the </F> Main Directorate for Educational and Sociopsychological Work of  the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: "The Scientific Approaches  in the Work of the Organs of Educational and Sociopsychological  Work Aim at Increasing the State of Discipline of Military  Personnel"]    [Text] The so-called "human factor" plays an important role  in any form of activity. It is the positive development of this  factor in conditions of military service that is the goal of the  organs of Educational and Sociopsychological Work [VSPR]. The  ultimate goal of these efforts is to improve the performance by  the Armed Forces of their set tasks. The part played by the VSPR  organs in attaining this end consists of applying measures of  educational and sociopsychological influence to affect such a  specific indicator as the moral-psychological state of personnel.    This indicator is characterized primarily by the fact that  it  is very sensitive to a large number of factors to which a member  of the military is subject. Thus, it is an integrating factor in  which numerous components are concentrated. These components  involve satisfying various human needs, ranging from the  biologically programmed need for security and the need to  satisfy physiological needs to the highest spiritual needs.    Ultimately, it is this highest level that is decisive in  evaluating an individual's moral-psychological state, but this  can only be built if there exists a more earthly foundation for  it.    Thus, considering the complexity of an individual's needs  and  that the degree to which each is satisfied in turn affects an  individual's moral-psychological state, we need to speak of a  very broad spectrum of directions in our work, all of them aimed  in one way or another at ensuring a satisfactory  moral-psychological state of our troops. We need to recognize  that some of these directions lie beyond the scope of the  jurisdiction of the VSPR organs.    But there exists a law that is of fundamental importance to  us: Just as certain factors affect the moral-psychological state  of the troops, this state itself affects the attitude of  personnel to all sorts of factors -- living conditions, the  level of danger to life, restrictions in the sphere of social  intercourse, etc. The degree to which spiritual needs are  developed and an adequate system for satisfying these needs can  compensate even for very significant deprivations that are part  and parcel of military-professional activity as a whole and  engaging in combat [vedennya boyovykh diy] in particular.    In other words, a military collective, whose  moral-psychological state is at a sufficiently high level, is  capable of maintaining it at the proper level on its own. We  need only professionally ensure this basic level of development.  Once it is reached, universal laws of self-regulation of complex  systems begin to operate.    Obviously, everything has its limits, and we should know  what  these limits are and take them into account in our work.    The above reflections may seem theoretical, but only at  first  glance. We are discussing a very concrete issue -- defining the  sphere of our practical work and the fundamental methods we must  use to accomplish this job.    In the most general sense, let us begin with the premise  that  the sphere of our work is to influence the moral-psychological  state, and that the method by which we exert this influence is  by directing sociopsychological processes.    The moral-psychological state is measured by many individual  factors, which in their aggregate create a complex system. One  such sociopsychological indicator is the state of discipline of  personnel [dystsyplinovanist osobovoho skladu], by which we mean  the readiness of each individual soldier and the military  community as a whole to abide by the accepted standards of  military service: Military regulations, orders of commanders and  superiors, directions, instructions, etc. Such readiness needs  to be formed on both the conscious and unconscious levels of  each individual. This is achieved by combining educational,  including ideological, work with sociopsychological influence  into an interactive system.    Why do we need to speak of such a system? Because the state  of discipline is founded on a very wide range of  psychophysiological, psychological, and sociopsychological  factors. Directly included in the sociopsychological factors are  the specific qualities and characteristics of each individual --  his patriotism, convictions, devotion to his Fatherland, etc.  The system of educational work is specifically designed to form  these traits; this is the goal of professional sociologists  [narodoznavtsi], the system of the humanitarian training of  personnel, and the like. In other words, those who regard the  sphere of sociopsychological factors to be the exclusive sphere  of psychologists are very much mistaken.    Unfortunately, at this stage, our educational work is mostly  confined to simple imparting of information, whereas it should  carry some emotional content, draw the soldier into the deepest  strata of his nation's historical memory and the worldview of  his ancestors, base itself on subconscious national archetypes.  Educational work will then produce significantly better results  in increasing the state of discipline of military personnel.    When working to increase the state of discipline of military  personnel, it is necessary to keep in mind that this feature is  dynamic -- depending on various conditions, the level of  discipline of each individual soldier can change significantly  over a short period of time. In particular, the level of  discipline can be easily affected by excessive organizational  measures conducted by superiors, as well as many other things  that can produce a sense of inner dissatisfaction with the  situation in which a person finds himself in military service.  This dissatisfaction can activate the corresponding  psychological mechanisms, but it will require purely  organizational rather than sociopsychological measures.    There is a direct link between the state of discipline of  personnel as a sociopsychological indicator and the general  level of military discipline. Increasing military discipline is  the common goal of virtually all structures of military  leadership; every official bears his own measure of  responsibility for this discipline. But the foundation of  military discipline in the Armed Forces is the state of  discipline of personnel.    Can military discipline be maintained at a more or less  satisfactory level if the state of discipline of personnel  remains low?    I should note that that was exactly what we always tried to  do by directing all our efforts at increasing military  discipline not by forming a sociopsychological characteristic  like a state of discipline in personnel, but by creating  conditions in which an undisciplined soldier -- that is, one  psychologically prepared to violate discipline -- would be  compelled to abide by accepted standards because of increased  supervision, increased exactingness, etc.    Let us be frank -- we are not satisfied with the quality of  our contingent of conscripts. Every professional activity is  based on the possession of certain individual psychological  characteristics by the person performing the activity, and  military service is no exception. There exists a so-called  professional profile [profesiohrama] of a soldier, which defines  the necessary individual psychological characteristics required  for normal service. Those individual psychological  characteristics that are associated with the state of discipline  of a soldier are an essential component of the professional  profile and must be studied by experts in the military  commissariats in the process of conscription.    Thus, the sociopsychological study of a conscript's  personality plays an important role in preventing violations of  military discipline. This study anticipates an assessment of the  candidate's moral qualities, the motives underlying his conduct  and activity, his military professional orientation, the way he  interacts and behaves in a group, and other individual  psychological qualities.    The sociopsychological study of individual traits cannot  rely  solely on information obtained from tests; it must be based on  an analysis of the formation and development of an individual.    By analyzing an individual's biography, the conditions in  which he was reared and his personality developed, it is  possible to obtain information about his professional interests,  moral principles, character traits, distinguishing features of  his emotional makeup, organizational skills, etc.    We take into account that the development of personality is  affected by the composition of the family, the way in which  family members interact, the family's social and living  conditions, and the interests and paramount requirements of the  family as a whole.    Viewing moral qualities as stable features of an  individual's  conscious mind, which are reflected to a certain degree in his  character, during the process of professional selection, the  social psychologist makes use of the entire arsenal of  psychological methods and methodologies. Based on the results of  this analysis, a conclusion is reached regarding the probability  of the subject's success or failure to perform under the  conditions involved in military service and steps to prevent  possible deviations in conduct are recommended.    But what can we do in today's circumstances in the event  that  this prognosis is negative? After all, this individual will  still end up in the Armed Forces. The present situation does not  allow us to create a professional army, in which recruitment  into the military would be conducted on a competitive basis. At  present, we take everyone. As a result, we frequently encounter  a situation in which we are forced -- metaphorically speaking --  to make a musician out of a deaf man. To continue the same  metaphor, all that we can do under the circumstances is not  entrust the "deaf man" with a "violin" but with something closer  to a "drum."    If we attain our goal of increasing the state of discipline  of personnel, will this mean an automatic increase in the level  of military discipline in general? It should be clearly  understood that although there is a direct link between the  state of discipline of personnel and overall military  discipline, the state of discipline of subordinates is not  always enough to compensate for miscalculations in general  organizational matters, problems in creating the necessary  conditions, etc.    Another thing that educators must recognize is that although  the state of discipline of personnel is a sociopsychological  indicator, this indicator, like the level of military discipline  in general, is also affected by factors other than  sociopsychological ones. Therefore, the deputy commander in  charge of educational and sociopsychological work cannot ignore  the wide range of issues that in one way or another involve the  interests and needs of the individual. This approach is also  reflected in the Temporary Regulations of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine.    The practical methods used by the VSPR organs in the sphere  that involves the needs and underlying motives of conduct of  personnel can vary widely, depending on specific conditions and  practical possibilities. The temporary failure to satisfy one  need can be compensated by satisfying another need, which a  military psychologist and educator can ensure in a timely  fashion. The fact that there are certain restrictions in  military life can be accepted more readily by personnel if the  system of motives is influenced in a proper professional manner.  In certain conditions, the professional responsibility of a VSPR  official may require candidly telling a superior about the range  of possibilities in educational work and sociopsychological  measures. It is, after all, possible to create a situation in  which a person will basically refuse to execute every single  order unless hypnotized to do so.    The VSPR organs must anticipate the dynamics of the  moral-psychological state of personnel under the influence of  the system of dominant factors and respond in timely manner to  potential problems.    Work that is oriented on a conceptual approach to increasing  military discipline by VSPR organs through influencing the state  of discipline of personnel must be based on a scientifically  founded sociopsychological system as an adjunct of military  service. Allow me to list the main requirements of such a system.    It should provide for unified algorithms of activity on the  part of VSPR professionals, taking into account the specific  features of the sociopsychological characteristics of soldiers  at various stages in their service, the psychological laws of  group dynamics in military subunits, the laws underlying the  impact of factors characteristic of military service on the  individual at various stages of military service, and the like.    The system of the sociopsychological adjunct of military  service must resemble a production flow chart [tekhnichna karta]  of the work of VSPR professionals, which takes into account the  actual level of training of military specialists by providing  several alternative methods of work. There should be a base  variant, which could be introduced immediately at the level that  we have today, as well as alternatives involving a higher level,  which, in addition to the basic measures that use the popular  methodologies "Prohnoz," KOS-KOR, sociometrics, and some others,  would also provide for the use of a higher degree of  psychological manipulation.    An understanding of all these elements focuses our attention  on our scientific base. What kind of base do we have today? We  do not have a single up-to-date textbook on psychology for the  military that would meet world standards in this field. In fact,  we have no Ukrainian handbooks at all. Almost nothing is being  done to train our own scientific cadres for the Armed Forces of  Ukraine in the fields of educational work and meeting the  sociopsychological needs of personnel in the districts and  branches of the Armed Forces.    Another problem that we encounter in introducing modern  scientific approaches in the work of the VSPR organs is the need  that they be based on what I would call an adequate level of  civilization in both society at large and the military  environment. Our sociopsychological measures must be based on a  certain level of understanding on the part of all officials of  the specific features of our professional activity and on a  proper attitude towards this work, on a readiness to introduce  modern social techniques and "sophisticated" methods of  influencing the moral-psychological state of our troops. This  requires that we provide proper training not only for our  specialists, but also for our entire officer corps, starting  from the time they are attending military educational  institutions.    All this lies in the future. But it requires that we take  certain practical steps immediately. We need to encourage the  directors of the Scientific-Research and Methodological Center  of the Main Directorate of Educational and Sociopsychological  Work of the Ministry of Defense to devote very serious attention  to this matter. I expect them to provide teaching manuals for  the forces that have been prepared on a modern scientific level  and a detailed sociopsychological system of support in military  service, which we need to begin introducing in stages in the  Armed Forces starting now. In addition, we are waiting for a  prospective program [perspektyvna prohrama] developed jointly  with the Defense Ministry's Main Directorate for Military  Education for providing officers in command cadres with basic  sociopsychological training.    Any assessment of the contribution of the VSPR organs to  increasing military discipline must be based on an assessment of  their actual contribution to raising the level of the state of  personnel discipline -- i.e., what concrete steps were taken  towards this end. But this general assessment needs to be made  more specific. It is not enough to simply add up the number of  measures that were applied in evaluating the activity of VSPR  organs. We have something different in mind.    First, all measures used in educational work and  sociopsychological support must be combined into an integrated  system, in which everything is interconnected. In other words,  in order to assess the work of the VSPR organs, it is necessary  to establish the degree of conceptual uniformity in the measures  applied.    Second, it is necessary to assess the justification for  every  measure and its specific objective. The specialist must  understand clearly why at any given moment he applies a specific  measure and to a specific extent.    Third, each measure applied by the VSPR organs must be  assessed in terms of how well it meets professional standards,  as well as how effective it is in accomplishing its designated  purpose.    Fourth, it is necessary to take into consideration to what  degree the measures applied by the VSPR organs reflect all the  directions of our work, beginning with the methodological and  experimental spheres and ending with that of individual  education.    Fifth, VSPR professionals must posssess thorough and  comprehensive information about the real state of affairs in  their sphere.    This set of indicators of the activity of the organs of the  VSPR makes it possible to give an objective and integral  assessment of the quality of this work.    Simplifying the system of assessment, reducing it to merely  quantitative indicators, cannot be allowed, because this will  inevitably lead to a surrogate level in practice.    Another vitally important question concerns the ways in  which  the VSPR organs make a practical contribution to the overall  assessment of the state of military discipline as a basis for  planning further work in this field.    Only those categories that belong to the sociopsychological  field can be subject to sociopsychological analysis. With  respect to military discipline, this category is the state of  discipline of personnel. Thus the role of the VSPR organs in the  overall assessment of the state of military discipline is to  conduct a thoroughgoing professional assessment of the state of  discipline of personnel, which must be based on:    -- a general statistical record of violations of military  discipline, which are kept by the military staffs;    -- a legal analysis of the situation, which is conducted by  the legal specialists in the VSPR organs;    -- an understanding of the social processes in the Armed  Forces arrived at with the help of sociological studies;    -- a deep understanding of the psychological and  psychophysiological factors that operate in military subunits  and affect the level of discipline;    -- the results of a study specifically designed to analyze  the level of the state of discipline of personnel in units and  subunits using the methods of sociopsychological research. We  have already discussed how this can be done.    Thus, only a scientific approach, based on an analysis of  the  daily activity of the VSPR organs, can bring positive results in  the activity of professional educators and promote a high level  of discipline among personnel.</p>

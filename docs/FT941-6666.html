			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Mortgage lending by big banks falls 25% in month Mortgage lending by leading British banks fell by more than a quarter in January compared with the month before. Gross loans were Pounds 1.01bn, down from Pounds 1.36bn, according to yesterday's figures from the British Bankers' Association. This was the seventh successive monthly fall since the Pounds 1.72bn gross figure of June last year. Seasonally adjusted figures for net lending also dropped, from Pounds 733m in December to Pounds 588m in January. Mortgage approvals also continued to fall - to 19,297 approvals with a value of Pounds 914m, after December figures of 20,348 with a value of Pounds 968m. Approvals are seen as an important indicator of the state of the mortgage market, so the fall of slightly more than 5 per cent is less discouraging for the banks than December's sharper drop, which was reflected in January's lower mortgage lending figures. Mr John Ecklin, BBA statistics director, said yesterday that he expected the leading banks' share of the UK mortgage market in January to be about 33 per cent, compared with more than 35 per cent during 1993. This suggests that building societies have begun to regain some ground.</p>

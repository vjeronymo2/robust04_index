			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he favors early  empowerment in towns in the West Bank. In an address to the  Jewish Agency's annual assembly in Jerusalem last night, Peres  said the Palestinians have the right to run their own lives:    [Begin Peres recording] No, I do not see any reason why we  should not go ahead with what is being called the early  empowerment, particularly in the large cities like Nabulus,  Ramallah. Why should we be there as their tax collectors, as  their teachers? They have their own curriculum. Why should we  force them to read our curriculum? I mean, the idea that their  agony is not necessarily our happiness is basic.    You know, some people criticize me that while during the  negotiations I agreed to give almost a passport to the Gazan  people. I did not understand this criticism. What joy does it  give us? There will be 800,000 people without passports. We did  not want to give them ours. Why should we take away from them  the right to have a passport? I never saw a person killing  another person by hitting a passport on his head, but I saw a  person killing because they did not have a passport. Let us be  a little wise and generous. I do not see why should we not let  the people to run their daily lives, though I admit I consider  that the negotiations with the Palestinians over the principle  of early empowerment, which means to hand over some of the  responsibilities in the other parts of the territories to their  hands, will be very complicated and very difficult, but we have  to start and go ahead. [end recording]    Peres also said it would be useless to link the release of  Palestinian prisoners to obtaining information on missing and  captured Israeli soldiers. Israel believes Ron Arad is held by  Iran, which opposes the peace process, Peres said. He said the  government takes the matter seriously, but he added that telling  the Palestinians the peace process will not continue until more  information is obtained will not help, since the missing  Israelis are not being held by Yasir 'Arafat.    [Begin Peres recording] We do not believe that the missing  soldiers are in his hands and that the ones who have control  over it are not necessarily listening to 'Arafat. So if we  shall do it, we shall introduce a service against ourselves. It  will be totally counterproductive. [end recording]</p>

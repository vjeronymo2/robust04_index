			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The sleepy side of life for Weekend FT readers In the Weekend FT of September 18 Nicholas Lander wrote about the problems which restaurateurs face when a diner falls asleep. This seems to have tickled readers' fancies and, judging by your letters, is a far from uncommon problem. We offered a bottle of pink champagne to the reader with the best solution to a dozing dining partner. The winning letter comes from Takuro Hoshi of Japan who provided one of the most detailed accounts of how to deal with the problem. Letters have been cut and edited where necessary. From Christina Foyle I was amused by your article on people who doze off at luncheons. I have had two experiences of this. Jeffrey Bernard (journalist and raconteur) fell asleep on my shoulder at a luncheon I gave to Judge Pickles. On another occasion, many years ago, the chairman at the lunch was Sir Walter Gilbey (of gin fame). The chairman should confine his remarks to introducing the speaker, about five to ten minutes, but Sir Walter Gilbey spoke for an hour and a half] Nobody could do anything to stop him. In front of my father, an elderly gentleman had fallen asleep and it looked rather rude so my father picked up the toastmaster's gavel and tapped the man on the shoulder. The man stirred and said: 'Hit me harder, I can still hear him]' In arranging my luncheons the worst two things that can happen are that the speaker talks too long, or is drunk, especially if it is a bishop] I am sure my next one for Lady Thatcher will not suffer from any of these problems. Maldon, Essex. From Helen Smelt-Webb Your article on dozing diners was very amusing. I have one solution. Take a feather from your boa and light it from the candle on the table. The smell will rouse the soundest sleeper. Stillington, York. From Mr CH Massingham Thank you for your interesting and amusing article in today's Weekend FT. Here is my remedy: Always have a pillow available (and all serving staff aware of it), suitably embroidered with the words: 'One needs to be awake to enjoy our food but you are always welcome.' Should a similar instance ever recur, with the minimum fuss, remove dangerous items such as glasses etc. from the table and replace with pillow, with wording facing the other guests. When the couple finally leave, do not remove the pillow. You and your other guests out of natural curiosity will try and pass the table to try and read what was written on it. Thus, afterwards, when the victim or any other of the guests tell their friends about the incident, they will not be talking negatively about the sleeper, but positively about the restaurant. Lee-On-Solent, Hants. From Peter Hollins We recently held a sales conference at a country club in Tennessee. One evening a salesman fell asleep over dinner, much to the amusement of his 25-30 colleagues. Everyone quietly left the dining room, the lights were dimmed and a waitress then awoke the sleeping guest and presented him with the entire bill for dinner] His horror at the enormity of his faux pas was only matched by his embarrassment when he realised that the whole act had been watched by his colleagues, as well as members and staff at the Country Club. Boston, Massachussetts. From Gabriel Goodall Your article touched a particularly raw nerve in that for a number of years I have been falling asleep in precisely the same circumstances as you outline. On one occasion I had finally persuaded a particularly attractive girl to come to dinner. I woke to find an appropriate note and no girl. Whilst one can laugh about it I can assure you that this affliction, somehow peculiar to restaurants, renders one almost powerless to stay awake. I have in the past sought medical advice - to no avail. When afflicted I have gone to the restaurant bathroom and splashed cold water on my face; drunk large quantities of water quickly; gone outside for a walk in the fresh air etc. The most frustrating aspect is that if left asleep until after dinner one has subsequently an extraordinary surge of energy and a strong inclination to continue the night's activities 'clubbing' and so on. One's friends of course just want to go home to bed. London SW11 From ALR Fincham One of the more exclusive cricket clubs I have occasionally had the privilege of turning out for is the St Moritz Cricket Club, which stages an annual match on the frozen lake there each February. Some four to five years ago, one of our number fell into a deep sleep over the team dinner in a local restaurant. We sent for a spare tablecloth and covered him from head to toe with the cloth so that he took on the appearance of a ghost. Every now and again throughout the meal the ghost stirred, thereby causing amusement to other diners, but he never woke until we left the restaurant at the end of the evening when we, not without difficulty, recalled him from his deep slumbers and took him home. I think the restaurant staff probably found this approach helpful as, if I recall correctly, they did not serve the individual concerned with any food, no doubt because they are not in the habit of serving meals to ghosts. London SW4 From David Chandler Many years ago I was in a south London Chinese restaurant late at night. One of a party of four at the next table had fallen asleep, spread awkwardly cross the dishes. His snoring had caused glances and sniggers until a lady at another table leaned forward. 'Wouldn't he be more comfortable in the chow mein?' she asked. The place exploded. Bromley, Kent. From Nick Mathys I read with amusement your article. On a sailing trip in Scotland some 20 years ago a similar event occurred. After a hard sail in a pre-war racing yacht the night had been spent in harbour and breakfast was to be taken in a waterside hotel. One of the crew fell asleep at breakfast, not merely subsiding to the table, but immersing his face in the porridge. No action was taken. No doubt an excess of fresh air the day before was the cause. However, after the rest of the crew had eaten the first course, the good young lady serving breakfast arrived with bacon, eggs and all the other goodies which make up a true Scottish Breakfast. She was uncertain as to the correct action. The skipper did not hesitate. Seizing his crew member by the hair he lifted his head, removed the porridge and, placing the next course beneath his face, lowered him back again. No complaints were received either then or later. In the possibly more sophisticated surroundings of a London restaurant, may I suggest removing the diner's plate, applying if necessary a hot wet towel, and providing a clean plate - with perhaps a napkin as well  - for him to continue to sleep on? Chelmsford, Essex. Dr Robert A. Kisch My grandmother is said to have always carried a bottle of smelling salts: in those days, ladies had this valuable item handy for themselves against faintness both in their young and not-so-young days. When grandfather Albert dozed off in a restaurant (inevitably towards the end of the main course of meat), she was wont to administer a sniff which effectively woke him up for the rest of the meal. Waiting staff could carry such an item and offer it discreetly to the embarrassed (awake) partner to adminster, perhaps? Today, I find that the offensive level of background 'music' tapes stops me enjoying such a snooze . . . but that is another story. St Ouen, Jersey From David Edwards I am surprised that you regard the sleepy diner as a rare and novel phenomenon. He is commonplace in times of stress. Ashore after a stint of North Atlantic convoy duty or even after competing in the London Head of the River race a fit young man can be overcome by irresistible drowsiness when exposed to warmth and a little alcohol. He is far from being drunk but he just can't stay awake. A jet-lagged businessman is often in the same condition. A solution that works well in these cases is for the maitre d' to offer, on a salver, a luggage label and Biro to the apparent leader of the party. The maitre d' should say: 'If you would be so good, sir, to write the gentleman's name and address on this label we will get a taxi and see him to it if you so desire.' It is of some importance that, if the offer is taken up, the label be securely tied to the casualty's buttonhole so that there is not an identity problem at destination. With a mixed couple the situation is more tricky. A somnolent male is probably responsible for the account and his partner may be both unwilling to settle on his behalf or to escort him home. The label trick is worth trying nevertheless as the lady, no matter what her relationship, is put under no obligation by being helpful. If you want your money it may be worth your while to send a member of staff with him to his destination. With men you can afford to wait on events. Nothing dramatic is likely to happen if your offers are refused; but should the sleeper be female I suggest you call a taxi and then firmly see the couple to it using all powers of persuasion that are at your disposal. The lady on waking will nine times out of ten create a scene you will very much regret. Woking, Surrey</p>

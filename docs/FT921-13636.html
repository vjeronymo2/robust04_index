			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Greece and Bulgaria head off Macedonia rift BULGARIA and Greece yesterday began unofficial talks in Athens aimed at preventing a rift following Bulgaria's recognition of the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia last week. The move came as Mr Milan Babic, leader of Krajina, the Serb-inhabited self-proclaimed republic in south-western Croatia, said no UN troops would be deployed in the region. 'Without our acceptance, the mission to deploy (UN) peace-keepers and disarm Krajina's armed forces is doomed to failure,' Mr Babic told Borba, a Belgrade newspaper. Bulgarian diplomats said negotiations with Greece, which follow the re-election on Sunday of Mr Zhelyu Zhelev as Bulgarian president, would seek to guarantee stability in the Balkans. Fears over stability increased last week after a special arbitration commission, set up by the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, recommended recognition of Macedonia's independence by EC countries. However, the EC postponed recognition following Greek objections on the grounds that the choice of name - the independent republic of Macedonia - could indicate future territorial pretensions on northern Greece. But Bulgaria went ahead, recognising Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Nova Makedonika, the Macedonian newspaper, yesterday accused Greece and Bulgaria of 'exposing its concerted plans for Macedonia and the Macedonian people'. Macedonia was once divided by the two countries. In Croatia, Mr Babic, who believes Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, has betrayed Serbs in Krajina by accepting the UN peace plan, said UN peace-keepers should be deployed only on the current frontline between Krajina and the rest of Croatia. This would, de facto, recognise Serbia's control over a third of Croatian territory. Mr Babic also repeated his opposition to the withdrawal of the federal army from Krajina, a linchpin of the peace plan which has been approved by the leaders of Croatia, Serbia and the army. Belgrade radio, a mouthpiece of the Serbian leadership, reported yesterday the deaths in Krajina of a family of Serbian and Croatian background, and the murder of three federal army officers. The extensive coverage given to the alleged killings may be an attempt by Serbia to discredit Mr Babic's standing among the military and the enclave's population.</p>

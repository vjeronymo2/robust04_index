			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FORMER ALLERGAN EXECUTIVE NAMED TO HEAD I-FLOW CORP.  </P> <P> I-Flow Corp., the Irvine developer of drug-infusion systems, has hired Donald  M. Earhart, a former Allergan executive, as its president and chief operating  officer. Earhart also is being considered for the top job as chief executive  officer and to become a member of I-Flow's board of directors, the company said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> In February, Eric Brown resigned as I-Flow's chief executive over a  disagreement with the company's board of directors about business strategy,  according to a company spokesman. At that time Michael A. Pentopoulos, an  independent consultant, stepped in to serve as the company's chief executive.  Pentopoulos would resign that position to Earhart.  </P> <P> Earhart, 46, was formerly president of the Optical Division of Allergan, a  major eye care products manufacturer in Irvine. At Allergan, Earhart managed a  line of ophthalmic products with sales of more than $350 million.  </P> <P> By contrast, I-Flow is a 5-year-old research firm that has yet to make its  first sale. Officials of the company, which went public in February, say they  hope to have their first home drug-infusion product ready for market by the end  of this year.  </P> <P> "That Earhart chose to join I-Flow, with so many other excellent opportunities  open to him, is a very strong testament to his and our faith in the future of  the company," said Dr. John H. Abeles, I-Flow's chairman. LESLIE BERKMAN  </P></p>

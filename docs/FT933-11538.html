			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Challenge to Law Society regulators fails in court A 77-year-old woman who sued the Law Society, the solicitors' professional body, for alleged failure to make a proper investigation of her complaint against her former solicitors yesterday lost her legal battle in the High Court. Miss Peggy Wood, of Portsmouth, Hants, claimed that if the society had taken action to investigate her complaints against Hubbard &amp; Co of Chichester, West Sussex, in 1979 and 1983, they could have prevented her losing her home and development land. Her action was widely seen as a test case of whether regulatory bodies owe a duty of care to the public in investigating complaints and, if they do, whether they must pay damages to those who suffer loss as a result of their failure to uphold that duty. But yesterday Mr Justice Otton ruled that there was no general duty of care owed by regulatory bodies to the public and that in Miss Wood's case there was not a sufficiently close and direct relationship between her and the society for a duty of care to arise. The judge said that if the society had owed Miss Wood a duty of care he would have had no hesitation in finding that its mishandling of her complaint in 1979 'fell so far below the standards expected of the law society as to have amounted to negligence'. But if the society intervened in 1979 or in 1983 it was unlikely to have prevented Miss Wood losing her home. Mrs Wood's complaint against Hubbards dates back to 1973 when, having been left without any income, she approached Mrs Sylvia Hubbard about obtaining four loans totalling Pounds 10,000 on her home. When she was unable to repay the loans, Hubbard &amp; Co acted against her on behalf of the lenders. The main lender, Mobile Homes, was 50 per cent owned by Mrs Hubbard's husband, Joseph, then also a partner in the law firm. When Miss Wood was evicted and the house sold, she was left with just Pounds 1,400 after all her debts had been paid. After development the property was resold for almost Pounds 200,000. Mr Justice Otton said the real reason she had eventually been evicted was because she was unable to raise enough money to satisfy her creditors. He concluded: 'However heart-rending her story and however much I understand and sympathise with it, authority and principle are heavily weighted against her claim.' After the hearing Miss Wood said: 'It's a bleak day for all complainants. It's a lost opportunity for the courts to give protection against the mistakes and omissions of regulatory bodies.'</p>

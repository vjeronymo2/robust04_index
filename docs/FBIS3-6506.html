Western human rights groups and Buddhists have said that  Thich Huyen Quang, the 77-year-old patriarch of the Unified  Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), has been held under house  arrest since February 1982 and has been cut off from all  communications with the outside world.    But foreign ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said: "He is now  practising his religious services at the Hoi Phuoc Pagoda in  Quang An" in central Vietnam.    The International Federation of Human Rights recently  appealed to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to  intervene with Hanoi as Quang was said to be in need of urgent  medical care.    But Lan denied this, saying: "His physical health is  normal."    Quang became head of the Church in 1992 after the death of  Patriarch Thich Don Hau, but his succession has become the focus  of a violent row with the government, who have refused to  recognise Hau's right to choose his successor.    Fearful of unrest sparked by Buddhists, who make up 70  percent of Vietnam's population, the government here has tried  to bring all religions under the control of the communist  party's Fatherland Front, a patriotic organisation of social  groups.    Lan also brushed off reports of the "arbitrary detention" of  another member of the UBCV, Vo Han Duc, a 48-year-old abbot  sentenced to three years in jail in January.    "This man was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for  his crimes against on-duty officials," Lan said, adding that the  sentence had been handed down through normal legal processes  following Duc's arrest in July last year.    A court in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau  imprisoned Duc for disturbing public order on charges of  "conducting activities against the law" and "handing out  documents hostile to the socialist government of Vietnam."</p>

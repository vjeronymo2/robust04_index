			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If this code goes through and is enacted, it would change the timber falling industry in Alaska. Southeast Alaska is a relatively new geological area. We work on steep ground that is broken up by draws, gullies, cliffs. We have our timber fallers work together as partners. One works in one strip or one area of the hillside and the other one works in another area of the hillside. For safety reasons, our company requires that they work at least three tree lengths apart. And often with the broken up terrain, that precludes visual contact (Tr. OR 353).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, comments were received on the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device. Some participants supported the prohibition (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42). Other commenters argued that chain-saw noise is currently being used as a means of contact in the logging industry and should be allowed in the final rule (Tr. W1 65; OR 86, 353&hyph;55, 356&hyph;58, 384&hyph;85, 694&hyph;96). For example, one commenter said the sound of chain saws is an indicator that someone is working at a specific location (Tr. W1 65). Another commenter stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [W]e have been counting on chain saw noise for years. Chain saw noise is possible, and by the way, that's my most dangerous part of my job is to do a safety inspection or to go up and check on cutters in a strip, to approach cutters. And I listen to the saw. And I can tell when they are putting a cut into a standing tree or bucking a log with the chain saw noise. If we are not allowed to use chain saw noise as audible contact, that means we may have to go back to double jacking which is a faller and a bucker working in tandem (Tr. OR 353&hyph;55).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This participant also said that chain-saw noise should also be permitted because 103-decibel chain-saw engines render 92-decibel personal alarm systems inadequate as means of audible contact (Tr. OR 355).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, several commenters urged OSHA to adopt various alternatives and modifications to the proposed contact requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55; Tr. OR 670&hyph;81). For example, commenters suggested that OSHA replace the contact provision with a ``check-in'' requirement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In West Virginia, a cutting crew often consists of a worker who fells and limbs the trees and a worker who operates a skidder. Consequently, it is often necessary that the feller be left alone in the woods, without audible or visual contact with another worker, for short periods of time while the skidder operator is making the trip to the log landing. Also, it is common practice for workers to be constantly checking on one another. Upon his return from the landing, the skidder operator immediately checks on the feller; and, the feller, if the skidder operator does not return in the normal time span, will check on the skidder operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering the common small cutting crew size, the practice of constantly checking on one another, and the difficulties involved in using an audible signal capable of being heard over distances, over machine noise, and through hearing protection devices, it is our recommendation that this aspect of the Standard be changed to allow a worker to be out of ``visual or audible signal contact with another person'' for short periods of time. Due to the normal time involved for transporting a skidder load to the landing, unhooking, and returning, we recommend that this short time period be established at 20 minutes (Ex. 5&hyph;54).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters also suggested that OSHA allow employees to be out of contact from other employees for short periods of time (e.g., 15 to 20 minutes, the time to take a load to the landing and return) (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 670&hyph;81). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has decided in the final rule to retain the requirement that employees work within visual or audible contact of another employee. As discussed above, most commenters indicated that remaining in contact is important to the safety of loggers. Several commenters said that supervisors use chain-saw noise to identify where and whether an employee is working. However, they did not provide evidence that chain-saw noise provides an effective means of communicating information from the employee or from the supervisor. For example, data and information available to OSHA indicates that even though chain-saw noise is currently used as a means of maintaining contact, there are still reports from OSHA case file investigations of loggers being injured and not being discovered until after the shift has ended (Ex. 1). In addition, chain-saw noise does not provide the cutter with an adequate means of communicating with others in the event they have become injured or are in other trouble. Since all chain-saw noise indicates is whether an employee is working, the cutter must wait until another employee recognizes that the lack of noise means the cutter needs assistance. This may delay rendering that assistance. OSHA believes the cutter, not just the supervisor, needs to have a method for communicating when necessary. Radios and telephones are modern communication methods that are increasingly used in this logging industry. These methods, unlike chain-saw noise, provide immediate two-way communication.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

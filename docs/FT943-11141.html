			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Board split at Astra operator Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg company behind the Astra satellite television system, has been split by boardroom rivalries and an attempt to oust the director-general. SES runs three 16-channel television satellites and has plans to launch three more. It is also proposing to float on the London Stock Exchange, and other European exchanges, next year and could attract a value of Pounds 1bn. Mr Pierre Meyrat, the Swiss-born director-general, has run SES for the past nine years. An attempt was made to oust him last month by a group of shareholders, including Luxembourg financial institutions which control 20 per cent of the equity and 30 per cent of the votes. It is believed the two vice-chairmen of SES, Mr Romain Bausch, chairman of the SNCI bank of Luxembourg, and Count Roland Kergorlay, a private investor, were involved. The main criticism against the director-general was apparently that he did not consult widely enough among the 24-member board. Mr Meyrat's supporters included Deutsche Telekom, which recently bought 16.6 per cent of the company. The matter reached government levels and it is believed Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, became involved. Last week at an SES board meeting Dr Meyrat faced what amounted to a vote-of-confidence and received overwhelming support. Apart from Deutsche Telekom, his backers included Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank and Thames Television, part of the Pearson media and entertainment group which also owns the Financial Times. As part of a compromise, however, SES will have to strengthen the operational directors. SES is also taking difficult decisions on the development of digital television. Its fourth satellite, due to be launched in November, will use existing analogue technology. The fifth and sixth are scheduled to be devoted to digital television. Negotiations are continuing with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Mr Leo Kirch, the German television entrepreneur, on how many channels the Murdoch-Kirch consortium should have on the new satellites and on what terms.</p>

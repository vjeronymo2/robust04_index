			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (12): The horse has bolted - Hugh Carnegy finds caution as well as optimism at the banks IN HIS splendidly august office, complete with grand landscape oil paintings and a loudly ticking grandfather clock, Mr Pertti Voutilainen reflects, in measured terms, on the prospects for recovery at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki. He took over last year as its chief executive in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. 'In February we promised to halve our 1992 losses of FM3.7bn this year. We anticipate break-even will come at the end of 1994 and that 1995 will be profitable for us,' he says. 'If we look at developments so far this year, we are a little bit ahead of that trend. But there are risks still awaiting us and I don't think I can promise a significantly better development than we estimated previously.' Mr Voutilainen's sober assessment of the outlook at Finland's leading bank catches the mood in the sector as a whole a year after the immense depth of the losses sustained by the country's financial institutions became clear. In step with the economy as a whole, there are signs of recovery, thanks largely to the steep fall in interest rates this year. But the backlog of credit losses is so large that a return to profit is likely to take another two years. 'Our non-performing loans have stabilised now and our credit losses are going down,' says Mr Vesa Vainio, chief executive of Unitas, KOP's main rival, which ran up a loss in 1992 of FM2.7bn. 'We see a turnaround in our bank, in spite of a further big loss this year and next year as well. Banking operations as such are profitable.' So great was the disaster that overtook Finland's banks - like those of Sweden and Norway - that the state was forced to step in with guarantees and infusions of capital to keep the system afloat. 'If we had not, we would have had no banking system left,' says Mr Jorma Aranko, head of the Bank Supervisory Authority. 'It would have been a total shambles.' The crisis erupted when a severe recession, induced in large part by the loss of Finland's trade with the Soviet Union, pricked a grossly inflated lending bubble - much of it in foreign currency - that had followed liberalisation of foreign exchange and other financial regulation in the mid-1980s. Rising interest rates and sliding asset values then wreaked havoc on the banks. None escaped without resort to some government assistance. The two main players in the savings bank sector, Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland, had to be taken over by the state, which set up the Government Guarantee Fund to administer the crisis. The government has budgeted some FM60bn in rescue capital for the fund, much of which has already been spent. A recent Bank of Finland paper showed the banks as a whole had non-performing assets of FM55bn at the end of 1992 - nearly 10 per cent of their loans and guarantees - after write-offs of FM22bn. Nearly 60 per cent of these bad assets were attributed to corporate lending, with the bulk spread through real estate, trading companies, tourism and construction. Just over 21 per cent of bad loans were to the household sector. A year later, the picture undoubtedly looks rosier. KOP cut its losses in the first seven months to FM768m, from FM2.3bn in the same period of 1992. Unitas losses in the first eight months fell to FM1.01bn from FM1.31bn the year before. Operating profits before credit losses rose fivefold to FM881m. Both banks believe they will now survive the crisis without resort to state aid beyond the preference capital each has received. The government has pledged to guarantee bond issues by the banks. But for now at least, the big two have successfully turned independently to the markets to recapitalise and ensure they remain above the 8 per cent minimum international capital adequacy ratio. KOP has raised more than FM2bn this year in share and bond issues and plans to raise similarly a further FM2bn. Unitas is meanwhile raising more than FM1.5bn. If the economy stays on track for a slow recovery next year and interest rates remain at the present low levels, the banks should return to profitability in 1995. The government is also hoping that the recapitalisation process - both through state and private funds - will avert a 'credit crunch' that could choke off the much-yearned for upturn in economic activity. But several unresolved issues hang over the banking sector. Chief among these are the savings banks. The government has kept them afloat, but at great expense, prompting protests of unfair competition from rival commercial banks and calls for them to be sold off or closed down from some senior politicians. KOP and Unitas are both interested in acquiring at least some of these banks and have had talks to that end with the authorities. But that has prompted concern about their achieving too great a market share. The issue overlaps with the question of reducing the generally acknowledged overcapacity in Finnish banking. STS, the sixth largest bank, was taken over by KOP this year. But the authorities appear undecided over how to proceed with the savings banks, the obvious candidates in any further restructuring. Last, but not least, is the question of whether the system as a whole has learned the lessons of the past two years. All the banks have tightened the way they handle credit control. Unitas, for example, has a board member whose sole task is risk control and a team of 15 credit specialists. The bank now takes account of cash flow as well as collateral when assessing loan requests. The state, meanwhile, has moved to extend the powers and resources of the Bank Supervisory Authority. It has been brought within the Bank of Finland for the first time and is acquiring the power to monitor all divisions of a banking group, not just the core bank as previously. 'It is far too late, in a way, as the horse has already bolted,' says Mr Aranko. 'But we have got together with the Bank of Finland to be ready for the next bank crisis.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BANKING GROUPS' TOTAL EXPOSURE*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Total     Non-performing   Write-offs on                              exposures       assets         loans and                                                             guarantees Sector                      FM bn     %   FM bn      %    FM bn      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Corporate, of which          268    45.1    32     58.9     17     71.8 Manufacturing                 89    14.9     4      7.5      2      8.8 Construction                  29     5.0     6     10.1      3     11.8 Trade, restaurants, hotels                        58     9.7     7     13.4      3     14.2 Real estate business          34     5.7     9     16.4      5     20.5 Other                         58     9.8     6     11.5      4     16.5 Household                    192    32.3    12     21.1      1      6.6 Other domestic*               57     9.5     3      6.1      2     10.6 Foreign                       78    13.1     8     13.9      2     11.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All sectors                  595     100    55     100      22      100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes financial institutions, general government and non-profit institutions.

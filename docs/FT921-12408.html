			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Clinton gambles on TV appeal over sex claims GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas and his wife Hillary yesterday recorded an interview to appear on prime-time television to answer charges of marital infidelity which have hit his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. The decision to give the interview, to be broadcast last night, was a gamble for Mr Clinton. But the 46-year-old Yale- and Oxford-educated governor calculated he had to lay the accusations to rest if he was to remain a contender for the nomination. With just three weeks to go until the critical opening primary election in New Hampshire, Mr Clinton is the media-anointed front-runner, better known than his rivals (thanks in large part to the sex-scandal rumours) but more vulnerable to scrutiny and attack. In the interview with the CBS news programme Sixty Minutes, according to one of Mr Clinton's advisers who was present at the recording, the candidate and his wife repeated statements that their marriage has had problems in the past, but was now solid. They denied reports that Mr Clinton had a 12-year affair with a nightclub singer. The Clinton campaign received one welcome piece of news at the weekend; the Arkansas state employee whose unsubstantiated allegations formed the basis for tabloid stories that have dogged Mr Clinton's campaign, said he was dropping the lawsuit in which he made the claims.</p>

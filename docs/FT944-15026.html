			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ratings rumpus - Controversy in Japan over new plans for monitoring television viewing A recent announcement by AC Nielsen Japan, the Japanese arm of the US marketing and television ratings group, is causing havoc among the country's television and advertising communities. At issue are the company's plans to launch next month a television ratings system using the so-called people meter, which measures ratings based on individual viewers' opinions. Although Japan's television advertising market is the second largest in the world, with turnover last year totalling Y1,589bn (Pounds 10bn), Japan is one of the few countries where television commercial rates are still based on household ratings. Nielsen's announcement has stoked up the debate between the country's corporate advertisers, which are eager for more detailed and timely information, and the television networks, which are trying to stop the move. Companies' needs for more detailed data on who is watching what have been heightened by the downturn in Japanese corporate earnings and lower advertising expenditure. 'Our advertising budget has fallen around 30 per cent since 1990, so we would be interested in getting information on individual viewers,' says Toyota Motor, the leading car maker. Under the household ratings system, automated data is relayed from 3,600 households across the nation. But the information does not help companies that want to target consumers of particular age or gender group. 'In an age where a household has about four television sets, household-based ratings are really of no use,' says Shiseido, the country's largest cosmetics company and a leading advertiser. The system is supplemented by individual ratings based on diaries in which viewers indicate the channels they watch. However, the Japan Advertisers' Association (JAA) claims the figures are useless because the diaries are filled in during just one week a month and rely heavily on viewers' memories. Nielsen's people meter, by contrast, requires every viewer to push a button on top of the TV set each time he or she watches television. Each member of a 'Nielsen family' will have a separate button and a heat sensor will warn viewers by beeping if the number of buttons pushed and the number of people in front of the set do not match. The television networks, meanwhile, which are also irritated that Nielsen had failed to consult them before its announcement, argue that the people meter is an imperfect tool, and refer to developments in the US, where American networks are questioning the system's accuracy. They further argue that the people meter still relies on the viewers' diligence to press the machine's buttons. According to Brian Roberts, managing director of AGB Television, the company that operates a 'people meter' for the BBC and ITV in the UK very similar to Nielsen's controversial Japanese model, much depends on how scientifically the sample of television viewers is selected and how well these viewers are instructed in how to use the meter. AGB is now also able to log 'time-shifted' programmes on its model of the people meter. 'If you record a programme and play it back within seven days, our clever probes pick that up,' he says. Official British viewing figures now include this 'off-air' viewing. The main problem in monitoring television viewing in the future is going to be keeping track of which station a set is tuned to - with the proliferation of cable channels, this is already a problem in the US. AGB Television recently unveiled a new 'picture-matching' system that will work by collecting samples of digitised television pictures, rather than relying on measuring the frequency of the signal - an increasingly complex task, with so many channels now in existence and frequent changes in frequencies. The ultimate dream of advertisers must be 'passive metering' - a machine that will be able to tell for itself who is sitting in front of the TV. Roberts believes that this technology will be expensive to develop and is still some way off. He also considers that passive metering would give researchers little more information than they get now with the people meter, and that the technology could be seen as unacceptably like having Big Brother in the homes of sample viewers. The issue in Japan, however, is more than just a simple technological debate. Behind the wrangling is an attempt to prise open the ratings market, which is effectively controlled by the television networks, by Dentsu and Hakuhodo, the two largest advertising agencies, and by Video Research, the ratings agency which has a virtual monopoly in its field. Given the influence that ratings have over programme schedules and advertisement rates - not to mention expensive ratings service fees - corporate advertisers are happy to lend their support. Foreign advertising agencies, trying to gain a foothold, are also behind the move. For Nielsen, the move is a big step in trying to regain a foothold in the ratings business. Although the company first introduced to Japan the concept of television ratings in 1960, it lost out when Video Research was set up by the networks and advertising agencies two years later. There is also much at stake for the advertisers, which have taken a risk by confronting Dentsu and Hakuhodo. According to brokers James Capel in Tokyo, these two handle more than one-third of all advertising budgets in Japan. 'To sever a relationship with the two agencies will have grave repercussions since they usually control the best advertising slots and have a lot of information which we would miss out on,' says an advertiser. For many companies, television remains the most effective medium to reach consumers. The negotiations between the networks and advertisers have so far been handled delicately. Akihiro Ito, secretary-general of the JAA, says the association will now stand back and wait for the outcome of Nielson's launch next month. However, the broadcasting association - which has so far failed to dissuade Nielson - plans to keep up the pressure and will announce a statement of its opposition before the launch of the people meter.</p>

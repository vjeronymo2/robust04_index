			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXPAYERS GET LESS ROSY ESTIMATE ON COST OF S&amp;L BAILOUT  </P> <P> The cost to taxpayers of President Bush's savings and loan rescue plan will be  at least $84 billion during its first 10 years, more than double the $40  billion estimated by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office said  Friday.  </P> <P> And rising interest rates could drive the taxpayer share to $104 billion or  more, Acting Director James Blum of the budget office told the Senate Banking  Committee.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has estimated that its plan to shut down or sell  hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls will require cash outlays of $157.6 billion in  its first 10 years, with a cost to taxpayers of $39.9 billion.  </P> <P> Under the Administration proposal, the program would be financed with premiums  collected from healthy S&amp;Ls and sales of 30-year bonds, for which the  Treasury would pay the interest.  </P> <P> In sharp contrast, the budget office said Friday that the outlays will reach  $205 billion, with expenses of $84 billion for the Treasury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aggravating the Problem  </P> <P> Blum said Administration estimates failed to reflect the full amount of  Treasury borrowing needed under the complex financing plan.  </P> <P> Rising interest rates also could boost the cost of the S&amp;L rescue program  in several ways. Healthy thrifts would suffer declining profits as they are  forced to pay higher rates of interest on new deposits, compared with the  interest they receive on old mortgages. This could increase the number of  S&amp;Ls that become insolvent, adding to the burden.  </P> <P> The Treasury also would be forced to pay higher rates of interest on bonds used  to raise billions of dollars to close insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off  depositors.  </P> <P> Under the budget office's interest-rate assumptions, which are more pessimistic  than official Administration forecasts, the taxpayer share would be as much as  $104 billion in the first 10 years, the period in which all the crippled  S&amp;Ls would be closed or sold.  </P> <P> "The sky's the limit," said a worried Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.),  chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "There's a question of honesty in  budgeting." Under the Administration plan, "we ask you to sign the blank check  today, and we'll fill in the numbers over the next 30 years.".  </P> <P> If the Bush plan is approved by Congress without changes, "it will lock in the  government to pay the bill no matter how high it goes," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposes 'Blank Check'  </P> <P> Disturbed by the spiraling cost estimates, Riegle has asked government  officials and outside consultants for detailed economic studies, using  different assumptions about interest rates and the level of deposits at  S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> "There is a history with this problem of low-balling the estimates," he said in  an interview Friday. "It's a very unpleasant situation we find ourselves in. I  don't think many people on the committee want to sign a blank check."  </P> <P> In financing the S&amp;L cleanup, "it may well be that we are going to spend  more than the Administration has suggested," he said. "But we want to know that  now. There is a great value in leveling with people at the beginning."  </P> <P> Although the ultimate cost to taxpayers is uncertain, the federal insurance  fund that guarantees the safety of S&amp;L deposits up to $100,000 remains  safe, Riegle said. "The deposit insurance pledges are absolute guarantees." he  said. "There's no question . . . that the federal insurance system affords  protection and will always be there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Resort  </P> <P> But the new budget office estimate raises the specter of open-ended taxpayer  contributions to the S&amp;L rescue, a disturbing prospect for Riegle.  </P> <P> "The Treasury is the deep pocket of last resort," he said at the hearing. "If  the number gets larger, that's where the money is." Congress may "wake up one  morning and find we have a much larger number on our hands," he said.  </P> <P> Taxpayers must be the last resort for solving the problem because the S&amp;L  industry has reached the limit of its ability to pay, Riegle said.  </P> <P> Healthy S&amp;Ls already pay premiums into the deposit insurance fund equal to  about 20% of their profits, and would have to pay more under the Bush plan.  </P> <P> Riegle does not want to impose premiums beyond the level suggested by the  Administration. "I'm hard-pressed to see how more can be found there" in the  industry, he said in the interview. "We do not want to construct a plan to work  in such a way that a number of thrifts now solvent become insolvent. Then the  cost of the solution gets driven much higher."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Gaza, 17 Jun (MENA) -- Amidst the joy, ululation,  and chants of the Palestinian people, who still cannot believe  that they have started their first steps toward liberation from  the 27-year colonization, yesterday evening Israel released 368  Palestinian prisoners from a total of more than 1,000 who are  supposed to be set free under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    Hasan 'Asfur, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the  peace talks who returned to Gaza over a month ago to join the  members of the Palestinian National Authority in the Gaza Strip,  said in a statement to MENA that most of the released prisoners  are members of the Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas and the  Islamic Jihad. Foremost of these released prisoners are two of  the leaders of the movement, Shaykh Sayyid Abu-Musamih and 'Imad  al-Faluji.    This is the first time that Israel has released Hamas and  Islamic Jihad members.    'Asfur adds that they were officially informed by the  Israeli  authorities of the release of this number of prisoners,  including 160 convicts.    Contradictory figures were quoted yesterday and today  regarding the correct number of the released prisoners. These  figures varied between 200 and 400 prisoners. Some people even  claimed that the released prisoners did not exceed 130 men.  'Asfur said that all those released signed a "document of  pledge."    This document contained -- after it was drafted three times,  according to Palestinian sources here -- the following:    "I declare that I realize that this signature is a basic  condition for releasing me. I also understand that this measure  is being executed within the framework of the peace agreement  signed between Israel and the PLO on 4 May 1994. Therefore, I  promise to abandon all acts of terrorism and violence and to  respect the law."    This is the first time that Hamas detainees have signed a  document of pledge to release them after they received orders to  do so from their leadership. However, more than 600 Palestinian  detainees from various factions refused to sign the document and  the Israeli authorities refused to release them.    Shaykh Abu-Musamih -- who had been convicted to nine years  in  prison, three of which he had already served, and who became one  of the Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip after its leader, Shaykh  Ahmad Yasin, was arrested -- affirmed that, despite the fact  that his movement will not participate in any of the self-rule  authority's activities, it does have a red line that it will not  cross. This line is not to allow internecine fighting in the  Palestinian arena.    Shaykh Abu-Musamih mentioned that his movement does not  object to participating in any institution or sector that serves  the Palestinian people.    Shaykh Abu-Musamih said that the movement will not be turned  into a political party, but it is studying the possibility of  establishing a political wing. [passage omitted]</p>

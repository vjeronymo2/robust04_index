			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): How to manage a war MOVING MOUNTAINS: LESSONS IN LEADERSHIP AND LOGISTICS FROM THE GULF WAR By Lt General William G. Pagonis with Jeffrey L Cruikshank Harvard Business School Press Dollars 24.95, 248 pages IT MAY NOT be surprising that a war which the US managed to get other countries to pay for has quickly produced a soldiers' story for business schools. Lt Gen 'Gus' Pagonis, the diminutive Greek-American general who commanded the entire logistical effort behind Desert Shield, Desert Storm and the return of US troops from Saudi Arabia, has produced the Gulf War Management Guide. It is a tale of some heroics. The task of ferrying 560,000 armed forces personnel halfway across the world and back to fight a war while keeping them fed, fuelled and fit is equivalent, claims Pagonis, to moving the population of Alaska and all their belongings to the other side of the world. Some of the book's numbers are boggling: the US army in the Gulf ate 122m. meals, burned 1.3bn. gallons of fuel, read 500 tonnes of mail a day and erected 500 new traffic signs in Saudi Arabia to guide a total of 52m. miles driven in the theatre of operations - about 100 round trips to the moon. Try organising that . . . As the general does concede, he had much in his favour: such as the fact that Saudi Arabia had huge underused military and civilian airbases (built by the US Corps of Engineers) and vast equally underused ports within nearly ideal range of Kuwait on which to land his forces. Neither did it hurt that the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia had a highly-developed local economy from which Pagonis and his men were able to procure water, trucks, fridges, timber, fresh food and the countless other things upon which modern armies march. But as a concentrated task of military organisation, the deployment of US forces in the Gulf probably has no equal. And to compound it, Pagonis was asked under immensely demanding deadlines to organise Gen Schwarzkopf's now famous 'Hail Mary' attacking sweep across hundreds of miles of desert to attack Iraq's exposed western flank. Pagonis describes that to achieve this it was necessary to create a giant military crossroads in the desert through which an average 18 military vehicles a minute passed every day for a month. So what does it take to run a show like this? Above all, it seems, a clear head, fabulous self-confidence, shrewd common sense and a limitless capacity for hard work. All characteristics Pagonis draws out, at some length, in a detailed description of his upbringing, sculpted by the American Dream, as the son of a Greek immigrant who sailed to the US aboard a ship called Democracy and worked his son from the bottom up in the family hotel. At less length, Pagonis takes us through the breathless, and breathlessly told, task of organising and dismantling Desert Storm, and to his conclusions; which, says the blurb, provide 'an inspirational model for today's business executives trying to cope with an increasingly global and complex environment'. In essence, these apparently boil down to having a clear 'vision' of what needs achieving, banging it home relentlessly and consistently to subalterns, delegating where possible, being a good listener and, above all, being ruthlessly well organised. In other than the management jargon Pagonis employs, it seems to come down to something the rest of us might term 'military efficiency'. But Pagonis' assertively self-confident tone gives the book, in its intended role as champion of the logisticians' underrated art, a slightly paradoxical feel. He makes it seem that one of the biggest military deployments in history somehow wasn't a problem. There must have been some real cock-ups somewhere, surely?</p>

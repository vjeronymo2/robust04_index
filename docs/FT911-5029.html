			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: McGraw-Hill hit by falls on the publishing front MCGRAW-HILL, the big US publishing, information services and broadcasting group, saw first-quarter profits fall by more than a fifth. With a small gain in operating profits from broadcasting and a larger improvement from financial services offset by falls on the publishing front, McGraw-Hill turned in Dollars 12.7m after tax, compared with Dollars 16.5m a year earlier. Revenues were static at Dollars 428.5m (Dollars 420m). At the operating level, profits were down from Dollars 41.4m to Dollars 35.1m, after taking in losses of Dollars 15.3m (Dollars 12.8m deficit) from the company's share of the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill school publishing joint venture. McGraw said that the decline in profits had been expected, although its shares still weakened on the news, slipping Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 . A strong performance by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, lay behind the advance in the financial services division's profits, from Dollars 32.1m to Dollars 37.9m.</p>

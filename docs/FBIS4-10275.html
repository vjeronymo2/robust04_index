			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alberto Fujimori announced yesterday a  salary increase of 40 percent for teachers and health personnel  with professional degrees, and a 30 to 33 percent increase for  those without degrees.    He also announced that the minimum salary for the private  sector will go from 72 to 132 new soles as of 1 April, and that  for public servants the minimum salary will be 300 new soles.    According to the presidential announcement, the salary  increase will represent an additional spending in the budget of  180 million new soles.    President Fujimori indicated that the increase represents a  partial recovery of the purchasing power of state workers.    He added that a decision was also made to increase the  salaries of the National Police and the Armed Forces, but he did  not specify by how much.    The salary issue was one of the more difficult demands to be  met by the government. In all the polls done a high percentage  demanded an urgent salary increase.    When the sale of some public companies such as the Peruvian  Telephone Company was done for more than $2 billion, many  sectors believed the government was in the condition to increase  salaries substantially.    The president, however, denied this several times, saying  that the country cannot go back to populist measures.    The president said: "Under no circumstances will the income  from privatizations be used in administrative spending such as  salary increases."    On the contrary, he said, about $1.6 billion will be used on  what he called "social spending," which was later defined as  "investment in productive employment."    The president also said that the money received from  privatizations will not be used to pay the foreign debt, and  therefore it is not clear where the money to pay the announced  salary increase will come from.    Regarding the "minimum salary" of 300 new soles for public  servants, some leaders expressed their doubts because "for the  first time the salaries of public servants will be above the  private sector."    Despite the fact that the president said many times that it  was not necessary to increase the minimum salary "because we are  in an open market ruled by the law of supply and demand," this  salary was increased yesterday from 72 to 132 new soles.    President Alberto Fujimori also referred to the recent  election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as new OAS  secretary general.    Fujimori said Gaviria would give greater dynamism and a new  focus to this continental organization, "which for years has  been involved more in international political discussions."    He added that an emphasis on regional integration in the  fields of economic and commercial development and the struggle  against drug trafficking are points that will receive special  treatment by the new OAS secretary general, with whom Fujimori  shares these concerns.    Fujimori then referred to the working tour to be made by  Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of Ministers and  foreign minister, and Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama  throughout Asia to promote the investment possibilities offered  by Peru.    Fujimori is confident that as a result of the meetings to be  held by the ministers with Asian businessmen and investors, they  will respond with the same enthusiasm found in the Americas and  Europe to invest in the country.    President Fujimori made these comments after dedicating five  educational centers built by the National Institute of Education  and Health Infrastructure (Infes) with an investment of  $1,425,630 from the Public Treasury.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIGAR SMOKERS  </P> <P> My husband and I have had season tickets to the USC home games for about 25  years and were in attendance at the USC-Arizona game Oct. 20 in the Coliseum.  </P> <P> During half-time we were astounded to see two very pleasant, well-behaved men  who sit near us being handled roughly, grasped by their shirt collars and  hustled out of Tunnel 19 by four policemen, two to each man. We didn't know  what their offense was, but later learned they were indeed guilty -- of smoking  cigars!  </P> <P> When murder, rape and robbery abound in the area, four policemen are busy  stamping out cigar smoking! Has the world gone mad or is it only in Los  Angeles?  </P> <P> ALICE SHEQUEN, La Crescenta  </P></p>

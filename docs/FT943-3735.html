			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: China lures auto component groups - Foreign entrants are reshaping an antiquated industry Like participants in a gold rush, the world's top automotive components manufacturers are scrambling for a niche in China. General Motors' Automotive Components Group, TRW and Ford of the US, Bosch of Germany, Toyota and Nissan of Japan, and Daewoo of South Korea are just some of the names competing in a sector expected to absorb Dollars 20bn of new investment in the next five years. Fledgling groups are also entering the field, attracted by the promise of huge demand for components. American investors, including Dean Witter, the broking house, have backed, for example, the establishment of Asian Strategic Investments Corporation (Asimco) which plans to invest Dollars 1bn over the next two years. Mr Don St Pierre, president of Asimco, expects a 'revolution' in the components sector marked by a rash of joint ventures, mergers and the continuing rationalisation of small, inefficient producers. Many of China 4,800 components manufacturers are expected to go out of business, to be replaced by larger units with foreign involvement. Asimco, which raised Dollars 160m initially for its China investments, recently concluded its first components deal, with Ningguo Rubber in Anhui province, to produce rubber seals, rings and gaskets. Asimco has another 10 similar deals pending, which are expected to be concluded over the next few months. Its investment in Anhui is Dollars 11m. TRW, the big US space technology and automotive parts conglomerate, is enlarging its presence in China having signed a memorandum of understanding with Jinan Auto-Accessories Works, one of China's biggest components manufacturers, to produce about 14m engine valves. Mr Joseph Gorman, TRW's chief executive officer, said the company wanted to be a 'player' in China because of tremendous growth prospects in the world's fastest-growing automotive sector. He said he would not be surprised if, by early next century, half the 45m-50m cars sold annually out of a total global car 'population' of 475m were marketed in Asia, with China accounting for the bulk of new sales. China's new automotive policy, released in July, is providing the catalyst for a dramatic transformation of the components sector. Ambitious plans to supply from domestic production 90 per cent of China's estimated passenger car needs of 2m units by the end of the century will in itself create a huge demand for components. In 1993 China produced 234,000 passengers cars out of total production nationwide of 1.3m vehicles. About 310,460 vehicles were imported, according to official figures, but this did not account for the thousands more that were smuggled in. Strict local content rules and allied tax incentives mean that components manufacturers will be competing for a vast captive market. Adding impetus to the scramble is the demand by Chinese policymakers that international car makers qualify for permission to build vehicles in China by first investing in components manufacturing. This requirement has drawn Ford, General Motors and Daewoo, to name several of the more prominent manufacturers, into investing heavily in China. Ford, for example, announced recently that it would spend Dollars 50m in two projects in the Shanghai area, one of the principal hubs of the automotive sector in China. Ford's initial investments include ventures for the fabrication of plastic automotive items such as instrument panels, and safety glass for windscreens. Partners are the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) and Yao Hua Glass Works. Mr David McKee, vice-president of Ford International Business Development in Beijing, said the company had 'nailed down' the top 100 or so components manufacturers with a view to possible joint ventures. Of these, Ford had singled out eight to 10 as prospective partners with two to three deals close to completion in such areas as air-conditioning and electronics. General Motors, through its Automotive Components Group, is engaged in a similar exercise in identifying investment opportunities. Mr Rudi Von Meister, ACG's chief representative in Beijing, said the company was 'exploring' more than two dozen projects, and had recently signed a joint venture agreement to produce electronic engine control systems - the successor to the carburettor. This joint venture and other pending deals build on ACG's existing arrangements in China, which include six licensing agreements for the production of such items as wiring harnesses, spark plugs, starter motors and alternators, and steering gears. Daewoo of South Korea has also signalled its intention to be a big player in China, with the focus of its activities in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing. Daewoo, according to Mr St Pierre of Asimco, is planning to fund a number of components suppliers in Shandong, and also intends to absorb some of the product in its car making operations in South Korea itself. Toyota is also reported to be moving towards heavy investment in China, although the Japanese continue to play their cards close to their chest. Among options being considered by Toyota is the construction of a 'greenfield' plant near Tianjin to produce transmissions, engines and other key components for a compact car, possibly the Corolla, to be manufactured in China. Across China, hundreds of projects are under negotiation in a process that, within a few years, will change the face of a hitherto antiquated sector.</p>

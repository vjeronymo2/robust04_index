			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ANIMAL KINGDOM;  </P> <P> HIPPO'S FREEDOM ENDS IN DEATH  </P> <P> Hilda the hippo's brief taste of freedom ended in tragedy today.  </P> <P> The three-ton hippopotamus escaped from her trailer onto a busy four-lane  English highway but died after being shot with a tranquilizer dart while being  recaptured.  </P> <P> "It didn't survive the drug that was used and the stress and trauma of the  recapture," said Roger Cawley of Longleat Safari Park, Hilda's owners.  </P> <P> Hilda, aged 10, was on her way to be paired with a mate at another safari park  when her trailer ran out of control near Thruxton in Hampshire, allowing her to  break free. Motorists swerved to avoid her and police sealed off the road.  </P> <P> Cawley said Hilda grazed quietly by the roadside for nearly two hours but  failed to survive the difficult rescue involving pulleys, ropes and a tractor.  </P></p>

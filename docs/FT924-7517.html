			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toyota considers output increase TOYOTA is considering increasing production in the North American Free Trade Area, according to Mr Osamu Kimura, president of New United Motor Manufacturing (Nummi), a 50-50 Californian joint venture between the Japanese vehicle maker and General Motors of the US. Mr Kimura said the plans, being drawn up by Toyota's US projects division in Tokyo, could entail investment to increase capacity by 100,000 vehicles to 200,000 a year in three to five years. Under consideration is investment in a new plant in Mexico, in Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada and in Toyota's car plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, which is doubling capacity to 400,000 vehicles a year. Mr Kimura stressed the plans were at an early stage and no decision had been taken. He suggested investment in a facility would cost at least Dollars 500m. The company was attracted by the low wage costs of Mexico, but the lack of a sophisticated supply infrastructure would mean importing parts from the US mid-west, thereby increasing transport costs. Nummi's California plant was also a candidate for expansion, he said. 'There are many proposals from almost every state in the US. They are asking Toyota to come to their state, to build a plant.' He said Toyota 'has some hesitation' because of concern over the state of the US market and the political danger of increasing capacity when Ford, GM and Chrysler were under pressure. The company was watching carefully for President-elect Bill Clinton's policy on Japanese transplants. Mr Kimura was in Scotland to address industrialists at a Strathclyde Institute conference on manufacturing. 'The recession is continuing in Japan, America and Europe at the same time. Toyota's stance is very conservative, to save money,' he said. The company's resources were already committed to expansion at the Kentucky factory, in the UK, in Turkey and China, and in a joint venture with GM in Australia. The agreement with GM that established Nummi expires in four years due to limits placed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Mr Kimura expected talks to begin with the FTC and GM over Nummi's future early next year. Both Toyota and GM have said they would like the present joint venture to continue.</p>

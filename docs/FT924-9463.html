			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Tecs put forward plans for redundant mineworkers SIX TRAINING and Enterprise Councils in areas that will be affected by the first 10 coal-mine closures presented the government yesterday with action plans designed to help those communities. Tecs - the employer-led bodies that deliver government training schemes - have been asked to organise and co-ordinate measures to alleviate unemployment among former miners. The government has allocated Pounds 75m for that over the next two years. It is understood that action plans, which are at an initial stage, contain proposals for Tecs to work more closely with the Employment Service, which runs non-training programmes such as Job Clubs. They will also work in close partnership with British Coal Enterprise, which since 1984-85 has run counselling workshops, job shops and training programmes for former miners. A wider revision of training programmes for the adult unemployed is expected to be announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, after next week's Autumn Statement. She has been reviewing all provision including Employment Training and Employment Action, the work experience scheme. How radical the revision will be will depend on the department's Public Expenditure Survey settlement.</p>

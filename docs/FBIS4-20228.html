			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victorino Ruiz de Azua: "Aznar Leaves Gonzalez </F> Only One Choice: `Go!'"]    [Text] Madrid -- Responsibility, responsibilities,  responsible. People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar rang the  changes on the word at least 49 times in his one-hour speech [at  the 19 April Congress of Deputies state of the nation debate],  and constantly applied it to head of government Felipe Gonzalez,  in order to conclude: "Go!" According to the People's Party  leader, Gonzalez, with his credibility ruined, has no honorable  solution left except to "tender his resignation to the king,"  and advise King Juan Carlos on the Socialist who should succeed  him in the government. Aznar, however, avoided referring to a  censure motion or calling for a vote of confidence, and made it  quite clear that he does not want an early election now.    Gonzalez found grounds in Aznar's reply for making his  message clearer. He is not prepared to resign, and his  intention is to complete the legislative term. Aznar chose a  tactic of wearing down his opponent, but striving to emphasize  that he is in no hurry to attain power through an early  election. His role was rather that of somebody seeking to take  up the general dissatisfaction and strengthen himself as an  alternative.    In his speech, he left no room for pity: "What will be the  next scandal, Mr. Gonzalez? What extremes have we had to go to  for this question alone to sum up the state of the nation?"  That was the beginning, and the end was the resignation call.  In between, there was a lengthy reflection full of direct  questions to the prime minister and recollections of the  rejections of and votes against committees of enquiry which  Gonzalez and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party have reeled off  over the past few years.    He argued that the head of government, through his  passivity,  has encouraged the impression of impunity and contributed to the  current atmosphere. As a result, according to Aznar, Gonzalez  is not only politically responsible for the appointment of  alleged corrupt people as chiefs of the Civil Guard or the Bank  of Spain, but also "is too late, even to wash his own face."    In the People's Party leader's opinion, the promises to  investigate the Roldan or Rubio affairs now are just an attempt  to ensure that the responsibility falls on "a scapegoat, whom  (the Socialists) attack with the fury of the convert."    Aznar emphasized that parliament should speak not of the  culprits -- a task for the courts -- but of the individuals  responsibile for making the appointments and who now should  answer for the appointees' misconduct. "It is you," he  concluded, looking at Gonzalez's seat, "who are responsible for  helping to create the most unbreathable moral atmosphere of our  recent history."    Aware that Gonzalez's weak spot is credibility, the People's  Party leader rubbed salt into the same wound in the second  section of his speech, devoted to deriding the announcements of  economic recovery.    Aznar concluded by denying Gonzalez even the ability to  maintain political stability, which is threatened by the  atmosphere of public distrust about corruption, and said that he  can no longer correct matters. As long as he he stays in power,  "we can expect no sincerity, no solution." Hence, according to  the People's Party chairman, his responsibility is to resign and  hand over his post to another Socialist.    Gonzalez opted for taking up the gauntlet and replying to  Aznar immediately, without waiting for speeches by the other  spokesmen. Much livelier than in the morning, the head of  government accused the People's Party chairman of delivering  tirades without saying "anything at all" about what can be done  with the country. Determined to strike back, the head of  government cited the prosecution of Miguel Perez Villar, Aznar's  former councillor in Castille and Leon, for the alleged  irregular granting of public aid, and asked who takes political  responsibility for his appointment.    In a parliamentary "look who's talking" gesture, Aznar  rejoined that his party voted for the establishment of a  committee of enquiry in the parliament of Castille and Leon, and  called for one in the Congress over the Naseiro affair, but the  Socialists voted against. Gonzalez recalled that the People's  Party voted against the application [for lifting parliamentary  immunity] of deputy Sanchis, involved in that affair. Aznar  announced that his group will call for a committee to  investigate the Filesa affair (the application will be submitted  at the registry this very morning), and Gonzalez warned him that  perhaps he will be surprised if the Socialists accept it and  propose extending it.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: UK trade minister starts visit to HK and China MR Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister, arrives in Hong Kong today for an eight-day visit which will also include China, writes David Dodwell. The trip is intended to pave the way for a UK industry trade mission in November, flagged by Mr Needham as 'the most important this country has ever seen to China.' In Hong Kong, Mr Needham will discuss export opportunities and the territory's role as a springboard for business in China and across the Pacific Rim, a region 'which offers the British economy and British companies the biggest opportunity for growth of any area in the world,' he said yesterday. While in China, Mr Needham's discussions on bilateral trade will dovetail with the forthcoming talks with the Overseas Development Administration on a new line of concessional aid and the availability of export credit cover to China. Britain's second line of credit to China - which was worth Pounds 300m - has now been used up. 'I am anxious that China fully understands that the British government, commerce and industry are taking a long-term view of building business across China in a whole range of sectors,' he said, conceding at the same time that Britain had failed to exploit Hong Kong effectively both as a market in its own right, and as a springboard for business in China. Hong Kong is Britain's 15th largest export market, with exports rising by 13 per cent last year to Pounds 1.39bn, and a further 22 per cent up to May this year, Mr Needham said. Britain's exports to China fell last year by 40 per cent to Pounds 322m, but are understood to have rallied by 20 per cent in the first five months of this year. The visit will be the first to China by a British trade minister since the Tienanmen Square massacre in June 1989.</p>

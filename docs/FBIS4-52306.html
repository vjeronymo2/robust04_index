			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  told his cabinet Tuesday [10 May] he will continue the economic  policies of the Hosokawa cabinet, pursuing economic reforms  through wide-ranging deregulation, government officials said.    Hata, who took over as prime minister April 28 to replace  Morihiro Hosokawa, also told a cabinet meeting that he will seek  to secure sustained economic growth by stimulating domestic  demand, the officials said.    Hata also emphasized the need to implement the government's  economic stimulation package adopted in February, obtain Diet  approval of the fiscal 1994 budget, expedite compilation of  economic deregulation plans and to do everything possible to  implement tax reform before the end of the year, the officials  said.    Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and  Coordination Agency, told the meeting that he intends to have a  government task force in charge of administrative reforms work  out specific deregulation plans in June.    Regarding Japan's current account surplus, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters there are signs that  the surplus is beginning to subside.    Kumagai noted that the fiscal 1993 surplus, measuring goods,  services and some unilateral transfers such as grant aid,  decreased in yen terms for the first time in three years. He  also said the dollar-based surplus in March dropped from a year  earlier.</p>

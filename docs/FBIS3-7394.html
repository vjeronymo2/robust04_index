			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pak Che-kyun entitled: "Preparatory Events for </F> Kim Il-song Birthday Not Loud"]    [Text] Kim Il-song's birthday (15 April), which North  Korea calls the greatest national holiday, is only a few weeks  away. North Korea, however, does not appear as boisterous about  it as it was in previous years. In previous years, various  events to celebrate Kim's birthday, such as "the race to relay  the letter of loyalty" would have already started.    On the contrary, North Korea issued an emergency alert order  to the entire Armed Forces and is creating an atmosphere of  tension, suspending the issuance of travel permits to residents,  according to Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National  Security Planning, who disclosed this at the security-related  ministers meeting on 26 March.    Director Kim also said that the North Korean Army is  checking  the maintenance of its emergency communications network, while  intensifying training. North Korea is stepping up the  production of military supplies, such as military uniforms,  according to some information officials.    Since the inter-Korean contact broke down on 19 March, North  Korean broadcasts have been yelling: We will regard sanctions  against us as a declaration of war. We will respond to war with  war.    In particular, early this week North Korea will hold the  national meeting of party cells for the first time in the  "Workers' Party of Korea" history, with the participation of  some 200,000 party cells.    North Korea is abruptly convening a national meeting of the  party's frontline functionaries, while creating tension  internally, because it is taking, apparently, extra precautions  to prevent any crack in its system. North Korea must also want  to demonstrate its resolute will externally. However, there are  no signs of its provoking a war yet.    North Korea declared a semi-war state last year when the  ROK-U.S. Team Spirit joint military exercise was conducted.  Under this condition, attention is also focused on the rumor  about a setback in Kim Chong-il's hereditary succession system.  President Kim Yong- sam, interviewed by the ROK correspondents  in Japan on 25 March, said that there seems to be some change in  Kim Chong-il's succession system.    Rumors about difficulty in Kim Chong-il's succession system  have circulated from time to time since Kim Tal-hyon and other  aides of National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Chong-il were  reprimanded last December. With the frequent exposure of  confusion in North Korea's nuclear policy recently, observers  predict that the North Korean officials working on nuclear  policy, which Kim Chong-il has been in charge, might be replaced.    On this question, the position of the National Unification  Board and other relevant authorities is that although Kim  Chong-il's succession system is firm, its execution could be  expedited or slowed down. However, they believe that if a  problem arises in the succession system, there will be a serious  whirlwind in the North and its aftermath can reach the South.    Therefore, we will be able to determine what is happening  inside North Korea from the development of the party cell  congress, preparations for President Kim Il-song's birthday  celebrations, and the sixth session of the Ninth Supreme  People's Assembly scheduled for 6 April.</p>

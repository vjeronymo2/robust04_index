			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: India seeks private capital for toll roads India is turning to private investors in an attempt to give a huge boost to developing its primitive road network. The government is issuing letters of intent worth Dollars 50m for the construction of three private sector-operated toll roads and one bridge  - a first step towards attracting private capital into an industry long dominated by the state. The four schemes are among about 30 projects totalling over Dollars 6bn, including Dollars 5.8bn worth of motorways, earmarked by the ministry for surface transport for possible private sector development. Companies would build roads and bridges, collect tolls to recoup their investment for a fixed period and then transfer ownership to the state. The ministry's plans are an extension of the government's efforts to liberalise the economy and to expand India's infrastructure after years of underinvestment. Officials say 42 companies have expressed interest in build-operate-transfer schemes, including Renong, Malaysia's largest business group, which has suggested investing up to Dollars 25bn building a 12,000 kilometre national motorway network. Other interest has come from US, European, and Asian companies. Mr Rajeev Talwar, a senior transport ministry official, said: 'The amounts of money we need to invest are immense. But we have had an overwhelming response from private industry.' The projects include a letter of intent with Costain, the British construction group, to build a Dollars 15m bridge across the Narmada river on the west coast of India along a trunk road linking Bombay with the fast-growing state of Gujarat. The other three schemes covered by the letters of intent are for by-passes at Nellore, in Andhra Pradesh, Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu, and Hubli-Dharwad, in Karnataka. The Nellore project has been awarded to HSSI, of Malaysia, and an Indian partner, and the other two projects to SPIC, a diversified south Indian group. Companies say negotiating contract terms could take some time since privately operated roads and bridges are a novelty. The biggest problem will be ensuring that rules governing toll-collection are free from future political interference. This may prove difficult in a country where many people have come to expect that public services, including transport, cost little or nothing. Simply ensuring that travellers do not ignore toll booths will be a challenge. Also, even though Mr Jagdish Tytler, the transport minister, and his senior officials are enthusiastic about private investment, some officials are dragging their feet. Parliament last year authorised private investment in roads, but the ministry has yet to publish a new highways policy incorporating the change. Meanwhile, the ministry is also trying to attract private investment in ports. Private companies are working on schemes worth Dollars 300m to install privately operated terminals, container bays, berths and storage areas. Projects worth a further Dollars 4bn are under consideration, including a Dollars 500m chemicals terminal in Bombay and a Dollars 600m harbour in Goa.</p>

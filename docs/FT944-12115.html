			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Chinese move against Jardine China yesterday demanded that the Hong Kong government provide it with details on the award of a HKDollars 790m (Pounds 63m) contract to build a base for the Chinese navy in Hong Kong harbour. The contract was won by Gammon Construction, owned jointly by Jardine Pacific, a subsidiary of the Jardine Matheson trading house, and Trafalgar House, an associate of the group. China is furious with Jardine, which is to delist from the Hong Kong stock exchange at the year's end. In retaliation Beijing has withheld its approval for the extension of Hong Kong's container port, in which Jardine has a large interest. A senior Hong Kong government official said last night that Gammon had won the contract against six other bidders in an open tender. Simon Holberton, Hong Kong</p>

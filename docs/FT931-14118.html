			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Protest at Airtours' planned takeover: OFT to hear that acquisition of Owners Abroad will endanger small tour operators THE Association of Independent Tour Operators is tomorrow expected to tell the Office of Fair Trading that Airtours' proposed takeover of Owners Abroad would seriously hamper the viability of small travel companies. The association, which represents 126 independent tour operators, is expected to tell the OFT that Airtours' acquisition of Air 2000, Owners Abroad's charter carrier, would make it increasingly difficult for smaller travel companies to book airline seats. It will also say that the takeover would give Airtours and Thomson, the UK's largest travel company, a dominating position which would drive smaller travel agencies out of business. Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the UK's largest travel agents' chain, and Airtours owns Pickfords, the second largest. A draft submission to the OFT is to be considered by the association's council today. Within the next month, the OFT is expected to make a recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who will then decide whether the Pounds 217m bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Noel Josephides, AITO chairman, said Owners Abroad's seat wholesaling business had enabled smaller operators to sell holidays from a wide range of UK airports. He said Owners Abroad had supplied aircraft seats to every member of the association which used charter flights. By contrast, Thomson and Airtours used their aircraft primarily for their own programmes. Mr Josephides added that Lunn Poly and Pickfords were able to rely on the financial strength of their parent companies to offer discounts on holidays which independent travel agents were unable to match. With two travel companies dominating the industry, the position of independent agents would deteriorate further, he said. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, told AITO yesterday that tour operators could expect greater stability from his company's proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook and LTU, the German tour operator. 'Our deal, retaining the three majors, will bring a greater deal of stability to the UK market,' he said. Thomson was unlikely to remain passive as an enlarged Airtours would challenge its dominance of the UK market. 'For some years forward, Thomson should fear a combined Owners Abroad and Airtours more than it should fear an Owners LTU deal,' Mr Klein said.</p>

Accompanied  by Ling Botang, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the  Guangdong Provincial People's Congress and Liang Guangda and  other Zhuhai leaders, Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau  of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the NPC  Standing Committee, visited the families of these two peasants  and had cordial discussions with them.    It was raining that afternoon. NPC Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun  first came to Luo Taoan's house. After listening to an  introduction, he said: Over the past few years, whenever I have  come to the coastal regions, I have had to go and have a look at  the rural areas. I am very delighted in my heart to see that  the peasants are leading a better and better life every day.  This shows that the path of reform and opening up designed by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping is completely correct. It is impossible  to have a prosperous and strong country without developing the  economy. Facts show that reform and opening up must not be  shaken. There is no way out other than reform. After this, NPC  Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun visited the family of Lin Gen, who is a  fruit grower by occupation.</p>

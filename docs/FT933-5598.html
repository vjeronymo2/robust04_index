			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rank sells eight more hotels THE RANK Organisation has sold eight provincial hotels to the privately owned Macdonald Hotels group. Rank would not reveal the price paid, but it is thought to be about Pounds 26m. Of the 22 hotels put up for sale in April 1992, Rank has now sold 14. It has since decided to retain the Alvaston Hall hotel in Nantwich, Cheshire, as part of its Warner holiday business. The group said it was talking to prospective buyers of the remaining hotels, which include the Royal Garden and Royal Lancaster hotels in London. Mr Angus Chrichton-Miller, managing director of Rank's hotels division, expected the remaining seven hotels to be sold by next April. Among the hotels sold yesterday were the Last Drop in Bolton and the Tickled Trout, near Preston.</p>

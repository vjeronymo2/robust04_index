			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy  remained on the track of steady growth in May, flashing a safe  "green light" on a government composite scaling system, the  Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported  Monday [27 Jun]. May's overall economic performance received a  score of 28 points on the CEPD-designed monitoring scale, up 2  points from April and also the highest level so far this year,  the council said. It was the sixth straight month the domestic  economy has received a "green" rating.    The index of leading economic indicators, which gauges the  country's economic prospects for the next three to five months,  rose 0.9 percent from April to reach a five-year high of 114.8.  However, the index of coincident economic indicators, which  measures economic performance for the month, dropped 0.5 percnt  from April to 138.2 mainly because of a slight decrease in  manufacturing sales due to seasonal factors.    CEPD officials said the rise in the leading index indicates  the economy will continue to grow steadily in the months ahead.  Of the nine indicators the CEPD regularly monitors to measure  the overall economic performance, five remained in the "green  light" category in May. They were the industrial production  index, the nonfarm-sector employment rate, manufacturing  inventory, new orders received by manufacturers and bank loans.    Two indicators -- the stock index and the M1b money supply  growth -- were upgraded from the "green" rating in April to the  more bullish "yellow-red" rating, and the check-default rate  also improved from the gloomy "blue" rating to the "yellow-blue"  category.    Only one indicator -- the export growth rate -- was  downgraded. It slipped from the "green" category to the  "yellow-red" rating.    Hung Hui-yen, a section chief at the CEPD's Economic  Research  Department, said May's factory facility utilization rate reached  78.8 percent, up 1.3 percent from the same month of 1993 and a  two- year high.    The profit rate for local manufacturers also reached a  22-month high of 6.1 percent in May, Hung reported. Moreover,  manufacturing sales and new orders grew by 6.1 percent and 10.7  percent, respectively, from the year-earlier levels.    "All these figures show the domestic economy will grow even  faster in the second half of this year," Hung noted.    A recent CEPD survey of local manufacturers also reflected  optimism about the country's future economic prospcts, Hung  said. The survey found that 28 percent of manufacturers  interviewed said they believe economic prospects will continue  improving in the months ahead; 59 percent said the economy will  remain almost the same, and only 13 percent said they are  pessimistic about their business prospects.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) The payment is designated for a public purpose rather than for a privilege, service or regulatory function, or for any other local benefit tending to increase the value of the property with respect to which the payments are made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain waste remediation bonds_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph (f) applies to bonds issued to finance hazardous waste clean-up activities on privately owned land ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> hazardous waste remediation bonds <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Persons that are not private users.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Payments from nongovernmental persons who are not (other than coincidentally) either users of the site being remediated or persons potentially responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site are not taken into account as private security. This paragraph (f)(2) applies to payments that secure the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds (directly or indirectly) under the terms of the bonds. This paragraph (f)(2) applies only if the payments are made pursuant to either (i) a generally applicable state or local taxing statute, or (ii) a state or local statute that regulates or restrains activities on an industry-wide basis of persons who are engaged in generating or handling hazardous waste, or in refining, producing, or transporting petroleum, provided that those payments do not represent, in substance, payment for the use of proceeds. For this purpose, a state or local statute that imposes payments that have substantially the same character as those described in Chapter 38 of the Code are treated as generally applicable taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Persons that are private users.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If payments from nongovernmental persons who are either users of the site being remediated or persons potentially responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site do not secure the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds (directly or indirectly) under the terms of the bond, the payments are not taken into account as private payments. This paragraph (f)(3) applies only if at the time the bonds are issued the payments from those nongovernmental persons are not material to the security for the bonds. For this purpose, payments are not material to the security for the bonds if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The payments are not required for the payment of debt service on the bonds; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The amount and timing of the payments are not structured or designed to reflect the payment of debt service on the bonds; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The receipt or the amount of the payment is uncertain (for example, as of the issue date, no final judgment has been entered into against the nongovernmental person); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The payments from those nongovernmental persons, when and if received, are used either to redeem bonds of the issuer or to pay for costs of any hazardous waste remediation project; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) If a judgment (but not a final judgment) has been entered against a nongovernmental person by the issue date, there are, as of the issue date, costs of hazardous waste remediation other than those financed with the bonds that may be financed with the payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples illustrate the application of this section: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Aggregation of payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> State B issues bonds with proceeds of $10 million. B uses $9.7 million of the proceeds to construct a 10-story office building. B uses the remaining $300,000 of proceeds to make a loan to Corporation Y to finance unrelated privately owned facilities. In addition, X leases 1 floor of the building for a significant period that is less than the term of the bonds. As a percentage of the present value of the debt service on the bonds, the present value of Y's loan repayments is 3 percent and the present value of X's lease payments is 8 percent. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment test because the private payments taken into account are more than 10 percent of the present value of the debt service on the bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Indirect private payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> J, a political subdivision of a state, will issue several series of bonds from time to time and will use the proceeds to rehabilitate urban areas. More than 10 percent of the proceeds of each issue will be used for the rehabilitation and construction of buildings that will be leased or sold to nongovernmental persons for use in their trades or business. Nongovernmental persons will make payments for these sales and leases that have an aggregate present value that is more than the present value of debt service on 10 percent of each issue. There is no limitation either on the number of issues or the aggregate amount of bonds that may be outstanding. No group of bondholders has any legal claim prior to any other bondholders or creditors with respect to specific revenues of J, and there is no arrangement whereby revenues from a particular project are paid into a trust or constructive trust, or sinking fund, or are otherwise segregated or restricted for the benefit of any group of bondholders. There is, however, an unconditional obligation by J to pay the principal of and interest on each issue. The bonds meet the private security or payment test because all of the private payments are counted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Allocations of payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> City Z purchases property for $1,250,000 using $1,000,000 of proceeds of its tax increment bonds and $250,000 of other revenues that are in its redevelopment fund. The bonds are secured only by the incremental property taxes on the property attributable to the increase in value of the property from the planned redevelopment of the property. Z will reimburse the redevelopment fund from amounts paid from the resale of the property. After clearing the property, Z sells it to Developer M for $250,000, an amount not in excess of the fair market value of the land, which Z uses to reimburse the redevelopment fund. Although M uses the property financed with the proceeds of the bonds, it also directly uses property that was not financed with those proceeds. The payments by M are properly allocable to the property financed with the amounts in Z's redevelopment fund. Accordingly, the issue does not meet the private security or payment test because of M's $250,000 payment. See paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Payments in respect of bond financed property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In order to further public safety, City Y issues $5,000,000 of its tax assessment bonds the proceeds of which are used to move existing electric utility lines underground. Although the utility lines are owned by a nongovernmental utility company, that company is under no obligation to move the lines. The debt service on the bonds will be paid using assessments levied by City Y on the customers of the utility. Although the utility lines are privately owned and the utility customers make payments to the utility company for the use of those lines, the assessments are payments in respect of the cost of relocating the utility line. Thus, the assessment payments are not made in respect of property used for a private business use. Any direct or indirect payments to Y by the utility are, however, taken into account as private payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5. Management contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> City P issues general obligation bonds to finance the renovation of a hospital that it owns. The hospital is operated for P by D, a nongovernmental person, under a management contract that results in private business use under &sect;1.141&hyph;3. P will use the revenues from the hospital (after the required payments to D) to pay the debt service on the bonds. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment test because the revenues from the hospital are payments in respect of property used for a private business use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6. Lease financing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) County W issues certificates of participation in a lease of a building that W owns and covenants to appropriate annual payments for the lease. A portion of each payment is specified as interest. More than 10 percent of the building is used for private business use. None of the proceeds of the obligations are used with respect to the building. W uses more than 10 percent of the proceeds of the obligations to construct a stadium that is to be used for a private business use. If W defaults under the lease, the trustee for the holders of the certificates of participation has a limited right of repossession under which the trustee may not foreclose but may lease the property to a new tenant at fair market value. The obligations are secured by an interest in property used for a private business use and, therefore, the obligations satisfy the private security for payment test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The facts are the same as in part (i) of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  except that, under the terms of the lease, in the event of a default by W, the trustee's only rights are to sue W for any failure to make payments pursuant to the lease. Thus, the trustee has no rights to the building and no limited right of repossession. The right to receive lease payments is not an interest in the leased property and, therefore, this right does not provide private security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- More than 160 people were  injured, fire erupted and police were taken hostage in the most  violent clash of President Kim Yong-sam's administration  Saturday as collegians and activists took to the street to stop  government ratification of the Uruguay Round (UR).    Over 70 students were rounded up and police said they will  all be arrested.    Tension escalated from early morning when estimated 700  students gathered at Seoul campuses to join the afternoon  anti-UR rally.    Students resorted to steel pipes and wood sticks as riot  police blocked them from going into campuses where morning  ceremonies were planned before the march to the rally site in  the southern part of the capital.    Demonstrators took 54 policemen hostage inside Hongik  University campus [approximately 5 miles from the U.S. Embassy]  and demanded an exchange with 20 collegians taken by police.    Riot troopers stormed the campus building with tear gas and  saved the hostages but hours of confrontations continued before  the students tried to force their way out using firebombs.    Rally pamphlets caught fire in the volley of firebombs and  flame erupted at the student center but was put out in 25  minutes.    Police said at least 160 people, including 110 of their men  and 50 students were hurt and receiving hospital treatment.  Paek Kwang-hae, a 21-year-old student, was reported to have  suffered serious eye injury after being hit by a rock.    Meanwhile, the anti-UR rally opened as scheduled at 3 PM  with  over 7,000 ralliers.    "Down with Uruguay Round, repel Uruguay Round," protesters  chanted.    Seoul ended up opening its rice market despite President  Kim's campaign pledge to keep it closed. The government is set  to ratify the UR accord in August.    Downtown traffic was paralyzed for throughout the afternoon  as some 1,000 ralliers went ahead with its 5 km march.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / River information paid for by the piggy bank: Charges levied on children, and others, for access to government documents Deep pockets may be needed by children requesting information for school projects under guidelines introduced by the government on how official information should be made more widely available. The National Rivers Authority, a quango, has said that it may levy a fee on children and students who request information under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information if it takes more than half an hour of staff time. The code was designed to 'make information about the policies, actions and decisions of government departments, agencies and public bodies more widely available'. The government said that departments and quangos, supervised by the parliamentary ombudsman, would have to make available on request some information previously kept secret. The code stipulates that officials would be able to charge for certain information but left departments to set their own fees. Seven months on, a survey by the Campaign for Freedom of Information has found confusion and wide variation in fees charged by government departments and quangos. Mr Maurice Frankel, the campaign's director, said: 'What we have found is extraordinary differences between departments' arrangements, showing how arbitrarily charges have been set.' The survey found that three departments - the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; the Inland Revenue, and the Foreign Office - allow no free time and charge for all requests involving additional work for officials. The Home Office and Department of Health waive charges only for requests which take less than one hour to answer. They charge Pounds 20 an hour for other requests. According to the Campaign for Freedom of Information the worst example is the rivers authority, where it is not just children and students who face a fee. Its regulations say that requests for information by journalists 'to facilitate the writing of articles should, however, be subject to charge'. Documents provided by the authority show that the authority will charge up to Pounds 150 for each A2 sheet of paper containing information such as tables of periodic rainfall and flood risk maps. The authority said: 'Charges for such data reflect the requirements for those who obtain specific benefit from the work the NRA does, and has done, to pay a fair contribution towards this.' It said most information it held was provided free. The Ministry of Defence told the campaign that it had implemented an 'upper ceiling of Pounds 200 so that no charge will be made above that level, irrespective of the actual additional cost'. The Campaign for Freedom of Information believes that this Pounds 200 ceiling will put much official information out of bounds for the public. The Ministry of Defence confirmed this: 'It is unlikely that divisions will be able to answer inquiries more expensive than Pounds 200, however, since it would probably represent an unreasonable diversion of manpower from defence activities.' The Office of Public Service and Science yesterday defended the fees and said anyone dissatisfied should complain to the parliamentary ombudsman. 'There are bound to be some anomalies. The overarching principle is that all charges must be reasonable and must not exceed the total cost of the work involved.'</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (13): The global area links may take a little while - Enterprise-Wide Networks THE ERA of stand-alone personal computers is over, but that of enterprise-wide networks has not yet begun. How quickly the transition can be achieved depends partly on developments in the software industry and partly on how willing managements are to change their thinking. Linking personal computers together to form local area networks has become standard practice in the past few years, driven largely by a user rebellion against slow service from central mainframe and minicomputer departments. The typical LAN now joins together around 20 users and around a tenth of LANs join as many as 250. By 1995 it is expected that half of all the business PCs in the world will belong to such networks. LANs were set up first to provide relatively simple applications such as word processing, spreadsheets and electronic mail. As users increasingly look for more quickly developed and more cost-effective corporate systems, LANs are gradually being extended to take on more of the traditional data processing functions, based on larger databases from leading suppliers such as Oracle and ARK Ingres. The era of stand-alone PCs has come and gone in little over a decade. But to connect PC LANs to corporate systems to form wide area networks and enterprise-wide or 'global area' networks, which will allow many thousands of users to communicate, is a vastly more complicated matter. Many firms have machines on different sites that are connected, but it is one thing to be able to transfer simple files between them and another to get complex applications running across several transport protocols. Some of the network management problems involved in establishing enterprise-wide systems are still unsolved and look unlikely to be solved for several years. Processes such as the electronic distribution of new versions of programs to thousands of users in remote sites are just only beginning to be widespread. Security features remain weak and viruses continue to pose a threat. There are also outstanding technical questions about how best to connect portable computers to corporate systems, using fax/modem cards or adaptor devices. In sum, large companies using systems from a wide range of suppliers may face a 10-20-year migration from the stand-alone environment to the enterprise-wide system. Mr Bruce Murrill, technical director of the Network Management Forum, cautioned last year that the goal of managing enterprise-wide networks was 'still some way off'. So far, neither of the two leading PC operating system software companies, Novell and Microsoft, has proved that it can fulfil all the necessary functions for the task of controlling very large networks. Microsoft has achieved a dominant position in single-user operating systems with its DOS and Windows products. Novell has become the principal LAN software supplier, with around 70 per cent of that market. In the next few months, Novell will seek to consolidate its position with a new version of its Netware product, while Microsoft will challenge it with a new network operating system called Windows NT (New Technology). Many users are delaying investment decisions until more is known about the capabilities of these new products. Last year, Novell launched a major move to broaden its operations by an agreement to take over Unix System Labs from AT&amp;T. Ownership of USL will give Novell control of the development of the Unix operating system. Unix is the engine of most of the new range of smaller machines which have been steadily taking over from mainframes and minicomputers in the past few years. This acquisition will therefore give Novell a central role in the evolution of corporate systems and potentially the ability to integrate those corporate systems with LANs. Novell's plans for Unix remain a matter of speculation until the takeover process is completed. However, there is a view in the industry that it will seek to consolidate Unix as the vehicle for the next generation of systems built on a client/server structure and to push it down onto personal computers as a shrink-wrapped commodity product. Mr Ben Smith, Novell's UK managing director, argues that users will benefit by having Unix in the hands of a hardware- independent company. He says that Novell intends to 'purify' Unix by reducing the number of variants in use. However, Novell may now come into confrontation with Microsoft, which could bring a new and potentially damaging conflict within the industry. Microsoft's UK marketing manager for corporate network systems Ms Jack Fogg says that there will inevitably be more direct competition between the two companies because of their similar business strategies. The opening shots in the battle have already been fired. Novell and the Unix camp claim that very little is yet known about Windows NT and that users have no reason to wait for it. Meanwhile, Microsoft has begun to argue that Unix has design weaknesses and is seeking to show that many software developers are switching their support from Unix to Windows NT. Some industry experts consider that the main barriers to building effective enterprise-wide networks are psychological rather than technological. They say that most corporate networks are still badly managed, inefficient and unreliable. Mr Chris Yates, managing partner of telecommunications consultancy Newburn Consulting and formerly of National Power, is a proponent of this view. In his opinion '95 per cent of networking problems are managerial and only 5 per cent technical. Most business leaders are still not aware of how dependent their business is on communications. They ought by now to be as aware of information technology issues as they are of finance or production.' Ms Laura Lilyquist, European marketing manager for Sun Connect, Sun Microsystems' networking business, also thinks the problem of building global area networks is one of management education. 'Each vendor only owns one piece of the problem,' she argues. 'Users may need software products from a dozen different sources to be able to get machines to interact properly at the application level. But many of them are still attuned to one-stop shopping for their computing and do not take advantage of the range of choice of products available.'</p>

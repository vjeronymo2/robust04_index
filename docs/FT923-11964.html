			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Train times running backwards Sir, Notwithstanding InterCity director, Brian Scott's defence of extended journey times between Bristol Parkway and London (Letters, July 20), I know that commuters in several parts of Britain are wondering why some rush hour timings have been extended since the introduction of targets under the Passenger's Charter. At my home station, Brockley, the average journey time of trains to London between 7am and 9am was increased in the May timetable from 9.1 minutes to 10.8 minutes. This is a rise of almost 20 per cent for this journey of 3 3/4 miles. I am not aware of any engineering works affecting this route. To measure 70 years' progress, I looked up the same range of rush-hour trains in a 1922 Bradshaw timetable; the average journey time then was 10.2 minutes.

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI POLICE UNION REACHES TENTATIVE PACT WITH CITY  </P> <P> The Simi Valley police union reached a tentative contract agreement with the  city Wednesday night, apparently ending a three-week deadlock, but details were  not made public.  </P> <P> An emergency meeting of the Police Officers Assn. was called immediately so  members could vote on the proposal.  </P> <P> "I am very optimistic that the agreement will be ratified by a majority,"  predicted Officer Blair Summey, the union's president.  </P> <P> Union attorney Stephen Silver would describe the tentative pact only as "a  respectable contract for both sides."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Week to 10 Days  </P> <P> Simi Valley Personnel Director Laura Wylie said that if accepted by the union,  the pact would be presented to the City Council "within the next week to 10  days."  </P> <P> The council might consider the agreement at its regular meeting July 24, but  only if the paper work and language of the contract are completed, Wylie said.  </P> <P> The agreement appeared to end a labor dispute that peaked Monday at a crowded,  emotional council meeting attended by about 200 police officers, their families  and friends. Police and their supporters protested the lack of a contract and  voiced concern over threats made last week that the council might consider  replacing the city's police force with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Summey said he believed that the large turnout prompted both sides to end a  three-week break in talks and return to the negotiating table.  </P> <P> The 85-member police force has worked without a contract since July 1.  </P> <P> The union sought a workweek of four 10-hour days and a wage scale tied to the  average police pay in Southern California cities of comparable size. The base  pay for a patrol officer in Simi Valley is $26,472 a year, and for a sergeant  it is $34,608.  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: UBF takes FM1.7bn injection UNION BANK of Finland, the country's second-largest bank, yesterday said it would take a FM1.7bn (Dollars 328m) injection from the Finnish government to strengthen its capital base. The move makes it the last of the leading Finnish banks to take advantage of a FM8bn preference capital fund which the government set up earlier this year to help support the country's ailing financial system. The state has also established a FM20bn guarantee fund. UBF said it decided to take the injection because of the continuing difficulties being faced by the Finnish banking sector, which has been battered by heavy credit losses and the deterioration in the country's economy. It also noted that the option to apply to the fund expired at the year-end. The bank said the provision would strengthen its capital ratio by about 1 per cent from 9.5 per cent and would increase its lending capacity by about FM20bn. The injection takes the form of a preferred capital certificate and carries a coupon of 0.5 per cent a year over one-year Finnish government Treasury bills until the end of 1997. If heavy losses prevent UBF from repaying the amount, conversion rights will allow the state to take a holding of up to 30.4 per cent in the group. Unitas, UBF's holding company, disclosed a FM1.5bn loss for the first eight months of 1992, and predicted a FM3bn loss for the whole year. Like other Finnish banks, it has been rationalising heavily. Staff numbers will have been cut to 8,500 by the year-end, 2,000 less than in 1987. Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, UBF's main commercial competitor, said in August that it would also take a FM1.7bn injection from the government.</p>

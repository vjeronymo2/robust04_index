			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown seeks to avoid rule by minority MODERATE Conservative and Labour voters should deny both Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock the opportunity to form a minority government after the election, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said last night, Ivor Owen writes. He told a rally in Eastbourne, East Sussex, that neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock would have the right to try to go it alone in a hung parliament, and that pressure from within the Conservative or Labour party could ensure a coalition government involving the Liberal Democrats. Mr Ashdown's speech came after a visit to Cornwall and Devon. There he found evidence that Mr Major's warning against voting Liberal Democrat because it might put Mr Kinnock into 10 Downing Street could rebound on the Tories. There were indications of Conservative candidates fearing that Labour supporters could interpret the warning as an encouragement to switch to the Liberal Democrats. As soon as Mr Ashdown crossed the River Tamar into the Cornwall South East constituency, Liberal Democrat activists assured him that they were poised to repeat their February 1974 victory, when a combination of Tory defectors and tactical voting by Labour supporters defeated Mr Robert Hicks, the sitting Conservative. Mr Hicks regained the seat in October 1974 and has held it since, but his confidence that he will beat off the Liberal Democrats challenge does not appear to be shared by some of his party workers. Mr Ashdown, buoyed by recent opinion polls and the response he has received on his nationwide election tour, told a rally in Eastbourne last night that a vote to replace Mr Major with Mr Kinnock would not be enough. He dismissed Labour's slogan 'time for change' and said Mr Kinnock was not seeking 'real change'. Mr Ashdown added that a Labour victory would be a return to the old system with a 'gang of playground bullies' using their strength to grab Buggins' turn to do whatever they like.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A patch in time to save smokers - The race to help nicotine addicts give up Imagine trying to sell a product which is simultaneously highly addictive and extremely poisonous. Even if it doesn't sound immoral, it appears commercially absurd. After all, sales would collapse as customers died. Yet one of the world's best-selling products - tobacco - contains nicotine which is both highly toxic and addictive. The cleverness of tobacco producers has been to provide just enough nicotine to yield its medically recognised benefits - such as stimulation of dopamine secretions in the brain, alleviating anxiety - without fatally poisoning the addict. No wonder then that while millions annually resolve to kick the smoking habit, only about 10 per cent succeed in stopping for a year. Of the UK's 14m smokers, an estimated 10m want to stop. As many as 40 per cent of British smokers try to stop the habit permanently during any one year; most fail. That is cheering news not just for tobacco producers but also for the newly evangelising manufacturers of products - chewing gum and stick-on patches - aimed at providing small doses of nicotine, enough to satisfy cravings, but without the 2,000 or so other toxins contained in a typical puff of tobacco smoke. The patches are attached to the skin surface and slowly release nicotine into the bloodstream. In the US, with 50m smokers, the leading brands are Nicoderm (from Marion Merrell Dow), Habitrol (Ciba-Geigy), Nicotrol (Warner-Lambert) and Pro-Step (American Cyanamid). Advertising Age, a trade magazine, calculates that their combined sales could have reached Dollars 900m (Pounds 592m) in 1992, with advertising support of Dollars 100m, 'the most ever spent on consumer advertising of a prescription drug'. In the UK three brands of patch have been available without prescription since the end of 1992. Kabi Pharmacia is using the cartoon figure (below) to market Nicorette, Ciba-Geigy is selling Nicotinell, and Marion Merrell Dow is promoting its brand, Nicabate. A three-month course for each retails from between Pounds 147.54 to Pounds 182.76, less than the daily price of 20 cigarettes. Industry estimates suggest that this year's market could be worth Pounds 30m-50m. Kabi Pharmacia, which in 1991 gained UK approval to switch its Nicorette chewing gum from prescription-only status to an over-the-counter product, saw retail sales of the gum treble to Pounds 20m in 1992, which it believes is partly a result of easier availability. The US sales/advertising ratio is likely to be repeated in the UK; certainly Ciba-Geigy and Kabi Pharmacia are spending in excess of Pounds 3m on their current advertising campaigns. Reports from the UK's 13,000 dispensing pharmacies are encouraging for all three brands. Some anti-smoking charities, however, are concerned that smokers may be misled by the marketing and that, ultimately, they may remain nicotine addicts. Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, notes that 'they are relatively expensive, particularly for the heaviest smoking groups which coincidentally are also the lowest income groups, and their success rates are questionable. 'Stopping smoking requires willpower. US research suggests that 90 per cent of successful ex-smokers quit without any formal help, because they have the motivation to do so.' Meanwhile, for those smokers who dislike both gum and patch, a further weaning device is just around the corner; the nicotine nasal spray.</p>

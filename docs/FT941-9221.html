			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Tories resist probe into auditing Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, last night resisted Labour demands for an inquiry into the auditing of companies. Arguing against giving auditors a wider role in detecting fraud, he insisted in a Commons debate that it would be wrong to turn them into 'snoopers and narks'. Mr Nelson stressed the importance of not undermining the relationship between auditors and their clients, and of avoiding overlapping of the responsibilities of auditors and the regulatory bodies in the financial services sector. MPs approved new regulations arising from the Bingham report on the events leading to the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which impose a statutory duty on auditors to report relevant information to the Bank of England and the regulatory authorities for building societies and the insurance industry.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WEST LEADS, 3-0, IN THIRD-ROUND LEGION CONTEST  </P> <P> Watching a seemingly endless game between New Mexico and Utah on Friday night,  Woodland Hills West right-hander Corey Bromberg uttered what was meant to be a  joke.  </P> <P> After New Mexico had taken a two-run lead in the top of the 13th inning and a  Utah batter had come up with a man on, Bromberg -- waiting to start West's  third-round game in the American Legion Southwest regional tournament -- said:  </P> <P> "If this kid hits it out, I'm not pitching."  </P> <P> Boom. Gone. The home run delayed the start of West's game against host Union  City until 10:22 p.m.  </P> <P> At press time, West held a 3-0 lead with Union City batting against Bromberg  with one out in the top of the fourth inning.  </P> <P> A loss would have sent West into an elimination game against Hawaii at 4 p.m.  today. Hawaii, which trailed, 10-0, at one point, rallied to defeat Arizona,  17-16, Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> A victory would have guaranteed West a berth in Sunday's final round. West,  which would have improved to 3-0 in the double-elimination tournament with a  victory late Friday, would play a 7 p.m. game with New Mexico today.  </P> <P> In an elimination game that lasted 5 hours 20 minutes, New Mexico defeated  Utah, 14-10, in 16 innings.  </P> <P> West scored a run without a hit in the bottom of the first on consecutive walks  to Paul Geller, Jeff Marks and Del Marine and a sacrifice fly by Bobby Kim.  </P> <P> West again loaded the bases against Union City right-hander Bob Pailthorpe in  the third and got more mileage out of this threat than it did in the first.  </P> <P> With one out, Marine singled to left on an 0-2 pitch and moved to second when  Union City third baseman Jeff Borges bobbled Jason Cohen's grounder in the  hole. Kim worked out of an 0-2 hole to draw a walk, loading the bases.  </P> <P> Right fielder Greg Lederman, who jokingly has started referring to himself as  "Stickman," drove in Marine and Cohen with a line single to right field to give  West a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> Through three innings, Bromberg had allowed three baserunners, one via a base  hit and two because of infield errors.  </P></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Haiti army chief will quit country Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras, head of the military government in Haiti, resigned his post yesterday and announced he was leaving the country, thus facilitating the return of the man he overthrew in a bloody 1991 coup, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Mr Aristide's supporters immediately took to the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, to celebrate, forcing the US military to protect Gen Cedras and his family, as well as Gen Jean-Claude Duperval, who was appointed interim head of the Haitian military yesterday. At a public ceremony on the steps of military headquarters, Gen Cedras attempted to leave power in a dignified manner, handing over nominal control of the armed forces and police to Gen Duperval, his second-in-command, as a 40-piece military band played the battle anthem of Haiti's armed forces. But thousands of Aristide supporters turned the ceremony into a mockery, singing anti-military songs to the band's tune. Chants of 'Aristide is coming back, Cedras is going to eat sewage', and the noise of US military helicopters overhead, drowned out much of the departing general's speech. Gen Hugh Shelton, commander of the 17,000 US personnel on the ground in Haiti, oversaw the ceremony, escorting Gen Cedras to the podium while US troops kept screaming supporters of President Aristide at bay. 'I choose to leave the country because my presence could be a pretext for unjustifiable acts,' Gen Cedras said. There was no immediate announcement of which country would give him refuge, but Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador at the UN, said last night the general would move to an 'undisclosed South American country'. A US diplomat ruled out Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Paraguay. US officials also said they believed Gen Duperval would relinquish power to President Aristide's nominee to head the military when the president made his expected return on Saturday. Five Haitian colonels met the president last week in Washington to discuss civilian control of the military. The resignation followed two days of meetings with US officials, including Mr William Perry, defence secretary, and Gen Shelton, in which Gen Cedras's safety after he had stepped down and ways to deal improve the maintenance of law and order in the country were discussed. The general's authority over the military, and the military's reign of terror over the population, had been steadily declining over the past week as it became apparent that he had no future as commander. Pro-Aristide demonstrations throughout the country have become widespread, often with deadly consequences for the president's supporters. On Friday in the town of St Marc, about 75km north of the capital, at least 10 people died and scores were injured as a bus ploughed into a pro-Aristide rally. At the weekend, a similar incident occurred near Miragone, south of the capital, killing 12. Over the next few days, US forces will be under pressure to protect both pro-Aristide rallies, sure to increase as the population prepares for the return of its president, and members of the Haitian military, which is in disarray but under unusual orders not to fire on Haitians. Gen Cedras took power on September 30 1991, when his two leading associates  -Brig-Gen Philippe Biamby and the police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois - took President Aristide from his home and sent him into exile, first in Venezuela and then in Washington.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Bush urges go-ahead for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to Israel THE transformation in relations between the US and Israeli governments was officially sealed yesterday with President George Bush 'enthusiastically' recommending that Congress grant Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees to the Jewish state. Mr Bush described his two-day meeting with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, as 'a consultation between close friends and strategic partners'. The US relationship with Israel was characterised by 'trust, warmth and a commitment to meeting common challenges. This is strategic co-operation at its very best,' said Mr Bush, who reaffirmed the US undertaking to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge over its neighbours. After the press conference outside Mr Bush's holiday home at Kennebunkport, the two leaders flew to Washington where Mr Bush was due to seek congressional approval for the loan guarantees, needed by Israel to finance housing for immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The administration had refused an earlier request from the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, defeated in the June general election, until Israel stopped building new settlements in the occupied Arab territories. Mr Bush praised Mr Rabin's approach to the issue and said that it had taken a lot of courage to impose a ban on new Jewish housing in the territories. The president declined to give details of the loan guarantees deal but said discussions had gone beyond broad outlines. He was convinced the agreement was not just in Israel's interest but also that of the US people. Mr Bush said he had also been persuaded by Mr Rabin of the new Israeli government's determination to make Middle East peace negotiations succeed. 'I call upon the Arab parties to respond in kind,' Mr Bush said. 'The time has come to make peace, not simply to talk of it.' Peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are due to resume in Washington on August 24 when Israel is expected to make a series of proposals for granting the Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza a degree of autonomy. Criticised for his cautious approach to the Bosnian crisis and challenged by President Saddam Hussein's partial rejection of UN ceasefire resolutions, Mr Bush clearly revelled in yesterday's opportunity to demonstrate a foreign policy success. Mr Rabin praised Mr Bush's leadership during the Gulf war and expressed personal gratitude to Mr Bush for helping Jews emigrate from Ethiopia and the Soviet Union. But he also reminded Mr Bush of Israel's concern over the human tragedy in Bosnia. 'The killing must stop,' he said.

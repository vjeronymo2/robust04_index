			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT easier Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was one of the few weak spots as one house apparently discovered that the cost to the company of this year's Los Angeles earthquake was far greater than previously expected. UBS spoke to Farmers, the BAT subsidiary which is one of the largest insurance groups in the US, and established that claims resulting from the earthquake had rocketed to Dollars 150bn from Dollars 120bn, thus draining the capital available for writing new business. The securities house has had the stock as a trading buy for the past couple of months. However, the latest news has prompted consideration of a return to its fundamentally bearish stance. There is also concern that BAT will have to carry out huge capital investment in order to cope with the potential demand for cigarettes in newly opened markets such as Eastern Europe. The worries were voiced at the UBS afternoon meeting and the stock hit 443p before rallying with the market to close 2 off at 448p.</p>

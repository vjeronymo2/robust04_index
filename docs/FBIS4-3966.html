			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The only way out for  China's national education program is to devote major efforts to  developing occupational education, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said  here.    During his three-day tour in the city, the vice premier said  that great importance must be attached to the development of  occupational education while institutions of higher learning  have to achieve both the highest educational quality and the  highest social and economic gains.    Speaking of the reform in education, Li said that education  has a positive bearing on the nation's quality, on the country's  prosperity and on development now and in the 21st century.    Li, also a member of the Communist Party's Politburo, said  that China's educational agenda should include basic education,  adult and professional education and higher education, as well  as special education such as education for the disabled.    In basic education, he said, emphasis should be placed on  the  spreading of the nine-year compulsory schooling in areas  including 85 percent of the nation's population, and on the  elimination of illiteracy in areas covering 90 percent of the  total population.    To achieve greater, faster, better and more economic results  in running occupational schools, the official said that  professional education should be divided into three stages.    He said that students should be given such education in  primary, middle and high schools, respectively, to meet the  demands of a socialist market economy.    Talking about teaching quality and the social gains of  higher  education, he pointed out that efforts should be made to create  new educational patterns for colleges and universities, by way  of intercollege cooperation and resource sharing.    The vice premier noted that all of society must respect  teachers. Officials at all levels should "show respect to  teachers."    Greater attention should be paid to the work and life of  teachers, he added.    Li was accompanied by local officials on visits to many  universities and high schools in Tianjin.</p>

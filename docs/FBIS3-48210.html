(POSCO) workers will get a 2.9-percent  pay hike this month under an agreement thrashed out by the  company's industrial council.    The modest increase in basic pay and fixed allowances was  set  by the council, which comprises 18 labor representatives and 12  management negotiators, in a bid to maintain POSCO's  international competitiveness, according to a company spokesman.    "The industrial council agreed that the pay raise should be  low for the company to survive the rapidly changing  circumstances of international business," he said.    POSCO's wage accord is expected to affect pay negotiations  at  other industrial companies in the Pohang region.    POSCO, which has some 22,622 workers, is the world's second  biggest iron and steel maker with production last year estimated  at 22.48 million tons.</p>

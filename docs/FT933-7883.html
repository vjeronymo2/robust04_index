			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UN plans Somalia build-up THE United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia needs to be boosted by another brigade of about 3,000 men, secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali said yesterday, agencies report from New York. In a report to the Security Council asking for more men, he said Somali factions and warlords must be disarmed and 'criminal elements' brought to justice. He said fugitive warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed must bear the blame for much recent strife. The UN force is already set to rise next month to 28,000 soldiers from 27 countries. UN troops took over in May from a US-led force that numbered 37,000 at its peak.</p>

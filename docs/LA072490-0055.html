			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HOT HANGOUT;  </P> <P> UP TO 400 A DAY ARE PACKING THOUSAND OAKS' NEW TEEN CENTER FOR SOME COOL, CLEAN  FUN  </P> <P> Last summer, the mall was the cool place to hang out in Thousand Oaks. Sure,  some teen-agers liked to meet at the bowling alley for a few sodas. But The  Oaks Mall was the place to be.  </P> <P> But not this summer -- or at least that's what Maggie Heidenthal, 12, and her  friends say.  </P> <P> "We like to meet here now," said Heidenthal, lounging on a couch at the  Thousand Oaks Teen Center on Janss Road at California 23. "We just wasted money  at the mall."  </P> <P> Jennifer Wi, 12, added: "Besides, we could get bad habits at the mall, like  smoking. We can't do that here."  </P> <P> Since the city-sponsored Teen Center opened eight months ago, 300 to 400  teen-agers frequent it each day -- far surpassing city expectations.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks paid $3 million to build the 13,000-square-foot facility, which  includes basketball courts, pool tables, video games and a weight room. And  city officials say the center has been worth it.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased," Mayor Alex Fiore said. "We feel that the teens have a  place they can call their own."  </P> <P> In the evenings, the center usually is packed. Youngsters lounge on bean bags  and watch movies or MTV. Others play pool or Ping-Pong.  </P> <P> The Conejo Recreation and Park District, which runs the center for the city,  sponsors dances twice a month, sometimes attracting 700 teens. A volleyball  club, indoor soccer, jazzercise and beginning yoga are also available.  </P> <P> Although there is a fee for some of the classes, most of the activities are  free.  </P> <P> Jay Dodwell, the teen service coordinator, said when he was in high school in  the early 1980s there was little for teen-agers to do. Now the center fills the  void.  </P> <P> "The kids have a place to have positive interaction," Dodwell said. "It's a  necessity of life."  </P> <P> Twelve-year-old Corinne Michel -- visiting friends at the center -- said,  plainly: "We could be home vegetating and watching soap operas."  </P> <P> The idea for the center was first brought up in 1981 by several students and  park district officials, who formed a committee with city officials to discuss  their plans.  </P> <P> "It took a lot of legwork" to get the facility started, said Joe Hinsberg. But  after dozens of meetings, construction began in 1987.  </P> <P> The center is the only one of its kind in Ventura County. Thousand Oaks plans  to build a similar facility for senior citizens. Until the seniors' facility is  completed, the city wants to sponsor activities for them at the Teen Center  when the teen-agers are in school.  </P> <P> Dodwell said there have been a few incidents of vandalism at the center, but  the problems have been minor.  </P> <P> Elizabeth (Gypsy) Strauss, 15, said she used to hang out at the bowling alley.  Now she spends her free time playing pool at the Teen Center.  </P> <P> "I even won the tournament," she said.  </P> <P> Jason Gaines and Kevin Perry, both 12, say they like to play basketball at the  center. But "sometimes the big guys chase us off the court," Gaines said.  </P> <P> Wi said she has one small complaint.  </P> <P> "Sometimes they turn the MTV down too low."  </P></p>

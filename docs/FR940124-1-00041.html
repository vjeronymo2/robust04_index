			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute allocates legal responsibility among the entities that compose the program integrity triad. While specific statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together in a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects of institutional review. Within this statutory scheme, the Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system operates as efficiently as possible, with maximum integration among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on postsecondary institutions. In order to assist the Secretary in designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the Secretary specifically requests comment on the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same or similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency may establish different standards for evaluating the financial responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of an institution's educational program. Thus, a reviewed institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting agency's standards even though those standards address the same areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce the burden on institutions and enable the triad entities to carry out effectively their statutory functions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Should the final regulations be more explicit in identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any of the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected to consider in its evaluation of an institution?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart 1 of part H establishes a State Postsecondary Review Program under which each State designates a single State postsecondary review entity that is responsible for reviewing institutions of higher education that the Secretary identifies as meeting certain review criteria and for determining whether those institutions should continue to participate in the SFA programs. Subpart 3 specifies the procedures the Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and financial responsibility to administer the SFA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In subpart 2 of part H, the Secretary is charged with making a comprehensive and careful evaluation of an accrediting agency before recognizing that agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training offered by institutions or programs that the agency accredits. Moreover, as part of this evaluation, the Secretary is charged with establishing recognition standards that must include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' Accordingly, the standards that the Secretary proposes in this notice of proposed rulemaking require an accrediting agency to make a detailed and careful evaluation of the institutions or programs it accredits and to include in that evaluation ``appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed regulations were subject to the negotiated rulemaking process set forth in section 492 of the HEA. Under that process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings in September, 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The meetings were held in San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City. Before convening the meetings, the Secretary held a meeting in Washington, DC in August 1992 to invite comments from interested parties as to the key issues that should be addressed at the regional meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the four regional meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed in these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals and groups who attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in the negotiated rulemaking process. The Secretary selected negotiators from the list of nominees to reflect all the groups that are involved in the SFA programs. With regard to these proposed regulations, the Secretary chose negotiators who reflected the diversity of the accrediting community as well as the interests of States, higher education institutions, and students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared a draft proposed regulation and negotiated the provisions of that draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in January 1993 and one in February 1993. During those sessions, consensus was reached on several of the provisions that are included in this notice of proposed rulemaking. On the remaining provisions, however, the negotiators agreed to disagree. Where agreement was not reached on a particular provision, that fact is noted in the discussion that follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On several issues that were negotiated, there was general discussion on various approaches to take with regard to those issues. The Secretary believes those issues are important enough to include in this preamble possible alternative approaches in order to give the public a fuller understanding of the issues and the available potential solutions. Finally, on most issues where consensus was reached, the negotiators also reached general agreement on the language of a proposed regulatory provision. However, the Secretary wishes to reiterate the remarks of the Federal negotiators that the agreed-to language with regard to a specific provision would be subject to change in the proposed regulations for technical reasons but the substance of the provision would remain unchanged, wherever possible. Where a substantive change was made in a particular provision, that fact is noted in the discussion that follows, and an explanation of the reasons for the change is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

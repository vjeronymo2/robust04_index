			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The Taiwan High Court  Thursday [19 May] cut the jail terms for two mainland Chinese  hijackers from 10 years to seven years.    Liu Baocai, 24, and Huang Shugang, 30, hijacked a China  Southern Airlines' Boeing 757 to Taiwan en route from Shenzhen  to Beijing on April 5, 1993, marking the first of ten mainland  hijackings in 1993.    Liu and Huang were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a  Taoyuan District Court, but they appealed to the Taiwan High  Court, and the High Court upheld the sentence.    Liu and Huang then appealed to the Supreme Court. The  Supreme Court returned the case to the Taiwan High Court for  retrial. On Thursday, the High Court cut their sentences from  10 to seven years, saying the hijackers deserved leniency  because they surrendered without resistance.    Judge Wang Hsi-pao of the Taiwan High Court told them that  they could be paroled after serving slightly more than two years  in jail.    Liu and Huang said they would appeal the decision.</p>

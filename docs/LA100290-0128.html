			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNMEN KILL 25, WOUND 82 AT LEBANESE RALLY  </P> <P> Twenty-five people were killed and 82 wounded Monday when gunmen opened fire on  a candlelight rally of hundreds of followers of Christian Maj. Gen. Michel  Aoun.  </P> <P> Security sources said the attack came at the Nahr el Mawt (Death River)  crossing point linking Aoun's territory to areas controlled by the rival  Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces.  </P> <P> The demonstrators, men, women and children holding Lebanese flags and candles,  were protesting President Elias Hrawi's blockade of areas of Christian East  Beirut held by Aoun.  </P> <P> "Bodies are still lying on the street with the Red Cross unable to reach them  because of continued shooting," one Christian security source said.  </P> <P> Aoun accused the Lebanese Front and Hrawi's troops, who guard a checkpoint at  the crossing, of opening fire at the crowd.  </P> <P> "It is the ugliest crime. . . . It is a crime committed in cooperation and  coordination between Hrawi's government and the Lebanese Forces militia," Aoun  said.  </P> <P> Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's authority and rejects reforms aimed at giving  Muslims a greater role in Lebanon's Christian-dominated political system.  </P> <P> Hrawi's army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, issued a statement denying that his  troops fired on the rally, adding he has ordered an investigation into the  "regretful" incident.  </P> <P> Lebanese Forces radio accused Aoun's soldiers of shooting at the crowd.  </P> <P> Aoun's television station showed footage of panic-stricken demonstrators  running for shelter and badly wounded people screaming in pain.  </P> <P> Wounded protesters said Lebanese Forces gunmen holding positions just yards  from the rally were responsible for the attack.  </P> <P> "I was leading the march. . . . When we reached 25 yards from the forces'  position they opened fire on us," one wounded man said. "It was a massacre."  </P> <P> Monday's night protest followed Aoun's call Sunday for Lebanese to beat the  blockade imposed on his stronghold in a bid to starve him into surrender.  </P> <P> Aoun, 54, was appointed head of an interim government when Lebanon was left  without a president in 1988. He has refused to quit despite Hrawi's election  last year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A Brief History of Hawking: Movie-making giant Steven Spielberg will bring his  Amblin Entertainment company's sense of imagination to "A Brief History of  Time," a 90-minute television production based on the life of physicist Stephen  Hawking and his best-selling book about the origins of the universe. The  project is a co-venture of Anglia Television, Gordon Freedman Productions and  Amblin. The film will intertwine the story of Hawking -- he mastered the  disabling disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -- with a visual demonstration  of his theories about the black hole and the beginning of the universe. Errol  Morris will direct the production, which is scheduled for completion next fall  and intended for broadcast in network prime time. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

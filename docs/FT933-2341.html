			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Clinton reassures Italy on Somalia PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday told Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, that the US would like to see a political initiative to stop the violence in Somalia, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Clinton was speaking at a photo-session in the US capital with Mr Ciampi, who has voiced concern that the UN mission in Somalia should not turn into a 'police operation'. Italy, a former colonial power in Somalia, believes the US and the UN have turned a peacekeeping mission into a military campaign aimed at capturing warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed. Mr Clinton was asked about a letter sent by Gen Aideed to the UN asking for an independent commission to evaluate criminal charges against him and pledging to abide by the results. 'My main concern is not to allow Somalia to deteriorate into the conditions in which it was in before the UN went there,' Mr Clinton replied. 'Obviously we would like it if some political initiative could be taken to stop the current violence, but we cannot afford to do anything that would permit the country, after all the efforts the UN has made, to deteriorate to its former conditions where thousands of people are killed or starve at random.' Mr Clinton said US officials were 'looking at our options' in Somalia but had made no decisions. Italy has about 2,400 soldiers in Somalia, but because of disagreement with the US over how the UN mission is run, it plans to move them out of Mogadishu to a post north of the capital.</p>

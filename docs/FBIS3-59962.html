			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On the very day that the Search Bloc shot down Pablo  Escobar, EL TIEMPO and the firm Yankelovich Innova de Colombia  asked Colombians for their opinions on the final episode of this  17-year history. The poll revealed that the majority would have  preferred the voluntary surrender of the most wanted drug  trafficker in the world.    Whereas 76.7 percent of those polled responded affirmatively  to the question, ``Would you have preferred Pablo Escobar's  voluntary surrender?'', only 14.2 percent replied that they  would not.    Of the four cities surveyed (Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and  Barranquilla), the latter had the most responses favoring  surrender, with 82.5 percent affirmative answers. It was  followed by Medellin, with 80 percent; Cali, with 79.7 percent;  and Bogota, with 73.1 percent.    In Medellin and Cali, 11.4 and 8.7 percent, respectively,  answered that they would not have preferred Pablo Escobar's  voluntary surrender.    Nevertheless, the majority of those queried described the  drug trafficker's death as a positive event. This claim was made  by 48.3 percent, compared with 12.4 percent who considered it  negative. It was immaterial to 30.3 percent of those polled.    In Medellin, however, Pablo Escobar's death was immaterial  to  the majority of persons (40.9 percent); whereas 33 percent  regarded the event as positive, and 13.9 percent viewed it as  negative.    In Cali, on the other hand, 48.1 percent replied that it was  positive; 30.4 percent said that it was immaterial to them; and  13.9 percent described it as negative.    As for the possible consequences of Pablo Escobar's death  for  the law and order situation and drug trafficking activity, those  polled thought that there would be very few repercussions.    According to the results, 34.4 percent did not believe that  the law and order situation would be affected, and over half  expected drug trafficking activity to remain the same.    These are the optimists: 29.1 percent thought that the law  and order situation would improve, and 29.3 expected the drug  traffic to decline.    And these are the negativists: 11.5 percent claimed that  drug  trafficking activity would increase, and 23.5 percent expected  the law and order situation to worsen.    Bogota residents, however, were more positive compared with  those of Cali, Barranquilla, and Medellin because there were  more in the nation's capital who thought that the law and order  situation would improve than who expected it to worsen.    In Cali, on the other hand, a larger number of those queried  claimed that the law and order situation would remain the same,  representing 40.5 percent of the responses, while 25.3 percent  expected it to worsen. Only 12.7 percent replied that it would  improve.    In Medellin, 32.2 percent responded that the law and order  situation would remain the same; 30.4 percent expected it to  improve; and 20.9 percent thought that it would worsen.    With regard to drug trafficking activity, in Cali, for  example, 58.2 percent of those polled replied that it would  remain unchanged, whereas 26.6 percent claimed that it would  decline, and only 8.9 percent expected it to increase.    In Medellin, 47.8 percent believed that drug trafficking  activity would remain the same; 25.2 percent expected it to  decline; and only 12.2 percent maintained that it would rise.    In the breakdown by sex, more women than men would have  preferred Pablo Escobar's voluntary surrender. Similarly, more  women than men expected the drug trafficking activity to remain  the same.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poll on Death of Pablo Escobar (in percent)                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |As an event, it is....                                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Positive                              |48.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Immaterial                            |30.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Negative                              |12.4                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |8.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Law and order situation                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not affected                          |34.4                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will improve                          |29.1                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will worsen                           |23.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |13                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug traffic                                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will remain the same                  |52                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will decline                          |29.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will increase                         |11.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |7.2                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Would you have preferred voluntary surrender?                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                                   |76.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                                    |14.2                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Immaterial                            |6.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |3.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: EL TIEMPO - Yankelovich                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Poll Profile </H5>   On 2 and 3 December (the same day and the one following the  death of Pablo Escobar), EL TIEMPO and the firm Yankelovich  Innova de Colombia began taking the public opinion poll.    The four questions were asked, by telephone, of a sample of  500 persons in four cities: Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and  Barranquilla.    The distribution was as follows: Bogota, 250 polled (50  percent); Medellin, 113 polled (23 percent); Cali, 83 polled (17  percent); and Barranquilla, 54 polled (10 percent).    A certain number of surveys were made in each city, based on  the socioeconomic distribution of the Colombian population: 25  percent representing the upper stratum; 60 percent, the middle  stratum; and 25 percent, the lower stratum [as published].    Of those polled, 41.4 percent were of the male sex, and 58.6  percent, female. The majority had completed their studies for a  high school diploma, or had a higher level education.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / PLO says talks will be halted THE Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday all Middle East peace talks would be suspended until Israel reversed the expulsion of more than 400 Palestinians, but Syria argued some negotiations should continue, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said at a meeting of Islamic states in Dakar: 'The solution of the Palestinian deportees will be the assurance of the continuation of peace talks.' Asked if this meant there would be no more talks until the Palestinians returned home, he said: 'Definite.' The PLO delegation gave the same message to an emergency Arab League foreign ministers meeting in Cairo. 'All depends on whether the deportees are repatriated,' said Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, the equivalent of the PLO's foreign minister. 'It would be impossible for the Palestinian delegation to participate in these negotiations so long as the deportees remain deported.' But Syria, which held out for four decades against direct peace talks with Israel until changing tack two years ago, made it clear it saw too much at stake to threaten to pull out now. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, told the Cairo meeting multilateral peace talks could be suspended because Israel stood to gain from them. But, he said, bilateral talks, in which Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians are negotiating treaties with Israel, were too important to Arab interests. Israel expelled the Palestinians to south Lebanon claiming they supported Islamic groups which had killed five Israeli soldiers. Lebanon has refused to accept them.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO VOTE ON PITTS RANCH PROJECT  </P> <P> The Camarillo City Council will decide today whether to approve the first  51-acre phase of a residential and industrial development on the east side of  the city.  </P> <P> The Pardee Co. development, which calls for 126 houses on 31 acres, also  includes a 16-acre park and four acres to be donated to the city, earmarked for  a substation for Ventura County Sheriff's deputies who patrol the city.  </P> <P> Located west of Calleguas Creek and south of Upland Road, the Pardee project is  part of an area known as the Pitts Ranch. The City Council approved an overall  plan last year designating where and when the area would be developed.  </P> <P> The plan calls for rerouting Calleguas Creek, a move that opponents said would  endanger fish and other wildlife. Residents who wanted to preserve the creek  also argued that drainage from any streets built in the area would damage it as  a wildlife habitat.  </P> <P> The council ordered a study on those issues and said it must be completed  before construction begins near the creek. The study will describe how the  stream bed should be protected.  </P> <P> However, Assistant City Manager Larry Davis said Monday that this phase of the  Pitts Ranch plan does not include any acreage near the creek.  </P> <P> The public hearing on the Pardee project will be part of the council's regular  meeting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall.

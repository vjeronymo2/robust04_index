			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A MERRY ROASTING OF 'BETTE AND BOO'  </P> <P> Set designer George Suhayda chooses birthday-party colors for Christopher  Durang's "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre.  Its characters are always celebrating something: a wedding, a birthday, another  dead baby.  </P> <P> Durang's heroine, Bette (Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds) insists on having babies,  even though she and her husband Boo (Bernard Baldan) are RH negative -- or did  the doctor say RH positive? Anyway, Bette knows that it's God's will for her to  be a mother, because she has always liked children better than she liked  people. She wants to have a whole orphanage full of them, each named after a  character in "Winnie-the-Pooh." Wouldn't that be cute?  </P> <P> Since it's Christopher Durang, we can infer an autobiographical element here.  This is his "Long Day's Journey Into Night," an examination of the people who  molded him and the forces that molded them. Only, Durang does it as a cartoon.  </P> <P> Good cartoons exaggerate; they don't lie. "Bette and Boo" touches the lunacy of  "The Bald Soprano," but any veteran of a Catholic household 40 years ago will  recognize some of its little touches. A birthday cake with a cross planted in  the middle of it? Not impossible.  </P> <P> Durang must have smiled when he put that in. (Or maybe director Walter Schoen,  or the designers, or one of the actors, thought of it -- they all seem to have  gone to school with Sister Mary Ignatius.) Durang knows the mind-set of this  household by heart: the piety of people who secretly fear, in some cases  rightly, that they are very vicious.  </P> <P> For instance, the younger sister (Sabrina LaRocca) has picked up the notion  that a saintly person is one who apologizes at all times for everything she  does. This is at once funny and not so funny, and Durang and actress LaRocca  show us both sides of it, touching the not-so-funny part only enough to show  that they recognize it.  </P> <P> Widdowson-Reynolds' Bette almost seems to be getting some kind of revenge on  God, the way she insists on putting Him through the birth process until he gets  it right. Bernard Baldan's absent-minded Boo reacts to this by having another  drink and taking another pledge in front of Father Donnally.  </P> <P> Ah, Father Donnally. You'll love his retreat for "young marrieds," the gist of  which is that they got themselves into this pickle -- don't come to him. Actor  Tom Oleniacz plays the good father with a surprising amount of love, plus a  superfatted Barry Fitzgerald accent. It's clear that everybody in "Bette and  Boo" goes to the movies at least as often as Mass.  </P> <P> Therefore the Church can't entirely be blamed for their problems, although Matt  (Patrick Miller), our young narrator and clearly a spokesman for the  playwright, would dearly love to make that the explanation. Alas, his  grandmother (the wonderful Priscilla Allen) would probably be a monster in any  culture, one of those ever-smiling Moms who give you their shoulder to lean on,  after having carefully kicked out your crutches.  </P> <P> It's not, Durang seems to say, that the Church has screwed up these people.  They were born that way. The Church only keyed into it. Durang may write like  an apostate, but he still believes in original sin, and he still, somewhere,  believes in hope. There's a lovely moment when poor, battered Matt goes to his  disastrous Grandfather (the excellent William Dennis Hunt), and asks: "What  should I do with my life?" It's like Red Riding Hood going to the Wolf for  advice, but the joke is that Grandpa has some: Destroy people, if you feel like  it, but don't try to change them.  </P> <P> The play abounds with destroyed women, particularly Mary Benson as Grandpa's  wife. She takes each of his insults with a little hiccup of merriment, like  Billie Burke -- oh, Dad, you're such a tease, people will think you mean it.  </P> <P> As a family comedy, "Bette and Boo" is one of the darkest ones around, but this  cast serves it up as merrily as ice cream and cookies, letting the viewer say:  Ouch.  </P> <P> There'll be a production later in the summer at the Los Angeles Theatre Center,  but it's hard to imagine it coming closer to the bone -- or the funnybone.  </P> <P>  Plays Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m. Matinees Sundays at 2.

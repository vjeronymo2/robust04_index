			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Fashion: Long, cold search for the perfect winter coat - David Sexton tramps the streets of London in search of happiness 'NOT ONE second passed without his being conscious of the new overcoat on his shoulders and several times he even smiled from inward pleasure. And really, the overcoat's advantages were two-fold: firstly, it was warm; secondly, it made him feel good.' Thus thinks the clerk Akaky Akakievich in the one day of happy possession allowed him in Gogol's story, The Overcoat. 'The whole day was like a triumphant holiday for Akaky Akakievich. He went home in the most jubilant mood, took off his coat, hung it up very carefully and stood there for some time admiring the cloth and the lining. Then, to compare the two, he brought out his old 'dressing-gown', which by now had completely disintegrated. As he examined it he could not help laughing: what a fantastic difference]' Buying a new overcoat remains a challenge. It usually seems easier to let another winter go by without one. I have worn second-hand coats all my life. At school, we clumped about with great self-satisfaction in second-hand military greatcoats, looking like the survivors of a retreat from the Russian front. At university, we preferred shabby, genteel, tweed coats: we all looked like that picture of Auden and Isherwood about to depart for China in 1938. I have accumulated plenty of expensive raincoats (an enveloping one from Nicole Farhi, an Agnes B version of a real Mackintosh) and even a cotton summer coat (from Comme des Garcons, like a design for an ideally rational police force). But no overcoat. This year I went looking. Since an overcoat has to last more than one season, perhaps it is an idea to get a classic English number? Austin Reed in Brompton Road sells the widely available Boss double-breasted coats from Germany - nice enough, in black, at Pounds 325, but nothing special. Its own range is mortifyingly boring. A 'hand-tailored Chester Barrie' cashmere grey double-breasted overcoat, smooth as can be, with flap pockets and buttoned sleeves, is Pounds 1,050. You would instantly look like the sort of businessman I take care to avoid. Marks &amp; Spencer has more to offer. At the Marble Arch store there are two well-calculated bargains. A single breasted, fitted city coat has a button flap, flap pockets, and some padding in the shoulders, but is otherwise plain. Made in Portugal, from 100 per cent wool of some quality, it costs Pounds 130 and is available in sensible dark grey and navy blue. For only Pounds 20 more, M &amp; S offers an Italian-made double-breasted coat, in dark blue and then, bizarrely, in grim green and dull brown ('taupe'). It has a belt and sleeve straps and a plain jacket style lapel. prominent seams radiate from the collar, over some shoulder padding. The material is 70 per cent wool, 20 per cent nylon and 10 per cent cashmere, a blend that gives an impression of luxury rather than the real thing. No doubt it is durable. Both of these coats are great value and they look smart in an anonymous way, particularly if you make sure, as you always should with M &amp; S clothes, to buy them big. But they are never going to put a swagger in your step. So perhaps coats do need a designer's touch? In the Issey Miyake shop, there are a couple of terrific coats. A dark-blue single-breasted coat, with patch pockets, a jacket-type lapel with a big buttonhole in it, a seam down the back and a single button on the sleeve, has no padding and is not particularly long, but it hangs beautifully. It is perfectly simple - but it is thin, made only of wool with 5 per cent nylon and costs Pounds 950. Another coat, double-breasted, longer, in black, is even simpler. It feels great but would not keep you warm and costs Pounds 1,050. These are not clothes for those who have to work. If coats are daunting for buyers, they seem equally daunting for many designers. Joseph stocks only one substantial wool coat - a dull item, single-breasted in a hard wool, by Cacharel, at Pounds 395. Joseph's own unstructured black coat in wool jersey is elegant at Pounds 199. It is not a coat, it is a supreme cardy. Browns, has only two long wool coats in stock, from Romeo Gigli and Byblos. Agnes B's coats are all short. You look silly when you stand up. Margaret Howell was let down by a supplier and has no winter coats for men. Paul Smith has coats which look alluring on the rack. There is a blue single-breasted coat in wool and cashmere, at Pounds 495. But on a human being, it collapses, lacking all articulation. Then there is a long wool 'raincoat' - in a beautiful alpaca, at Pounds 650, in wool Pounds 400. On, it looks like a blanket tentatively trying to be a coat. On the other hand, Paul Smith has a single-breasteed city coat, Crombie-esque, in blue cashmere and wool mix: this is so fitted it constricts you and looks revoltingly spivvy. By now, some ideas are beginning to form. Although I want a coat that is as plain as possible, not excessively interfered with in the cause of fashion, probably only a very good designer is capable of suppplying this. And although I want the coat to be luxurious, I do not want a style that strives to make bankers look established. I decide to try some emporia. Woodhouse has a good range. Its double-breasted black coat is a bargain at Pounds 249. It is well cut, with a belt and straps on the sleeves; it looks good. But, though 100 per cent wool, it is not nice to touch. At the top of their range, Woodhouse has 'white label' Giorgio Armani ('Le Collezioni'). This is what I have been looking for: a double-breasted long coat, in a dark blue, made of soft wool. It is quite plain: three buttons either side, no buttons on the sleeves, no belt or straps. There are patch pockets and undisguised seams, and the quality of manufacture looks excellent. It costs Pounds 499. Woodhouse does not have my size. I visit Emporio Armani. Emporio Armani coats, at Pounds 450 for the single-breasted and Pounds 395 for the double, are only marginally cheaper than the 'Collezioni' lines but fabric feels much harder, and the cut does little to rectify that. In the actual Giorgio Armani shop, there are only a few 'white label' coats. The 'black label' are made of sumptuous materials (70 per cent wool, 30 per cent cashmere or 60 per cent wool and 40 per cent angora) and they are admirably cut, too. But these are much more formal and fitted and cost Pounds 895 or Pounds 995 or more. I end up where the more sensible might have begun, in Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Harrods has quite a small range of coats (unappealing items by Valentino and Byblos) but it includes Armani Collezioni coats. There is an excellent dark grey double-breasted version, in a harder, tweedier wool / cashmere / nylon mix, at Pounds 575. it does not have the soft hang of the Woodhouse version. There are several other versions - even one in cashmere, more formally cut, at Pounds 875. But not the coat I want. The Harvey Nichols basement is surprisingly rewarding. You can see more designers more quickly here than anywhere else. I try coats by Dolce &amp; Gabbano (Pounds 725, a lush material absurdly cut into a mock-poor version of a hand-me-down) by Montana (Pounds 535, all superfluous flaps and militaristic trimmings, but a stylish swing to it) and Byblos (Pounds 456, a pastiche army greatcoat, festoooned with brass buttons, again of little charm for one who wore real army surplus for years.). Happily, Harvey Nichols stocks a generous range of Armani diffusion coats. And there is the one I want, in my size, and at Pounds 495 marginally cheaper than it would be at Woodhouse. How far this can really be considered an Armani coat, rather than just a standard piece of well-made Italian tailoring adorned with the great man's label, I do not know. But I do know that it has had the same effect on me that Akaky Akakievich's had on him. I hope I can avoid his fate. His coat was stolen on the evening he got it. He died of chagrin and spent the after life as a ghost, ripping coats from people's shoulders.</p>

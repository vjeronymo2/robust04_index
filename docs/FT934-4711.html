			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Field grows by 14% to Pounds 6.8m Field Group, the folding carton company which floated on the stock market in July, yesterday reported interim results showing a 14.4 per cent rise in pro-forma pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.8m - in line with expectations. The interim dividend is set at 2.3p, an 8 per cent rise on the dividend the group indicated it would have paid had it been public last year. The shares rose 8p to 273p, compared to the float price of 250p. Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said that the high level of promotional activity by customers such as supermarkets - which adversely affects Field's business by shortening runs - had not eased as hoped. Mareen, the Belgian subsidiary, had been affected by the economic slowdown in continental Europe, although it had recently won two new contracts worth Pounds 1.5m. However, the group's Portsmouth factory had beaten expectations on its tobacco packaging machine, installed in February. Mr Gilchrist said recovery in the UK was still slow and fragile, but there were signs of improvement further ahead. For instance, orders for Easter egg packaging next year were not imaginative, but designs for Easter 1995 now being discussed were revealing a greater desire for innovation from customers suggesting, he said, 'marketeers are less constrained by accountants'. Pressure on selling prices had been balanced by raw material price reductions and through cost cutting. Turnover growth in the half to October 3 was 10.5 per cent to Pounds 75m, although volume growth was higher than that. Operating profits rose 10.7 per cent to Pounds 6.97m, including Pounds 205,000 from the packaging business bought from Boots in July. Pro-forma interest charges fell to Pounds 176,000 (Pounds 360,000). The tax charge for the year is estimated at 26 per cent. Earnings per share were 8.5p (7.5p) on a pro-forma basis. Despite the Pounds 5.7m acquisition of the Boots business, net debt was Pounds 1m.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Henderson Administration down 14.5% PRE-TAX PROFITS at Henderson Administration, the fund management group, fell 14.5 per cent from Pounds 17m to Pounds 14.6m in the year to March 31. However, the final dividend edges up to 29.5p, making a total of 42p (41p). Earnings per share fell to 45.74p (54.35p). The group acquired the Touche Remnant fund management company during the year, helping funds under management rise to about Pounds 11.5bn. Touche Remnant made a Pounds 1.1m contribution to operating profits, although after deducting costs, the net contribution was Pounds 764,000. The cost of acquiring Touche Remnant was Pounds 43.4m, including expenses. After allowing for the effects of a pension fund holiday and for the costs of integrating the businesses, Henderson wrote off Pounds 24.4m of goodwill against its assets. As a result, shareholders funds fell to Pounds 36.8m, from Pounds 60.2m at the end of March 1992. The main fall in profits occurred in the first half when stock markets were weak. However, second half profits, at Pounds 8.1m, were also down from the Pounds 8.2m recorded in the second half of the previous year. The group suffered some further losses of pension fund clients, reflecting disappointing investment performance in the late 1980s. However, Henderson said that its performance had recently improved, although it was 'still too early' to say whether it had seen the end of client losses. The acquisition of Touche Remnant turned the group into the UK's largest investment trust manager and there will be a marketing relaunch this summer. The range of unit trusts is set to be rationalised, with fund mergers expected to reduce the number of trusts from 35 to 21. Operating profits were Pounds 9.66m (Pounds 10.1m) and interest income fell from Pounds 6.91m to Pounds 5.48m due to lower interest rates and the loss of cash spent on the acquisition. There was a loss from associated business of Pounds 585,000, mainly reflecting costs at Seligman Henderson, the US venture. See Lex</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Israel and China aim to boost trade ISRAEL and China yesterday initialled a trade agreement Israeli officials hope will facilitate increased exports of such items as electronic goods and farm equipment, Tony Walker writes from Jerusalem. The pact follows the setting-up of formal relations in January and comes amid increased trade contacts between the two countries. Mr Zvi Koren, director-general of Israel's industry and trade ministry, said the protocol would enable Israel to 'enter the Chinese market directly and smoothly, without barriers'. Israel's 'visible' exports to China are expected to reach Dollars 30m this year, against imports of Dollars 4m. Israeli companies have also been involved in selling military equipment and know-how to China. Much of Israel's trade with China has been routed through third countries. Mr Koren said a 'co-ordinating committee' would start to deal with such issues as investment insurance, double taxation and copyright. El Al, Israel's national carrier, will begin direct once-weekly flights from Tel Aviv to Beijing next month, it said yesterday.</p>

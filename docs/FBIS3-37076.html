			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Larisa Lazar for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 10 Feb -- The current socioeconomic crisis in  the republic is a direct consequence of destroying integration  processes in the economy, says a statement which the Presidium  of the Belarusian Council of Ministers adopted today. In this  connection the document says that the "consistent and  well-thought- out moves by the republic's government aimed at a  close economic union with Russia mean, above all, a policy of  common sense, socio- economic stabilization and overcoming the  crisis".    As is known, an indefinite political strike is planned for  15  February. Its participants intend to demand the government's  resignation, holding early elections to the Supreme Soviet and  electing a government of national confidence. The Presidium of  the Council of Ministers describes these demands as "political  adventurism and violation of the constitution" and as an attempt  by certain political forces "to drive the republic to chaos and  to put it on the verge of civil confrontation".    "Calls for a political strike and social disobedience are  nothing else but an attempt to eliminate the legally elected  power," the statement says. The document also says that the  sovereignty and independence of the state are being built on the  basis of a solid economic foundation. The foundation cannot be  laid by internal self-isolation and by trying to fence ourselves  off from neighboring states with whom we have not only common  history in the past and present but in the future as well.    The statement says "both fraternal peoples, close in their  spirit, culture and history, equally need social stability at  present. The guarantor of this stability is the economic union  of the two states. The two states have natural interest in each  other and will not allow any attempts to create political and  human barriers between them."</p>

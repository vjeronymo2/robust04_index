			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Boardroom imports down under - A wave of American executive appointments in Australia Australia has often been called the 51st state - a lighthearted reference to the proliferation of Hollywood films, fast-food restaurants and baseball caps. But now, at a rather more fundamental level, is American management culture infiltrating Australian boardrooms? The thought has been prompted by a spate of top executive appointments at some of Australia's biggest companies. Last month, for example, the Australian Mutual Provident, the nation's largest life insurer and a pillar of its institutional investment community, named George Trumbull as its new chief executive. Trumbull comes to the AMP from Cigna, the giant Philadelphia-based insurer, where he was president of the individual financial services division and former investment chief. Last year Bob Joss, a former Wells Fargo executive, was appointed to head Westpac, the oldest of Australia's 'big four' commercial banks. In 1992, Telecom, the large state-owned telecommunications company, recruited Frank Blount from AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, as chief executive. This importation has seeped down to lower management levels, too. Last month, for example, Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers, appointed Dennis Eck to run its supermarkets division. Eck is a former executive vice-president of American Stores and, more recently, worked for California-based Vons Supermarkets. But despite these eye-catching moves, executive search firms and management consultants remain divided about how pervasive the importation of US talent actually is. Geoff Morgan, at Morgan &amp; Banks, the executive recruitment specialist, describes the development as 'a definite trend', pointing out that the Trumbull/Joss/Blount appointments were all the results of full-blown searches conducted outside Australia. He thinks the pattern stems partly from a desire for the general management skills and objectivity which US executives can offer, and partly from the need for sector-specific experience. The latter element, he predicts, will mean that the influx continues, especially in service industries where 'Australian companies don't have a great reputation', and in high-tech fields. This view seems well supported by Coles: it lists four specific skills where it reckoned Eck had an edge, ranging from inventory management to technological expertise, especially in supplier relationships. The Australian retailer notes, too, that it has a major refurbishment programme getting under way, and that Eck has handled more than 1,000 store overhauls. But David Benn, managing director of consultants Korn/Ferry in Sydney - whose strong American accent belies 20 years in Australia - reckons that the development 'is not nearly as pervasive as the headline-grabbing stuff suggests'. For the most part, he suggests, US executives are being used as trouble-shooters. 'I don't think anyone has had the brief: 'Go find an American'. It (such appointments) tends to happen in situations where there is a well-defined problem, and all other bets are off,' he says. Telecom, he points out, was (and is) facing the loss of its protected monopoly position. Westpac, having called itself Australia's world bank, had strayed badly at home and shareholder disgruntlement was swelling. Australia's insurance sector faces major issues like the merits of demutualisation and increased competition. But at least some board directors, who have the formal say over such appointments, seem to have been wooed by the promise of broad management objectivity. One AMP director notes that the insurer did first consider an internal promotion, but eventually shortlisted two candidates from outside Australia. 'We decided it was better to select someone who was unencumbered by AMP baggage', he says. So if these are the expectations, are they realistic? Where US executives have already been installed, there are some clear signs that international perspective has quickly come into play. Most of the recent US appointments, for example, have put a major emphasis on raising service levels. Joss wants the bank to take McDonald's as its management model, and emulate the US hamburger chain's route to consistent quality. Reaching such a target, he has acknowledged, implies a strong training focus. He has also stressed the need for a more targeted rewarding of performance. Meanwhile, Telecom, which remains state-owned and therefore hugely political, says that greater use is now being made of techniques like international 'benchmarking', especially in finance. But there also are some signs that cultural differences - notably, Australia's strong egalitarian beliefs - may not make for the easiest transition of ideas. Already, executive remuneration is in the spotlight, and the packages offered to the new breed of executives - whether home-grown, like Tony Berg at Boral, or imported, like Joss - have been much-debated. On the plus side, institutional shareholders, anxious to lift their profile in the wake of the 1980s 'entrepreneurial' excesses, say they are supportive, provided the structure of an option package is 'appropriate'. The Australian Investment Managers Group is currently drawing up guidelines on the subject and on corporate governance matters generally. The throwaway remark of one mining industry manager, asked about a recent non-Australian appointment in his own company, seems to summarise the attitudes which the stepped-up executive culture has yet to alter. 'We haven't caught the Bob Joss syndrome if that's what you mean,' he comments. 'My family has been shareholders of Westpac for years and all I can say is he'd better be worth it.'</p>

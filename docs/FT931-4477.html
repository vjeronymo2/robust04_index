			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / NatWest's five-week delay on card error NATIONAL Westminster Bank admitted yesterday it had waited five weeks after learning that it had overcharged several thousand credit card customers before taking action. The error, which resulted in payments being credited to the wrong accounts among 15,000 World Wildlife Fund Visa card customers, was discovered in late January. But NatWest said yesterday an official in its credit card services unit had decided only to adjust the accounts of individual customers who noticed a discrepancy and complained. Only after one customer contacted a more senior manager did the bank decide to contact and compensate the remaining card holders who were affected. NatWest has launched an internal investigation and is expected to determine in a few days whether there will be any disciplinary action. Mr Trevor Blackler, general manager of UK branch business, said: 'We made a mistake in how we handled the problem. We are very concerned about giving good service to our customers and we will be contacting all who are affected to apologise and put things right.' The problem occurred after NatWest decided to withdraw its WWF affinity card in late December and convert the accounts into ordinary Visa cards. A human error in merging the accounts meant that payments from some WWF card holders in January were credited to the accounts of other Visa card customers by mistake. The procedure which led to the error was changed before February bills were sent out, although the bills themselves were not corrected. The bank was able to identify the problem because some of the account numbers to which funds were channelled did not exist and were rejected by the computer. NatWest said 'a significant number' of customers had complained about inaccurate statements, and their accounts had already been adjusted. It has now brought in a special team to its credit card unit to identify all other customers affected and arrange compensation. Any customer who had paid too much interest because payments had not been credited for January would be receiving a reimbursement and possibly additional compensation. Customers who were incorrectly credited with others' payments will have that money removed but will not be expected to contribute any additional interest they should have paid. NatWest last year alerted thousands of cardholders to errors after software was changed.</p>

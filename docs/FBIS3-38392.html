			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Henning von Lewies </F> by news moderator Karin Beindorf -- live]    [Excerpt] [Beindorf] A new law to reduce the number of  asylum-seekers in Germany can only work if the neighboring  countries cooperate. Poland, for example, was raised to the  level of a safe third-country; since then, refugees, who had  crossed Poland on their way to Germany, had to expect to be  returned to Poland as soon as they arrived here. However, the  agreement with Poland has obviously not produced the result Bonn  expected. Instead of the approximately 10,000 who should have  been returned each year, the number was just somewhat higher  than 3,000, which has, allegedly, created some ill-feelings.    Federal Interior Minister Kanther returned today from  Warsaw,  where he had met with his counterpart and with the Polish  president. He stopped in Rostock Warnemuende on his way back to  Bonn.    I now have my colleague Henning von Lewies on the telephone  from there. Mr. Von Lewies, what did Kanther have to say about  the German-Polish talks, or has he maintained his silence?    [Von Lewies] Mrs. Beindorf, Kanther said one could not speak  of ill-feelings, and that the media played up the affair. He  said the talks with his Polish partners in Warsaw on various  issues were excellent, and that they included topics such as  cooperation in the struggle against crime and the return of  cultural objects. So, as he claimed, there were no ill-feelings  or irritation. He added, however, that there is much need to  take action. Contacts between the border organs should be  improved. It is intended to exchange liaison officials, which  suggests that things at the German-Polish border are not as they  should be.    In addition, German equipment should be provided for the  Polish police and border security organs, as was agreed in the  1993 treaty. This is, so to speak, the result of that visit to  Warsaw.    [Beindorf] Did Kanther comment on the numbers that I  mentioned at the beginning -- the 10,000 Bonn expected, compared  to the only 3,000 refugees who were actually returned?    [Von Lewies] No, he did not say a word. He downplayed the  commotion and said the affair was played up by the media.  [passage omitted]</p>

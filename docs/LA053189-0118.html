			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> One local banking company revived by a cash infusion 18 months ago is  transforming itself into a privately held corporation to eliminate the costs  associated with maintaining a public company.  </P> <P> John Wertin, who owns 91% of San Clemente Bancorp, plans to pick up the rest of  the shares in an offering that would give remaining shareholders $1.25 a share.  </P> <P> Wertin picked up 81% of the company for $1 a share, or $1.5 million, in late  1987, just as the company was stemming its losses at its Bank of San Clemente  subsidiary. He picked up an additional 10% by assuming about $700,000 in debt  to previous directors, who had tried to bail the firm out with personal loans  to the company. Wertin converted the debt to equity by taking the additional  stock.  </P> <P> The company continued to struggle in the first half of 1988 but ended the year  with net income of $156,000. In the first quarter this year, the company posted  net income of $153,000 and had assets of $42.4 million at the end of March,  according to Michael Dunahee, the company's president.  </P> <P> Wertin, the company's chairman, also is president of Pacific Co.  </P></p>

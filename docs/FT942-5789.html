			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (7): Flair, boldness and originality - Fashion houses win a growing reputation Belgium is best known for beer, frites, chocolate - and fashion. Next to the old Belgian brand-names of Stella Artois and Cote d'Or, a host of new names is making its mark in the international fashion world. Dries Van Noten, Anne Demeulemeester, Dirk Van Saene and Walter Van Beirendonck may not be as big as Chanel and Yves St Laurent, or as famous as Armani and Lagerfeld; but their labels are much sought after among the cognoscenti and word is spreading fast. The new Belgian designers can be spotted today in stores ranging from Bergdorf Goodman in New York and Nieman Marcus in Los Angeles to Whistles and Joseph in London, Joyce in Hong Kong, and to outlets in an increasingly fashion-conscious Tokyo. Back at home, Queen Fabiola has become an ambassador for the Belgian fashion industry, sporting Watelet dresses, Strelli coats, Marie Storms jewellery and, always, the Delvaux handbag. The rise of contemporary Belgian fashion began in the early 1980s in Antwerp, at the Academie Royale, the town's now famous art school. It was driven by a small group of talented, avant garde and ambitious students who became known as the Antwerp Six. The Belgian government helped to promote these designers not through direct financial aid but through a competition known as the Golden Spindle. Originally set up to give a shot-in-the-arm to the ailing textile industry, the award acted as a magnet for designer talent, helping young cash-strapped artists to forge an image. Still, these were hard times. Dirk Van Saene recalls how they all shared the same van for a fashion show in London. Today, the collective approach is out. Each designer wants to be treated as an individual with a distinct label. Martin Margiela is typical of the contemporary Belgian style, with his unfinished edges, asymetrical hemlines and recycled material. This deconstructionist mode marks a clear break from the glitz and glamour of the 1980s and reflects a more restrained style for the politically chic, environmentally correct 1990s. Dirk Van Saene, who has had his ups and downs in the volatile fashion business, believes the market is developing in two directions. In one corner stand the large multi-label department stores who can be expected to dominate the market in terms of volume; but there will always be plenty of room and profits for the specialist stores with the small exclusive labels. The public is always looking for something exclusive and will always be willing to pay for it, he says. That does not mean that customers want to wrap themselves in the excesses of the catwalk; rather they are looking for something simple, serene and understated. Van Saene's latest collection is simple and elegant, reminiscent of the early 1960s and Jackie Onassis. It is hand-finished in luxurious materials - and expensive. With only 16 clients, he estimates that he generated a turnover of around BF 6m. He relies on ateliers in the Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp region, all paid on a piece-work basis; but his textiles come from Ireland, Scotland, Italy and France. Walter Van Beirendonck found it impossible to produce his line in Belgium, preferring instead the more sophisticated technical skills of northern Italy. Seated in the Academie Royale overseeing a student show earlier this month, Van Beirendonck cut an imposing figure with his shaven head, beard and fingers armour-plated in silver. His approach to the market is two-pronged. First, there is a commercial line called W. &amp; L. T. - code for Wild and Lethal Trash. His publicity states flatly: 'WALT is colour. WALT is style.' Translated, this means affordable, available and adaptable - the Walt fashion philosophy. In practice, it means fun clothes for the street: T-shirts for BFr 1,500 (Dollars 45); sweaters for BFr 5,000. All are produced and distributed by Mustang Italia, part of the German Mustang Group. Second, Van Beirendonck has for the past three years run a separate collection of knitwear which draws its inspiration from Naive Art. The style is bright and humorous. Dresses and sweaters range from BFr 15,000 to BFr 35,000. Sold world-wide, he claims these high priced items are in enough demand to be recession-proof. Traditional Belgian industry has not been slow to spot the demand for avant garde Belgian products. In 1985, Monarca, an old Belgian family shoe company, adopted Dirk Bikkemberg who had just won the Golden Spindle competition. Today, Monarca produces around 15,000 pairs of Bikkemberg shoes annually from its factory in Lier, just outside Antwerp. The shoes are made of Belgian and Italian leather, for distribution in markets ranging from Switzerland to the US. Bikkemberg says its complete line of shoes, knitwear, clothing and accessories generated BFr 25m-30m last year. Such talk of facts and figures are anathema to Gerald Watelet, the self-styled 'imposter' on the Belgium fashion scene. This youthful, audacious 30-year-old from southern Belgium knows little of art schools, or the deconstructionist mode; but he has made his name on sheer talent - and an unusual partnership with a Flemish architect called Norbert Norman. Watelet was brought up in Namur, Wallonia. In line with his parents' wishes, he steered clear of the fashion world and trained in the hotel business. At 21, he became the youngest maitre d'hotel in Belgium. But before long he switched direction, to indulge his lifelong passion for elegance. He and Norman opened a haute couture salon in Brussels. Today, located in the prestigious Avenue Louise, they sell 80 per cent of their products to Belgians. Their clientele are predominately working women aged 40 to 65 seeking a simple, timeless mode. For Watelet, couture is not just a fashion show; it is about cut, and what people can wear in practice. Watelet and his team exemplify French fantasy and Flemish business acumen in action and stress timely deliveries, superior quality and high visibility. It looks like a winning combination - and it explains why Belgian fashion is here to stay.</p>

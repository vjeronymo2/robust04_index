			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mladen Bosnjak report on news conference by the assembly of </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats in Sarajevo on 7 February -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Bosnjak] The assembly of the Croats of  Bosnia-Herzegovina was successfully organized and went well.  Some 595 participants were invited, 35 of whom were guests.  Some 362 participants took part in the session here in  Sarajevo, 26 of the invited participants were in Zenica on a  direct telephone line. Twenty-two participants arrived from  Zagreb, four from Germany, and four from the United States.    The assembly adopted several documents -- the decision on  the  negotiations for the solution to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the decision on the participation of Croats  in the representative bodies and bodies of authority, and the  declaration of the Council. A Croatian National Council was also  formed as the executive body of the assembly of the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The assembly presented a completely concrete proposal for  the  future organization of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  assembly participants claim that this proposal does not support  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary republic, that it is not at the  detriment of the Serbs in the territorial sense, that it annuls  all the excuses the aggressor found for carrying out the  aggression, and that it offers a territorial organization that  enables the return of the refugees and the evicted people.    [Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member] Ivo Komsic, chairman  of the Croatian National Council, told the correspondents about  the territorial organization of the republic, the structuring of  the state authority -- starting from communes, to cantons, and  possible republics -- and the necessary federal authorities.    [Komsic] The Croatian assembly that took place yesterday  adopted a concept of a reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which could remove the causes of the war, which could remove the  reasons behind the conquests of other people's territories --  that is, the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory -- as the fundamental  cause of the war. This map shows that. These numbers depict  these territorial units in a three-level federal state -- as we  propose for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which represent full  autonomous units or cantons, and they would be directly  connected with each other through the Federal Assembly. The  authorities would, therefore, be unified but broken down into 17  autonomous units, while Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka as  extra territorial status as the most important and largest  cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with an ethnically mixed  population.    What is important to say here is that we presented this  proposal of a three-level federal state as the grounds for  another option that could be discussed during further  negotiations, and that is to reorganize the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina into a federal state with four levels of  authority. We have left this proposal open for the simple  reason that we want to respect the positive results of the  negotiating processes on Bosnia-Herzegovina so far. [sentence as  heard]    [Bosnjak] As for the legitimacy of the Croatian assembly and  the Croatian National Council, Bozidar Matic said the following:    [Matic] In times of war, assemblies such as this one cannot  meet the strict requirements for legitimacy as set out in times  of peace, when deputies are counted for a quorum, and so on. I  know there will be questions as to how legal this Croatian  National Council is and the way it was elected, and I would like  to say one thing: Not one party that won power at the last  elections had the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its  program.    Therefore, whoever and however elected -- if he works on the  partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country -- he has lost  all legitimacy.    [Bosnjak] [passage omitted on the Croatian Academy of Arts  and Sciences and its Bosnia-Herzegovina counterpart demanding  end of war and respect of human rights] The correspondents did  not have many questions, but they all referred to the proposal  for the territorial organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  most important of the replies is the one that contained the hope  and conviction that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly will support  at today's session the proposal of the assembly of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, which would strengthen the  negotiating positions in Geneva of those who support a united  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Teymuraz Mamaladze report: "Black Sea Fleet Incident Could </F> Escalate Into Armed Conflict"]    [Text] The much-loved naval game of tug-of-war has  currently taken on threatening overtones in Crimea and the Black  Sea Fleet. The style of the reporting on the attempted detention  of the hydrographic vessel Cheleken would have been reminiscent  of a pirate novel -- had not means been used which were not even  dreamed of in the days of the "Jolly Roger." The missile-armed  Su-15 ground-attack aircraft scrambled by the Ukrainian Air  Defense forces and the high-speed cutters of the Ukrainian  Border Guards which tracked the ship belong more to a modern  armed conflict -- which is all the more likely because a Black  Sea Fleet battle group came out to escort the Cheleken.    This time, it seems, God was merciful, or some naval  official  had second thoughts. Talks began in Kiev. It blew over. Will  it blow over the next time, when it is not a taut rope but  someone's nerves that crack?    This protracted Black Sea tug-of-war contest, in which the  "teams" are battling for the prize of the property and status of  the Black Sea Fleet units, is accompanied by an exhausting war  of nerves, largely provoked by the sides' press centers and the  mass media. Those who claim that unchecked and often concocted  information (disinformation) works like a slow-burning fuse are  absolutely right. As Emil Pain, member of the Presidential  Council, stated in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent,  the appearance in the mass media of Black Sea Fleet situation  reports that often fail to accord with reality excessively  aggravates the situation. The demand that any report from the  region be carefully checked out is undoubtedly correct. The  trouble, though, is that the speed at which "disinformation" can  be verified may not coincide with the firing speed of multiple  rocket launchers.    The sides are disseminating mutually exclusive versions of  events. It seems as though these versions, numbered with  different figures and painted in different national colors, are  becoming a kind of infection typical of this time of conflict.  The news fabric is being woven out of scraps, each of which has  its own message at odds with the others. Public opinion is  disoriented. These clashing versions are striking the spark that  may cause the explosion, after which people will no longer ask  who gave the order. Before that happens, we should ask who is  fabricating these explosive reports and to what end.    The incident of the Cheleken and the 318th Division of ships  of the Black Sea Fleet reserve prompts us for the umpteenth time  to consider the existence of a shadowy influence on big-time  politics. After all, it is quite obvious that this latest  "contest" was organized in circumvention and behind the backs of  the top "referees" -- the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, and  their agreement to refrain from unilateral action over the Black  Sea Fleet. People have tried to cut down with the ax of shadowy  schemes what was written with the pen in Yalta and Massandra.  As one learned expert on the question has written, there still  exists -- aside from the patent, obvious, and even specially  presented picture of political life -- another, hidden intrigue  of events that is inaccessible to the public gaze and controls.    Which in this instance is deadly dangerous. In this  connection, here is another statement from a man to whom the  dangerous games over the Black Sea Fleet are of interest since  they pose a most serious threat to general peace: "A conflict  between Russia and Ukraine could make events in Bosnia look like  a Sunday-school picnic."

An oil contract is to be  signed as soon as possible! -- this was the gist of the remarks  made by Geydar Aliyev when he assembled the entire leadership of  the State Oil Company a few days ago. The document signed here  has given the go-ahead to all of the State Oil Company's  proposals regarding the basic areas covered by talks with the  BP-Statoil consortium, the U.S. companies Amoco, Unocal,  Pennsoil, Remco, and MacDermott, and the Turkish company Tekis  Petroleum. The Azerbaijani company has been empowered to  prepare and conclude a contract with them.    Recently the fate of this contract has hung by a thread on a  number of occasions. Following the change of government last  June the Azerbaijani Government suspended the signing of this  document, which caused confusion among the Western partners.  But Geydar Aliyev explained away this step very simply:  Azerbaijan is not rejecting the plan to develop the oil fields  jointly, it merely wants everything to be done in a civilized  manner with due account taken of national interests.    This may well have been an unpopular step. In a difficult  situation when there was political infighting in the republic,  and when it was suffering one military reversal after another at  the front, this course of action paid no dividends to Geydar  Aliyev, who had only just come to power. Articles started to  appear in the world press, even in Turkey, that were sharply  critical of Azerbaijan's position on the oil question.  According to opposition forecasts, the republic ran the risk of  advertising itself as an unreliable partner. But the new  leadership stood firm and insisted on the need for a second  expert analysis of the terms of this contract which was causing  so much fuss.    During its work, the independent expert commission reviewed  the percentage share of the anticipated profit in Azerbaijan's  favor. The experts announced that they had managed to win back  several tens of billions of dollars from the foreign partners.  Admittedly, this did not happen without a great deal of huffing  and puffing: The leader of the expert group was accused by a  number of publications of extorting money from the Western  firms, but the affair did not receive wide coverage, the talks  continued, and all the indications are that they reached a  successful conclusion.    A number of analysts are linking this surprising turn of  events and the hasty conclusion of a contract with Geydar  Aliyev's current visit to Turkey and his upcoming visit to  Britain. Both these states are keen to develop Azerbaijani oil.  Because, however economically interesting this contract proves  to be for the republic, it is at the same time a powerful  political trump card in Azerbaijan's hand which could  potentially play a major role in establishing very close  contacts with influential Western countries. Azerbaijan can  thus provide itself with strong protectors and, most important  of all, guarantors of the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Not yet the death knell: The emergence of global investment banks leaves a role for smaller City institutions At one stroke, the rules changed this week for the merchant banks and stockbrokers of the City of London. SG Warburg, the UK institution with the most serious ambitions to compete alongside the dominant US firms as a global investment bank, abandoned its independence. It announced that it intends to merge with the US bank Morgan Stanley to create a stronger global force. If Britain's flagship investment bank makes such a decision, what hope is there for the others? The City of London, with its ingrained habits and rules for capital raising that encourage the continued separation of merchant banks and stockbrokers, has outlasted many farewells before. Institutions such as Cazenove &amp; Co, the stockbroker, and Schroders, the old-established merchant bank, were not given long to live in their traditional form when the City was deregulated in the 1986 Big Bang. They are still there, arguably more successful than ever in their old incarnations. Yet the shock of Warburg's decision to merge was still being absorbed yesterday, as bankers and brokers pondered whether it finally marks the demise of the old City. Many believe that two waves of rationalisation will combine to sweep away the past. One will be the integration of remaining merchant banks and brokers into the combined investment banks of the American model. The other will be a renewed push by foreign banks to snap up the remaining brokers. 'We are coming to the second stage of Big Bang now. Warburg has started a bandwagon rolling, and it will roll to the end,' says the chairman of one broker. 'It is difficult to conclude anything other than the process of rationalisation is going to go further,' says the head of a merchant bank. Bankers question the future of brokers such as Cazenove and Smith New Court that are not owned by merchant banks, as well as medium-tier merchant banks like Kleinwort Benson and Barings. The City itself is unlikely to be damaged by Warburg's move. Indeed the merger, if anything, will reinforce London's position as Europe's financial centre. Morgan Stanley has already built up a substantial operation in London since it opened an office in 1977, with 2,000 of its 2,200 European employees based at its Canary Wharf office in the former docklands area. Yet the decision to merge with Warburg means a recognition that it needs to reinforce its London base even more strongly. The move follows the decision by Deutsche Bank, the largest German bank, to base investment banking operations in London and partly integrate its operations with those of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank it acquired five years ago. Despite the claim of Frankfurt, many European banks have now recognised London's lead in equity raising and in trading new products such as derivatives - instruments that derive their value from that of an underlying asset or index. 'It is good for the City because it reinforces the moves by a number of people to commit capital and people to London. From that point of view, hurrah,' says one banker. This means that the evolving global investment banks are increasingly operating out of three centres: New York, London and Tokyo. The leading players are the US banks - known as 'bulge bracket' firms - such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, which have largely built up their operations in London and Asian centres such as Hong Kong organically. Other emerging competitors are large commercial banks such as Deutsche Bank and the big three Swiss banks. As London has grown into a more international centre, a presence in other markets for UK banks has become more important. In the first 11 months of this year, Pounds 59.7bn of shares from abroad were traded in London, compared to Pounds 48.1bn of UK and Irish equities. 'This merger symbolises an international financial services industry based in one country, but with a smaller domestic business,' says Mr Richard Weir, director general of the Institutional Fund Managers Association. The banks that have adapted best to compete internationally are those which have integrated stockbroking with traditional merchant banking, as Warburg did at the time of the Big Bang. It bought two stockbrokers and combined them with a jobber - the firms that used to buy and sell shares wholesale - to create a single investment bank. After that, it started a gradual expansion in Asia and the US, opening 39 operations in 23 countries. Other UK firms have become international investment banks, but on a more modest scale than Warburg. Kleinwort Benson has capitalised on its research skills in the electricity industry to help it win mandates for privatisations around the world. It has managed to sell these shares in the US, despite a relatively modest sales staff of around 20. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, also has global ambitions. Yet despite all the pressures on the medium-sized banks and brokers of the City, many have survived remarkably well in the eight years since Big Bang. There is still a significant number of traditional merchant banks - which concentrate on providing advice. Some firms have stuck to their roots, but tried to expand overseas. Examples are Robert Fleming, which has a partnership in Asia with Jardine Matheson, and Barings, which also has a strong Asia business. 'Many companies are suspicious of the conflicts of interest that can arise at an integrated bank that offers both broking and advice,' says one banker. As well as using a merchant bank for advice on matters such as takeovers of other companies, many companies also value having an independent broker of their shares. This allows them to get an independent view of the pricing of share issues. The firm which has gained most strongly from this conservatism is Cazenove. Even more important for the survival of traditional firms have been the rules governing the raising of equity capital in London, which are out of line with practice in the US and continental Europe. The most significant of these is pre-emptive rights - rules requiring companies wishing to raise equity capital to offer new shares to their existing shareholders first. This means that UK companies have to use UK brokers with good access to investing institutions such as pension funds to distribute new shares. The fees for these rights issues have remained impervious to competition: all advisers and brokers earn fees of  1/2 and  1/4 per cent of the value of a rights issue regardless of the quality of the issuer, or prevailing market conditions. These fixed fees have helped to cushion the business of the niche firms that specialise in them, and there has been little need for firms that excel at UK corporate broking to build up an extensive distribution network abroad. The Warburg-Morgan Stanley merger is likely to put more pressure on some of London's traditions. Warburg has already adopted US methods of canvassing institutional investors to fix the price of an equity issue - known as 'book-building' - in some international issues. Beyond this, regulators such as the Office of Fair Trading and the Securities and Investments Board are starting to question whether some London traditions are fair, further encouraging a shift of methods. Moreover, the owners of UK shares are becoming more international. Recent figures show that the fastest-growing category of shareholder on the UK market is foreign shareholders, particularly from the US. This may encourage companies to hire advisers who can not only help them distribute shares to their traditional UK shareholders, but widen their investor base abroad. Firms with an exclusively or largely domestic orientation may have more difficulty getting business. But the squeeze may be more drawn-out than some suggested in the wake of the Warburg move. UK companies show enormous loyalty towards advisers, even when their broker or merchant bank has been acquired by a foreign bank. One example was the former broker Phillips &amp; Drew, which was acquired by Union Bank of Switzerland. 'I have always been struck by the way their clients stuck with them after the acquisition,' says an executive at a rival investment bank. Furthermore, many of the medium-sized banks and brokers are under less pressure than Warburg because they do not have the expensive international network. Warburg made only a Pounds 5.5m profit on investment banking operations in the first half of the year because financial markets were weak and it could not pull in its horns as easily as some of the smaller, nimble players. It also had to operate in many developed countries where margins have been squeezed by competition. Smaller firms that do not have to operate in all global centres do not need such high costs. This means that they may be able to ride out the current weakness in markets and wait for an expansion in better times. Many medium-sized merchant banks have grown through a range of niche operations such as trading the debt of less developed countries rather than competing head-on with US firms. They can shed or grow these operations depending on how profitable they are. 'It is not necessarily size and size alone that makes you successful in this business. You can operate with a few people producing clever ideas instead of having a massive overhead,' says the head of one merchant bank. Furthermore, a smaller merchant bank may be able to offer services to small and medium-sized companies that do not want to pay the large fees associated with US firms. Such fees are required to support large number of employees and high salaries. These trends may mean that instead of heralding the end for many of the merchant banks and brokers of the old City, the Warburg merger may simply mean a more stratified market. At the top will be global players such as Warburg-Morgan Stanley, competing across the world with the likes of Goldman Sachs. But smaller UK firms will be able to survive by offering a distinctive approach in the UK market, combined with careful growth into more profitable overseas markets. 'We are all scratching our heads and trying to work out what it means,' said a banker yesterday. 'I would be surprised if some of the firms are around in a few years time, but I think the process could take longer than people think.' The end of the old ways of the City of London has been predicted several times before. Some of its traditions may not be able to endure forever, but the Warburg-Morgan Stanley merger is not yet the death knell of its traditional firms.</p>

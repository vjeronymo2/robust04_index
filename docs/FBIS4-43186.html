			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis today said he has made  it clear that he will resign from his post, if necessary, to  give the people the opportunity to decide whether they want  further discussion on the confidence-building measures, or  whether they prefer to insist on effective alternative  procedures before negotiations on the substance of the issue  that will open the way for a solution are held.    He added: If the UN Security Council follows this procedure,  we would be ready to help the secretary general find a just and  viable solution to the Cyprus problem. The president said he  has made it clear that he remains committed to the 21 March UN  document on implementing the confidence-building measures that  was prepared by the UN secretary general's representatives, and  in his report Butrus-Ghali described it as a fair and balanced  document.    The president made this statement this morning during an  address at a ceremony to receive the credentials of the new  Jordanian ambassador to Cyprus.</p>

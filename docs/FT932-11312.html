			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: House to rule on criteria for Emu THE GOVERNMENT con-firmed last night that the House of Commons would have an opportunity to determine whether Britain was able to meet the European Community's convergence criteria before embarking on economic and monetary union under the Maastricht treaty, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, announced that the government would provide for the necessary parliamentary proceedings by agreeing to add a new Labour clause, subject to some technical changes, to the Maastricht bill. He also gave a further assurance that the treaty did not impose an obligation on the government to return sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, hailed the announcement as a 'victory' and stressed that in reaching a judgment on the convergence criteria MPs could take account of the effect on budget deficits and the general co-ordination of economic policy. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, confirmed last night that as a result of its earlier defeat on the Maastricht bill the government would appoint members of local councils to all 24 places allocated to Britain on the EC's committee of the regions.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: British Thornton up sharply WITH SALES sharply higher at Pounds 3.92m, against Pounds 1.11m, pre-tax profits of British Thornton Holdings, the furniture making and contract packaging group, moved ahead from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 301,000 in the six months to October 31. However, serious problems arose in the educational and scientific furniture businesses and significant trading losses were incurred. A number of senior management changes have been made and steps taken to increase efficiency and reduce overhead costs. The result this time was struck after a Pounds 171,000 exceptional charge being compensation to a former director for loss of office and related costs. Earnings per share were 0.2p (0.09p). A special interim dividend of 0.25p (nil) has already been declared.</p>

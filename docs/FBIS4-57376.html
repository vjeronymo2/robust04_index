			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The atmosphere at Carabineros headquarters is  now relatively calm. A discreet police patrol was established  after General Rodolfo Stange returned to work this morning.  [passage omitted]    By 0800 everything was ready to receive Gen. Stange who  arrived at 0807 and was welcomed by General Fernando Cordero,  General Manuel Ugarte, and General Oscar Tapia. Before entering  the building Stange greeted the media.    After 0900 Carabineros issued a brief communique stating  that  Gen. Stange, having taken the vacations to which he is entitled  by law, has resumed his activities.    [Begin recording] [Carabineros Social Communications  Director  Major Camilo Salinas] Complying with Defense Minister Edmundo  Perez Yoma's orders, within the next few days the Carabineros  High Command will focus its attention on drafting a  modernization plan for the institution. [end recording]    Carabineros sources have said this means Gen. Stange will  not  delegate his command nor his decision-making role, only minor  tasks such as inspection visits and ceremonies. [passage omitted]    Defense Minister Perez Yoma said the government is satisfied  with the solution to the Stange case. He explained that while  Gen. Stange is busy studying the modernization plan, his other  duties will be discharged by Gen. Fernando Cordero, the second  in command.    After yesterday's hectic day, which ended with a brief  communique on the solution to the Stange case, the defense  minister explained the scope of this agreement.    [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] I believe this agreement, to  a  certain degree, safeguards the interest of both parties.    [Unidentified reporter] Does this merely postpone the issues  for another 30 days or is the problem definitely solved?    [Perez Yoma] It by no means postpones the problem. It is the  solution to a determined problem and we will assess the  developments day by day.    [Reporter] In 30 days time will he [Stange] leave the  institution definitely or will he fully resume his duties?    [Perez Yoma] There is nothing definite yet on the subject  and  we agreed we would not discuss the problem. I think we must let  things take their course, we are right on top of the problem,  and the best course is to let things return to normal, let calm  return, and keep in permanent contact with Gen. Stange and  assess the development of events.    [Reporter] This means Gen. Cordero will assume these duties  in his capacity as acting director general.    [Perez Yoma] Naturally, he is the second in command. [end  recording]</p>

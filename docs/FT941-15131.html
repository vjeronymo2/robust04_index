			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hungry for change Britain's food retailers will be glad to have seen the back of 1993. The big three grocers were among the seven worst performing FT-SE 100 stocks last year. The sector as a whole underperformed by 34 per cent. This year has started off in better mood with the sector bouncing 15 per cent from its November floor, outperforming the market by 5 per cent over that time. There have been some encouraging trading noises from Wm Morrison and Waitrose. On Wednesday, it is hoped Tesco will add to the good news. Given the lull in the price skirmishes, it is perhaps tempting to anticipate a further run in the shares. Falling gross margins may ensure the sector's earnings growth will lag the market for the foreseeable future; especially so if Tesco follows Argyll in depreciating its expensive assets. Yet the financial strength of leading grocers should enable them to maintain attractive dividend growth. Asda may have outperformed the sector recently but, in the longer term, it may be seen as perverse for the market to favour the weak in the industry over stronger companies like J. Sainsbury. Yet, in truth, the current bounce may reflect little more than income-hungry investors chasing the sector's yield down to the market average. Some rebound is also natural after so savage a fall. Much further appreciation will have to rely on a dose of inflation, a reduction in store capacity or some successful diversification. With the benefit of hindsight, the misguided wave of rights issues in 1991 resulted in too much capital being hurled at the market. Some capacity will have to be removed before the bigger companies can resume growth.</p>

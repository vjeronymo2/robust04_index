			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Buy-out plans for two Daf operations MANAGEMENT buy-out proposals are being prepared for two further operations within Leyland Daf, the truck and van maker in administrative receivership. Mr Arthur Zammit, managing director of Daf International, based at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, is leading a UK-based team seeking to take control of Leyland Daf's truck assembly and distribution activities in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi. Managers at Leyland Daf's parts distribution operations at Chorley, Lancashire, are also understood to have begun talks with the receivers on a possible buy-out. Meanwhile the management team seeking to buy Leyland Daf's vans operation in Birmingham has acquired a non-executive chairman-designate. He is Mr Ned Dawnay, a director of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, which is 50 per cent owned by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Mr Dawnay, a former non-executive director of Rover Group, is understood to have been introduced by former Rover chairman Sir Graham Day.</p>

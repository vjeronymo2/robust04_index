			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: TLS reduces losses and pays dividend TLS Range, the vehicle rental group trading in Scotland, the north-west and the West Midlands, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 259,000 to Pounds 190,000 in 1992. However, it was unable to offset losses incurred in the summer and could not maintain the level of improvement recorded at halfway. Turnover was static at Pounds 9.79m (Pounds 9.97m). The fleet size, including contract hire vehicles, was reduced from 1,934 to 1,738 to take account of falling market demand. From January, the hire fleet will be depreciated equally over the period of the estimated useful life, which will result in an overall average provision of 16.8 per cent per annum of cost. On the basis of an improving trading performance in the early part of the current year, the group is returning to dividends with a final of 0.25p. Losses per share came to 0.98p (1.25p).</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THIS THAI RESTAURANT, THE COOKING FALLS WAY SHORT OF BEING HOT STUFF  </P> <P> Thai cooking, with its scalding fresh chilies, handfuls of green and opal  basils and sweet undertones of coconut milk, would seem one of the bastions  against standardization. It is nothing less than a scandal when it, too, falls  prostrate before the American urge to homogenize.  </P> <P> The process has taken place at Taste of Thai in Hillcrest, where many of the  dishes seem no more exotic than the hot dogs hawked at Padres games.  </P> <P> It is a pretty restaurant -- Thai restaurateurs in San Diego seem to have a  flair for designing cool, attractive spaces in which to serve what usually is a  hot, heady cuisine. The location, on University Avenue in Hillcrest, also seems  just right, since Thai is trendy at present and Hillcrest is about as trendy as  San Diego gets. Snippets of conversations overheard from nearby tables are less  about real estate prices than get-away trips to Third World destinations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Main Street Menu  </P> <P> The menu, however, is more Main Street than Third World, and a dish of choochi  curry eaten with closed eyes will not provide the imagination with instant  transport to a Bangkok klong. The bulk of the menu is a depressing roster of  mix-and-match options that seems to have been designed not by a chef but by a  graduate of the P. T. Barnum School of Marketing. Even a cursory examination of  the menu gives the impression that the kitchen is organized on an assembly-line  principle. The entree list begins by mentioning chicken, roast pork, beef,  roast duck, shrimp, squid, scallops and a vegetable medley, not as dishes but  as main ingredients to be matched at will with one of 13 sauces from the  following list. In other words, any of these main ingredients can be had with  red, green or yellow curry sauces, or with garlic-pepper sauce, or in a  sweet-spicy finish, or sweet-and-sour, or with ginger, or cashew nuts or fresh  basil.  </P> <P> Presumably, all the cooks need do is fish the selected meat or seafood out of a  bin and dress it with sauce ladled from the appropriate pot. This seems not  unlike spreading a hamburger with one's choice of ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise  or Thousand Island dressing.  </P> <P> The kitchen evidently does pair already cooked meats with ready-made sauces.  Under the specialties heading, for example, the menu lists "crispy duck," which  it says is a "half duck topped with sweet spicy curry paste." This listing is  followed by one for "spicy duck," which it describes as "half crispy duck  topped with sweet spicy curry paste." This would seem to be the same critter.  The spicy duck was ordered, and it was an awkward and embarrassed bird, one  that apparently had spent much of the day cooling its heels (it certainly  wasn't warm) waiting to be spread with a bit of sauce that was about as spicy  as a copy of Popular Mechanics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mix-and-Match Approach  </P> <P> Roast pork in yellow curry sauce had a little more to recommend it, because the  sauce actually seemed to have been invested with a little spice, along with  chunks of carrot and potato. Just like the duck, however, the pork had the  tough and somewhat greasy quality common to reheated meat, which definitely is  one of the drawbacks of this mix-and-match approach to restaurant cooking.  </P> <P> Shrimp ordered in the "hot-basil" style, which the menu described as  supplemented with green pepper, chili and garlic, was not the searing and  explosive preparation that this dish can be. It was so nondescript and so  essentially non-Thai-seeming, in fact, that were it served at a Midwestern  Sunday School picnic, some of the participants would find it little more  remarkable than the baked beans and macaroni salad.  </P> <P> This point of view was mentioned to one of the restaurant's managers, who  responded, "Well, it's very subjective. If you want it hot, you have to say so.  We try to standardize everything."  </P> <P> Standardization is, of course, playing to the lowest common denominator, and we  get enough of that on television and in political campaigns. If a menu says  "hot," that's what we expect, and the whole point of going to an ethnic  restaurant would seem to be to get something out of the ordinary, out of the  mainstream and beyond the daily experience. When that stops being true, the  American melting pot will seem to have melted down, and we all might as well  pop something frozen into the microwave and spend the time saved from dining on  other pursuits.  </P> <P> The appetizer list includes the typical stand-bys, including beef and chicken  satay skewers served with a moderately spiced peanut sauce and a nice cucumber  salad. The spring rolls, which are about half the size of an adult's little  finger, are advertised as containing ground shrimp and chicken along with  cabbage and "grass" noodles, but what one sees and tastes are slivered  vegetables. The accompanying sauce is hot with cayenne, but not subtle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delicate Noodles  </P> <P> Soups again are available on a mix-and-match basis, with one's choice of  chicken, beef, shrimp, squid or vegetables prepared tom-yum (in broth flavored  with lemon grass, mushrooms, chilies and lime juice) or tom-khar (enriched with  coconut milk and pungent galanga root). Salads follow the same principle, and  the yum salad is a fairly good blend of cucumbers, tomatoes and greens dressed  with sweetened vinegar, chopped peanuts and a choice of seafood or sliced  steak.  </P> <P> Among other dishes are noodles, fried rices, several seafood specials (the  "Thai boat" steams scallops, shrimp, fish filets, squid, white wine and herbs  in foil) and the eternally popular mee krob, the crisp noodles that probably  did more to popularize Thai cooking in this country than any other 10 dishes  combined. Sweet, and so delicate that they almost shatter at a glance, Taste of  Thai's presentation of these noodles is fairly standard, except that it  garnishes them with dried shrimp rather than fresh. The flavor of this kind of  shrimp, which appears often in Oriental cooking, is pungent and anchovy-like.  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> * TASTE OF THAI  </P> <P> 527 University Ave.  </P> <P> 291-7525  </P> <P> Lunch Monday through Saturday; dinner nightly.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $20 to $40.  </P></p>

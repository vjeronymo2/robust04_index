Upon the  instigation by Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the issue was passed on  to the Russian Security Council at the beginning of this month.  Kozyrev recommends putting the Germans off for an indefinite  period, even if this were to cause the Russians' desired project  of a consulate general in Frankfurt/Main to fail. He wants to  talk to his Bonn counterpart, Kinkel, who is visiting Moscow  this week, in this spirit and warn against a relapse "into the  Germanic urge to the east": In particular, the debate about  Koenigsberg, which was started in the European Parliament upon  the suggestion of German deputies, and the demand for a "special  relationship" between the European Union and the Kaliningrad  area are "pure impudence."</p>

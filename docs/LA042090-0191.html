			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS UNION ELECTS BERNSTEIN PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Los Angeles teachers union members have voted overwhelmingly to elect union  Vice President Helen Bernstein as their new leader.  </P> <P> She will take the reins of United Teachers-Los Angeles in July from President  Wayne Johnson, who headed the nation's second-largest teachers union for six  years, leading it through a bitter nine-day strike last spring. Johnson was  precluded by union rules from running for another term.  </P> <P> Bernstein, a high school counselor and history teacher, has been the union's  leading advocate for the school restructuring process negotiated during the  strike and now under way in the district's 600 schools.  </P> <P> She won nearly 65% of the vote, with about 12,000 of the union's 28,000 members  casting ballots during the three-week-long election. Ballots were counted this  week and results will be formally certified and announced by the union's board  of directors next week, said union spokeswoman Catherine Carey.  </P> <P> Bernstein, whose low-key style is a marked departure from the confrontational  demeanor of her predecessor, said she has intends to stay the course Johnson  has charted for the teachers union.  </P> <P> "I have a different style and I've taken on different issues than Wayne, but I  have the same priorities he does," Bernstein said in an interview Thursday.  </P> <P> She called her lopsided victory over three opponents "as much an endorsement of  Wayne and what he has stood for in this union as a mandate for me."  </P> <P> "Wayne went out of his way to endorse me," she explained, "and people voted for  me on the assumption that I would continue to push on the priority that we have  had as a union in the past few years -- that the district's money is not spent  in the classroom.  </P> <P> After three terms as president, Johnson plans to return to the classroom this  fall but will continue to serve on the union's board of directors.  </P> <P> Johnson's confrontational style has led to a bitter relationship between the  union and the district, but that may change some under Bernstein, who has had  to work closely with district officials in getting school-based management off  the ground.  </P> <P> School board President Jackie Goldberg said she looks forward to working with  Bernstein and has been impressed by her commitment to the school restructuring  process. "I know she is completely dedicated to that and that will certainly be  an area of agreement for us."  </P> <P> But Bernstein said she plans to go even further in pushing for teacher  empowerment.  </P> <P> "We need to restructure the entire district, from the superintendent's office  on down," she said. "Our school system is in crisis: The schools are not  properly supplied, we don't have the resources to compete in this technological  world, the curriculum is not responsive to the multicultural, multilinguistic  needs of our children.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles native and graduate of Hamilton High School, Bernstein, 45, began  teaching history in 1967 at Sun Valley Junior High School in the San Fernando  Valley.  </P> <P> She has a bachelor's degree from UCLA and a master's degree in counseling from  Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Bernstein was elected to the union board in 1987 and to the vice president post  in 1988.  </P> <P> Newly elected union vice presidents are Day Higuchi, Denise Rockwell, Nina  Greenberg and John Perez. Jerry Folender was elected treasurer.  </P></p>

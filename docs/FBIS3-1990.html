The Chang Jiang River, China's longest, flows across Jiangsu  and cuts by Nanjing, capital of the province, and Zhenjiang,  Yangzhou, Nantong, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou Cities, to form a  belt which covers an area more than 400 km in length and 100 km  in width.    This area has seven open ports which have more than 20  berths  able to accommodate ships of at least 10,000 dwt [deadweight  ton].    With thousands of industrial enterprises, it generates about  80 percent of the gross domestic product in the province.    Since 1991 Jiangsu has invested billions of yuan in building  up the industrial belt along the valley.    So far, the seven cities in the valley have formed a chain  of  modern industrial installations, covering raw materials, energy  development, processing and high-tech. They account for one  tenth of the country's total industrial output.    In addition, these cities boast complete telecommunications  and transportation networks.    A provincial official in charge of the economy said that  Jiangsu has opened eight state development and bonded zones, as  well as international tourism and holiday areas over the past  few years.    Investors from more than 100 countries and regions are  busily  setting up enterprises or exploring land for development.    A survey shows that the provincial government has approved  the establishment of 18,000 foreign-funded enterprises,  involving a total investment of more than 16 billion U.S.  dollars. Included are over 60 noted trans-national corporations.    Meanwhile, China's first high-tech industrial chain has  opened in the Jiangsu section of the Chang Jiang River Valley.    With a total area of 38.38 sq [square] km, the chain  includes  four high-tech industrial zones in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and  Changzhou, respectively. The chain also houses more than 700  high- tech project?nvolved in the fields of electronic  information, the combination of machinery and electrical  appliances, new materials and bio-engineering.    The Suzhou High-Tech Industrial Development Zone has more  than 100 projects run by both Chinese and foreign investors.  Each of the projects has an investment topping 10 million U.S.  dollars.    According to the official, about 100,000 rural industrial  enterprises in the Chang Jiang River Valley in the province are  paying attention to upgrading themselves technically.    The technology and equipment of more than one half of them  have reached the advanced Chinese standard and even  internationally in some cases. One tenth of them have  co-operated with overseas business people in forms of joint  ventures or technical co- operation.    According to the latest statistics, the annual industrial  output value generated by rural industrial enterprises in five  counties, including Wuxi, Jiangjin and Wujin, in the river  valley has surpassed 20 billion yuan each, ranking them among  the leaders in the country.    One new feature is the Sino-Singapore joint development of  the Suzhou Industrial Park.    The two sides have decided to spend 20 billion yuan on  developing a 70-sq-km area into a industrial park consisting of  a modern industrial zone, a high-tech zone, an industrial  processing zone and an industrial town.    So far, the park has concluded contracts on building more  than 60 projects with Singapore, involving a total of 1.6  billion U.S. dollars.</p>

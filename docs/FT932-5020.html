			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Winning portraits THE BP Portrait Award comes round again, for the 14th time, in as robust and varied a competition as ever, writes William Packer. Ten thousand pounds, with a further Pounds 2,000 commission for a portrait for the collection, were always worth the winning, but the importance of the award goes deeper. It has brought the discipline of the Portrait back into the currency of contemporary art, a possibility that even 20 years ago seemed as remote as the revival of the full-bottomed wig. The winner this year is Phillip Harris, for his hyper-realist image of two figures, male and female, nude and grunge respectively, lying on the bed of a stream. But the strength of the competition is to be measured by the immediate runner-up, a  3/4 length self portrait in a football jacket by Christopher Prewett (left), an artist who has been in the offing for the award a number of times, and could well have won this year with this, the most confidently and painterly image of the show. The professionalism of the entry throughout is remarkable; this is a competition that artists themselves clearly treat with an increasing seriousness with every year it continues.

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules of the Exchange, in addition to the rules set forth under the Act, impose certain obligations upon the specialist unit, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Because specialist units play a crucial role in providing stability, liquidity and continuity to the trading of stocks on the Exchange, the Commission believes that effective oversight, including periodic evaluation of the specialists' performance, is important to the maintenance of a fair and efficient marketplace. Critical to this oversight is the specialist performance evualation process embodied in Rule 103A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See generally NYSE Rule 104; Rule 11b&hyph;1 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the May 10 Order, the Commission reiterated its desire for the Exchange to develop objective measures of market making performance and incorporate such measures into the proposed rule change to extend the Rule 103A pilot. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The Commission's request was consistent with its previous orders approving the extension of the Rule 103A pilot program. In fact, the Exchange informed the Commission that it had employed the services of an outside expert to study the feasibility of adopting such objective measures of specialist performance. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  To date, however, the Exchange has not finished its development of objective measures of market making performance. Indeed, in the proposed rule change, the Exchange states that it continues to work to develop additional objective performance standards. The Exchange requests that the Commission extend the effectiveness of the rule for an additional year because the rule is working well. However, the proposal herein to extend Rule 103A until May 9, 1995, does not include objective measures of market making performance as the Commission originally and requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32285,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28215,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 2 and letter from Robert J. McSweeney, Senior Vice President, Market Surveillance, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Commission, dated August 31, 1992 (``August 1992 letter''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even though the proposal lacks objective market marking performance standards, the Commission has determined to approve the proposal to extend the effectiveness of Rule 103A for an additional year in light of the significant enhancements the NYSE has made to the Rule 103A program thus far, and the substantial time and resources the Exchange already has dedicated to the development of objective criteria. The revision to Rule 103A, adopted in July, 1990 <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE> , the subsequent adoption of relative performance standards <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE> , and the refinement of existing standards <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  have augmented the Exchange's ability to evaluate specialist performance. In this regard, the Commission also notes that the Exchange has developed a new measure of capital utilization by specialists, even though that measure has not yet been incorporated in to the Rule 103A evaluation criteria. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30676 (May 7, 1992), 57 FR 20544 (May 13, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32045 (March 24, 1993), 58 FR 16896 (March 31, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As noted in previous orders, <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  the Commission stated that the mature status of the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS''), as a market structure facility, warrants the incorporation of ITS turnaround and trade-through concerns <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  into the NYSE's Rule 103A performance standards. The NYSE has responded to the Commission's request that it incorporate ITS turnaround and trade-through concerns into Rule 103A. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Exchange stated that ITS matters are more appropriately addressed by means of the Exchange's regulatory processes rather than by its performance measurement system. According to the Exchange, it has emphasized to speciality that all ITS commitments to trade are expected to be executed, and will take appropriate regulatory action if specialists are deficient in this matter. Moreover, the Exchange states that trade-throughs are not always the responsibility of the specialist and, therefore, would not appear to be an appropriate measure of specialist performance. In the Exchange's view, the current ITS trade-through resolution process works well, and is the appropriated means for addressing ITS trade-through concerns. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Despite the contentions of the Exchange, the Commission believes that evaluating the ITS turnaround and trade-through concerns can be a valid measurement of specialist performance and should be incorporated into the evaluation process. For example, the NYSE should measure how many times NYSE specialists trade-through other markets and how often specialists' ITS commitments expire. Although we agree with the NYSE that these factors should be addressed, where appropriate, by regulatory action, we also believe these factors can be a valid indication of specialist performance in the current trading environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30676, 29180, 28215, and 25681 supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ITS Plan, Section 8(d)(i) and (ii), (as last amended March 9, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See August 1992 letter  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission continues to believe that the Exchange should develop objective performance standards that would measure accurately the traditional indicia of specialist performance, namely, market depth, price continuity and dealer participation and stabilization. The Commission continues to encourage the NYSE to incorporate objective standards into the Rule 103A program prior to or simultaneous with the NYSE's future proposal to extend the effectiveness of Rule 103A or adopt the Rule on a permanent basis. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> In this regard, the Commission expects the NYSE to submit to the Division of Market Regulation, by February 28, 1995, a proposed rule change pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4, to extend the Rule 103A pilot or make the Rule permanent. As emphasized above, this proposed rule change should include objective measures of market making performance that have been developed by the outside experts retained by the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this regard, as of December 1994, the NYSE should have a full year's experience with the new capital utilization measure. Assuming that the experience with the capital utilization measure is good, the NYSE should incorporate the new measure in the Rule 103A evaluation prior to the Exchange's next request for an extension or permanent approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also expects the Exchange to submit to the Division, by February 28, 1995, a status report on the implementation of Rule 103A. The report should contain data, for each quarter of 1994, on (1) the number of specialists that fell below acceptance levels of performance for each category; (2) the number of performance improvement actions commenced; (3) the number of units subjected to informal counseling to improve performance; and (4) a list of stocks reallocated due to substandard performance under the Rule and the Particular unit involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

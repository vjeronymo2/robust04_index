			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50&hyph;483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : August 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The proposed amendment would replace Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.6.2.2, Spray Additive System, with a new TS 3/4.6.2.2 entitled Recirculation Fluid pH control (RFPC) System. The associated TS Surveillance Requirements and the Bases would be revised. In addition, the Bases for the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) System will be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall protection system performance will remain within the bounds of the accident analyses documented in FSAR Chapter 15, WCAP&hyph;10961&hyph;P, and WCAP&hyph;11883.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accidents evaluated in the FSAR that could be affected by this proposed change are those involving the pressurization of the containment and associated flooding of the containment and recirculation of this fluid within the ECCS or the Containment Spray System (i.e., large break LOCA, main steam line break inside containment, and feedwater line break inside containment). The TSP&hyph;C will dissolve in the containment sump fluid resulting from these accidents raising the pH of the fluid, which would initially be greater than or equal to 4.0 but less than 7.0 during the injection phase of containment spray operation. The equilibrium spray pH during the recirculation phase resulting from this change will be greater than or equal to 7.1. The pH range for the spray will be bounded by the range of 4.0 to 11.0 in the current FSAR Section 3.11(B) for the postulated spray solution environment. Since the resulting pH level will be closer to neutral using the TSP&hyph;C instead of NaOH, post&hyph;LOCA corrosion of containment components will not be increased. The results of the current, post&hyph;LOCA hydrogen generation calculation will remain bounding. There will not be an adverse radiation dose effect on any safety-related equipment. Thus, the potential for failures of the ECCS or safety-related equipment following a LOCA will not be increased as a result of the proposed change. The radiological consequences of changing from NaOH to TSP&hyph;C were reanalyzed using the current NRC methodology presented in Revision 2 of the Standard Review Plan (NUREG&hyph;0800) Section 6.5.2. This reanalysis indicates that the proposed change would result in reduced control room doses. Offsite doses would remain less than those currently reported in FSAR Table 15.6&hyph;8. The offsite and control room doses will continue to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 100, 10 CFR 50 Appendix A GDC 19, SRP 15.6.5.II, and SRP 6.4.II. The dose reanalysis, combined with knowledge gained from recent studies on the behavior of iodine in the post&hyph;LOCA environment, demonstrates that the deletion of the Spray Additive System and replacement with a sump pH control system using TSP&hyph;C will not increase the reported radiological consequences of a postulated LOCA. The proposed new pH control system will provide satisfactory retention of iodine in the sump water, as well as provide adequate pH control to minimize the potential of chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking of austenitic stainless steel components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Containment Spray System will continue to function in a manner consistent with the plant design basis. There will be no degradation in the performance of nor an increase in the number of challenges to equipment assumed to function during an accident situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These Technical Specification revisions do not affect the probability of any event initiators. There will be no change to normal plant operating parameters, ESF actuation setpoints, or accident mitigation capabilities. Therefore, these changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Recirculation Fluid pH Control System is a passive system, i.e., no operator or automatic action is required to actuate the system. There are no active components being added whose failure could prevent the new system from functioning. The only new components being added are the TSP&hyph;C storage baskets. Seismic requirements have been included in the design to ensure the structural integrity of the baskets will be maintained during a seismic event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No new accident scenarios, transient precursors, failure mechanisms, or limiting single failures are introduced as a result of these changes. There will be no adverse effect or challenges imposed on any safety-related system as a result of these changes. The use of dry sodium phosphates is allowed for adjustment of the post&hyph;LOCA sump solution pH as discussed in SRP 6.1.1. Trisodium phosphate has a dissolution rate of 0.7 lbm/ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> -min in water at 160 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (given in WCAP&hyph;12477, based on trisodium phosphate in the form of a solid block with no agitation of the solution). The quantity of trisodium phosphate chosen will provide a minimum equilibrium sump pH of 7.1 following dissolution and mixing. No new equipment performance burdens are imposed' however, there is the potential for an unlikely, but possible, event in which an initially concentrated solution of TSP&hyph;C occupies the stagnant volume of an inoperable sump. This situation would not last for long since, as the recirculated sump fluid is cooled in the RHR heat exchangers, sufficient buoyancy-driven circulation within containment will result to displace the stagnant solution and eventually yield a uniform, equilibrium solution. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different type of accident is not created. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

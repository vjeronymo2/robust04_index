			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Arnotts may fight bid in court ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, may take legal action against the hostile ADollars 8.80 a share takeover bid by Campbell Soup of the US, Reuter reports from Sydney. 'It is far too early to say . . . but one of the steps that could be taken is legal action,' Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts chairman, said after the company's annual meeting. Campbell already has 33 per cent of Arnotts and its bid values the company at ADollars 1.2bn (UDollars 857m). It needs just over 17 per cent acceptances to gain control of Arnotts. Mr Sandy Dawson, an Arnotts shareholder and former managing director, urged legal action at the annual meeting, saying Campbell had gone back on undertakings that it would not increase its stake beyond 40 per cent. Mr Dick Shea, president of Campbell Soup's global biscuit and bakery division, said in Australia that his company had no plans to lift the ADollars 8.80 a share offer for Arnotts. 'We believe that the figure is a very valid and wholesome offer,' Mr Shea said. 'There are really no facts from this morning that would cause us to change that offer,' he said, referring to earlier opposition voiced at the Arnotts annual meeting by Mr Purdy and shareholders.</p>

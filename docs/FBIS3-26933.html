Both indices surpassed 200 billion yuan; of the 220 billion  yuan of total income, the net increase was 72.4 billion yuan  over the previous year. Last year, Guangdong's township and  town enterprises earned a net profit of 16 billion yuan, turned  over 6.7 billion yuan in taxes, and earned $7.5 billion through  exports. These three economic indicators rose by more 40  percent compared to those of the previous year.    Enhancing competitiveness by having an appropriate  operational scale, developing high and new technologies and  opening up new markets, and making efforts to earn foreign  currency by utilizing Guangdong's advantage as the native land  of overseas Chinese were the three main reasons why Guangdong's  township and town enterprises could make break-through  developments last year, and they were also a major embodiment of  the greatly increased overall economic strength. In the process  of developing township and town enterprises, governments at all  levels in Guangdong have paid good attention to maintaining an  appropriate scale of operation, have optimized the organization  of the finished projects in many respects, and have promoted the  rational flow and recombination of personnel, capital,  technology, resources, and other means of production so as to  obtain returns through an economy of scale. For new projects,  they have adopted various means of management such as stepping  them up, slowing them down, or stopping them, to ensure the  development of key projects, infrastructure, and projects that  meet market needs.    During the period of macroscopic regulation and control last  year, Zhongshan and Sanshui cities stopped or slowed down the  development of 100 projects, thus reducing an investment of  approximately 2.2 billion yuan and ensuring the development of  some key projects there. In order to improve the market  competitiveness of township and town enterprises and  continuously open up new markets, they can only rely on  technology-intensive quality products. It has been learned  that, of the new projects started by townships, towns, and  villages throughout the province last year, a fairly large  number were high-technology projects. Once these  technologically advanced projects have been put into operation,  it not only will greatly enhance the economic strength of these  places but will bring along the development of related  industries.    At present, Guangdong has over 130 township and town  enterprises whose output value has reached 100 million yuan  each, representing a 1.4-fold increase over last year; Foshan  city alone has 80 of these enterprises. These township and town  enterprises which have strong capital support, which are  technologically advanced, and whose products sell well have  become a powerful and important force in Guangdong's economy.</p>

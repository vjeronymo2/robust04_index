			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICTS' 'SPECIAL TAX' REMAINS INVALID  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court dealt a setback Thursday to school districts in  fast-growing communities, limiting their ability to impose special taxes or  fees on developers to pay the full costs of educational facilities.  </P> <P> The justices, over one dissent, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last  November by a state Court of Appeal that struck down a voter-approved tax of as  much as $6,300 on each new home built within five districts in the Santa  Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The three-judge appeal court held that the tax was invalid either as a "special  tax" allowed with two-thirds voter approval under Proposition 13 or as a  "development fee" that schools may impose, but only up to $1.50 a square foot  of a new residence.  </P> <P> The panel ruled further that the tax was illegal because it was not imposed  uniformly on residents and property owners throughout the community, but would  be borne only by developers and future residents.  </P> <P> The high court's action, taken in a brief order issued Thursday, means the  appellate ruling becomes binding on trial courts throughout the state. Only  Justice Stanley Mosk voted to review the appellate court decision -- leaving  the matter three votes short of the number required.  </P> <P> The case had drawn wide attention in the wake of a flurry of recent efforts by  local governmental agencies to impose fees on developers to provide for  schools, roads and other facilities required by rapid population growth.  </P> <P> Orange County school officials, however, said they are not directly affected by  the ruling.  </P> <P> None of the Orange County school districts that impose fees attempted the kind  of tax vote that the five Santa Clarita school districts did. Rather, they did  so under existing legislation that allows them to charge up to $1.50 per square  foot for residential construction, sometimes in combination with other  agreements with developers to pick up part of the construction costs.  </P> <P> But officials said Thursday's ruling would make negotiations on the issue of  new school funding between schools and developers even more difficult.  </P> <P> "It hasn't worked out really well," said Anthony Dalessi, assistant  superintendent at the Santa Ana Unified School District. "Developers have never  been real crazy about paying."  </P> <P> Already, developers in Orange County have challenged the use of the  state-allowed developers fee.  </P> <P> In November, a Superior Court ruling declared that the Newport-Mesa Unified  School District had improperly imposed the maximum state-allowed fee on  developers. The court agreed with developers who argued that the school  district, which is facing a declining enrollment, was using the revenue from  the fees for maintenance and repairs, when the legislation intended it to be  used for capital construction.  </P> <P> While Orange County and most school districts in the state had abided by the  statutory limit on developer fees, the effort by the districts in the Santa  Clarita Valley to impose what they called a "special tax" to obtain far more  revenue for long-range educational needs could have led to similar moves  throughout California, lawyers and officials said.  </P> <P> William Ingram, president of the California School Boards Assn., said school  authorities from across the state had been hopeful that the appellate court  ruling would be overturned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Back to Drawing Board'  </P> <P> "That would have given us an out," he said. "Now, we're back to the drawing  board."  </P> <P> In Orange County, where school construction is a critical topic among school  administrators because of growing population, the case had been studied  carefully. School officials here say they do not blame the Santa Clarita  schools for trying to find a creative solution to a desperate situation.  </P> <P> "That's why school districts engage in these games," said Paul Reed, deputy  superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District. "The need is so great,  and the number of projects to be funded is so great."  </P> <P> Reed, whose district has faced an annual growth in enrollment of 2% to 5% in  the last few years, said there is a $5-billion backlog of requests in the state  school building fund.  </P> <P> "It's a huge problem," he said.  </P> <P> On another front, Sonoma County Counsel James P. Botz, representing a coalition  of 14 counties that supported the five school districts in the case, voiced  concern that the ruling could encourage legal challenges to a wide range of  voter-approved, post-Proposition 13 special taxes enacted by cities, counties  and special districts.  </P> <P> Botz noted, for example, that under the decision a hotel occupancy tax -- borne  primarily by visitors and not voters -- might face a legal challenge because it  was not uniformly imposed.  </P> <P> "It could really narrow the kind of taxes that local governments can impose  under Proposition 13," he said. "Those kind of taxes are difficult enough to  obtain because they have to be approved by two-thirds of the voters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minimal Effect  </P> <P> However, Alvin S. Kaufer, a Los Angeles attorney who represented the California  Building Industry Assn. in a suit against the tax at issue in the case, said  the ruling would have minimal impact, affecting only a relatively small number  of school districts that have tried to impose a special revenue measure.  </P> <P> The Court of Appeal opinion, he added, stopped far short of requiring absolute  uniformity in the burdens imposed by a special tax -- and thus may pose little  threat to such measures. There is still room for special taxes to contain  reasonable rate differentials, he said.  </P> <P> "The primary effect will be to retain the status quo," Kaufer said. "If the  decision had gone the other way, there would have been chaos. Residents in any  school, sewer or mosquito-abatement district in the state could go out and tax  new residences in any amount and nothing could be done about it."  </P> <P> The case arose after voters in the Newhall, William S. Hart, Saugus, Castaic  and Sulphur Springs school districts in Los Angeles County approved the special  tax by a two-thirds vote in June, 1987.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Steve Padilla contributed to this report.  </P></p>

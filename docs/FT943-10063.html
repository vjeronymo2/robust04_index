			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Euro-fighter cost queried Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday said the European fighter aircraft, a joint project between Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, should be scrapped because of soaring costs. But in an interview in Die Welt am Sonntag Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, continued to defend the aircraft, which is already behind schedule by two years. Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD, said the taxpayer would have to provide an extra billion D-Marks if the project goes ahead. The federal audit office last month calculated that the price of each aircraft has already increased to DM150m (Pounds 62m) instead of earlier estimates by the Defence Ministry of DM90m. The SPD has consistently argued against the project following the end of the cold war and the demise of the Warsaw Pact. But supporters of the aircraft say it will meet western Europe's air defence needs well into the next century. Mr Ruhe is also under pressure from Deutsche Aerospace, which is developing the Eurofighter. Dasa is seeking DM1.2bn more to fund the project.</p>

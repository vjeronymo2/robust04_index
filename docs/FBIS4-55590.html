			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Resuming  their offensive against the republic of Srpska, Muslim units are  still using chemical weapons in the Majevica area where they  have enjoyed UNPROFOR's military backing again, TANJUG learned  today from republic of Srpska army sources. According to these  sources, strong Muslim attacks in cooperation with UNPROFOR's  Nordic unit continued against most Serbian defense positions on  Mount Majevica, particularly against Serbian villages in the  Stolice area. Muslim units again targeted Serbs with large  caliber chlorine-charged shells in addition to artillery and  infantry weapons. Serbian military sources pointed out that for  the second consecutive day a part of UNPROFOR's Nordic unit  continued to provide military back-up for the Muslim side. The  same unit targeted the Serbs with tank fire yesterday, also  using armored personnel carriers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong last night called on  industrial countries to ride on the growth of Asia and respond  to it not as a threat, but as an opportunity to advance their  own economic well-being.    This was a challenge which the Western nations must respond  to positively, he said. "If they do not, and instead try to stem  the flood tide, the challenge would turn into economic conflict  and fragment the world into economic blocs -- the European  Union, NAFTA and, perhaps, a new Asian bloc."    In a keynote speech to open The Asia Society's international  business conference at the Shangri-La Hotel last night, he said  Asia's time had come. ASEAN, China, India, Vietnam, even  Myanmar [Burma] were opening up their economies. As China  pushed through its economic reforms while India and Vietnam  revamped their hitherto closed state-run economies, their impact  on the global market would change the pattern of world trade and  investment.    "As they grow, the pattern will change further. We will all  have to adjust to their in creasing economic presence," he  added. "Integrating these new giant producers into the world  market is a major challenge."    Unfortunately, the West was ambivalent about Asia, and some  Western leaders, politicians, trade unionists and opinion-makers  saw Asia's emergence as a threat rather than an opportunity.    He said: "Attempts to check imports from low-wage countries,  like the recent efforts to introduce social clauses on workers'  rights and minimum wages into the GATT agenda, betray the West's  fear of competition from Asia and its growing sense of economic  insecurity.    "These thinly-veiled protectionist measures are  short-sighted. They show a misguided preoccupation with  preserving low-value jobs when the West should be concentrating  on creating high-value jobs."    Mr. Goh said Western governments should resist changing the  rules to curb Asia's growth.    "There is no alternative but to compete if Western countries  want to maintain their edge in living standards over Asia and  other developing countries."    Cheap imports from developing states did not cause the high  unemployment problem in the West, he said, pointing out that  Asia's economic emergence coincided with the prolonged recession  in the industrialised countries.    "The relentless shift to wards new technologies is the major  reason why those with out skills are losing their jobs. This  will continue even if borders are sealed. It explains why the  West is experiencing economic growth without corresponding job  creation."    Mr. Goh said Western leaders must have the political will to  overcome some "basic self-inflicted problems".    Europe was burdened with costly welfare systems, he said.  The labour markets in Europe had become too rigid, and laws  inhibited rather than promoted growth.    The bottom segment of workers in the United States and  Europe  were also under educated and under-trained.    He said: "The West needs to solve its structural problems  now, while it still has the trump card on technology and  know-how.    "If it does not strive to stay ahead, it will find that in  another generation, even this competitive advantage may be lost.  Asia will catch up fast with the West in levels of education and  skills."    He noted that Asia, with its growing affluence, was becoming  a huge market for consumer goods, travel and other economic  services. Asia had already overtaken Europe as the leading  export market for the US, accounting for over a quarter of US  exports by 1992, he said.    By the end of the decade there would be some 400 million  Asians with purchasing power equal to the average Westerner  today.    If, despite these benefits the West continued to see Asia as  a threat and tried to slow its growth, both Asia and the West  would lose.    "If the West blocks the emerging Asian countries, especially  China from world markets, it will force them to turn inward.  They will be less open and be less co-operative internationally.    "Their weaker economic growth would translate into a more  aggressive and destabilising military posture because they would  distrust the West.    "The West will be threatened not merely by the loss of  exports and slower domestic growth, but with global insecurity,  including the risks of losing the assets it already has in Asia."    There would be similar negative effects if the European  Union  looked only inward and the North American Free Trade Area  (NAFTA) only southward, he warned.    "If they do, Asians will have to organise themselves and  trade increasingly among themselves. The region's diversity in  natural resources, wage levels, skills and technology will allow  for continued expansion of intra-regional trade and investment.    "Asia has the capital. It saves more than the rest of the  world. Its growth will be slowed, but it will not be stopped.  An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a  viable option. And sometime in the next century, Asia, by its  sheer size, would shift the weight of global economic power from  the West to the East."    Whichever the scenario, he said, the West would have much to  lose by not being a partner in Asia's growth.    "An economically-powerful Asia which is not integrated with  the rest of the world will be sullen and ready to challenge the  West.    "An Asia made prosperous with the help of the West will want  that beneficial relationship to continue."    Citing Germany and Japan as examples, Mr. Goh said the  wisdom  of America's policy to help its World War II adversaries after  the war was obvious.    They were now America's allies. "Likewise, the US can help  China, India, Vietnam and the rest of Asia integrate with the  West by investing in them, selling to them and buying from  them," he said.    "This will lead to an interdependent world economically and  politically. When the West and Asia reinforce each other's  strengths and take a stake in each other's stability, prosperity  and future, it is a much better world."</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to keep it all in the family - In a nutshell An exchange programme which allows the next generation of a family company to gain experience working in another family firm is one of the services to be provided by the Stoy Centre for Family Business, to be launched later this month. The centre, which has been set up by accountants Stoy Hayward, is intended to generate ideas, stimulate discussion and disseminate knowledge about all aspects of the family business. Family-controlled firms account for 75 per cent of all UK companies, Stoy calculates. Other services to be provided include a forum to lobby for the interests of family businesses; help in finding non-executive directors; a newsletter, seminars and conferences. Membership of the centre is open to companies where more than 50 per cent of the shares are owned by one family; a single family group effectively controls the business; or a significant proportion of the senior management is drawn from the same family. Contact Moira Lewis, Stoy Centre for Family Business, 8 Baker Street, London W1M 1DA. Tel 071 486 5888. Annual subscription Pounds 110 plus VAT.</p>

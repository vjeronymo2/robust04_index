			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, chief of the UN Mission  for El Salvador (Onusal), said that "El Salvador should feel  proud about its elections." The Onusal chief and his large team  of observers toured the entire country on 19 and 20 March.  Ramirez added that they had access to the latest information on  what was transpiring "and, therefore, this was an  extraordinarily normal election."    Ramirez described as "a Solomonic measure" the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decision to install polling stations in  Arcatao, San Jose las Flores, Nueva Trinidad, and San Isidro  Labrador, because these four municipalities of Chalatenenango  are considered to be refugees for former FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] combatants.    The voting started in those places at 1015 because ballot  boxes were not transported until yesterday via Air Force  helicopters after the TSE had a change of mind. The original  plan was to install all ballot boxes in the city of  Chalatenango, where 85 percent of the inhabitants of those four  municipalities live.    Ramirez praised Salvadorans who stood in line without making  any fuss to comply with their duties as citizens. He regretted  delays in the voting process that prevented many people from  voting. [as published]    The chief observer, of Colombian origin, recalled the  commitment made by presidential candidates and secretaries  general to President Cristiani to close polling stations at 1700  only after every citizen still waiting to vote had cast his or  her vote.    Ramirez said that Onusal will take note of all "anomalies,  claims, and requests but will only report worthy ones. The  atmosphere that has surrounded the peace process is yielding and  will yield results," the chief of the observers added.    Among the small problems he noticed at certain voting sites  were the delays in opening. In some cases, such as the Central  American Pavillion of the International Fair Grounds, Ramirez  intervened directly to expedite its opening. "In general, this  was an extraordinarily normal election," the Colombian added.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Stance on Scotland may cloud Lib Dem message CHANGE in Britain's political system and economic revival were set at the centre of Liberal Democrat aspirations for the general election yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. But he risked clouding his party's message with a complex stance on the issue of 'home rule' for Scotland. Rallying his party at its spring conference in Glasgow, Mr Ashdown confronted accusations that a Liberal Democrat vote is a wasted vote. 'Never before has the ground for political change been so well prepared,' he said. On the economy, he warned that 'the Tories offer paralysis and Labour offer timidity.' He called for public investment, an independent central bank - and hinted that he would reverse any tax cuts in tomorrow's Budget. He welcomed moves by Labour in the direction of including moves towards proportional representation in its manifesto. But the party should go farther, 'bite the bullet' and come out unequivocally in favour of reform. In spite of the obvious passion of Liberal Democrats at Glasgow for Scottish 'home rule', the party's MPs have agreed it must be subordinate to Mr Ashdown's top priority - electoral reform at Westminster. Some MPs have had to be persuaded to toe the line, notably Sir David Steel, the former Liberal party leader who made only a very brief appearance at the conference. With devolution bounding up the Scottish political agenda, the strength of the deal to subordinate Scottish aspirations has been tested to the limit. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Scottish spokesman, admitted the party was only 'half way' towards persuading voters why Scotland would not have a guarantee of its rights under a devolved system until Britain had a fair and representative democracy. Liberal Democrat MPs in Scotland feel glee at the way in which the 'home rule' dream that drove many of them into politics in the 1960s and 1970s could start to become a reality in five weeks. Their delight is an emotion that could threaten the party's cohesion if Mr Ashdown sought to vote down a minority government offering devolution but not full-blown constitutional reform. Yet Mr Ashdown knows the Liberal Democrats' appeal has to be broader based if he is to make an impact in the constituencies in the south-west and south-east of England where the Alliance parties - from which the Liberal Democrats were forged - came second to the Tories in 1987. The Scottish MPs do not need special concessions. In all but one of the constituencies, the main challenger is the Conservative party, not Labour or the Scottish nationalists. Scottish 'home rule' is far down the list of voters' priorities in Liberal Democrat target seats such as Bath, Falmouth and Camborne, Richmond and Barnes, or Cheltenham. Mr Ashdown's tactics for capturing such seats are broader and softer focused, based on simple messages about changing the Westminster political system, of building on voter apathy or disenchantment with negative Labour and Tory campaigning. The party's My Vote slogan, splashed across a giant orange sun over the conference platform, is aimed at encouraging voters to make every ballot paper count. Party political broadcasts will list all the 259 constituencies where the Liberal Democrat is the main challenger to the MP. 'Ours will be the vote which breaks the logjam holding back change in our country . . . My vote is for an election which is positive,' read the introduction to Mr Ashdown's speech. That message will be emphasised at grassroots level with Liberal Democrat policy papers crammed with neat ideas or 'common sense' solutions to contemporary issues - such as the housing shortage or animal rights - that can be niche-marketed according to local concerns. Party headquarters in Westminster is lean and professional - a remarkable turnround compared with the near-bankrupt state of the organisation a few years ago. But the lesson of past elections is that Liberal Democrat victories are borne largely of local effort. Alas for Mr Ashdown, the devolution debate was in danger over the weekend of disguising the infectious enthusiasm of confident Liberal Democrat candidates. He risks exacerbating the confusion himself. He appeases home rulers by talking of the Scottish devolution debate as 'the soft underbelly' of UK constitutional reform but - apparently in contradiction - says a Scottish parliament could not become entrenched if a single party at Westminster could impose the policies that Scotland had rejected. The hypothetical arguments over what his stance would mean in a hung parliament - like the fascination over how many cabinet seats Mr Ashdown might or might not demand - irritate party strategists who believe a coalition government is a long way down the scale of probabilities. In practice they fully expect Labour or the Tories to attempt to run a minority government before calling Mr Ashdown. If the government survived the Queen's speech debate, Liberal Democrats would vote for any devolution legislation brought before parliament.

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR 5 PARCELS OKD  </P> <P> The City Council gave initial approval this week to a plan to redevelop five  city parcels totaling nearly 200 acres.  </P> <P> After hearing testimony from owners and tenants of the One-Stop Shopping Center  on Orangethorpe Avenue, the council decided to eliminate that 6.6-acre parcel  from the redevelopment area.  </P> <P> Included in the project are the Buena Park Mall/Handyman site on La Palma  Avenue; the Orange County flood control area near Malvern Avenue and Dale  Street; the Builder's Square site near Beach Boulevard and Malvern Avenue; the  Buena Park Drive-In and strawberry fields near Holder Street and Lincoln  Avenue, and the northwest corner of Crescent and Western avenues.  </P> <P> The approval Monday night does not mean that the bulldozers will start moving  in, said Mayor Donald T. Bone. Instead, the city will work with property owners  and let them offer ideas, said Acting Director of Redevelopment Gustavo Duran.  </P> <P> Preliminary plans call for expanding established commercial properties such as  the Buena Park Mall and building homes in vacant areas. This will take place  over the entire 30 years set aside for the project, Duran said.  </P> <P> Final approval is expected at the council's next meeting, scheduled for July  2.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

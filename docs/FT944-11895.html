			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (7): Standard reforms on the way - Leasing / A look at progress on new accounting practices Most large finance leasing companies in the UK produce excellent accounts and are a model of corporate reporting in the eyes of standard setters and the users of financial statements. The problem for the industry, which it readily acknowledges, is that its image is still tainted by the memory of failures like Atlantic Computers and Court Line: the first a lessor and the second a lessee. These collapses, and the increasing tendency for lessors to be dealers in assets, often give a jaundiced picture of a vital industry to those in need of a creative answer to capital problems. The industry, and the government's own standard setters, are working hard to improve the integrity of leasing finance. It is worth looking at the case of Atlantic Computers to see where many of the problems began. Atlantic was founded in 1975 to provide leasing, lease-financing, broking, and the sale of computers. It was floated in 1983 and was swallowed by British &amp; Commonwealth in 1988 for Pounds 408m. Two years later both collapsed. Atlantic had reported aggregate pre-tax profits of Pounds 127.6m between 1983 and 1988. When the department of trade and industry finally got their hands on the books its inspectors were able to report that if prudent accounting methods had been used no significant profits should have been reported. The problem was Atlantic's core product: Flexlease. This product was not viable in the long term but this was concealed by the way in which the company accounted for profits and failed to make provisions for contingent liabilities. Flexlease was in fact three products: a six-year lease with two options  - the 'flex' option allowed renegotiation for a new agreement after three years, while the 'walk' option allowed the client to terminate the lease after five years. The options gave rise to large potential liabilities as more customers took the 'walk' option. It is this type of 'treadmill' situation which is often the root of the problem in lessor accounting: where the growth of the business obscures unprofitability. Once growth diminishes the spiral goes into reverse. The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) has responded to the type of problems illustrated by Atlantic, and other failures, by pushing ahead with reform for lessor accounting, particularly in the area of residual values. The FLA's focus on residual values is understandable in the light of several corporate adventures which have ended in failure. However, many outside the industry would like to see a wider reform, tackling the need for lessors to give realistic information on profits. The 'treadmill' nature of leasing finance makes this an area open to abuse. The FLA does, however, deserve credit for campaigning for reform and realising that the future of the industry relies on a public perception of professional integrity. Both the FLA, and its predecessor the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA), became aware of the problem during the mid 1980s - particularly in the field of computer leasing. The ELA suggested setting up a joint working party with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1986. The institute felt the issue warranted a full accounting standard and passed the problem on to the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC). In 1993, the FLA approached the Accounting Standards Board, which succeeded the ASC, on the issue. 'They acknowledged that residual value accounting was a problem area along with other aspects of lessor accounting. They suggested that the FLA itself should, in consultation with them, draw up a Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice (Sorp) on lessor accounting issues,' according to the FLA. The ASB has allowed the industry to set up a 'Sorp-making' body and it will meet later this month. Despite some friction between the standard makers and the FLA the industry will hope that the Sorp will be an influential accounting standard similar to those introduced in banking and in pension funds. The FLA, through the Sorp process, would like to see residual values more realistically calculated for lessors. Those values should also be revalued at intervals. The timing of the impact of revaluation on the balance sheet is another issue to be considered. Should the company accounts take a single hit or should the impact be spread over the life of the lease? The Sorp is likely to propose a conservative compromise between the two. The FLA disagrees with the ASB when it comes to reforming the standards governing lessee accounting. David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, says: 'We take the view that the ASB should be more concerned to ensure that lessors are properly accounting for their profits rather than with what should be on or off balance sheet, which seems to be their current preoccupation.' The ASB's present financial reporting standard is SSAP 21 - the standard set by the old Accounting Standards Committee, which became effective in 1987. It drew a distinction between finance leases, which were transactions with contracts in which the lessee paid most of the value of the asset, and operating leases, usually over a shorter period. In the first the asset is treated as a purchase, appearing on the balance sheet of the lessee, with the profit and loss account incorporating the cost of borrowing and depreciation. The second item is allowed to remain off balance sheet. The profit and loss account simply shows a charge for servicing the lease. How do you tell the difference between the two? The '90 per cent test' states that a finance lease was any lease in which the present value was at least 90 per cent of the asset's fair value. The result of this rule was, as is so often the case in accounting, the creation of a small industry dedicated to circumventing it, particularly in big ticket leasing. Leases were engineered to be off balance sheet at 89 per cent. Lessors also abused the spirit of the regulations. In their accounts the requirements were the inverse of those for the lessee and creative accounting can remove the impact of the lease on the balance sheet. Third parties were introduced between the lessor and lessee with the result that, in some cases, the impact of the transaction was not shown at all. This state of affairs is unlikely to survive in the face of the ASB's Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 4, and the ASB's statement of principles. The first seeks a picture of the true nature of transactions in accounts and the second defines the true nature of assets and liabilities. All eyes will be on the ASB in the medium term for reform in this area - and in the shorter term on the Australian Accounting Research Foundation - which is currently considering the very same issue.</p>

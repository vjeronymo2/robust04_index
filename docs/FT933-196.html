			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: What they had to say 'The changes I propose today are vital - absolutely central - to our strategy for winning power and I ask you to unite behind them.' John Smith party leader 'On this issue John, as we have told you many times in the past year, you ask too much of us.' John Edmonds GMB leader 'I say to all those who will cast their votes today against the leadership: 'Do you really speak for your members; do you really speak for the levy payers out there, the real Labour supporters?' I doubt it.' Maggie Jones of Nupe 'The block vote is now this party's weakest link.' Bill Jordan AEEU leader 'I am delighted that the position we have taken has been approved by conference. You can't have three contradictory positions. If you are saying that this conference passes a composite in the debate and that is then not carried I do not accept that. The NEC will have to clarify the situation.' Bill Morris TGWU general secretary 'It's been a draw. If you go to the Cup Final and it's one-all, you play extra time.' Dennis Skinner MP for Bolsover 'In Tory Britain, the unions cannot succeed without the Labour party, and the Labour party cannot succeed without the unions.' Bill Morris 'The trade unions will continue to be the tail that wags the dog.' Sir Norman Fowler Tory party chairman 'We don't want to be modernised out of existence . . . we're not just the Labour party here, we are a labour movement.' Christine Shawcroft Co-operative Retail Society 'We have a very good deputy leader already.' John Smith on whether John Prescott should be deputy leader</p>

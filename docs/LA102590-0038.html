			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> OLD PORK RIND BAIT METHOD STILL EFFECTIVE FOR SALTWATER ANGLERS  </P> <P> An old fishing method still brings good results, according to Henry Church of  Wilmington.  </P> <P> Church has been fishing the ocean for more than six decades as a commercial  fisherman with hook and line for albacore and tuna.  </P> <P> Now retired, Church fishes only for the sport and releases most of his catch.  </P> <P> Church said when he looks at an angler's tackle box today he sees all different  types of jigs, feathers and trolling gadgets.  </P> <P> Today's saltwater anglers may be blind to the merits of using pork as a  versatile fish catcher, he said.  </P> <P> To prove his point, Church said he used pork rind on a recent trip for sharks  and hooked a mako during a slow troll. He estimated it to be 80 pounds.  </P> <P> Horsing it in, Church said the hook came out of the shark with the pork still  on the hook.  </P> <P> Another one of his theories is when fishing deep water, pork rind attached to a  hook will net more strikes than bouncing a jig on the bottom.  </P> <P> Church said an angler will find it very useful to carry some rind in his tackle  box.  </P> <P> Tuna continue to be caught for quality, but not quantity.  </P> <P> Long Beach Sportfishing's Aztec and Toronado returned last weekend with less  than one tuna per rod. Yellowtail and rockfish made up most of the two-day  Cortez Bank trip.  </P> <P> Tom Filbach of Long Beach was the jackpot winner aboard the Aztec with a  47-pound bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Eric Krepinovich of Lomita and Jay Akahashi of Gardena each caught jackpot  contenders of 35 pounds apiece.  </P> <P> Lomita fishermen Tom Simpson and Tom Marquez returned from fishing Buena Vista,  Baja Mexico, and described the trip aboard the boat Mickey as one of the best  they have had.  </P> <P> Simpson and Marquez caught sailfish up to 75 pounds and broadbill of more than  90 pounds.  </P> <P> Marquez said using cut bonito for bait, they hooked and released more than 60  dorado on the three-day trip.  </P> <P> Sonny Bennett of Marina del Rey worked Santa Monica Bay Monday in his skiff and  drifted for a mile fishing for halibut. He said within an hour he had his  five-fish limit.  </P> <P> Bennett said he used herring for bait with a halibut rig. The five flatties  weighed upwards of 15 pounds.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Duane McCutheon of Redondo Beach caught the whopper of the  week fishing aboard the Blackjack at Cortez Bank. He landed a 51-pound bluefin  tuna.  </P> <P> Tom Herinance of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught a 50-pound  bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Jon Mojuharan of Hawthorne, fishing aboard the Vagabond at Benites Island,  caught a 39-pound yellowfin tuna.  </P> <P> Roy Henderson of Lomita, fishing at Tanner Bank aboard the Pacifica, caught a  36-pound bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Sally Gold of Gardena, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the horseshoe kelp,  caught an 18-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Jack Chase of San Pedro, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the Diawa,  caught a 16-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: Local fishing catches of barracuda have slowed, with bonito  setting the pace for limit catches. Outer islands continue to be good for bass  and yellowtail.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the Sunset Beach area and  had a catch of 55 calico bass, 31 sculpin, 15 sand bass, three halibut and two  bonito.  </P> <P> The Del Mar half-day trip resulted in a catch of 189 sculpin, 32 calico bass  and a halibut.  </P> <P> The Sumo rock cod trip to Redondo Canyon returned with 150 rock cod and four  lingcod.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray worked rocky point for 176 bonito, 37  calico bass, 23 sand bass and two halibut.  </P> <P> The Blackjack returned from its day-and-a-half trip to Cortez Bank with four  bluefin tuna, 425 rock cod and four cow cod.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special, on a half-day trip, returned with 38 bonito, 34 calico  bass and a sculpin.  </P> <P> The City of Redondo half-day trip had a catch of 150 bonito and 96 rockfish.  </P> <P> The Isle of Redondo barge had a weekend count of 428 mackerel, 31 bonito, 28  rockfish and 19 sculpin.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String fished the west end of Catalina Island  and returned with 210 rockfish, 27 barracuda and four yellowtail.  </P> <P> The New Image trip to rocky point resulted in a catch of 220 whitefish, 78  sculpin and two yellowtail.  </P> <P> The Monte Carlo, on a half-day trip, returned with 56 bonito and 46 calico  bass.  </P> <P> At L.A.

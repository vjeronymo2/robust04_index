			<p>BFN     [Text] In Paris, after telephoning his American  counterpart, Warren Christopher, French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe spoke at length to the deputies, both to castigate those  preaching, whether intellectuals or Socialists, and to recall  that there is no possible military solution for Bosnia. Alain  Juppe also paid tribute to the role of the United Nations in  Bosnia:    [Begin Juppe recording] It is true that there have been  mistakes, and the way in which the negotiations over Gorazde  were carried out throughout last Saturday and Sunday illustrates  this fact. Nevertheless, I would like to qualify this judgement  made against the United Nations. Everything is demanded of the  United Nations, and it is given no means to fulfill the mission  it is assigned. It is not given money; the organization is  practically bankrupt: the main contributors don't pay -- though  I must say straight away that this is not the case with France,  which is up to date with its contributions -- and then the  secretary general is not given the necessary troops. In Bosnia  Mr. Butrus-Ghali said several months ago: I cannot fulfill my  mission if I am not given 7,000-8,000 more men. France is the  only country to have responded to this request. No other  country followed.    So it's easy to snipe at the United Nations, because it is a  somewhat anonymous sort of beast. Yes, but we don't have any  other weapon at our disposal, neither diplomatic weapons, nor  weapons on the ground. So we have to support it rather than  continue to denigrate it, I believe.

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY BASKETBALL TEAMS FACE EARLIER START FOR 1991-92  </P> <P> A school calendar scheduled to be implemented in July throughout the Los  Angeles Unified School District might force City Section league basketball  seasons in 1991-92 and beyond to be completed before an eight-week recess for  most schools begins in mid-December.  </P> <P> "The reality is that we must reschedule basketball season," City Section  Commissioner Hal Harkness said.  </P> <P> The impact of the new calendar on winter sports would be severe, Harkness told  City basketball and soccer coaches this week.  </P> <P> Under a proposal, the basketball season would begin the first week of November  -- three weeks earlier than usual -- and playoffs would be held the first two  weeks in January even though a majority of the City's 49 high schools would be  closed.  </P> <P> Because the basketball season would begin during the fall, teams would be  ineligible for the state basketball playoffs, which begin in March.  </P> <P> Other problems with the new schedule are apparent, according to Dick Browning,  a district administrator and member of a committee that studied the effect on  athletics of the new school calendar.  </P> <P> "Facilities problems are major," Browning said. "Soccer and football, which use  the same fields, would overlap. So would basketball, wrestling and volleyball,  which all use gymnasiums.  </P> <P> "There are no obvious answers. Things are real complicated. We are seeking  input from coaches or anyone who has some ideas."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: SUPPLEMENTING THE BENEFITS OF MEDICARE  </P> <P> How many private health-insurance policies does it take to supplement Medicare  benefits? Answer: one. And only one, because by law so-called Medigap policies  must provide coverage for what Medicare does not: the $564 deductible for  hospital costs, the $75 deductible for physicians' services and the 20% of  Medicare-approved doctor charges. A second policy duplicates coverage.  </P> <P> Says Robert Hunt of the National Insurance Consumer Organization: "Anyone who  tries to sell a person more than one (Medigap policy) is trying to take the  customer." So far, about 5.6 million older Americans have been taken, according  to a 1987 study by the Health Insurance Assn. of America. That many people own  two or more Medigap policies.  </P> <P> Often they've been misled. It's illegal to knowingly sell a supplemental policy  duplicating the purchaser's existing coverage, so unscrupulous sales persons  may not ask if you already own a Medigap policy. They'll just try to sell you  theirs.  </P> <P> Here are some common sales pitches and facts for deciphering them:  </P> <P>  -- A Social Security or Medicare worker comes calling to sell you a Medigap  policy. Don't believe it. Representatives of these federal programs don't sell  or service such insurance.  </P> <P>  -- A salesman explains that Medicare does not cover extended stays in a  nursing home, then pitches a Medigap policy. His statement is true as far as it  goes: Medicare helps pay for care in a skilled-nursing facility for only 150  days and does not cover stays of any length in intermediate- or custodial-care  nursing homes. But the agent's misled you by implying that Medigap policies  cover lengthy nursing-home stays. They don't. Consumers can purchase insurance  policies that cover long-term care, but these are currently distinct from  Medigap policies and do not supplement Medicare hospital and physician  benefits.  </P> <P>  -- A Medigap insurance agent asks if you'd be interested in a policy that  helps prevent you from ever becoming a burden to your spouse or children. With  your worst fears running rampant, you have difficulty resisting the sales  pitch. Again, the implication is that Medigap insurance offers coverage for  long-term care. Once again, it doesn't.  </P> <P> If you're worried about what will happen if you ever need extended care,  discuss your concerns with family members and explore such options as  long-term-care insurance or buying into a continuing-care retirement community.  </P> <P>  -- An insurance rep asks if you'd like coverage for prescription drugs. You  would, because your current Medigap policy doesn't provide this benefit.  </P> <P> In addition to paying for items required by federal and state laws, some  higher-priced Medigap polices provide extra insurance for prescription drugs,  physician fees in excess of Medicare-approved charges or other benefits.  Monthly premiums for these policies pay for the standard Medigap insurance plus  the additional coverage.  </P> <P> If you want broader coverage than your current Medigap policy provides,  exchange it for one that meets your needs. Don't buy an extra Medigap policy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> OPRAH GIVES $50,000 TO AID POOR  </P> <P> Oprah Winfrey is giving $50,000 to Glide Memorial United Methodist Church,  which appealed for help in its holiday grocery giveaway to the poor, the church  said.  </P> <P> "Because she is a very caring person who reaches out to the poor, she  immediately responded," the Rev. Cecil Williams, the church's pastor, said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Glide Memorial has distributed thousands of bags of groceries to the poor since  1979. But Williams reported earlier this week that holiday contributions were  down 37% from 1989 and asked the public for donations.  </P> <P> Winfrey learned of the appeal through poet Maya Angelou, a member of Glide  Memorial, and called Williams to say she will be sending a check, the church  said.  </P> <P> The church planned to start its holiday giveaway of more than 10,000 bags of  groceries today. The church said that while donations have declined, the need  for the groceries has risen.  </P></p>

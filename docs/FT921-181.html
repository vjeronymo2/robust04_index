			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Management: Innovators smart from a lack of funds - The Growing Business The government's main programme for supporting innovative small businesses, the Small Firms Merit Awards for Research and Technology (Smart), should be increased so that more eligible projects can be funded. The awards should also be made available twice instead of only once a year. These are the main recommendations of a study* by two Cambridge University researchers. The Smart scheme funded 180 companies in 1991 but more companies deserve backing if the money were available, according to Ian Moore and Elizabeth Garnsey. Smart is an annual award which provides funds for companies employing fewer than 50 people which have an innovative and commercially viable project. It meets 75 per cent of the costs up to Pounds 45,000, with a second stage award of up to Pounds 60,000 for further development. At present, large numbers of companies apply for Smart - 1,422 companies for just 180 awards in 1991 - resulting in a heavy burden on management time with only a small prospect of success. Very few of the projects backed by Smart money would have gone ahead on their own, the researchers concluded. But since technology is so fast moving, very few firms are able to wait a year before applying again for a Smart award. This problem could be overcome by making the awards more frequently. The Smart scheme plays an important role in giving credibility to a project. Businesses which had been unable to raise finance before winning an award frequently received several offers once they were successful. However, businesses which applied and were unsuccessful were sometimes seen as having been judged as not being up to standard. 'We therefore recommend an expansion of the scheme so that the relative scarcity value is eliminated and so that all viable proposals are funded,' the researchers said. In a second research study** Moore and Garnsey called for the government to rethink its other innovation programmes which emphasise collaborative, 'pre-competitive' research. The government's approach shows a failure to understand the process of innovation, they argue. It is often only obvious in retrospect that research is pre-competitive and it is not clear whether time or the nature of the activity defines 'closeness to market'. *Funding for Innovation in Small Firms. ** Pre-competitive and Near-Market Research and Development.

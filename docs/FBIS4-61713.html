Grachev  replies: "The German side is fulfilling its obligations with  regard to providing back-up for the withdrawal of our troops  very well. As well as the 7.8 billion DM [German marks], we  have also received from the German side a further 55 million DM  to provide facilities for the troops being withdrawn.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Supreme Court President Luis Serpa Segura  reported that on 13 June, the Supreme Court ordered an  investigation into the release of three Shining Path [SL]  leaders. This investigation is to be conducted by the Office  for Judicial Overview. Serpa explained that "Office for  Judicial Overview chief Carlos Giusti Acuna has been duly  informed. We hope a preliminary report will be submitted  sometime this week."    A television report, disclosed a few days ago, said that the  judicial branch ordered Luis Alberto Arana Franco, also known as  "Abel;" Juan Carlos Rios Fernandez, also known as "Norman;" and  Monica Feria Tinta, all of whom are SL leaders, released from  jail.    It was learned that Luis Alberto Arana Franco, also known as  "Comrade Abel," a SL leader in charge of the logistics apparatus  that operated at the Cesar Vallejo academy, is on parole. On 13  June, Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for terrorist crimes,  said Arana Franco's sentence was commuted because he helped  disrupt important SL groups. Espichan added that Arana Franco  continues to supply information to antisubversive forces. He  explained that after he finishes testifying, Arana Franco will  be given a new identity and will leave the country with his  family.    Those who resort to the "repentance" law can be exempted  from  prosecution and punishment; they can change their identities and  leave the country with a small amount of money whenever it is  approved by a small committee that works in utmost secrecy.    Serpa stated that so far, several of those who resorted to  the "repentance" law have been granted new identities because  several SL members were arrested through their testimony. He  added that all of them have been allotted money until they get  jobs.    Juan Carlos Rios Fernandez and Jesus Monica Feria Tinta  [name  as published], as well as 27 other terrorists who were released  by the courts, are in a different situation because requests  were submitted to the Supreme Court to nullify their sentences.  Serpa stated: "These judges are obviously biased." He  explained that some members of faceless courts are reportedly  being subjected to "pressure" or to accept "bribes." [passage  omitted]    So far the faceless courts have sentenced only two or three  and absolved the rest.    Carlos Blanco, president of the congressional Human Rights  Committee, has demanded that the Office for Judicial Overview  conduct an exhaustive investigation. Blanco believes,  nevertheless, that this situation resulted from a  misinterpretation of the repentance law.    Moreover, Justice Committee President Cesar Fernandez (NM)  [New Majority] will submit a bill to close the "legal loopholes"  in the antiterrorist law that have allowed the release of SL  leaders. Fernandez Arce has demanded drastic punishment for  those judges responsible for this release.    Fernandez Arce specifically requested that the special  prosecutor for terrorist crimes be duly informed about the court  rulings so he can appeal these decisions. Prior to the Attorney  General's Office decision, any release ordered by a "faceless  court" should be subjected to a Supreme Court review.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Voronezhstsev: "We Will Just Have To </F> Choose Between Something Not Very Good and Something Very Bad: A  Point of View"]    [Text] Perhaps 100 percentof our republic's citizens expect  changes and are waiting for them to occur. A somewhat lesser  number are convinced that these changes are impossible without  replacing the parliament and the government. Each person views  them in his own particular way; frequently various groups of  people present completely opposite and mutually contradictory  positions. But almost all of us hope for something better,  especially in the event that those whom we like nowadays should  come to power.    To be sure, our hopes for quick changes are hardly justified  in any case. The process of the disintegration of the economy  and the fundamental social structures has been going on for so  long that "neither a genius nor a hero" will be able to rescue  us from the present nightmare as rapidly as we would like. It  will continue for another two or three years, even if a  beginning is made on those reforms are carried out by persons  who know how to implement them and who have support in the  society. And are there any such persons here in our country?    Even if we were to assume what is virtually  impossible--namely, that the elections to the Belarusian  Parliament were held by the deadline promised by the present-day  deputies of the Supreme Soviet--the picture that emerges is not  completely rosy. Many serious analysts have pointed to the  substantial probability of acquiring a parliament that is not  much different from the Supreme Soviet which we have today with  regard to its intellectural development, degree of competence,  as well as the capacity for moving the reforms forward and  providing stability within the society. Indeed, we have been  pushed in the direction of this joyless conclusion by the  surprising statements made by the leaders of the most  influential political groups and factions now in the running for  a significant number of seats in the new legislative organ.    They see as the principal causes of all our troubles the  intrigues and machinations of the Russian special services,  which "are exercising a free hand in Belarus," as well as the  actions of the imperial-communist "Fifth Column," and the  advocates of economic integration with that country which is  traveling "down the path of a brutal liberal capitalism." The  only thing to do is to break off from these foreign and domestic  enemies, nationalize those enterprises which have been  distributed and held hostage, separate ourselves from the  Russian boors," and buy oil in Kuwait. Then--as a completely  sovereign and independent republic--we would soon enter upon a  kind of Baltic or Polish "prosperity." To be sure, before a  sharper economic upswing could come to pass, it would be  absolutely necessary to teach the Belarusian language to all our  ministers, along with two or three other foreign languages.    Other leaders--during the time free from struggling against  propaganda of the "cult of violence, the dollar, and sex"--are  actively advocating a reanimation of socialism, which is  presently at death's door, or what they have been saying for a  long time: achieving an orientation of the state structures  aimed at creating well-planned and regulated state-type  commodity-and-monetary relations in the interests of enhancing  the people's prosperity and cultural level. Loud calls are being  heard for decisive actions to be taken for protecting and  defending the "indigenous interests of the working people," the  Soviets, for restoring the old USSR--of course, with the  Communist Party at its head. The economic reforms leading to  "capitalization" are to be excluded, and the growth of the  people's prosperity would, evidently, be provided by purely  ideological methods--although substantial revenues from tourist  activity would be possible. Belarus--the last communist preserve  on the territory of Europe--would be visited by people from all  over the world in order to have a look at a unique country where  entirely white people live under the "most democratic,  collegial, and effective" Soviet-type regime.    There is also a "third force" in our republic--one which  could neutralize the extreme political tendencies. But its ideas  are not so popular or simple so as to enable them--as the  Bolsheviks used to say--to win over the masses. And it is  difficult to present this idea of liberalism with a populistic  interpretation, especially under the conditions of the  Soviet-type, leveling education accorded to the overwhelming  majority of the members of our society. Furthermore, the mass  media have already become divided over the two most powerful  political factions and their variants--sometimes concealed  behind the masks of "centrism." A strong side of those parties  which can be provisionally relegated to the "true center" is  their realistic approach to the problem of assigning priority to  human rights over national and state rights. This is so because  the majority of our republic's population regard implementation  of the "human rights" principle as the "chief value"  guaranteeing personal security and the stability of the society  as a whole.    It is hardly likely that a majority in parliament will be  gained by one of the parties or blocs which are striving toward  this goal with participants who are very close in their  ideologies and programs. The polarity of views on the basic  problems of structuring the society and the state held by the  future party factions in the parliament will--more than  likely--cause the latter to be utterly inoperable. It will be  difficult to get by without making compromises, and it is  necessary to seek them out even today. It is clear that  agreement between the advocates of the sacredness of private  property and those fighters for the most just "social justice"  is scarecely possible. But it is possible in another case. For  example, in the program documents of that very same BNF  [Belarusian People's Front], together with some completely  normal and realistic provisions, there are also many on which  agreement would be difficult to reach not only with the  communist-internationalists, but also with persons unburdened by  Marxist pathologies. But it would probably not be too difficult  to find a compromise with the more moderate political forces on  these same "revival" problems, if they were approached from a  position of taking into account the interests of the majority  now living in Belarus, rather than resurrecting historical  justice or equity with regard to past generations. Because,  after all, it is fully obvious that excessive radicalism--while  understandable and justified under the conditions of an armed  struggle against the colonialists for the nation's  independence--is completely unacceptable at the stage of a  society's quite civilized development, and even at a critical  moment of this stage. It frightens quite a large number of  persons, pushing them into joining "pink" or "red"  parties--parties which have begun to trade upon the artificially  inflated, so-called nationality issue. It is possible that  mutual concessions can also be achieved along with an  accomodation of views on other problems.    Without finding such common grounds--something on which  political groups with various different program goals and  ideologies could unite--the parliament would, of course, not get  by. But this does not mean that replacing the Supreme Soviet  with a parliament must be postponed "until later." Today we are  compelled to choose between something not very good and  something very bad. But tomorrow we could be left without even  that kind of choice.</p>

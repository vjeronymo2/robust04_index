			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Growth of Mercury helps lift Cable and Wireless profits CABLE and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, reported an 8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September on the back of a strong performance by its UK subsidiary Mercury Communications. Group profits rose to Pounds 378m from Pounds 351m while turnover increased to Pounds 1.74bn from Pounds 1.57bn. Mercury's trading profit rose 36 per cent from Pounds 69m to Pounds 94m while turnover grew 29 per cent from Pounds 439m to Pounds 567m. This was largely because market share increased at the expense of its main rival British Telecommunications. Lord Young, C and W chairman, also revealed yesterday that the group would be interested in establishing a 'trans-border Mercury' in mainland Europe if the European Commission opens up the region's largely monopolistic telecommunications market. 'Telephone prices in Europe are far higher than those in the UK, so you instinctively know there is a (business) case', said Lord Young. Mercury carried a daily average of 9.7m calls during the period, a 52 per cent increase compared with the same period last year. At the end of September Mercury had an order base of 897,000 lines, 39 per cent more than last year. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, was bullish about the future following Mercury's alliance last week with BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group. He predicted that price competition would continue to be vigorous but not to the same extent as last year when BT cut its international prices by 10 per cent. Mercury is also hoping to boost its share of the residential market with the introduction of 'easy access', which will make it simpler for customers with BT lines to use Mercury's long-distance service. Other parts of C and W grew less strongly. Trading profits for the Asia and Pacific region, made up largely of Hong Kong Telecom, grew 5 per cent to Pounds 251m from Pounds 240m. Earnings per share increased 4 per cent to 18p from 17.3p and the dividend rose 12 per cent from 4.25p to 4.75p. C and W's shares closed up 10p at 652p. Lex, Page 20</p>

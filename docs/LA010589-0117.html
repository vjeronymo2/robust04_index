			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN LION GAMBLES ON RENO, COMES UP LOSER  </P> <P> A mountain lion that apparently roamed into Reno in search of food led police  on a 6 1/2-hour chase Wednesday before it was captured as it lounged on the  patio at a restaurant.  </P> <P> Police said the 65-pound female lion, which was first spotted at the Peppermill  hotel-casino before daybreak, was stung by two tranquilizer darts as it lay  under a bench at the Hacienda del Sol restaurant near the Peppermill.  </P> <P> Reno Animal Control and state Department of Wildlife workers took the drugged  lion away. Wildlife spokesman Dave Rice said the animal will be taken to a  remote area outside Reno and released.  </P> <P> Telephone calls began coming into the police station at about 5:25 a.m., when a  parking lot attendant at the Peppermill and several Virginia Lake joggers  reported seeing the animal, Sgt. Greg Dion said.  </P> <P> Dion said animal tracks were spotted by police leading from the Peppermill to  Virginia Lake.  </P> <P> The lion dropped out of sight until just before noon, when workers preparing  lunch at the Hacienda del Sol saw it on the patio, according to restaurant  manager Barry Rivlin.  </P> <P> Rice said mountain lion sightings are not unusual in Reno, although the animals  usually slip in and out unnoticed.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / TUC plans tough poaching fines UNIONS WILL face heavy fines from the TUC after the end of this month if they poach members from one another, the TUC's employment policy committee agreed yester-day. The move, likely to be approved at next week's TUC general council meeting, is an attempt to maintain harmony between unions after November 30. A provision of the government's Trade Union Reform and Employments Right Act comes into force at the end of the month, giving workers a legal right to choose the union they wish to belong to - undermining the 1939 TUC Bridlington agreement which aims to prevent unions competing for members. Unions found by the TUC to be actively recruiting members from other unions will have to pay compensation of up to two years' lost subscription for every member recruited. The union leaders have also agreed that legally qualified individuals will in future chair the TUC disputes committees that deal with inter-union poaching cases. In the past the TUC could threaten recalcitrant unions with expulsion if they poached members from other unions. The TUC believes it still has legal power to require cash compensation from any union defying a TUC ruling over poaching. The TUC will not, however, be able to seek cash compensation from unions which find themselves with additional members who have joined voluntarily rather than being poached. The TUC is concerned that if it does not introduce a new code of practice on inter-union relations, backed up by financial sanctions, union members and employers may run out of patience, sparking hostility over collective bargaining. It fears this could encourage employers to derecognise unions.</p>

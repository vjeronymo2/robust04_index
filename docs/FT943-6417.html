			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Poles win easing of debt position More than 95 per cent of western commercial banks and other holders of Dollars 13.2bn worth of Polish debt have agreed to a debt buy-back component in the country's debt reduction agreement, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the country's deputy premier and finance minister said at the weekend. This means that the value of the debt reduction for Poland will increase to over 49 per cent from the 42-46 per cent originally mooted because more debt holders than expected have opted to sell back their paper to the Poles at 41 cents to the dollar. Further details of the Brady-style arrangement - so-called after a 1989 initiative by the then US Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady - are due to be revealed today by Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the chief negotiator of the deal which is to be signed on September 13. As late as mid-July the Poles were still a few percentage points short of the 95 per cent threshold legally required for the buy-back to go ahead. Some debt holders had been refusing to go along with the agreement, believing the terms too generous. Failure to cross the 95 per cent threshold would have meant that the Poles could have only gone ahead with exchanging debt for par bonds and discount bonds which the deal values at 55 cents to the dollar and which have proved to be the most popular option chosen by the debt holders. The agreement will initially cost the Poles over Dollars 2bn, to be financed from foreign currency reserves and from loans from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>

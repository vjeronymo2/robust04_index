			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Turkey and Iran once again displayed their  newly established good relations with the visit by 'Ali Mohammad  Besharati, the Iranian interior minister.    The Iranian delegation enjoyed a warm welcome during their  visit on June 13-15, and the Turkish press reflected the mutual  understanding between the two countries.    Newspapers and television channels gave wide coverage of the  visit by the Iranian delegation, and there was no mention of the  fact that the delegation has not visited the [Ataturk]  Mausoleum, a source of tension and dispute between the two  countries.    Iran impressed the Turkish public with its stance regarding  terrorism, particularly the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). The  anti-PKK statements made by Iranian officials, coupled with the  fact that they had handed over a number of terrorists, made a  favorable impression on Turkish officials.    This visit laid a solid foundation for President Suleyman  Demirel's visit to Iran, which will take place on July 25, a  Turkish official told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN].    "Iranians were very positive regarding our concerns about  PKK  activities in the Turco-Iranian border region. They reassured  us that they would never condone terrorist activities that  targeted Turkey. They proved this by handing over to us scores  of PKK members who had been caught on their soil. Turkey and  Iran also shared similar views on regional issues. Both sides  want to improve their mutual relations," one of official said.  Meanwhile, Turkey has reacted to Iran's concerns on terrorism  in a similar manner.    Asked if Turkey would turn over to Tehran members of the  Iranian opposition Mojahedin-e Khalq Party detained in Turkey,  Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: "We will not allow any  anti-Iranian activity on Turkish soil. We will not shelter  anyone who can harm Iran."    One Iranian official told TDN that they were delighted with  Turkey's response. "They assured us that they would prevent  anti- Iranian activities in Turkey. Time will tell whether  these guarantees hold true, but we trust in the words of the  Turkish officials," he noted.    Mentese announced that Iran and Turkey would struggle  against  terrorism together. "Our agreement covers issues other than the  PKK," Mentese concluded.    Besharati stressed that positive and constructive contacts  had been made during his visit.    "We have no dispute with Turkey," he said. "Our borders are  closed to Turkey's enemies. There are no members of the  subversive and separatist PKK on Iranian soil. Turkey does not  have a closer or more sincere friend in the region than Iran."  As the Iranian delegation left Turkey for Tehran on Monday [13  June] morning, Besharati aid: "Turkey and Iran should follow a  common policy regarding Northern Iraq. We informed Turkish  officials about our stance and strategy on this issue. During  our meetings with Turkish officials, we said that Iran supported  the territorial integrity of Iraq and was opposed to the  establishment of a Kurdish state in the region."  <H5>  The Problem of Northern Iraq </H5>   Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the  terrorist organization has benefited from the instability in  Northern Iraq.    "The Kurdistan Democracy Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani  and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani  held a meeting in Silopi on June 13... During the meeting we  informed them of Turkey's stance and on the country's views on  the latest developments in the region," Ataman noted. He said  that Kurdish leaders were aware of the fact that Turkey  considered a renewal of the elections in Northern Iraq  unnecessary.    Pointing out that the way to stability in Northern Iraq  should be sought for in Iraq, Ataman concluded: "This attitude  was also expressed by the communiques published after the  meeting of Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and that of Turkey, the  United States, France and Britain. A dialogue should be created  between Baghdad and Northern Iraq."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government on 9 March decided to set up  additional working groups under the Administrative Reform  Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa) and to have them come up with, by the end of June,  additional deregulation measures primarily in the areas of  market-access barriers and import controls. Keiretsu dealings  and other commercial practices which have come under attack by  other countries are also expected to become the subjects of  study by these groups.    The U.S. Government has asked the Japanese Government to  move  up the target for finalizing the deregulation enforcement  five-year plan, which is now set for completion by March 1995,  to mid-July, when the summit of industrialized nations (Naples  summit) will be held. The government is due to discuss measures  including this point at the 10 March cabinet ministers meeting  on foreign economic issues.    The government held a ministers meeting on 9 March to  discuss  issues concerning the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks and  agreed that the market-liberalization measures now under study  should be finalized in two groups -- the first measures by the  end of March and the second measures by the time of the summit  in July.    During a news conference on the evening of the same day,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said that the  government will set up immediately, in addition to the existing  deregulation working group on land and housing issues, a similar  working group on the information communications sector and  another on the distribution sector by the end of the month.  These working groups will deal with issues related to market  access and regulations governing imports, and they will study  deregulation measures that would lead to the promotion of  imports.    Meanwhile, in relation to this question, a government source  on the same evening noted, "Even among cabinet members, views  are emerging on the need to review Japan's commercial practices."    According to the Foreign Ministry, the United States has  requested Japan to add to the "deregulation enforcement plan"  deregulation measures concerning the distribution sector as well  as measures for improving the transferability of land. The  United States has also asked about the schedule for finalizing  the plan, and it noted with respect to the deadline for  implementing the plan, "We hope that Japan will not try to  adhere to the implementation deadline of five years but rather  will facilitate its implementation before that."</p>

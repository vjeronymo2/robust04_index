			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs  Division.    The Majles held an open session yesterday with Dr.  Ruhani presiding, and the deputies of the cities of Mahneshan,  Takestan, Damghan, and Dorud and Azna made preagenda speeches.  Then in a brief speech the deputy speaker of the Majles  condemned the crime of the Zionists in slaughtering the  Palestinian worshippers. Then the Majles went into session. We  call to the honorable readers' attention the details of  discussions.  <H5>  Statements of the Deputy Speaker of the Majles </H5>   In the open session of the Majles yesterday, Dr. Hasan  Ruhani  offered his condolences on the anniversary of the day that the  Commander of the Faithful, 'Ali, was struck and then said: The  striking of the Commander of the Faithful proved this bitter  truth, that heathenism and hypocrisy have no logic but the  sword, assassination, and oppression and that this weapon has  always been used against justice, truth, free human beings, and  the oppressed. Unfortunately, after the passage of centuries,  today as well, hypocrisy and heathenism speak to us in the  language of slaughter, terrorism, aggression, and oppression.  The heinous and barbaric incident in the al-Khalil Mosque in the  shrine of his holiness Abraham, and for that matter during the  month of Ramazan, during the morning prayers, once again  repeated the incident of the Kufeh Mosque. This time, however,  not at the hands of one person but at the hands of a usurping,  aggressive, and oppressive regime, which in order to carry out  its treacherous and hypocritical plan in the region created this  tragedy. Despite the empty claims and deceptive and hollow lies  of the United States and Israel concerning the issue of "peace  and wanting peace" and their readiness to stop aggression and  oppression in the region, this shocking incident proved the  point for everyone, even the simpleminded, that the Zionists are  the same terrorists of yesterday, that no change has taken place  in their nature, that they understand no language but bullets,  and that there is no way to restore the rights of the  Palestinians and liberating Jerusalem except through holy war  and the unity of Muslims. As one of the main responsible  elements in this crime and tragedy, Washington is neither able  nor willing to solve the problem in the region. Solving the  Palestinian issue is only possible at the hands of Muslims  through unity and holy war. We hope that in these days of the  blessed month of Ramazan, especially the sacred days and nights  of Qadr and the days of guardianship and the imamate, we will be  able to make the most spiritual use of these sacred days and  nights and pray for all the Muslims in the world, particularly  the oppressed people of Palestine and Bosnia and other oppressed  people.  <H5>  Reza 'Abdollahi, Deputy From Mahneshan </H5>   The first preagenda speaker of the open session of the  Majles  yesterday was 'Abdollahi from Mahneshan, who referred to the  striking of his holiness 'Ali on 19 Ramazan and said: On 21  Ramazan, with the martyrdom of 'Ali, the history of Islam and  humanity changed, and as it advanced, with the coming to power  of oppressive governments, deviation from Islamic principles and  injunctions increased.    He added: In this age, the offspring of ebn-e Moljam kill  the  fasting worshippers during Friday prayers in the al-Khalil  Mosque, the racist Serbs engage in Muslim genocide in Bosnia and  Herzegovina, and the governments that support human rights  endorse these crimes.    Pointing out that the people of Iran will certainly hold the  Jerusalem Day ceremonies more magnificently, he said: Now that  the blessed Islamic Republic is 15 years old, I shall speak of  certain issues. To solve the problem of high prices, it seems  that in addition to the training and employing of strong  managers who are familiar with economic, social, and political  issues, this fact must be admitted, that fighting high prices is  dependent on increased production and more supply than demand.  This is possible in one of two ways:    Increase in supply or decrease in demand.    He added: In order to increase production, we need  investment, whereas we face limitations of capital and  investment, and some investments exceed the expectations of the  country and the people. The better way is to decrease  expenditures, make the best use of resources and investments,  and decrease consumption, which requires experienced, concerned,  and brave managers who have the national interests at heart. If  such a culture is formed in our society, we shall be certain  that our revenues will increase every day, and more just  distribution, wiser use of resources, and more reasonable  consumption will reduce high prices and inflation.    The speaker continued: If the Majles, the government, and  the  people decide to reduce in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]  only 10 percent of the uncontrolled consumption of oil products  compared to 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], with the  $1,898,000,000 in savings in this way, we shall be able to  provide medicine and essential goods for all the people as well  as employment, marriage, and housing for the young easily and at  low cost. If the uncontrolled consumption continues, in 1377 [21  March 1998-20 March 1999] our domestic consumption will reach  3,295,000 barrels of oil per day. With such consumption, from  1373 to 1377, we must build at least $17.5 billion worth of new  refineries or import $24 billion in products. Most important, in  1377, the level of our exports on the basis of daily production  and consumption will reach 700,000 barrels, whereas our exports  this year have been 2.7 million barrels, with a population of  about 60 million people. In other words, the per capita annual  export of oil will decrease from 10 barrels in 1372 to four  barrels in 1377.    Then, to decrease oil consumption, he suggested: Attention  must be paid to observing sound scientific principles in  planning, reforming the administrative structure, reducing red  tape for the people, making transportation networks more  efficient, constructing buildings using technical methods, and  preventing the production and entry of vehicles requiring high  gas consumption. In addition to this plan, cash subsidies should  be given on all essential goods and products for all the people,  the per capita expenditures of which should be based on the rate  of inflation, and prices should be made to be realistic, based  on actual cost or the payment of coupons to provide for the  urgent needs of the people.    In continuation, 'Abdollahi emphasized: In order to prevent  inflation and high prices, calculated and expedient investments  must be made. For this purpose, it is necessary to prepare and  make available the chart of payments and collections as soon as  possible. One important management skill is to best allocate  resources at a time when investments are limited.    In order to prevent inflation and price increases, the  logical and acceptable price of all services and goods,  especially the products of government organizations and  companies, must be determined by experienced experts. We must  accept that the time of disregard for the quality of management  has passed, and we must not allow consumers to pay exorbitant  prices for goods and services because of weak and incompetent  management.    For example, the minister of post, telegraph and telephone  has often announced that one telephone line costs about $2,000  in foreign currency, and recently in examining the 1373 budget  revenues in the Planning and Budget Committee, he repeated this  and announced that 60-70 percent of the foreign currency costs  of every telephone line involves cables. However, one cable,  which includes about 100,000 telephone lines, at the highest  purchase price of the Communications Company, according to the  officials of that company, was purchased for $20 million. The  foreign currency for the cable amounts to $200 per telephone  line.    If 60 percent is $200, 100 percent is $333 at the highest  purchase price. At the maximum leeway for foreign currency use,  every telephone comes to $500. Now, where does the $2,000 come  from when, as the minister knows, expert evaluation indicates it  should cost $500?    When we procure the same cable from Shahid Qandi Factory,  the  cost will be $60. Now, if we are to distribute the 5 million  telephone lines in the Second Plan at prices several times  higher, the difference between the actual price and the high  price imposed on the people is about $7.5 billion.    He explained: If the prices become accurate, certainly weak  and incapable people who are unable to offer goods of high  quality at an appropriate price will be dismissed and strong and  competent people will come to the scene. We must break the  monopolies and monopolized prices by creating competitors for  the monopolists and allow the private sector, at least by moving  a few letters and establishing a few quality telephone lines and  other services, to break the prices.    Stating that in order to prevent inflation we must try to  reduce the rate of population growth, he said: As has been  estimated, the population of the country in 1377 will reach 67.5  million. For every person in the population on the way and  future guests, we will need to spend at least $1,600 to provide  food, clothing, etc.  <H5>  Rajab Rahmani, Deputy From Takestan </H5>   The second preagenda speaker was Rahmani the deputy from  Takestan, who referred to the slaughter of the Palestinian  worshippers by the Zionist regime, which is supported by the  United States, and pointed out that they must be dealt with only  with the language of weapons and reliance on the weapon of faith.    In continuation, he added: The traitors who have committed  treason against the ideals of the oppressed people of Palestine  and those who have submitted to the Gaza-Jericho plan should  have realized this truth a long time ago. It is most unfortunate  that the legal and international circles, the United Nations,  and the Security Council simply overlook these crimes and under  the pressure of the United States have continuously held a  double standard in such cases.    Then, in connection with the Second Five-Year Plan, the  speaker said: By establishing expert groups and committed  experts, the Majles must work on the plan. The plan shows the  social awareness of the people and the officials. Social  awareness and conscience and the role of the people must be  taken into consideration in designing and devising, and after  the plan is adapted to the frameworks and policies determined by  the grand leader, who is the divine mountain of dignity and the  divine correct path, they should be implemented.    Also, in continuation, pointing out that despite the  conspiracies of the enemy, the government has been successful in  the First Plan, he asked the government to join forces with the  people to take basic steps in harnessing unbridled inflation and  high prices, supporting the vulnerable strata, stabilizing  prices, and fighting economic terrorists.    Thanking the president in regards to eliminating the  problems  and impediments involved in dried goods, including raisins, by  issuing appropriate instructions, which have been implemented to  a great extent, the speaker continued: Considering the frequent  requests of the people and the fruit growers of the province of  Zanjan, which were made during his visit to Takestan and that of  the officials, we ask the president to establish a grape and  apple juice concentrate unit in this city as one of the national  projects of the conversion industries. Most unfortunately, out  of the millions of dollars in foreign currency in Note 27 of the  1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] budget bill, not only has not  one dollar been spent on this project, but with the negligence  and disruptive actions of the concerned officials, including the  officials of the Agricultural and Mellat Banks, the people and  the government will suffer irreparable damage.    The deputy from Takestan also thanked Mr. Yazdi, the head of  the Judicial Branch, and said in continuation: As was stated to  his honor in the meeting on Saturday, 07/12/1372 [26 February  1993], we ask his honor to issue a decisive order to the  judicial officials and send a special representative to the city  of Takestan in order to resolve the nine-year problems of the  people concerning the land disputes of the farmers with the  forestry and urban land and also to notify the National Document  Registration [Office] to take steps in accordance with the vote  of the Investigating Committee concerning the disputed lands  cited in Article 56 in regards to the issuance of deeds in the  name of the farmers.    He also asked the minister of energy to take urgent steps  concerning the shortage of agricultural water and added in this  regard: Considering the prohibition on digging deep wells and  the very high drop in the underground water level and the  decrease in the amount of water in existing deep wells, more  than 3,000 hectares of agricultural land and vineyards are about  to be destroyed, and it is not clear who should respond to the  fruit growers.    He asked the minister of health and the head of the Social  Security Organization to pay special attention to the city of  Takestan and its problems and to find solutions to start the  operation and equipping of the 96-bed sole hospital in this area.    The deputy from Takestan continued: I ask the minister of  agriculture to take serious steps in regards to insuring the  agricultural products and vineyards, which is requested by a  large number of honorable deputies of the grape growing regions.    Considering that one of the necessities of the region is a  center for research on the orchards; despite the dominant  products in the region and the existence of Takestan as a  production area, the country lacks a research center.    He also made a reminder to the interior minister concerning  the annexation of villages 15-20 km from this city.    Concluing, he asked the Muslim and martyr-nurturing nation  to  respond positively to the call of the grand leader and, through  their million-large presence in the march on International  Jerusalem Day, to pledge once again their unity with the  oppressed martyrs and the people of Palestine and Bosnia and  Herzegovina.  <H5>  Abolfazl Hasan-Beygi, Deputy From Damghan </H5>   The next speaker was Hasan-Beygi from Damghan, who wished  victory for all servants of the sacred Islamic regime and  heathen-fighting combatants throughout the Islamic world and  destruction for the Zionist enemy and global oppressors from the  East to the West and said: Sometimes one hears and sees and  hears from the statements and pens of informed and uninformed  people unjust, incorrect, and unfair judgments. They say that  the sacred Islamic regime of Iran is not only helpless in  running the country but also even ordinary matters, or, affected  by destructive foreign and domestic elements, they follow an  incorrect path, distancing themselves from the foundation of  guidance on the basis of divine injunctions. It is most  unfortunate for such ideas to spread.    In continuation, he said: The sworn enemies in the East and  West criticize our nation and country with such self-righteous  posturing. Without reference to history and examining the  present countries in the world, one can easily be affected by  this. This country, until the victory of the revolution, with a  population of less than 35 million people and $26 billion in  revenues annually, was living in utter poverty, misery, and  dependence. The breed of farmers and farming was about to  disappear, and with the spread of the corruption and debauchery  of the offensive Western culture, the end of the human dignity  and Islamic principles of our people was in sight.    Pointing out that Iran is the mecca of the wishes and ideals  of the oppressed of the world, he said: They know well that the  country of the Imam of the Age has gained access to a strong  economic power and know that they can never place us under  colonial domination, like other Islamic countries. That is why  they are always thinking of tricks and treason and, by spreading  lies and baseless rumors, trying to deceive our alert people. I  say strongly that Iran is proud in this wide world. The Iranian  nation is proud, and we are standing completely behind the  guardian of the Muslims and are hopeful for the day that justice  will govern the whole world.    The speaker added: Our sincere people remember that until  1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], the total amount of asphalt  and gravel roads was only 5,500 km. But now this figure amounts  to more than 107,000 km, of which 65,000 km are asphalt roads  and 42,000 km are gravel roads. Up to 1357, there were about 1  million telephones, and in this short period of time the number  has reached 4.5 million, which shows a growth of 395 percent.  About the situation of universities and what stratum could make  use of universities, but by the grace of God, now in 14 years,  that is, up to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], 40 agreements  in principle to create higher education centers and 20 some  cases of medical education centers have been issued. Student  numbers have reached from 175,000 in 1357 to 500,000 in 1372.    He continued: The number of dams built would not exceed the  fingers on one's hand; but now we have more than 100 large dams  and dozens of small dams under construction and study. The  Ministry of Petroleum and our National Gas Company were taken  away by foreigners for free and hired Iranian people as  servants. But today, by the grace of God, the ministry and the  complex are operated by concerned and committed experts of our  own country. Until the revolution, they had distributed 50,000  gas connections throughout the country. With the blessing of the  revolution, in these few short years more than 2 million  connections have been distributed. And there are thousands of  other examples, which I will not mention due to the shortage of  time.    In this connection, Hasanbeigi added: Nevertheless, I see  that while all these conspiracies and all this poisonous  propaganda exist, while we have received an insignificant amount  with regard to this wealthy country to reconstruct the industry  and the war-stricken regions, I must say to the dear people of  Iran that, at the same time that the so-called country, the  United States, is one of the largest debtors in the world,  comparative statistics show that the United States in 1991 was  $828 billion in debt; Austria, $32 billion; England, $325  billion; Iraq, $146 billion; Germany, $405 billion; Japan, $425  billion; and Iran in 1991, $9 billion; Sweden, $172 billion; and  France, $146 billion. Why do our enemies only publicize this  insignificant amount of Iranian debt? It is clear that the  growth and the future blossoming of our economy has made them  upset.    In conclusion, the deputy from Damghan thanked the minister  of petroleum in regards to natural gas outreach in Damghan; the  minister of energy for water outreach in Damghan and building  the Damghan dam; the minister of roads for expediting the  Sari-Semnan, Sari-Damghan, and Damghan-Esfahan-Yazd road; and  also asked the director of planning and budget to instruct the  allocation of developmental funds for Payam-e Nur University.  <H5>  Jahanshah Saddiq, Deputy From Dorud and Azna </H5>   As the last preagenda speaker, Saddiq said: While the  Islamic  world, mourning the Sire of the Pious, sees that the true owners  of Palestine are the target of the bullets of the illegitimate  usurpers in the sanctuary of the divine prophet, his holiness  Abraham, due to the incompetence of the Islamic governments and  their neglecting the directives of the leader of the Islamic  revolution in their own home, has the time not come for the  children of the intifadah to follow the directives of the grand  leader of the revolution and rescue Palestine from the claws of  the traitors of Palestine and their enemies?    He added: The enemies of Islam must know that they will be  punished with the help and power of God by the unity of Muslims  throughout the world, the guidance and leadership of the revered  leader, the perpetual presence of the Muslim people of Iran on  the scene, and retaliation for the blood of the martyrs of the  bloody Friday of Ramazan.    He thanked the people for their presence in the march on 22  Bahman [11 February] and asked them to show a united presence,  as in the past, in the Jerusalem Day ceremonies.    The speaker then continued: In the continuation of the  examination of the budget bill, it is proper for the deputies to  note that in this country there are regions that in the course  of the sacred defense were not only not included in the  developmental actions but had also offered all they had to the  victory of the revolution as a duty. Has the time not come to  pay attention to my constituency? In the course of the war, was  an important part of the share of the provinces involved  directly in the war not spent in other provinces? Is it right,  under the present circumstances, for most of the national and  provincial funds to be poured into wealthy provinces under the  pretext of finishing incomplete projects? Has the time not come  for the national planning officials to pay attention to the  concerns of the leader of the revolution with regard to the lack  of development of the province of Lorestan and declare the  province a deprived province? Does agriculture, which is given  first priority in the speeches of all the experts of the  country, hold its correct position?    Concluding, he made reminders about the problems in his  constituency.  <H5>  Ratifications </H5> <H5>  Proposal To Determine the Registered Protests That Are Not </H5> on Record    The first item on the agenda of the open session of the  Majles yesterday was the report on the second round of  discussions by the Judicial Committee concerning the proposal to  determine the registered protest cases that are not on record or  which have been eliminated in the judiciary, of which the single  article and note were ratified by the deputies.

Second, based on the illegality of the action and the lack  of  justification, instructions have been issued that the practice  be stopped. Third, after examining the cost of payers, the  amount collected by the Tea Organization, which came to 2.6  million tumans, has been returned to the farmers. Noting the  above, the committee determined that the answer of the minister  of agriculture was satisfactory.  <H5>  Amendment of the Bill To Build Passenger Terminals </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report by the Committee  on Councils and Internal Affairs of the country concerning the  bill to amend the legislative bill to build passenger terminals  and prohibit intercity passenger vehicles within the city of  Tehran, returned from the Council of Guardians, of which the  single article and articles were ratified by the deputies as  follows.

It is interesting that from Saturday the Majles will hold  open sessions in three shifts (morning, noon, and night) and in  the second round of discussions will examine the 1373 budget  expenditures. Also, today the Majles did not have an open  session.  <H5>  Holding an Exhibition for Direct Sale of Goods in Shahrud </H5>   Shahrud. RESALAT Reporter.    The exhibition for direct sale of goods was held for 10 days  by the Department of Commerce in Shahrud in that city. In this  exhibition, which was held with the cooperation of other  departments, household appliances, writing supplies, foodstuff,  academic books, and clothing were offered to the people of this  region in 15 pavilions.  <H5>  On the Margins </H5> <H5>  Bylaws Reminder of Messrs. Naderi and Astaneh </H5>   In the open session yesterday, Mr. Naderi the deputy from  Bo'in-e Zahra made a bylaws reminder concerning the inquiry and  investigation of the Ministry of Mines and Metals.    He said: An inquiry and investigation in connection with the  Ministry of Mines and Metals was ratified in the open session on  23/04/1372 [14 July 1993]. On 02/08/1372 [24 October 1993], in a  letter to the Board of Directors of the Majles, the honorable  chairman of the related committee requested an extension. The  honorable speaker of the Majles on 30/11/1372 [19 February 1994]  announced to the committee that the time for inquiry and  investigation had ended and asked that the report be submitted  immediately. On 03/12/1372 [22 February 1994], the honorable  chairman of the committee announced to the honorable speaker of  the Majles and the Board of Directors that the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee had not presented any report to the  committee. Considering the articles of the internal bylaws of  the Majles, in my opinion, this report cannot be discussed in  the Majles and is no longer valid.    After the reminder of Mr. Naderi, Mr. Astaneh also made a  reminder based on [Article] 149 of the bylaws that at the  present time a large number of inquiry and investigation issues  are on the agenda of the Majles, the legal deadlines of which  have passed. The inquiry and investigation of the steel company  also, like the rest, has taken a long time. The honorable Board  of Directors of the Majles should give more time, like in other  cases, to the inquiry and investigation of the steel [company].  The report is being prepared.

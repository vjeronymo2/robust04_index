			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DISAPPOINTING news continued to undermine the derivatives market yesterday. The futures market maintained recent trends, showing a flurry of activity in the morning and drifting off in the afternoon, writes Peter John. The FT-SE 100 future contract for December opened at 2,695 and was bought up to 2,701. Then, high German inflation figures and the realisation that Germany was not going to cut interest rates knocked December back. This disappointment was compounded by lower than forecast third-quarter figures from ICI and a 20-point fall in short sterling. The Footsie future came back to 2,658 and struggled ahead of the chancellor of the exchequer's keynote speech timed for yesterday evening. December closed at 2,677 on turnover of just over 8,200 contracts. It ended the day 35 above the underlying cash market and some 15 points above the estimated fair value premium, currently at around 20. Among traded options, total turnover of 24,637 lots was well down on the previous day with individual stock options attracting little interest. Barclays was the most active with 1,324 lots dealt as a two-way pull continued over whether the bank will cut the dividend. Lonrho was unusually busy with volume boosted by a call spread in the March series. ICI despite its impact elsewhere saw fewer than 500 lots dealt.</p>

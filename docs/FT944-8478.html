			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks follow bonds downward Wall Street US equity prices added to Thursday's losses yesterday as programme buying led to a sharp drop before shares came off their low point late in the day, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.79 at 3,815.26, . The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also fell, down 2.10 at 461.47, while the American Stock Exchange composite dipped 2.09 at 444.04. The Nasdaq composite was down 1.17 at 764.67. Trading volume on the NYSE was 357m shares. The 30-year Treasury bond, which had held flat early in the morning, fell nearly Dollars  3/8 shortly after the opening of the stock market and then bounced back a little, posting only modest declines by late afternoon. At one point the stock market slid much deeper falling more than 40 points-before recovering a little by the end of the day. Shares in major cyclical companies were mixed in spite of the weak market. Allied Signal fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 32 7/8 , Caterpillar shed Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 55 5/8 , and Dupont lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 55 1/4 . International Paper increased Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 71 7/8 . Dow Chemical fell Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 66 after the Wall Street Journal reported that a former subsidiary of the chemical company had distributed silicone breast implants in non-US markets. The disclosure could mean the Michigan-based company might have to contribute to the settlement of a lawsuit filed by women who said they were harmed by the implants. Shares in aluminium companies got a boost from news that they would increase prices charged to producers of aluminium cans. At the close Aluminum Company of America, a component of the Dow, had risen Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 83 3/4 , and Alcan Aluminium was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 . Kaiser Aluminum was unchanged at Dollars 11 1/2 . News that Amgen had bid Dollars 9.25 a share for Synergen boosted Synergen's shares Dollars 3 21/32 at Dollars 9 1/32 . Amgen shares, however, fell Dollars  3/16 to Dollars 56 7/8 after the company said it expected the acquisition to reduce its earnings. Southwest Airlines rose Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 22 3/8 after announcing that it had reached a 10-year accord with its pilots that puts off any wage increase for at least five years. Other airline companies saw their shares fall: AMR, the holding company for American Airlines fell Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 50 7/8 and UAL, United Airlines' holding company, was down Dollars 1 at Dollars 93 1/2 . Canada Toronto share prices recorded losses in the wake of news from Wall Street. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 29.31 points, or 0.71 per cent, to 4,114.53, with losers over winners 480 to 242. Volume of 49.63m shares with a value of CDollars 582.4m were down from Thursday's 57.74m worth CDollars 699.8m. The TSE 300 lost 56 points on the week. Eight of the 14 sub-indexes were down led by gold, oil, industrial product and paper stocks. Conglomerates, real estate and utility stocks made the strongest gains. Mexico Mexican equities closed sharply lower as a result of foreign selling as a result of Telefonos de Mexico's continued fall and the decline on Wall Street. The key IPC index dropped 36.1 points, or 1.46 per cent, to close at 2,429.11, slightly above its session low of 2,422.8. Volume was 71.8m shares worth a total of 672.38m new pesos. Telmex A shares fell 1.56 per cent and its L series shares were down 1.11 per cent, while Telmex ADRs closed Dollars  5/8 lower at 50 5/8 in New York.</p>

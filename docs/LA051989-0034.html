			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA ENACTS BUILDING MORATORIUM  </P> <P> The Santa Monica City Council has passed a 45-day moratorium on residential  building permits in a 14-block area north of Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> Members of the North of Wilshire Residents Group told the council last week  that their quality of life was deteriorating because of construction projects  -- mostly condominiums -- that have brought traffic, noise, air pollution, dirt  and litter to their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Councilman David Finkel, who originally proposed the ordinance, said the  moratorium will allow the council to "stop (construction) for the time being,  step back, take a breath of fresh air and let the staff do its work" in coming  up with solutions to the problems of residents.  </P> <P> The moratorium prohibits the granting of residential construction permits,  including hotels and motels, retroactive to April 28.  </P></p>

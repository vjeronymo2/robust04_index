The supplementary information section of this notice provides additional information on the changes made to Chapter 2 of the Handbook. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Margaret Milner, Acting Director of the Office of Elderly and Assisted Housing, Office of Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6130, or Albert Sullivan, Director of the Office of Multifamily Management, Room 6160, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410. Telephone number (202) 708&hyph;4542 (voice) for Ms. Milner: (202) 708&hyph;3730 for Mr. Sullivan; or (202) 708&hyph;4594 (TDD).

Members of the public, including groups representing persons with disabilities, have raised certain ``nondiscrimination'' issues with respect to those portions of Sections 2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;19 of Chapter 2 of the Handbook which relate to the identification of projects or portions of projects that are for the exclusive use of elderly persons under the following programs: Sections 221(d) (3) and (4), Section 231, and Section 236.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To clarify the Department's position on these issues, the Department has revised Sections 2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;19 of the Handbook. The Department believes that the revisions made to these sections provide clear and consistent direction to housing providers and to the HUD Field Offices on the nondiscrimination issues raised by members of the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the broad interest among housing managers, owners, residents, and other members of the public in the subject matter addressed by Chapter 2, and to ensure wide dissemination of the Department's position on these issues, the Department is taking the unusual step of publishing in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its notice to the Field Offices on the revisions made to Chapter 2. The notice is attached as Appendix A to this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing this notice, the Department also clarifies that Chapter 2 of the Handbook, and the revisions made to Chapter 2, do not implement Subtitle D of Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Subtitle D addresses the subject of ``Authority to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents and Units for Disabled Residents in Certain Section 8 Assisted Housing.'' The Department will be issuing an interim rule on Subtitle D of Title VI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 2 will remain in effect, as revised by the accompanying notice, pending the effective date of interim regulations for Subtitle D. When interim regulations for Subtitle D have been issued, the Department intends to review Chapter 2 and to make any further revisions as may be appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Roberta Achtenberg,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Nicolas P.

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: Watchdog growls at the door of the swaps dealing community Question: When is a Dollars 4,000bn monster really a Dollars 144bn pussycat? Answer: When the international swaps dealing community realises that its self-promotional enthusiasm has attracted a regulatory wolf to its door. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the trade group that represents derivatives market participants, has made a great effort in the last five years to let the world know that derivatives' trading has become a huge and vitally important business. 'Derivatives' is a catch-all term that usually represents contracts or securities whose values are pegged to traditional financial products like shares and bonds. As well as standardised contracts such as futures, traded on exchanges, a market in over-the-counter derivatives, mainly swaps, has been developed among banks and securities firms. These are products specially tailored to suit the needs of the end-user, and the market has proved highly profitable for many participants, whom ISDA represents. In an interest rate swap, one party swaps the cash flow of floating-rate liabilities for a counterparty's fixed-rate liabilities. Swap dealers act as match-makers, finding suitable counterparties or acting as counterparties themselves. Estimates of market size, supplied by ISDA, grew from Dollars 2,000bn to Dollars 4,000bn in notional value between 1991 and 1992, while the US Federal Reserve recently said the figure could be a high as Dollars 7,000bn. Regulators have become concerned about such large amounts of money exposed in novel ways to credit, settlement, market, and systemic risks. The natural response by regulators was to take a good look at the products, and determine if they needed to checked. The dealing community realised too late the mistake it had made, and began back-pedaling rapidly. It organised its own study of the market, under the cloak of the Washington-based think-tank, the Group of 30, to demystify and deflate the scope of derivatives trading. 'By any measure,' the G30 report said, 'derivatives are a major financial activity. Some have even portrayed it as a multi-trillion dollar business dwarfing activity in other financial markets. But a more careful comparison reveals that, while derivatives activity is growing rapidly, its size remains modest in relation to foreign exchange, bonds, or equities.' One ISDA board member admits that: 'It was probably a mistake to have focused on notional value (amount of the total assets) of derivatives. Notional value means nothing in relation to capital risked in derivatives trades. It has backfired on us.' To follow up on the G30 report, ISDA plans to publish 'marked to market' derivatives values in the future. These figures represent only the capital risked in a derivatives deal, and should amount to less than 5 per cent of notional value. A G30 report supplement puts market value of all over-the-counter derivatives positions at the 50 largest US bank holding companies in 1992 at only Dollars 144bn - or about 11 per cent of bank assets. Whether this slimming act will deflect regulators' concerns remains to be seen. ISDA members will convene in New York this week to discuss the G30 report and its recommendations, which lean heavily on sound management practices. Despite the conclusion by Mr Paul Volker, G30 chairman, that no new regulations are needed for derivatives trading, dealers know that important new constraints are already in the pipeline and could have a significant impact on how they do business.</p>

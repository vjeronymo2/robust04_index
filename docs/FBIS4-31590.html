			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M.B.L.: "Nuclear Waste Hidden in Kalna"] </F>   [Text] Bor -- Dr. Jovan Aleksic, minister of ecology in  the Serbian Government, on Bor Lake yesterday announced a  long-concealed truth that nuclear waste from the Vinca Institute  was hidden in the tunnels of a long-abandoned uranium mine in  Kalna near Knjazevac.    "We have followed the lead of a question raised by an  assembly deputy and discovered that there really was nuclear  waste deposited in barrels in the tunnels of the abandoned  uranium mine in Kalna," Dr. Jovan Aleksic said to reporters at a  news conference. His findings indicate that the waste  originates from the Vinca Institute, however, a question remains  whether it was the experts at this institute who did this or  some other institution that did not know what to do with the  radioactive waste.    In any case the waste will be returned to its true owner and  residents in the vicinity of Kalna will again be able to graze  their cattle on the nearby clearings. Dr. Aleksic was resolute  in his conclusion that the problem of depositing nuclear,  industrial, and any type of waste must be resolved expertly and  with considerably less harmful consequences for the human  environment.    A question remains as to who will attest to the great  damages  suffered by residents of Kalna, Mezdrej, Gabrovica, and other  nearby villages.</p>

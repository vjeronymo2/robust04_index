			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by </F> unidentified correspondent in Bratislava on 16 March -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Minister, what basic changes can  be expected in your sector after you have taken office?    [Kanis] It would not be good to speak right now about what  could be expected in the sector. I would rather stress that I  would like to follow up the trend whose foundations have been  laid by Minister Andrejcak. It is the trend of the Slovak  Republic entering the European security structures.    As you may well know, I was the author of [word indistinct]  programs of the Party of the Democratic Left, which were the  first to push through the orientation towards NATO. This fact  may have been taken into consideration in choosing a candidate  for the post of defense minister.    [Correspondent] The Slovak Republic was more successful in  concluding agreements eastward so far. Do you envisage any  change during your term of office?    [Kanis] I do not think that the republic was more successful  eastward as the Slovak Republic has achieved many successes in  becoming closer to Western European security structures. I  think that the decision on Slovakia's security orientation is  unambiguous. We only have to find appropriate (?firms) and  appropriate ways to implement this trend to strengthen the  integration into Western security structures. It is a political  as well as a military and financial issue.    [Correspondent] Do you have any conceptual solutions ready?    [Kanis] It would not be very appropriate to give you a  positive answer. [passage omitted]</p>

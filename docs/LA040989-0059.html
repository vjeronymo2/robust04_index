			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ANOTHER STRONG CASE;  </P> <P> POP STARS:***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE: **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR: *** GOOD  VIBRATIONS:** MAYBE BABY: * AIN'T THAT A SHAME;  </P> <P> PETER CASE: "THE MAN WITH THE BLUE POST-MODERN FRAGMENTED NEO-TRADITIONALIST  GUITAR." GEFFEN *** 1/2  </P> <P> Many write about the down-and-out, but few do so with the humanizing touch of  Peter Case. On his second solo album, the singer-songwriter relates what he's  seen while "standing on the corner of Walk and Don't Walk," with a feeling that  goes well beyond compassion, and with a minimum of moralizing.  </P> <P> On his 1986 solo debut, Case spun a series of vivid allegories involving  American heroes, dreamers and losers, all set to a dynamic musical tapestry. In  contrast, these songs play it straight, both musically and lyrically.  </P> <P> The arrangements draw effectively, if sometimes predictably, from various  American styles, from the acoustic country blues of the traditional "Charlie  James" to the "Highway 61 Revisited"-like, freewheeling free-association of  "This Town's a Riot." The album may not have the invention of the debut, but  the loose, personal feel makes a fine substitute.  </P> <P> The bottom line is always Case's skill as a storyteller. And though he presents  a world that seems pretty bleak, Case underscores it all with a sense of hope,  expressed in the closing testimony to faith that "someone sees the dreams we  hide."

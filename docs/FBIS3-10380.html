			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Larios] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and Economy  Minister Pablo Pereira revealed yesterday that the Public  Investments Program, which the government considers "the other  pillar" of its Economic Reactivation Plan, could collapse if the  agreement with the IMF is not signed as soon as possible.    Lacayo also announced the beginning of a "diplomatic  offensive" whereby economic cabinet ministers will travel to the  United States and Europe to "lobby several people who are  politically willing" to help us sign the agreement with the IMF.    "We want to sign it because we know that the flow of money  for the agricultural cycle and the public investment programs  depends on that agreement. However, the IMF has been very  strict and unrelenting with us," the government official stated.    The ministers of the presidency, economy, construction, and  FISE [Emergency Fund For Social Investments] appeared before the  Nicaraguan Construction Chamber to present the Public  Investments Program for 1994. They said 75 percent of the  program depends on the signing of the agreement with the IMF.    The Public Investments Program allocates 1.476 billion  cordobas for 133 projects. A total of 74 percent of the  projects worth 1.087 billion cordobas are dependent upon foreign  financing and are subject to the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility].    The agreement with the IMF is considered to be a sort of  "audit" by the international financial organizations to allow  the flow of at least $266 million to Nicaragua under the World  Bank's so-called "Economic Recovery Credit II."    According to the government's estimates, the funds assigned  to the Public Investments Program will prompt the construction  industry to grow 25 percent -- in addition to its ripple effect  on the economy -- and generate 40,000 permanent jobs in 1994.    Approximately 56 percent of the program or 825 million  cordobas would be allocated for the reactivation and  modernization of the country's economic infrastructure; 26  percent or 338 million for the rehabilitation of basic social  services; 19 percent or 282 million for the export support  infrastructure; and 2 percent to strengthen the central  government's administration.  <H5>  Ministers to Apply Pressure </H5>   As part of the "diplomatic offensive" mentioned by Lacayo,  Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger traveled to Paris and  London this Wednesday to meet with influential world banking  leaders.    Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, Foreign Minister Ernesto  Leal, and Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada left for  New York and Washington yesterday, where they expect to meet  with IMF President Michel Camdessus.    "Our main argument is that Nicaragua should have a special  status. We have found in most countries a willingness to favor  us. However, we will not see the same attitude among  international organizations because they have their standards  and deal with economic problems by dissociating themselves from  social or political problems," Lacayo said yesterday.    He added that the government will attempt to make these  organizations see that it is not only a matter of correcting the  economy but of ensuring peace and the democratic system.    "We hope we can enter the final stretch of the signing of  the  agreements with this diplomatic offensive," he observed.</p>

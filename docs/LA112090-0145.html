			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRAVIS TRITT IS REAL CERTAIN HE'S FOR REAL  </P> <P> It's a good thing Travis Tritt is an engagingly gritty performer, because it  takes that and more to rise above the young singer's love for what may be the  dullest trend in contemporary country music. Like the glut of  "how-ol'-Hank-woulda-done-it" songs in the last decade, the 27-year-old  newcomer larded his 85-minute performance at the Bandstand on Sunday with  protestations of how the music is supposed to be, instead of just shutting up  and being what it's supposed to be.  </P> <P> On the hit "Country Club," he not only ran through a litany of requisite  good-ol'-boy traits, but when he sang "I drive an old Ford pickup truck" he  interjected, "I really do!" -- as if it was some remarkable proof of what a  real guy he is. Defending his moribund mix of country and rock on "Put Some  Drive in Your Country" (as if the styles hadn't previously been paired by  everyone from Elvis and Johnny Cash on down), Tritt found it necessary to  declare: "I'm just as country as anybody you're gonna see in your entire life."  The thing is, ol' Hank and just about everybody else who had an effect on  country music sang about the life they knew, rather than just spewing out  credentials trying to prove they had a life.  </P> <P> When the material gave him a chance, Tritt showed he's certainly capable of  injecting real feeling into his music. He's an impressive singer, with a voice  like a twanged, somewhat-less-impassioned Stevie Ray Vaughan.  </P> <P> On "I'm Gonna Be Somebody" his singing rose above a hackneyed lyric to convey a  sense of blue-collar desperation and yearning. His ballad vocals on the  country-soul "If I Were a Drinker" and the hit "Help Me Hold On" earned the  screams offered by his female fans in the packed club.  </P> <P> Sporting a black, fringed and studded buckskin jacket and somewhat manicured  redneck hair and beard, Tritt definitely has his star sparkle and stage moves  down.  </P> <P> He has a competent five-piece band, though it didn't leave much of a signature  on the songs. That may be due in part to the fact that these aren't the same  Nashville studio pros who played on the records. Still, his stage outfit, which  shares the name Country Club with his debut album and song -- moved nimbly from  hard country to Southern boogie.  </P> <P> Tritt performed most of the tunes from his album, including "Dixie Flyer," "The  Road Home" and "Drift Off to Dream," as well as boogie-ized versions of Chuck  Berry's "The Promised Land" and the Doobie Bros. 1973 hit "Long Train Runnin'."  There were also a couple of unreleased numbers, including Tritt's own  hook-filled breakup song, "Here's a Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares." He  recently recorded a pair of songs with the re-formed Little Feat, "Bible Belt"  and "Time for a Change," but neither appeared in his set.  </P> <P> Incidentally, if there's a jukebox in Hell, it surely will be crowded with  those "gee-stardom-is-tough" road songs that so many artists feel compelled to  share with us, and Tritt's unrecorded essay on that theme deserves inclusion.  Given a country/space-jazz backing that fully warranted the ersatz fog that had  been rolling off the stage throughout the show, Tritt -- who only landed three  Top 10 hits (including two at No. 1) with his debut album and who is handled by  megastar manager Ken Kragen -- delivered five minutes of solid self-pity about  how rough it is up there giving away every ounce of energy he has. Jeez, if  it's all that draining, maybe he'll need to get someone to drive his pickup  truck for him.  </P></p>

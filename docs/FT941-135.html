			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Last week's episode of Murder Most Horrid, about a cunning grandmother who outwits her scheming daughter and son-in-law every time they try to bump her off, was the weakest so far, but this second series has been so much better than the first that that is not saying much. In today's story Dawn French plays travel and cookery writer Verity Hodge who moves to a little French village to hype all things French, bullying the villagers into creating the image she sells so successfully in her book (9.00 BBC2). After Episode 1, BBC1's new detective series, Grushko, shot in St Petersburg, could go either way. If the scripts sustain the interest in the problems of Russia, and move away from the cliches and stereotypes, all could be well. If not, this will be written off as just another crime series, shot on exotic locations to take advantage of financial enticements (9.30 BBC1).</p>

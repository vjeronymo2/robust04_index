			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Catchment area link to success is underlined The list of England's strongest and weakest non-selective schools at GCSE demonstrates the powerful link between a school's success and the catchment area from which it draws children. At the top of the table are comprehensives which tend to be based in wealthy suburban areas, such as Bexley Grammar in south London or George Abbot near Guildford, Surrey, or to have a well-established reputation so that they are over-subscribed, and therefore to some degree selective. Hasmonean High in north London, which has developed a nationwide reputation since newspapers started publishing league tables based on exam results, has again ranked highly on GCSE scores. It has a distinctive ethos because it is a Jewish school catering for the north London Jewish community, and cannot be described as a typical neighbourhood comprehensive. Several others have 'grammar school' in their name, indicating past traditions, although they are now non-selective. The lowest achievers at GCSE virtually all fall in urban areas and most are shown as having high truancy rates. Schools which the Department for Education listed as achieving five GCSE grade Cs for less than 10 per cent of their pupils are in a series of inner urban areas. They include: Grange Upper and Belle Vue Boys in Bradford; Broadgreen, Croxteth and John Paul II Roman Catholic High in Liverpool; Malory in London; George Dixon GM in Birmingham; Lyndhurst in Gateshead; and the Benjamin Gott High School in Leeds. Most are still maintained by their local education authority but a number of schools which have special status as part of government initiatives to revitalise education in inner cities are also among the lowest performers. For example no pupils achieved five GCSE grade Cs or better at Battersea Technology College in Wandsworth, south London, which specialises in technology. Some are near much more successful schools, leading to the claim that selective schools in big cities, often believed to have offered social mobility to able children from deprived backgrounds, have helped ensure other urban schools are even less successful. For example in Liverpool, the Blue Coat school, a comprehensive with long-rooted independent traditions and one of the highest GCSE pass-rates in the country, co-exists with several of the weakest performers. Three Birmingham schools appear in the bottom 50 in spite of the presence in the city of King Edward's and King Edward VI independent schools, which offer state assistance to children through the government's assisted places scheme, and several grammar schools. The city ranks 85th overall among English education authorities, slightly better than its level of social deprivation might indicate. Value-added studies by academics suggest that pupils at all levels of ability perform better in exams if the children surrounding them are more able. This is usually taken as an argument for selectivity, but as researchers such as Mr Peter Tymms of the University of Newcastle put it in a recent study, the finding could lead to two separate policies: 'Does it make sense to separate out the very able so that they can feed, intellectually, on one another or should their beneficial influence be as widely spread as possible?' The presence of many big independent day schools in London may also have speeded 'middle-class flight', hitting inner-city comprehensives. Only 11 per cent of pupils managed the equivalent of five O-levels at Highbury Grove in Islington, north London, where Sir Rhodes Boyson, the former Conservative education minister, was once headmaster. It serves an area hit hard by social deprivation, but many parents in the borough's pockets of affluence may have opted out of the state system. Mr David Blunkett, the Labour education spokesman, yesterday seized on these figures, promising action to deal with inner-city 'sink' schools. He said: 'Where we will do much more than this government is by acting to help those schools which are falling behind, to prevent them from becoming sink schools.' He added action was crucial in primary schools, if under-achievement at secondary schools was to be stopped.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, under the revised order processing methodology, unpreferenced market orders entered into the system will be broadcast to all NPROVE market makers at the applicable inside market for acceptance within 15 seconds, with the market maker next in rotation for an NPROVE execution receiving an indicator that the system will execute the order against him should he fail to reject the order or if no other market maker accepts the order (market orders with such notifications appended to them are referred to as ``designated, unpreferenced orders'' and orders without such a notification are referred to as ``undesignated, unpreferenced orders''). <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  If a market maker rejects a designated, unpreferenced NPROVE order and no other market maker accepts the order within the 15-second period, upon expiration of the 15-second period, the system will automatically execute the order against the market maker next in rotation who received the order on an undesignated basis that has not rejected the order. If all market makers decline the order consistent with Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 promulgated under the Act, the order will be automatically executed against the market maker next in rotation at the new inside quotation. Thus, with this proposal, Rounds 1 and 2 would be effectively collapsed into one round and Round 3 would be eliminated because orders rejected by all market makers would be executed automatically at the new inside market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Market orders matched against limit orders (preferenced or unpreferenced) priced between the inside bid or offer also will be processed pursuant to this one-round order processing procedure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 5 for a more detailed description of how market orders matching with limit orders will be processed under the NASD's proposed revision to NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, with this one-round order processing format, the NASD believes even more strongly that significant order queues will not occur in NPROVE, during normal trading days or peak volume days, and that investors will receive timely executions at prices at or superior to the quotes displayed when they entered their orders into NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD proposes, however, to retain the ability of NPROVE market makers to improve upon the inside bid or offer and achieve a ``priority market maker'' status; thus, providing a meaningful incentive for market makers to narrow their spreads. In particular, as currently proposed, when a market maker improves its bid or offer to better the inside best bid or offer and it becomes a ``priority market maker.'' Thereafter, for a short period of time (initially established as five minutes or five executions, whichever occurs first, after one or more market makers have changed their quote to equal the improved price) all unpreferenced NPROVE orders will be directed only to that market maker for acceptance within 15 seconds. The priority market maker will retain its ``priority'' status only if it does not reject an order, allow the system to automatically execute an order after 15 seconds, or a new inside has been established. Even if other market makers adjust their quotes to match the new inside quote established by the priority market maker, the priority market maker will be able to maintain its priority status, provided the priority market maker manually accepts each order within 15 seconds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the retention of the ``priority market maker'' feature, it is conceivable that an order rejected by a priority market maker could take 30 seconds to receive an execution in NPROVE. The NASD notes, however, that this potential delay will be limited to a single order directed to a priority market maker and that a delay will occur only if the market maker declines the order in compliance with Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 promulgated under the Act. If a priority market maker allows one order to execute against him automatically after 15 seconds or it manually accepts all orders, all orders sent to the market maker on a priority basis will receive an execution within 15 seconds. Moreover, unless the priority market maker declines an order at the last second, the maximum length of time the order will be delayed will be less than 30 seconds. Accordingly, in weighing the de minimis costs to the marketplace resulting from the possibility that a maximum of one order directed to any given priority market maker will be delayed for no more than 30 seconds, if at all, against the benefits to the marketplace derived from providing market makers with an incentive to narrow their spreads and improve the prices at which individual investors may execute their orders, the NASD believes it is appropriate and consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to retain the priority market maker feature of NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Automatic Execution of Preferenced Market Orders <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the NASD's desire to minimize the potential for order queues in NPROVE, the NASD is proposing to modify NPROVE to provide that preferenced market orders or marketable limit orders will be automatically executed against the preferenced market maker at the inside bid or offer displayed on Nasdaq when the order is processed through NPROVE. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  As explained in more detail in Section 5 below, preferenced market orders will only be automatically executed if they did not match against a limit order residing in NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Previously, preferenced market makers had 15 seconds to accept a preferenced market order. They could not decline the orders and, if they failed to accept them within 15 seconds, the orders would be automatically executed against them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Modifications to NPROVE's Execution Algorithm for Limit Orders to Provide Greater Limit Order Protection and Enhanced Price Improvement Opportunities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As currently proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE at a price between the spread, the next incoming market order on the opposite side of the market ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the limit order is to sell stock and the market order is to buy stock) would automatically ``pass over'' or read the limit order file to see if there are any orders residing in the limit order file at prices superior to the best bid or offer in the Nasdaq marketplace. If a limit order resides in the file at a superior price, then the market order will be flashed on the screen at that superior price for acceptance within a brief 15-second period, instead of at the inside bid or offer. In that event, all market makers at the inside quotation would have the opportunity for 15 seconds to execute the market order at the superior limit price. If no market maker elected to execute the order at that improved price, the system would execute the orders against each other at the limit price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

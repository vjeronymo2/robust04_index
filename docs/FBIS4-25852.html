			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edward Chen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- A Kaohsiung-based fishing  boat is being detained at the port of Madryn in southern  Argentina for allegedly intruding into that country's  200-nautical-mile economic zone, fishery officials confirmed  Wednesday [15 June].    The "Man Wei No. 111" was caught by an Argentine naval  patrol  ship on Saturday, the officials said. The ship was guided to  Madryn Tuesday for investigation.    A CNA dispatch from Buenos Aires, quoted the ship's agent in  Argentina as saying that the ship and its 28-member crew are all  in good condition.    The report said the satellite location recorder installed on  the Man Wei No. 111 clearly showed the ship was located at a  point 201.3 nautical miles off the Argentine coast when it was  intercepted by the Argentine patrol boat. Moreover, its radar  was not on, indicating that the ship was not operating.    Man Wei's captain, Tsai Tien-fu, had asked Argentine naval  officers to sign a statement affirming the ship's location  reading when it was intercepted to show that the boat was in  international waters, the report said.    Argentine naval authorities are still questioning Man Wei's  crew members for more information about its operations. They  may ask the Argentine court to make a ruling later this week,  the report said.    Huang Lung-yuan, Taiwan's representative in Argentina, said  he will provide the Man Wei crew with all necessary support and  assistance.    Meanwhile, fishery administrators said domestic squid prices  have risen by nearly 60 percent in recent months because of  dwindling catches.    Taiwan's squid catch stands at about 130,000 metric tons so  far this year, down 30 percent from the year-earlier level, the  officials said.    With fewer catches, the local squid wholesale price has  climbed to about NT$40 (U.S.$1.48) per kilogram, compared with  NT$22 (U.S.$0.81) recorded last year.    The officials attributed the decrease in squid catches in  part to a United Nations ban on the use of driftnets in squid  fishing. Moreover, the officials said, Argentina's attack and  sinking of a Taiwan fishing boat in waters near its economic  zone in May also adversely affected Taiwan's squid catches this  year.    As the annual squid fishing season finishes at the end of  this month, the officials said, domestic squid prices may rise  further. The unusually strong squid demand in Europe and  Mainland China this year iy also a reason behind the recent  price hikes, the officials added.</p>

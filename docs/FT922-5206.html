			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Canadians to tackle impasse in unity talks CANADIAN federal and provincial officials will spend the next week seeking to break an impasse in protracted national unity talks aimed at forestalling the separatist movement in Quebec. Talks broke off at the weekend with deep rifts among the nine English-speaking provinces. Failure to break the deadlock soon may leave Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister, with little choice but to call a national referendum on the federal government's favoured proposals. Mr Joe Clark, constitutional affairs minister, and his provincial counterparts had met over the past three months in an attempt to craft a new constitution before a self-imposed deadline of May 31. Ottawa is keen to present a package of constitutional reforms to Quebec well before October, when the Francophone province is scheduled to hold its own referendum. Although support for independence has recently waned, there is concern that separatist fervour could be reignited by failure among the other nine provinces to agree a package acceptable to Quebec. Among the thorniest issues is reform of the Senate, the upper house of parliament. There is consensus that the body, which at present consists entirely of appointed members, should be elected. But several western and Atlantic provinces, led by Alberta, are pushing  - against opposition from Ontario and Quebec - for a body with wide powers and equal representation from each province. Alberta insists it will not accede to some of Quebec's key demands unless its Senate reform proposals are accepted. The federal government, which is keen to bring negotiations to a decisive end, has been pressing ahead with preparations for a national referendum, a last-ditch solution. Parliament passed an enabling bill last month and the government has launched a national advertising blitz aimed at promoting national unity.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Abolition of Cleveland council is proposed THE ABOLITION of Cleveland county council and seven of County Durham's eight district councils was proposed yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England. The commission, set up last July to review the two-tier local government structure, recommends unitary councils for Cleveland and County Durham in its first published recommendations for a mainland area. It suggests areas in Cleveland north of the Tees should be restored to County Durham and those to the south of the Tees to Yorkshire for ceremonial and cultural purposes. Under this proposal Stockton will have areas in both Durham and Yorkshire. The commission proposes that in Cleveland the four district councils - Hartlepool, Langbaurgh, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees - should have unitary status. It says there should be two councils in County Durham, one for Darlington and one for the rest of the county. The proposals, which will be put out to public consultation, were welcomed by the councils which would survive, all Labour-controlled. But Mr Paul Harford, leader of Labour-controlled Cleveland county council, condemned the plans as a 'political fix' by the Tories - a claim strongly rejected by Sir John Banham, the commission chairman. The Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry criticised the plan to abolish Cleveland county council. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern CBI chairman, condemned the return of areas to Durham and Yorkshire for ceremonial and cultural purposes as 'crazy'. He said: 'It will cause a terrible schizophrenia. It's marching boldly backward to what we had pre-1968.' The Association of District Councils welcomed unitary status for Cleveland's districts and Darlington, but said the proposed Durham county council would cover too big an area. But Mr Robin Wendt, secretary of the Tory-dominated Association of County Councils, disagreed. He said the commission had followed the right logic in Durham, but needed to think again about Cleveland. Sir John said in launching the proposals that the commission believed the new structure would be efficient and cost-effective, and would reflect the identity of communities. But if the public said the plans should be thrown out, he said, they would be. The commission said its proposals would save more than Pounds 25m a year - an annual saving of Pounds 46 a household in Cleveland and Pounds 65 a household in County Durham - once transitional costs of Pounds 28.8m have been met. Of the 52,000 jobs in the councils, 50,000 would be unaffected. The commission will make a final recommendation to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, by November. It has started work on its review of Leicestershire. Proposals for Derbyshire are to be published on Monday, followed by Avon, Gloucestershire and Somerset on June 14 and Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire on June 21. Observer, Page 17</p>

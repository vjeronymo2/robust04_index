			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CZECH LEADERS AGREE TO SHARING OF POWER;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: EMBATTLED COMMUNISTS TELL REFORMERS THEY ARE WELCOME INTO THE  GOVERNMENT. THOUSANDS CONTINUE PROTESTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec, in a sharp about-face, said today that  non-Communists could join the government, but more than 200,000 protesters  still took to the streets of Prague demanding the resignation of hard-line  party leader Milos Jakes.  </P> <P> The crowd jammed into the central Wenceslas Square only hours after Adamec was  quoted as telling a group of dissidents that non-Communists could join the  government.  </P> <P> He also said the authorities would talk to the Charter 77 human rights  movement.  </P> <P> One of the participants at Adamec's meeting, journalist Michael Horacek, quoted  the prime minister as saying there would be no more police action similar to  last Friday's, when a demonstration by 50,000 people was violently suppressed  by security forces.  </P> <P> Adamec also announced an official inquiry into the police action, in which at  least 38 people were injured.  </P> <P> "He said there would be no massacre, no martial law," Horacek, who took part in  the meeting as a mediator, told a reporter.  </P> <P> Today's unprecedented meeting came a day after more than 200,000 people marched  through Prague and in other cities calling for the resignation of the Communist  leadership and free elections.  </P> <P> Despite Adamec's reassurances, some students gathering in Wenceslas Square said  the switchboard at their faculty building had received calls warning them  security forces had orders to shoot at demonstrators.  </P> <P> As the pace of events picked up dramatically, the country's Roman Catholic  Primate, Archbishop Frantisek Tomasek, added his voice to the growing chorus  demanding change.  </P> <P> Calling for a democratic government, he said in a statement: "We must not wait,  it is necessary to act. Raise your voices, all of you, no one should stand  aside."  </P> <P> Official accounts of Friday's demonstration have said 38 people were injured  and eight are still hospitalized. Witnesses have said the number of people hurt  was more.  </P> <P> New protests were also staged today in the provinces, official Czechoslovak  Radio said.  </P> <P> It said 3,000 young people massed in the country's second largest city,  Bratislava. The participants marched in procession to Hviezdoslav Square and  later dispersed peacefully.  </P> <P> The radio said students went on strike at Bratislava University but the campus  was calm.  </P> <P> CTK news agency said universities also stopped classes at Kosice, Banska  Bystrica and Zvolen.  </P></p>

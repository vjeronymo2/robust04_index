			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Bonbons for the backbenches He was masterly. He could win a party election for prime minister this morning, and, as prime minister, a general election in a good year. Never mind the economy. Forget about the interests of the country. Cast aside thoughts of the public sector borrowing requirement. This was the most political of Budgets, delivered by the most political of chancellors since the late Harold Macmillan. The purpose of Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech was to unite the Conservatives - behind Mr John Major if possible, behind himself if necessary. His first task was to save the government; his long-term aim to ensure a fifth Conservative victory in a row. If yesterday's Budget speech has not taken at least the first trick, nothing will; as to the second, Fate may have other plans. Since he is chancellor, Mr Clarke had to demonstrate a determination to pursue the path of fiscal responsibility, without inventing new taxes that backbench Tory rebels might threaten to overturn. If he could manage that, he could hope to be in a position to cut personal income taxes when the Conservatives next have to face the electorate. Alternatively he had to find a seemingly painless way of cutting public spending. If that was not possible, the hardship had to be borne by unpopular groups like the unemployed and the supposedly sham disabled. He achieved all of this, and more, with panache. He took full advantage of the opportunity open to him as presenter of the first unified tax and spending Budget, delivering a broad-brush account of government policy as a whole. At times, as he reminded us of the many departments he has managed (health, education, the Home Office, a spell at industry), he seemed to be the prime minister so many people long for. He was affable, which was no surprise. His speech was intelligible without being lightweight, which may have come as news to some in his audience. He was coherent, apparently in command of all facets of government, in control of the House, rhetorical where appropriate, possessed of a view of what government should do - in a word, a chancellor with grip, standing confidently beside a seated prime minister who has been accused of lacking in that commodity. Do not misunderstand me. We all know that Budgets that are well-received on the day of delivery often turn out to be turkeys. The same may be true of yesterday's effort - as a Budget. We shall soon see. It is also clear, even at this early stage, that the long-term structural defects of the British polity remain in place today; the chancellor did not touch upon those. Again, the Budget was remarkable for its timidity in tackling pressure groups. Mr Clarke contented himself with brushing aside lobbyists, such as the brewers, with an empty boast. Yet as a shameless political statement, an election manifesto, this was the stuff the Conservatives have been missing for three years. Its effect may not last; that depends upon events beyond any chancellor's control. But the memory will linger. Consider his fiscal balancing act. Not too much immediate pain, to get the government through the next year; not inordinate pain later on, to get it through the next election. The price of cigarettes, as of petrol and wine, goes up at once. British voters are accustomed to that, at least in the early years of a new government. Beer was left alone. How else could Mr Clarke face his mates in the great British pub? There is the customary disguised increase in income tax, achieved by freezing allowances next April; the pension age for women is to be raised to 65 - from the year 2010. Of considerably more importance is the fact that the chancellor managed to produce most of next year's reduction in the budget deficit by cutting projected expenditure. Much of this cut is the result of a public sector pay freeze, presented as tight control of the central administration. Mr Clarke has therefore not made the political error of raising the rates of income tax, thus providing a hostage to political fortune. Would he ever? You can almost see him grin as he announces in, say, November 1995 that the 20p income tax band is to be trebled in April 1996 and that, by the by, there will be an election in May. All that is tomorrow's politics. Mr Clarke was careful to pay full attention to today's. Concerned about the forthcoming imposition of VAT on fuel bills? The chancellor elaborated tight-fisted plans to compensate, to the penny but no more, all recipients of income support. Worried about losing by-elections to the grey vote? The VAT compensation is extended to all pensioners. On top of that, a guaranteed income bond will reassure the many old dears hurt by falling interest rates on their building society deposits. Tell them that in Christchurch. Labour going on about tax loopholes? Mr Clarke obligingly closed Pounds 2bn worth, and derided the opposition for talking of five times as much. Uneasy about the tightening up of unemployment benefit, the introduction of near workfare, and the new rules for invalidity payments? Soothe your conscience with the new allowance for childcare for low earners on family credit. This last is a classic example of Mr Clarke's way of proclaiming his own political philosophy without upsetting anyone. Right-wingers have attacked single parents; Mr Clarke says he will to help them get back to work - and heaps fulsome praise on Mr Michael Portillo, leader of the right. His speech was nevertheless peppered with references to the European Union, as if to remind everyone that he is in favour of our continuing and constructive membership thereof. The list of political debts paid, traps avoided, useful phrases laid down for future reference, and egos massaged is too long to rehearse here. Small businesses may yet be able to charge interest to late payers. The smallest will not require an audit. Investment in unquoted companies is to be encouraged by several means. There will be venture capital trusts and an enterprise investment scheme. It was as if the chancellor was facing, not the opposition, but the benches behind him, and casting out bonbons to each cluster of interested parties. His use of words is also purely political. Not for our chancellor the 'if it isn't hurting it isn't working' of Mr Major when he had the job, or the 'price well worth paying' characterisation of unemployment by his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont. 'A good social security system, under which the better off and people in work pay to support the poor and the disadvantaged, is an essential feature of a modern civilised state,' says Mr Clarke, cutting social security. 'Why should the bus driver or the pensioner . . . pay higher taxes to finance the living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?' he asks, while cutting student grants. Mr Major grinned admiringly and tapped Mr Clarke, the lawyer, on the behind with his papers as the chancellor said that.</p>

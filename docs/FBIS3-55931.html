			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's </F> national security adviser, by Andrey Poleshchuk in the "Power"  column: "Yuriy Baturin: `I Have Been Taught Not To Be Afraid  of Difficult Problems.' On Christmas Eve He Was Appointed the  Russian President's First National Security Adviser"]    [Excerpts] [Poleshchuk] People in this country have grown  accustomed to frequent cadre reshuffles and structural changes  in the upper echelons of power. Still, the introduction of the  post of the Russian president's national security adviser has  come as a great surprise. If only because, if I am not  mistaken, there has not been the slightest leak of information  about the upcoming event, although such leaks have become almost  commonplace recently. Was it a surprise to you also?    [Baturin] Yes, it was a total surprise to me.    [Poleshchuk] You did not undertake any efforts along these  lines?    [Baturin] It had never even occurred to me to work in this  direction. And, as you have stated quite correctly, there have  been no leaks. I did not know anything about it. This  obviously suggests that the decision has been made either by the  president himself or that he has discussed this matter with an  extremely narrow circle of people. [passage omitted]    [Poleshchuk] Was it a coincidence that a decision to  introduce the post of national security adviser was made on the  eve of President Clinton's visit to Moscow? Is there not some  hidden implication, some "second trunk bottom" here?    [Baturin] I cannot respond to this question for reasons I  have already explained. But I think that indirectly this could  have produced an impact. In recent days Boris Nikolayevich has  been making very thorough preparations for the meeting with  President Clinton. And apparently he has been constantly  mindful of such an efficient U.S. state structure. In other  words, this factor could be seen as a general background. But  again, this is merely supposition. It is not worth trying to  guess at what the president thinks. It is better simply to ask  him.    [Poleshchuk] Have you been actively involved in preparing  the meeting with the U.S. President?    [Baturin] No, I would say that the president has an aide on  international affairs, Dmitriy Ryurikov, who has been long and  thoroughly preparing this meeting. At this point perhaps I  could join in. But then too little time has passed since my  appointment to get engaged in this work. [passage omitted]    [Poleshchuk] How would you respond to this statement: The  post of the national security adviser is extremely necessary for  the country's leadership today amid the dramatic reforms in the  power departments, in particular the Security Ministry? The  president needs an absolutely trustworthy man who will oversee  the power ministries....    [Baturin] This reasoning is quite rational. And such ideas  have long been expressed to the president, for instance in the  course of his meetings with Presidential Council members. As  far as I could see, the president listened to all of that but  showed no reaction -- either positive or negative. At least, in  my presence. [passage omitted]    [Poleshchuk] And with respect to your personal contacts with  the "power ministers," are you familiar with them? Have you had  any contacts? Have you been in conflict?    [Baturin] I had not met Nikolay Mikhaylovich Golushko (head  of the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- A. P.) until last  August. I first saw him at close quarters during a session of  the Security Council's interdepartmental commission where I was  present as a presidential aide. Then there were a few casual  meetings in the corridors without any conversations. The same  goes for Stepashin (Golushko's first deputy -- A. P.). I first  had a detailed talk with him at the end of December, when the  president tasked me to take part in preparing a statute on the  Federal Counterintelligence Service. I have known Yevgeniy  Maksimovich Primakov (director of the Foreign Intelligence  Service -- A. P.) since the end of the 80's. After all, he also  comes from the academic world but he belonged to another weight  category and we had no close contacts. I had an exhaustive  conversation with Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev  (commander in chief of the Russian border troops -- A. P.) after  my appointment. Incidentally, many were wondering whether he  would be able to command the border guards. I would say that as  chief of the border service he has produced a very favorable  impression on me. Just like Golushko, I have met Viktor  Fedorovich Yerin (internal affairs minister -- A. P.) only at  various sessions. We were not closely familiar.    [Poleshchuk] A new post apparently presupposes the  existence of a national security concept....    [Baturin] The concept has been there and it continues to be  developed. Now there is a law on security: It was elaborated  on the basis of a certain security concept. The law was adopted  but work on the concept has not stopped: It must change all the  time to keep in tune with the changing conditions. And  conditions today are changing very fast.    [Poleshchuk] But will a readable text be finally produced?    [Baturin] I think so. At any rate, this was done in the  Security Council. Of course, now I shall be taking part in  this. And apparently I will somehow influence the content of  this concept.    [Poleshchuk] Does the introduction of the post of national  security adviser mean that he automatically becomes head of the  Security Council?    [Baturin] No.    [Poleshchuk] Up to now the question about adopting a concept  on the Federal Counterintelligence Service remains open,  although according to some reports, the text of the document was  ready by the day of President Yeltsin's 21 December 1993 edict  abolishing the Russian Federation Security Ministry. When, in  your opinion, should the concept's approval be expected?    [Baturin] I am afraid that you are in a little hurry here.  The adoption of the Statue on the Federal Counterintelligence  Service is a kind of foundation. But still there is a lot that  remains to be done there. It is also necessary to carry through  the reforms. The options are as follows. Either this concept  existed before and is now being implemented, but I do not think  that this is the best hypothesis. Or the building of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service began not according to a  detailed plan but according to a general outline proposed by  someone. In this case this work must be finalized as soon as  possible. Because a gap in reforms at the center and at the  local level can be very dangerous. And once the entire  framework of the Federal Counterintelligence Service has become  clear and obvious, then we can see how good and effective is the  concept which existed either in full or as a general outline.  And then improve on it. I think that this version more  corresponds to the truth. [passage omitted]    [Poleshchuk] You are known as one of the main architects of  a large number of documents defining Russia's present  development. How do you envision the country's immediate future?  What would you say to those who say that Russia is consistently  moving toward tough authoritarian rule?    [Baturin] Indeed, this is so. The adopted constitution  provides for a model of tough authority. But the strength and  toughness of authority lies not only and not so much in the  model that exists in the constitution, in the minds or in public  consciousness. It is also in how far the plans and decisions of  this authority can be implemented. And many decisions -- I mean  not only those by the president but also the government and the  former Supreme Soviet -- were not obeyed. And this fact  strongly undermines the version about dictatorship and a tough  authoritarian hand. But the historical movement, the trend....  Quite naturally, after the pendulum has swung toward  democratization to such an extent when it began to verge on  anarchy, it has swung to the other side. But the pendulum will  not freeze at this point and will soon start moving back. There  is much of what is dangerous and unpleasant but there is nothing  fatally terrible. [passage omitted]</p>

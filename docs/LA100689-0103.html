			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEWIS AND JOHNSON MEET BUT DON'T SPEAK  </P> <P> World-class sprinters Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis had their first showdown since  the Seoul Olympics Thursday, with Lewis upstaging his rival in an unlikely  setting -- a Capitol Hill news conference.  </P> <P> Johnson, the Canadian runner stripped of the 100-meter gold medal in last  year's Olympics after he tested positive for steroids, was in Washington  supporting the introduction of legislation to impose new restrictions on  performance-enhancing drugs.  </P> <P> Lewis, the American sprinter who was awarded the gold medal upon Johnson's  disqualification, said he was in town doing research for a soon-to-be-completed  autobiography and dropped in on the gathering to lend his support.  </P> <P> But the American stole the show when California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles)  was summoned to a vote on the House floor and had Johnson whisked from the room  until he could return. The crowd then turned to Lewis, who sat through the  event virtually unnoticed until Johnson's departure.  </P> <P> "I don't understand why Ben Johnson is here," said Lewis, a noted champion of  stricter regulations on steroids, in response to a question. "But if he wants  to speak out against drugs, that's fine. . . . There's no question my support  is behind this 100%."  </P> <P> When Johnson and Levine returned five minutes later, they reclaimed the  audience's attention. Johnson, 27, said that he started taking the drugs when  he was 19 because he believed he would need them to compete at a world-class  level.  </P> <P> "But I'm here to point out that it's wrong to take (steroids)," said the  Jamaican-born athlete. "Anybody who gets caught taking it is going to be  punished. I paid my price and I'm here to come forward and to say that I won't  make the same mistake again."  </P> <P> Asked later about the stricter punishments proposed by the measure, Johnson  said that they would not have deterred him from using steroids, synthetic  hormones that promote muscle bulk and increased strength and speed.  </P> <P> Despite recent rumors about a Johnson-Lewis match race and a longstanding media  feud that has intensified in the year since the Seoul Olympics, the track stars  never exchanged words -- only momentary glances.  </P> <P> The steroid legislation, introduced by Levine and co-sponsored by Reps. Henry  A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Benjamin J. Gilman (R-N.Y.), would place a list  of steroids on Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act along with street  drugs such as cocaine.  </P> <P> Schedule II drugs are subject to the most stringent governmental controls  imposed on drugs with recognized medical uses.  </P> <P> The legislation provides for a maximum 20-year prison term for illegal  distribution of steroids, along with a maximum of one year for possession.  </P> <P> "These are stiff sentences," Levine said. "But they are clearly justified by  the dangers that these drugs pose to the health of the young people in this  country."  </P> <P> Gary Wadler, co-author of "Drugs and the Athlete" and the chief physician of  the U.S. Open tennis championships, said that steroid use can trigger several  serious side effects, such as heart and liver damage, sterility, violent mood  shifts and hair loss.  </P> <P> Several groups already have voiced support for the measure, including the U.S.  Olympic Committee, the National Football League, the National Federation of  State High School Assns. and the International Federation of Bodybuilders.  </P></p>

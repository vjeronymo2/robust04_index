			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: FOR SOME ADVERTISERS, PRINT PARODIES ARE BECOMING SERIOUS BUSINESS  </P> <P> Every year, Daniel Simons spends nearly a quarter of a million dollars on print  ads targeted at bald men in search of nirvana. These ads are almost always the  same: pictures of bald men before and after Simons' hair replacement company  has woven its magic on them.  </P> <P> But lately, the response to these ads has been wearing, well, thin. So Simons  decided to do something about it. Although he kept the same "before" photo in  the ad, he replaced the "after" shot with a photograph of a dog. An Irish  setter, to be precise.  </P> <P> "The picture of the dog gets people to read the ad," said Simons, president of  Los Angeles-based Hair Care Replacement Center Inc. "That's all we want." What  he didn't want -- or expect -- was a deluge of phone calls. Some came from  advertising aficionados asking him who created the ad. (Answer: He did). But  others were angry calls from dog lovers, incensed that he "demeaned" the dog by  placing it in the ad.  </P> <P> Marketing experts say parody ads -- especially in print -- are perhaps the most  difficult ads to pull off. And parody ads are even more difficult when they  satirize an entire category of advertising. In that arena, Simons has some  company. These days, even missing children are not immune from advertising  satire.  </P> <P> Who hasn't received those throwaway post cards that have advertisements on the  back and pictures of missing children on the front? Well, last week, a small  Los Angeles radio production company sent its own version of the post cards to  ad executives nationwide. In the right-hand corner of the cards, above the bold  words, "Have you seen me?" they replaced the usual shots of missing children  with zany photos of grown-ups who look, at best, deranged.  </P> <P> Why are some print advertisers turning to parody in pictures -- something more  commonly associated with TV commercials?  </P> <P> "The TV generation is better at looking at pictures than at concentrating on  words," said John O'Shaughnessy, professor of marketing at Columbia University  in New York. "People view life through metaphors. A pictorial metaphor can be a  dramatic way to make a point," said O'Shaughnessy. "I'm certain you'll see more  of these."  </P> <P> Certainly, parody ads are a hot item on TV these days. Some regional  advertisers have already run parodies of the Zen-like Infiniti ads that show  flocks of geese and crashing waves. It didn't take long for McDonald's to run a  parody of those AT&amp;T commercials that show employees talking about the  phone company's business service. And in a new totally offbeat parody of  familiar testimonial TV ads, Nexxus, which makes hair-care products, features a  rancher praising how well Nexxus conditions hair -- on his prize bull.  </P> <P> But ad executives say it is far more difficult to get the humor of parody  across in print than broadcast advertising.  </P> <P> "A print ad doesn't have as easily accessible a tone of voice as a TV or radio  ad," said Bob Hoffman, president of Hoffman Creative Services, a San Francisco  agency.  </P> <P> "On TV, you have sight, sound and motion," adds Leonard Pearlstein, president  of the Los Angeles agency Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. "Clients worry about the  subtlety of parody being lost in print."  </P> <P> That didn't stop Sarley, Bigg &amp; Bedder from mailing out the missing  children parody post cards. In the place under the photo that usually has the  hot line phone number, the company substituted its own phone number.  </P> <P> "Everyone has received these missing children post cards," said John Sarley,  president of the production company, who co-created the mailer along with Jerry  Leibowitz. "But when people start sorting through their mail, they look at our  post cards and say, 'What the heck is this?' We figured if we can make someone  smile, sooner or later they'll call us."  </P> <P> Even the national organization behind the real missing children ads is smiling.  Sort of.  </P> <P> "Our first reaction was, this is pretty humorous," said Ernie Allen, president  of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. "We are, however,  concerned about something as serious as this is being parodied. But we are not  offended. This is proof of the saturation that the program has had."  </P> <P> But plenty of dog owners are offended by the Hair Replacement Center ads.  </P> <P> "We received about a half dozen calls from people who felt it was disgraceful,"  said Simons. "But as far as I can tell, the only thing the dogs get out of this  is fame."  </P> <P> So, Simons now says he wants people to send him photographs of their dogs. And  those dogs with the most homely looking mugs may be used in future ads. "You  can't please everyone," said Simons. "But this is bound to hit home with some  people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hal Riney &amp; Partners Says It Is Not for Sale  </P> <P> Despite rumors to the contrary, Hal Riney &amp; Partners is not for sale.  </P> <P> At least that was the word Monday from Jim Travis, the New York-based president  and chief operating officer of the San Francisco agency that created the  original Bartles &amp; Jaymes ads. Hal Riney, the agency's founder, was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> "We are not for sale," said Travis. "We have not talked with anyone, we are not  now talking with anyone, and we have no plans to talk with anyone," he said.  </P> <P> The trade magazine Advertising Age quoted an unidentified source Monday who  said Hal Riney had talked with a London-based agency about purchasing part of  the company. "There's nothing to that," said Travis. "The bad part is, every  time this gets reported, we have to call all our clients and tell them it's not  true."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Here Comes the Bride's With Lots of Ads Inside  </P> <P> Here's one bride who came dressed to kill. The February/March issue of Bride's  magazine weighs in at a hefty 3.8 pounds -- making it the largest consumer  magazine ever published, according to Publisher Elliot Marion.  </P> <P> The magazine, which totals 1,040 pages, is fattened by 802 pages of  advertising. The publication is nearly 100 pages larger than last year's spring  issue -- the time of year when many couples plan their weddings. Marion has  sent the issue to the "Guinness Book of World Records," hoping that it will be  officially recognized as the largest consumer magazine ever published.  </P> <P> Ilissa -- a maker of bridal gowns -- purchased nearly 100 pages of advertising  in the issue, said Marion. Such ads can cost upward of $10,000 a page. And this  one issue brought publisher Conde Nast more than $10 million in advertising  revenue, Marion estimated.  </P> <P> What about the postage costs? Marion figures that it cost his company about  $2.40 to mail each copy. Of course, 98% of the magazine's circulation is from  newsstand sales. "Thank heaven for that," Marion said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Graphic Safety Message in Poster Campaign  </P> <P> Larry Asher had all but given up on his task of creating a print ad campaign  aimed at showing youngsters that kids who are hit by cars can be killed.  </P> <P> Obviously, he couldn't show 4-year-olds pictures of dead children. But shortly  before the campaign was due, Asher, creative director at the Seattle agency  Borders, Perrin &amp; Norrander, was walking with his 2-year-old daughter in  the garden outside their home. There, his daughter found a dead bird -- and she  was totally baffled by it.  </P> <P> "It was the first time I'd ever tried to explain to her what death is," said  Asher. That gave him the idea to create posters directed at 3- to 9-year-olds  that would link the death of small animals to cars. The posters were for the  Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center in Seattle.  </P> <P> In three graphic posters, the ads show what frogs, snakes and squirrels look  like before and after they have been run over by cars. Unlike  "before-and-after" ads for miracle diets, the "before" pictures look delightful  and the "after" pictures look pathetic. Underneath the photos is the headline:  Cars Kill.  </P> <P> No animals were killed to create the campaign, insists Asher. In fact, he said  it took the photographer nearly three weeks to locate a frog, snake and  squirrel that were already killed. Of course, the animals' dead bodies were  rearranged a bit to be positioned something like the live ones, Asher said.  </P> <P> Is all this a bit too graphic for youngsters? "Not all the schools in this area  are using this poster," said Asher, "but we feel it stimulates conversation.  And if one less kid is run over by a car because of this ad, well, that's a  tradeoff we'll take any day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calling All Cars: Tattle on Air Polluters  </P> <P> The clean-air fink squad is looking for a few good tattlers.  </P> <P> And you can join by simply calling 1-800-CUT SMOG the next time that you see a  car belching thick, black smoke from its tailpipe.  </P> <P> That is the message behind a new ad campaign for the South Coast Air Quality  Management District. The group wants to double the estimated 130,000 calls and  letters that it received last year from Los Angeles area residents who reported  smoking vehicles.  </P> <P> Its new billboard campaign shows a picture of a car with thick smoke coming out  of the exhaust pipe. "Report this Crime," the ad says, above the special 800  phone number. The campaign was created by the Santa Monica agency Suissa &amp;  Associates. "It's a tattle-tale campaign," said David Suissa, president of the  agency. "Now, you can do something about air pollution just by picking up your  car phone."  </P></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (6): Eastern markets expand - Opportunity knocks for machinery makers THE world's food equipment manufacturers can look forward to some mouth-watering prospects in the 1990s, even if the start of the decade has shown that - contrary to the belief of some in the industry - they are not recession-proof. In spite of a series of takeovers in the 1980s by the two biggest players, APV of the UK and Sweden's Alfa-Laval, the industry remains fragmented by different worldwide fashions in food. APV, the world leader, had sales of Pounds 928m last year, almost all of which was in the food business, which compares with its own estimate of Pounds 11.5bn for the world market. But the more ambitious companies have realised for some time that the juiciest prizes in the next few years - in eastern Europe and the Far East - will go to those with the financial staying power and geographical spread to match the increasingly international outlook of the big food processors. 'As the market place changes, and some of the medium-sized customers disappear, suppliers will have to come into line,' says Mr Bo Wirsen, president of Alfa-Laval's food business. Until very recently, the gradual process of concentration in the industry was characterised by horizontal integration. APV's transformation since the mid-1980s is the clearest example: through the takeovers of Baker Perkins, the UK bakery and confectionery equipment producer, Pasilac, a big Danish dairy equipment maker, and Rosista, the German producer of carbonated drink equipment, APV has doubled in size and gained the broadest product range in the industry. At the same time APV has made a number of smaller acquisitions, with the principal aim, says Mr Neil French, finance director, of filling a specific gap in the product range. These deals reflect the continuing attraction of small companies with a strong position in a market niche. APV nearly bit off more than it could chew, however, and Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, says that, with eight takeovers in 1989, it had to spend considerable management time on handling the new arrivals. The City was relieved to see APV make just one small acquisition in 1990, the NZDollars 8.4m (Pounds 2.88m) purchase of Moffat Appliances, a New Zealand catering equipment producer. Alfa-Laval has also been on the takeover trail, making six acquisitions in its food business over the last four years, but it was its own takeover, agreed in January, which created an important precedent for the food equipment industry. In the industry's first significant attempt at vertical integration Tetra Pak, the Swedish-owned milk and juice packaging group, is paying SKr 16.25bn (Pounds 1.53bn) for Alfa-Laval, of which food equipment is only the second biggest sector after industrial equipment. Mr Wirsen says the deal is 'a rather logical type of integration,' but in March the European Commission said it had 'serious doubts' about the merger on competition grounds and announced a full inquiry. The Commission said the combination of the two companies' products could create or strengthen a dominant position in the EC food processing machine sector or the packaging sector. 'Its competitors are able to provide either food processing or packaging machines, but not both,' it said. That, however, is debatable. Mr Wirsen stresses that Alfa-Laval will be keen to ensure it continues to do business with competitors of Tetra Pak and, in the short-term, co-operation between the two companies will be limited to possible co-ordination of marketing and servicing at the request of customers. In the longer term, though, Mr Wirsen hopes the link-up will aid the search for new and improved technical solutions in liquid engineering, especially in situations where it would require the two viewpoints to spot an opportunity. The Alfa-Laval takeover creates two very different companies at the top of the industry, and the split is emphasised by recent disposals at APV which focus it even more on the core business of food processing equipment. The medium-sized equipment suppliers running behind APV and Alfa-Laval might be tempted to try vertical integration of their own, attracted by the prospect of offering 'one-stop shopping' for customers. Failing that, the traditional type of horizontal merger will still hold sway. An example was a deal in March between two Lancashire companies which saw Petrie and McNaught buying from Greenbank Engineering the rights to two new processes which combine hot air and radio frequency energy to bake foods. It is in small, entrepreneurial companies such as these that some of the industry's brightest ideas start, although generally the equipment producers see themselves as a service industry responding to food manufacturers' needs rather than shaping them. 'We don't try to second-guess our customers,' says Sir Peter. But rising development costs, and the need to respond more quickly and substantially to customers' expansion plans, suggest that in the 1990s the smaller players will increasingly be selling their ideas rather than developing them in-house. APV, for example, has acquired the technology to produce so-called 'Sintermatic sausages,' skinless sausages which are kept from falling apart by coagulation of protein around the edge of the product. APV is spending about Pounds 500,000 developing the machinery to produce these sausages, which will save processors from buying sausage skins and even offer the intriguing prospect of new shapes for sausages. Small companies will also find it difficult to offer their clients facilities that might help the larger groups win big contracts. APV's Pounds 30m-plus factory being built at Peterborough will have a research laboratory next door with rooms where customers can use APV equipment to develop their products. This investment should help APV benefit from any upturn in markets currently suffering from difficult trading conditions, such as the UK and US. The company has undoubtedly been much harder hit by recession than its Swedish rival: while Alfa-Laval's food business lifted profits by 50 per cent last year to SKr357m, APV suffered a 34 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.2m. The discrepancy partly reflects the fact that Alfa-Laval has concentrated on fewer customer segments and made more progress than its UK rival in assimilating its acquisitions and introducing operating efficiencies. But APV is catching up, and Sir Peter is encouraged by prospects in the UK, which suggest that the current reluctance by customers to commit to orders is due to short-term economic factors. In the long-term, two key factors justify the industry's optimism. In western markets, the maturity of the food industry will encourage a never-ending search for new ideas, and that will normally produce orders for new equipment. According to a report in February by Frost &amp; Sullivan, greater demand for snack and thermoformed pack foods is likely to boost European sales of form, fill and seal machines from Dollars 720.5m in 1989 to Dollars 1.18bn by 1995. The largely untapped markets of the Third World and eastern Europe provide the second big opportunity for the western equipment manufacturers. In the Third World, Mr French hopes that the next decade will see countries achieving the level of GNP where processed food takes over from more basic fare. Eastern Europe has already produced a few significant orders, notably APV's Pounds 50m contract in 1989 for ten breakfast cereal lines in the Soviet Union and a similarly-sized deal won by Alfa-Laval to provide ten margarine plants. However, although democratisation in eastern Europe has brought more inquiries, it has yet to be matched by much business, says Mr Wirsen. The problem, of course, is money. In eastern Germany, however, German financing is available and APV hopes to take advantage of this by selling equipment made by western German subsidiaries.</p>

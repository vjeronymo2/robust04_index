			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (29): An enigmatic survivor / Profile of General Ibrahim Babangida THE combination of an engaging but enigmatic personality, a soldier's ruthlessness and a politician's adaptability, have kept General Ibrahim Babangida in one of Africa's toughest jobs for nearly seven years. It is too soon for a definitive assessment of the man who seized power in a palace coup in August 1985. But it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that he and his government have fallen far short of the admittedly ambitious objectives the president set himself not long after taking office: the inculcation of a 'new socio-political order' and the implementation of a structural adjustment programme that would transform the economy. Corruption remains endemic, an attempt to create a so-called 'new breed' of politicians has failed, and the adjustment programme is in serious difficulties. The creation of nine new states last year seems ill-advised. The move may have some benefits: it continues the fragmentation of ethnic and regional blocks and further blurs the potentially dangerous north-south divide. But the country cannot afford nine new state administrations and the necessary infrastructure. To many observers, the decision smacked of patronage. In one respect, at least, few Nigerians could be better equipped to lead a country with such a turbulent history. No-one knows more about coups than the president, and few officers have enjoyed as much respect from peers and other ranks alike. Born in 1941 in Minna, President Babangida joined the army as an officer cadet in 1963. After graduating from the Military Training College, Kaduna, he went on to attend military courses in India and Britain. But it was in the Biafran civil war in the 1970s that he won his spurs and a reputation as a 'soldier's soldier'. It is said that he has played a key role in most of Nigeria's coups. Certainly he had an important part in ending the coup attempt in February 1976 in which the head of state, Gen Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated. He was also prominent in the overthrow of President Shehu Shagari at the end of 1983; within a year he was preparing to take office himself. His deft political footwork and resilience under pressure won him the nickname 'Maradona of Nigerian politics'. Time and again he has emerged from the fray with an unexpected goal, or at least still on his feet after some rugged tackle. Perhaps the best example was the debate in 1986 on the merits of seeking an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan. The country vigorously opposed it; the president adroitly treated this as support for an economic reform package as stringent as the Fund would have demanded; the Fund then endorsed the reforms, thus paving the way to external debt rescheduling. The president kept faith with the electorate by not borrowing from the Fund, although entitled to do so  .. and all parties were satisfied. Sometimes he scored an own goal. The administration remains saddled with what most observers believe was a serious misjudgment: the decision in August 1985 to change from observer status to full membership of the Organisation of Islamic States which had the effect of exacerbating religious tensions between the country's Moslem and Christian communities. But it is in recent years that the president seems to have lost the country's respect and affection which partly inspired the Maradona tag, now seldom used. The imposition of a two-party system and the arbitrary decrees which regulate the transition to civilian rule (discussed elsewhere), the other abuses of human rights documented in a report last year by Africa Watch, an independent monitor of civil liberties on the continent, and pervasive corruption, have eroded his popularity. The process has been hastened by the prominent role of his wife, Maryam, founder and patron of the Better Life for Rural Women programme. Its aims may be admirable, but its budget, accounting and evaluation procedures are not entirely clear. It has won the enthusiastic support of wives of state governors and other dignitaries, prompting the suggestion from Nigerian sceptics that the programme should be renamed 'Better Life for Ruling Women'. But President Babangida nevertheless retains a political flair that can take everybody by surprise, and retrieve a seemingly hopeless situation. This flair was dramatically demonstrated earlier this month: he bit the exchange rate bullet, bringing within reach a vital IMF agreement which many observers thought might prove impossible. After nearly two days of consultations at the presidency in Abuja, the new federal capital, Mr Abdulkadir Ahmed, governor of the Central Bank, was authorised to make a nationally televised broadcast announcing the float of the naira. It stunned Nigerians. So much so that, far from outrage as the official rate of the national currency fell from 10.5 to 18 to the dollar, the news was received with what seemed like bewildered acquiescence. Equally astonished - and also mightily relieved  - were the diplomatic community and western creditors. The man many were starting to write off had dramatically come good.</p>

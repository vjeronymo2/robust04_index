			<p>BFN     [Text] The water commissioner has warned that the border  adjustments demanded by Jordan in the 'Arava could lead to the  loss of water sources vital to Israel. He told our  correspondent Shula Schmerling that the reservoir of ground  water in the 'Arava meets the consumption needs of the  settlements in the area, which amount to approximately 40  million cubic meters per year. The water commissioner clarified  that at the Washington talks, Israel will demand that all the  outstanding water problems with Jordan, including the question  of the al-Yarmuk River, the Jordan River, and the 'Arava, be  discussed as one package.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 7 Apr (MENA)--Sudan's President Lieutenant  General 'Umar al-Bashir has declared that the security agencies  have seized dangerous documents from Mahjub 'Urwah, proprietor  and chief editor of the AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI newspaper, as he was  returning from a foreign trip. In a statement published in the  official newspaper AL-SUDAN AL-HADITH today, he said that these  documents revealed the suspicious link between the owner of the  newspaper and foreign intelligence circles hostile to Sudan.    Lt. Gen. al-Bashir pointed out that the competent agencies  immediately began to examine the contents of the seized  documents -- contacts and correspondences with these foreign  circles. He noted that these documents will be made known to  the public through the various media organs. He said the  information in these documents reveals the schemes and goals of  the newspaper, which are hostile to Sudan and designed to  destabilize the country.    The Presidential Office in Sudan released a statement on  Sunday, according to which the AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI newspaper  published in Khartoum was closed. The statement noted that the  paper's writers will be interrogated about their reports on  corruption, bribery, nepotism, armed robberies, and price rises,  which are considered to be an attempt to strike at the  revolution and fragment the domestic front.</p>

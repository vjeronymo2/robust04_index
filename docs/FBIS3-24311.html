			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Karasyk, minister of agriculture and </F> foodstuffs of Ukraine, by Georgiy Simakovich; place and date not  given: "Ukraine Has Gone To Work the Field. God Grant It a Good  Crop!"]    [Text] Spring has always been a time of hopes and  expectations for the tillers of the land. Now that the shelves  of delicatessen stores are becoming more desolate and the  consumer basket of foodstuffs for the majority of common  citizens is becoming scantier with every passing day, an  increasing number not only of villagers but of city folks, too,  turn their mind's eye to the future harvest. Will we succeed in  making it a full-fledged one, in the environment of the most  severe economic crisis and an acute shortage of many material  and technical resources? How will the villagers be able to  counteract a shortage of motor fuel and lubricants, fertilizer,  pesticides, and finally, the deficit of monetary funds, apart  from pure enthusiasm and the perennial patience of the peasants?  After all, the well-being of each family, of each of us, depends  on this to a significant, if not decisive, degree. This is why  the editorial office resolved to approach, so to say, the main  agrarian of our state--Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of  Ukraine Yu.M. Karasyk--with a request to discuss the specifics  of the forthcoming field work and the way in which problems  associated with them are being solved.    [Simakovich] Yuriy Mykhaylovych, at the beginning of March  in  years past, newspapers were usually replete with reports about  kolkhozes and sovkhozes completing repairs of machinery, about  machinery already being at the ready at leading farms, and so  on. This year, the weather has made its contribution to the heap  of economic problems in which the rural areas are drowning. In a  day or two, it will be time to talk about going out to the  fields. However, this is perhaps not the main peculiarity, is it?    [Karasyk] Why in a day or two? In the south, spring field  work is already getting under way at full tilt. Soil is being  prepared in the fields for spring crops, and moisture is being  sealed in Crimea, Kherson Oblast, Odessa Oblast, and in some  locations in Transcarpathia. Neither we nor the meteorologists  could have predicted this abrupt warming up--in Crimea and the  Kherson area, the temperature already reaches 17-18 degrees  during the day. Meanwhile, the reserves of moisture in the soil  are catastrophically small because of a winter without snow; in  the south, they do not exceed 60 percent of the optimal norm. It  has come to signs of dust storms already being noted at some  localities in the region--the wind picks up and blows away the  topsoil, the most fertile layer. Under the circumstances, it is  very important to retain, as much as possible, at least the  paltry resources of moisture that are still found in the soil.  To this end, it is necessary to reduce the length of conducting  field work to the bare limit and emphasize mainly its quality.  Here is one of the peculiarities of this spring for you, and  unfortunately, not the most important one.    [Simakovich] Does the main peculiarity concern perhaps the  lamentable condition of winter crops?    [Karasyk] Absolutely correct. The severe freezing  temperatures of November literally came down on the soil  unprotected by snow and did irreparable damage to areas planted  in winter crops. It is particularly regrettable that the  southern regions, the main suppliers of winter wheat grain, have  suffered the worst. In Crimea, about 90 percent of the area  planted in winter crops will have to be replanted, and in the  Kherson area--up to 70 percent. The state of affairs is not much  better in Zaporozhye and Nikolayev Oblasts. By all signs,  replanting will come to no less than 30 percent in Ukraine as a  whole. This is not all yet. In the fall, the farmers did not  manage to turn over 4 million hectares of the fallow land  because of a shortage of fuel and the early onset of freezing  temperatures. Judge for yourself what volume of work must now be  performed in the spring, and that within the shortest period of  time possible.    [Simakovich] How will the farms cope with the enormous  amount  of work, and in the environment of an acute energy crisis, the  now chronic shortage of mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and so  on?    [Karasyk] Well, everything does not look as dramatic as you  imagine. The point is that all measures are now being taken with  a view to urgently transporting the necessary quantities of  gasoline, diesel fuel, oil, mineral fertilizer, and spare parts  to the southern zone.    [Simakovich] However, I hope that this is not being done at  the expense of other oblasts.    [Karasyk] Of course not. I do not want to be overly  optimistic, but I do count on reserves of motor fuel and  lubricants for the successful conduct of the full volume of  spring field work being found in Ukraine.    [Simakovich] Yuriy Mykhaylovych! Increasingly loud voices  are  now referring to the insolvency of an overwhelming majority of  farms, to kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and farmers, too, just having no  funds to settle for motor fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, and  machinery. Where is a way out of what would appear to be a  hopeless situation?    [Karasyk] This is how the issue was raised: How to conduct  spring field work without additional credit? In Ukraine as a  whole, 30 trillion karbovantsy are needed to this end. Kolkhozes  and sovkhozes simply do not have that kind of money. Under the  circumstances, the government resolved to allocate a budgetary  loan of sorts to the rural areas. In general outline, this is  how it will look. The state undertakes to supply the farms with  fuel, mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and spare parts. Kolkhozes  and sovkhozes settle for this later with the output produced,  that is to say, they receive all resources against a pledge of  products. Calculations indicate that only 25 percent of the  output produced on the farms will be required to pay back this  loan, and the farms will dispose of the remainder on their own.  This is the only acceptable scenario under the conditions of a  payment crisis.    [Simakovich] What if yet another round of increases in the  price of refinery products occurs?    [Karasyk] The course has been set for strictly fixed prices  for motor fuels so that this will not happen, and so that prices  for agricultural products will cover outlays on fuel. Thus, one  liter of gasoline should cost no more than 4,150 karbovantsy,  and diesel fuel--no more than 3,900 karbovantsy.    [Simakovich] However, the fate of the harvest hinges not  only  on the availability or absence of motor fuel, but also on a  multitude of other components.    [Karasyk] Correct. However, first of all I would like to  inform the readers that refinery products are already reaching  rural areas. I think that the fertilizer situation will change  substantially, too. Last year, one-half of the usual amount of  mineral fertilizer was given to the land. This will not recur  now. The government has proceeded to sharply reduce rates for  gas and electricity for enterprises manufacturing mineral  fertilizer. Therefore, it will now be profitable for the  chemical industry to manufacture it, and for the peasants to buy  it. I will add that Russian rubles have also been allocated to  purchase phosphoric fertilizer and spare parts for agricultural  machinery in Russia, and potassium fertilizer in Belarus.  Finally, within days, the United States will be opening for us a  credit line for the acquisition of pesticides.    [Simakovich] So, does it turn out that rural areas will not  be left one-on-one with their problems?    [Karasyk] Of course they will not. Nonetheless, the picture  does not look as rosy as we would like it to. Last year, nature  was a great help to us. However, only selfless, high-quality  work, excellent seeds, and the timely performance of all  technological operations of the spring complex may save the crop  this year. Previously, we did not have the experience of  operation in the extreme conditions of a payment crisis. We are  now acquiring this experience. In this instance, it is very  important for the state to keep its word and not dash the hopes  and expectations of the peasants.</p>

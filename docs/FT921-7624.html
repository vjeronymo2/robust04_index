			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Kvaerner turns in record results KVAERNER, the diversified Norwegian company with main interests in engineering, shipping and shipbuilding, yesterday announced record pre-tax profits in 1991 of NKr1.1bn, up from NKr1.05bn in 1990. Kvaerner plans to lift its dividend to NKr3 a share from NKr2.75. The company said it expects to make a 1992 profit similar to last year's. Group operating profit rose by NKr175m to NKr1.04bn, while turnover increased to NKr18.66bn from NKr13.16bn in 1990. 'The big increase in revenue is primarily due to the acquisition of the Kvaerner Masa shipbuilding group in Finland and Goetaverken Energy in Sweden,' Kvaerner said. On a divisional basis, shipbuilding, the group's best performer, boosted net pre-tax profit to NKr535m from NKr22m. Mechanical engineering slid in a loss of NKr51m from a NKr46m profit in 1990. Pulping technology saw pre-tax profit in 1991 cut to NKr270m from NKr460m while shipping saw profits decline last year to NKr260m from NKr342m.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Political Notebook: Finding a place in the world ASK any group of Conservative MPs about Britain's place in the world and the competing cross-currents of opinion surface within minutes. First comes a surprisingly pragmatic realism appropriate to a middle-ranking European power in the 1990s. Applied most obviously to Bosnia but also to Saddam Hussein's Iraq, it states with certainty that Britain must no longer aspire to the role of world policeman. Its stretched armed forces have a part to play in humanitarian aid efforts in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. But British soldiers are too scarce and too precious to be cast in the dangerous role of peace-makers. So successive debates in the Commons have left the government in no doubt that its supporters would not tolerate the risk of significant casualties in a Balkans conflict seen as tangential to British interests. Unquestioning support on the backbenches for military action against Iraq has given way to questions over whether it serves a strategic purpose. But then comes the second, more familiar, strand of opinion. It is rooted in Tory nostalgia for empire. Britain is placed still centre-stage, interpreting its national interest in the context of a much wider international order. It is a current that abhors the temerity of those - most recently Mr Warren Christopher - who raise questions about whether Britain deserves still its seat at the top table in institutions such as the UN. It is one that has persuaded many Tory MPs that the cuts in the armed forces mapped out by the government for a post-cold war world went too far. The peace dividend promised by Options for Change no longer looks quite so attractive when the government is obliged to admit that it could not have found a few hundred troops to send to Somalia. Britain must retain at least the option of reinforcing its diplomacy with military might. The Tories are not alone with their uncertainties. Labour has yet to fashion a coherent foreign policy from the ashes of last year's election defeat. The Europeanism which Mr Neil Kinnock put at the centre of Labour's strategy has been undermined by its subsequent record on the Maastricht treaty. The election of President Bill Clinton has led some to flirt again with Atlanticism. What is left is confusion. But it is harder always for the Conservatives to come to terms with Britain's waning influence. Mr Douglas Hurd sought to negotiate the currents in a speech last week at Chatham House. He suggested Britain should retain a prominent role in the interlocking network of international organisations - from a reinvigorated UN to the European Community and the Commonwealth - confronting international disorder. He foreshadowed yesterday's reprieve of two army regiments by arguing that Britain should spend more on its diplomatic service and be ready to shave less from its defence budget. But it must recognise also its diminishing economic power by saying 'no' more often than 'yes' to new entanglements. The speech won plaudits as a typically eloquent contribution. But it was more convincing in its diagnosis than its prescription. It provided also only a fleeting glimpse of the most uncertain dimension of British foreign policy. Mr John Major's meeting with President Clinton later this month will generate endless analysis of whether the 'special relationship' has survived the Tories backing for Mr George Bush. In reality the prime minister's concern about the new administration is much more profound. What he wants to discover above all is the extent to which President Clinton will hasten US disengagement from Europe. For more than a decade the Conservatives have seen the US presence in Europe as a vital wedge between the Franco-German alliance. It has curbed the ambitions of those in Paris and Bonn seeking distinctly European defence and foreign policies. If President Clinton decides to accelerate the run-down in US forces in Europe - and by implication the priority Washington attaches to Nato - that wedge will be removed. With it will go one of the principal props which have allowed Britain to punch above its weight in the world. The cross-currents then would be not simply be between those remaining hopes that Britain might cling on to the illusions of empire or whether it must accept with dignity a modest role on the world stage. The Conservatives would face also the choice they most fear: between Europeanism and Atlanticism.</p>

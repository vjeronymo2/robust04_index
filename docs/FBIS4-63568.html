			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Mirolevich report: "Taxes To Be Paid to Oblast </F> Budget in Kind"]    [Text] Voronezh -- The reciprocal nonpayments crisis has  sharply reduced tax revenue to the oblast budget, which is why  Voronezh Governor A. Kovalev has signed the decree "On Payment  in Kind of Enterprises' Financial Obligations."    Henceforth and until times improve, enterprises, by  agreement  with the administration, will pay their taxes in the form of  their own output. The local authorities intend to use barter to  acquire the goods which the oblast needs. Enterprises' debts to  the budget will be considered cleared only after deals have been  completed by an administrative intermediary.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Perfect marriage in software sector The richest corporate marriage in the personal computer industry took place this week as Novell and WordPerfect announced the completion of their merger. The deal creates the third-largest software company in the world, behind Microsoft and Computer Associates which, respectively, occupy the first two spots. The newly merged companies had combined annual revenues of Dollars 1.8bn for 1993. Novell will act as the senior partner and the umbrella company for all existing and future Novell and WordPerfect operations. The merger, completed on Monday, takes place alongside a parallel deal in which Novell acquires ailing software maker Borland International's Quattro Pro spreadsheet business and rights to sell 1m copies of Borland's Paradox database. 'With Novell and WordPerfect technology, Novell intends to lead the industry's evolution to network applications - applications that improve our ability to access networked data, create easily shared information, collaborate and communicate over the network whether from an at-home office, on the road or within a global corporation,' says Mr Bob Frankenberg, Novell president and chief executive officer. As if to underline its commitment to WordPerfect's importance, Mr Frankenberg and Mr Adrian Rietveld, former chief executive of WordPerfect and now president of the new WordPerfect/Novell Applications Group, yesterday announced the first new product from the 'greater Novell': a suite of productivity applications known as Perfect Office. It includes the WordPerfect for Windows word-processing software, the Quattro Pro spreadsheet and the Paradox database - along with a set of workgroup computing technologies that Rietveld says will 'change the rules' about the way such applications are sold. One of the key elements will be an 'electronic publishing' tool that will allow all users on a network to 'publish' documents for sharing and allow others to view documents that have been created with Perfect Office without having to have the Perfect Office software loaded on their computers. However, neither Mr Rietveld nor Mr Frankenberg sounded complacent about the strong competition they face from market leader Microsoft. Mr Frankenberg readily admits new versions of Microsoft's popular Windows operating system software - code-named Chicago and Daytona - will offer strong challenges to Novell. 'It certainly is a threat and I never underestimate Microsoft's ability to threaten,' he says. While Mr Frankenberg and Mr Rietveld have declared clear directions for what Mr Frankenberg calls the 'greater Novell', the two operate in some rather long shadows. Mr Frankenberg only recently replaced Novell chairman Mr Ray Noorda in the president and chief executive's post a few weeks before the March announcement of the Novell/WordPerfect merger, while Mr Rietveld only took over from WordPerfect co-founder Mr Alan Ashton as president of that company in January. Both former chief executives will still offer advice to the merged company and Mr Noorda remains chairman, although Mr Frankenberg says that he has been given the freedom to do things his own way. The terms of the merger have not changed from the definitive agreement signed by the companies in March. Novell has exchanged 59m shares of its stock and options, valued at approximately Dollars 855m, for the outstanding shares of WordPerfect common stock and stock options. On a fully-diluted basis, the shares represent about 15 per cent of Novell's shares. As part of the WordPerfect merger, Novell also completed its purchase of the Quattro Pro spreadsheet business from Borland for about Dollars 145m.</p>

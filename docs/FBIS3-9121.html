			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bernadeta Waszkielewicz and Pawel Reszka: "After </F> Talks With Pawlak; Solidarity Is Not Sure Whether To Believe"    [Text] The government and Solidarity will establish a  team of experts to deal with the trade union's demands. The team  is to complete its work by the end of next week, and then the  Council of Ministers is to debate the results of the team's work  at its next session, [Solidarity Chairman] Marian Krzaklewski  told journalists after his meeting with Prime Minister Pawlak.  Chiefs of the trade union's regions and branches are keeping  their distance vis-a-vis the results of the talks with the prime  minister. They have no intention of ending their protests until  such time as the agreements concluded are actually implemented.  But they did announce that there will be no "massive strike  actions" for the time being.    The prime minister also met with chiefs of the All-Polish  Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], Solidarity '80, and the Polish  Miners Trade Unions yesterday.  <H5>  Prime Minister Opposed to Grumbling </H5>   While responding to questions from journalists, the prime  minister reported that talks among the experts will not be in  the form of bilateral negotiations but will be held as  "procedural talks." He also said that the principle of  "regarding issues concerning all employees, the government  negotiates in a multiparty arrangement--that is, one  representing all groups and unions" is in effect. When it comes  to bilateral talks, they are only possible when "there are  disputes concerning issues that are significant from the  standpoints of different parties," and the only goal of such  talks is to find a formula of how to solve such disputes within  the Trilateral Commission (government-employers-trade unions) or  within joint negotiating teams (trade unions, employers,  government, and territorial self-governments).    Pawlak said that experts for the government and Solidarity  are to work out a "mechanism for a referral of those issues to  the Trilateral Commission and to the teams, with the goal of  discussions involving many parties."    "No problems have been solved as yet simply by grumbling or  shouting how difficult life is in Poland," Pawlak said.    It was provided in a joint communique signed by the trade  union's spokesman and the director of the Government's Press  Office that the results of talks with the chairmen of Solidarity  and other trade unions--and also the results of the experts'  work--will be presented to the Council of Ministers for debate.  <H5>  Solidarity Keeping Its Distance </H5>   Krzaklewski and the prime minister did not talk to  journalists together. The chairman of Solidarity left the  Office of the Council of Ministers by a back door and came  across OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa Spychalska on the way. Rumor has it  that he kissed her on the hand and wished her success in her  talks with the prime minister.    Krzaklewski organized a conference for journalists on  "'Solidarity's territory." He reported there that he had agreed  with Pawlak that a team of governmental and Solidarity experts  will be set up this coming Tuesday [22 March]. The team is  supposed to come up with suggestions for legal changes that  would be required to implement the demands of Solidarity by the  end of the week. Subsequently, the Council of Ministers would  approve the team's conclusions at its next session.    "Until that time, the trade union will maintain its state of  readiness," the chairman of Solidarity said. According to  Krzaklewski, the Trilateral Commission is supposed to see to it  that the agreement is observed in practice.    But the reception of the decisions by chiefs of regions and  branches of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union  Solidarity, who were awaiting the results of the talks with the  prime minister, was cool.    "Pawlak is reported to have said that the demands of  Solidarity are justified. We were surprised by that statement,  especially because leaders for the Democratic Left Alliance have  been saying something quite the opposite," a member of the  National Commission [of Solidarity] told RZECZPOSPOLITA.    Piotr Zak, the National Commission's press spokesman, told  us  that, until such time as the experts's decisions are  implemented, Solidarity will continue its protests, in  accordance with a time schedule that was agreed upon earlier.  But, for the time being, there will be no "massive strike  actions," as had been announced earlier.    Zak refused to comment on a statement by the prime minister  that the talks with Solidarity are of a procedural nature.    --The prime minister agreed with Spychalska that he will set  up either a plenipotentiary or a coordinator for the government  for the purpose of "making interministry issues more specific."  According to the OPZZ chairwoman, lack of agreement among  ministries is an impediment to negotiating social guarantees.    --The prime minister agreed with [chief of Solidarity '80]  Marian Jurczyk that experts for the trade union and the  government will hold a session. [Chief of the Miners Trade  Unions] Kisielinski was critical of the strikes by Solidarity.  The government is to make efforts to include Solidarity '80 and  the Miners Trade Union. [sentence as published] Solidarity '80  is to represent Poland at the International Labor Organization  this year.  <H5>  Strikes by Solidarity </H5>   Yesterday, plants in the Ziemia Sandomierska Region were on  strike, among them the Stalowa Wola steelworks and a sulfur mine  in Tarnobrzeg. Also, five plants in the Jelenia Gora Region  were on strike and some in the Elblag Region. Employees of the  Radoskor plant in Radom are still on strike.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Votes scheme 'not MP's baby': Tory 'family man' denies role in home-sales policy A Conservative MP yesterday insisted that he was not involved in any way with the alleged Westminster City Council homes-for-votes scheme, the public inquiry heard yesterday. Mr Barry Legg, MP for Milton Keynes South-West, has been accused by the district auditor of being a driving force behind the scheme. Mr Roger Toulson QC, opening the defence for Mr Legg, said: 'The long and the short of it is that it was not his baby.' In a provisional report the district auditor, Mr John Magill, had found that Mr Legg was part of a triumvirate which controlled the London council in the late 1980s and had guided the evolution of the 'disgraceful and unlawful' scheme. Mr Legg was Conservative chief whip on the council for seven years. The other two members of the triumvirate were the then council leader Dame Shirley Porter and her deputy Mr David Weeks. The district auditor decided that the three, with seven other councillors and council officials, deliberately sold homes to increase the number of Tory voters in eight marginal wards in a scheme known publicly as designated sales. He is recommending that all of them should be surcharged for the Pounds 21m he says was wasted. In a written submission to the inquiry, the MP said: 'I accept that I was present at political meetings at which targeting designated sales in marginal wards was discussed. I personally never paid much attention to the talk about targeting marginal wards because, for one thing, I regarded it like much else as political rhetoric. 'As the proposed programme for designated sales was sound and justifiable, I would not have regarded the hope of political advantage as making it wrong. I cannot recall, and do not believe I ever knew, the criteria for selecting properties.' Mr Andrew Arden QC, for the group of Westminster residents who first lodged the allegations, said it was 'not credible' that Mr Legg - a senior member of the council - knew nothing of the alleged gerrymandering when many others in the council were well aware of it. Mr Legg replied that he was only a 'part-time councillor' since 'many demands occupied my life'. He said he was company secretary and a board member of Hillsdown Holdings during an 'extraordinarily busy time' and was also bringing up a young family. The inquiry was adjourned until Monday.</p>

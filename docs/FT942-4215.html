			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Regional bourse planned for southern Africa A grouping of 18 eastern and southern African countries is planning to set up a new stock exchange to help develop capital markets in the region, Reuter reports from Harare. An official from the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) grouping said the exchange would allow cross-listing and trading in national securities, to boost cross-border investment and capital mobility. He did not say where the exchange would be located. Zimbabwe welcomed the proposal, but said tight foreign exchange rules must be removed first. 'It is a good idea to have such an establishment but exchange controls have to be seriously addressed and relaxed before such an exchange could become viable,' said Mr Mark Tunmer, head of Zimbabwe's stock exchange. He said the proposed bourse could enable member-countries to raise funds for development projects and allow cross-border investment. The PTA official did not say where the bourse would be located, but analysts believe a likely choice to be Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.</p>

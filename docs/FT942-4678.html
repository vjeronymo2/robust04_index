			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian growers emerging from the gloom - Nikki Tait on a marked turnabout over the past six months in the sector's fortunes Next month, Wool International, the newly-constituted keeper of Australia's vast wool stockpile, will begin a fixed monthly schedule of sales in an effort to pare back the stocks. The regular sales programme, involving 28,000 bales a month at the outset, has been stipulated by law - the same federal legislation that set up the government-owned body at the end of last year. A year ago, the prospect of a steady supply dripping on to the market would have sent shudders down any Australian wool-grower's spine. Indeed, it is only 16 months since Mr Wayne Goss, Queensland's premier, suggested that the stockpile's 3.96m bales should be burnt, to remove the supply overhang and save storage costs. Today, however, the industry's attitude can only be described as relaxed. 'It's fundamental that the stockpile is sold and debt paid down,' says the Wool Council of Australia, the main growers' organisation, adding that it supports the open, orderly process. Mr Bob Quirk, head of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters, also predicts that regular stockpile sales should not prove disruptive. This sudden sang-froid owes much to a marked turnabout over the past six months in the fortunes of Australia's wool industry, one of the nation's biggest export earners and the source of about 30 per cent of the world's wool production. On April 28 1993, the sector hit rock-bottom. The local market indicator price plunged to 381 cents a kilogram, clean, the lowest level seen this century. Yet by the end of last week, the same marker had recovered to around 625 cents. While this may be only half the level seen in the headiest days of the late-1980s, prices above the 600 cents-mark seemed way beyond many growers' dreams last year. The sea-change has come about for two main reasons. The first is the recovery, or anticipated recovery, in Australia's traditional export markets. The biggest buyers of Australian wool include a number of western European countries - notably France, Italy and Germany - along with two Asian customers, Japan and Korea. For the most part, their economies are either on the mend, or thought likely to be improving by the end of 1994. 'There's been a quite sustained level of demand from all the traditional markets,' says Mr Quirk. 'We've seen considerable demand from western Europe, including Germany, and Japan. There is a growing degree of confidence'. At the same time, he suggests, China's new role as the biggest overseas buyer of Australian wool is moving on to a firmer footing. Even in the industry's gloomiest moments, this was a ray of light, with the country taking around 21 per cent of Australian wool exports in 1992-93. But Mr Quirk suggests that one of the most encouraging features is that an increasing amount of Chinese-purchased wool is being retained for domestic use (rather than re-export). He puts the retained figure at 70 to 80 per cent, up from perhaps 30 per cent in the past. In the meantime, grower supply has also contracted, and stocks in the wool processing pipeline are thought to have declined. According to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, the number of sheep shorn in 1993-94 is likely to fall by 5 per cent or so, to about 169m, and then ease back to 166m in 1994-95. All these developments have made Wool International's job considerably easier. The stockpile built up under the industry's previous guaranteed pricing structure, and was originally the responsibility of the now-defunct Australian Wool Realisation Commission. Wool International, the brainchild of Professor Ross Garnaut at Australian National University, whose recommendations on the restructuring of Australia's wool industry were adopted wholesale by the federal government last year, took it over at the beginning of December. The new institution, which is scheduled to be privatised by 1997, has been charged with selling 28,000 bales a month during the latter half of 1994, and then 187,000 bales a quarter in 1995. But, already, it has more than tested the waters. In March, April and May, its sales averaged about 40,000 bales a month, well ahead of the stipulated levels (which permit only small 'tolerances' on either side). As a result, by the end of last month, the stockpile had reduced to under 3.69m bales. In large part, the fact that WI has already been pushing out stockpile sales in excess of its proscribed post-June monthly targets explains the relaxed attitudes to its impending permanent market presence. Perhaps the biggest remaining question is whether China will remain in the market in such a substantial fashion, given the recent rise in prices. At least some observers predict that prices will ease back in the second half of 1994, but should then resume a steady climb next year. Still, if an air of stability has finally returned to the beleaguered industry, Australia's 65,000 growers are not cheering yet. At prices of about 600 cents a kilogram, they say that it is possible to survive. But, after the horrendous conditions of the past three years, there is a backlog of investment and renovation work to be done and current price levels still provide little margin. And already, the federal government is whipping away some of the emergency financial aid - in the form of interest subsidies and the like - that it introduced in the industry's darkest hours last year. That move, says the WCA, is 'premature'.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Peregrine hurt by market downturn Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong-based merchant bank, has reported a 5 per cent increase in first-half net profits, to HKDollars 398m (USDollars 51.5m) from HKDollars 380.9m. The company's usually strong performance was held in check by the downturn in Asian equities markets which followed the lifting of short-term US interest rates, Mr Philip Tose, chairman, said. For each of the three years to December 1992 the group more than doubled profits; last year earnings rose 43 per cent to HKDollars 869.5m. Falling stock markets and dwindling volumes led to a sharp reduction in corporate finance and securities activity, particularly in the second quarter. In the first half, the company invested in a new division, Peregrine Fixed Income, which was set up with a team poached from Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. New offices were opened in the six months in Munich and Zurich, and plans are under way for a Bahrain office to serve Middle East investors interested in south-east Asia. Earnings per share, taken on a fully diluted basis, inched up to HKDollars 0.65 from HKDollars 0.64 in the same period last year. The interim dividend is to be held at 25 cents. While turnover more than doubled, to HKDollars 6.4bn from HKDollars 3bn, the operating profit was virtually flat at HKDollars 294.9m. Mr Tose said the group would continue to diversify into business areas such as fixed income, direct investment operations and global trading of convertible bonds, depositary receipts and warrants. He expected a more stable second half, although uncertainties over interest rates and inflation would persist.</p>

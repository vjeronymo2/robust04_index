			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Blackout obscures fighting The confused military picture in Yemen's civil war was further darkened yesterday by clouds of propaganda, with leaders in both north and south claiming significant breakthroughs in battles concentrated around the approaches to Aden, the southern capital. Northern leaders claimed in Sanaa, North Yemen's capital, that their forces were 'advancing on all fronts' and some units had reached Aden's Bar Saad suburb, some 3 miles from the airport. The claims were dismissed in the south, where spokesmen said they had 'totally destroyed' the northern Amaliqa unit. Independent assessments remained impossible, given the near-total communications blackout. Western diplomats quoting reports from Sanaa said the city was quiet, with no evidence of air or missile raids since those launched by southern forces at the weekend. Foreign governments continued to evacuate hundreds of expatriate workers, with the French navy ferrying foreigners by warship from Aden to Djibouti. A British Airways jet had landed at Sanaa airport to fly out 200 expatriates, due at Gatwick airport last night.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Rise in demand for homes reported AVERAGE house prices fell by 1.1 per cent last month compared with December, according to figures published yesterday by Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society. Demand from would-be purchasers, however, has increased since the new year, in spite of the slide in prices, according to Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's retail operations director. 'Concerns regarding unemployment and general election uncertainty still need to be overcome before we can anticipate any long-term improvement in the market which will, in turn, translate into house price rises,' he said. The figures show the first signs of an increased level of interest and activity in the housing market. Estate agents and house builders reported a big upsurge in interest from prospective purchasers compared with January last year. They warned that there had been a high rate of failure between sale agreements and completions, therefore it would be some time before the industry would be able to determine whether a tentative recovery had begun. Most agents and builders said they did not expect to see any increase in prices until at least the end of the year, even if there was an increase in volume. Nationwide said yesterday that the average price of a house had fallen by 2.9 per cent since January 1990 from Pounds 57,670 to Pounds 56,004.</p>

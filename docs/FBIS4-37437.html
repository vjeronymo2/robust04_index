			<p>BFN     [Text] Indirect evidence now available seems to suggest  that India has `zero bombs in the basement'.    This runs counter to inferences of nuclear experts of the  West, who have claimed that India may have anything from 6 to 20  weapons. In fact, the general belief that India is only "days or  weeks away from fabricating a nuclear weapon" also appears to be  false.    While it is likely that India does have a stockpile of  weapons material in the form of plutonium (Pu-239) -- western  analysts give a figure of about 200-300 kg -- India is far away  from being able to put together an efficient and deliverable  weapon at short notice. If this is indeed true, the likelihood  of which is high, the bubble of India's nuclear ambiguity stands  completely blown. In short, India is `nuclear naked'.    In this context, the Prime Minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's  statement in his concluding address at the Delhi session of the  All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Saturday, that India will  keep its nuclear option open as long as there is universal  nuclear disarmament, begs the following question.    Can India exercise the nuclear option if it wants to at a  short notice? The nuclear test by China on Friday is only  likely to heighten the demands of the likes of the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] that India should go nuclear forthwith.  Mr L K Advani has reiterated his call at the Baroda session of  the BJP's national council meeting.    The bare critical mass required to sustain an explosive  chain  reaction in a bomb configuration, a sphere of weapons grade  plutonium (which has about 6 per cent Pu-240 in addition to  Pu-239), is about 15-17 kg of Pu-240, a weapons poison because  it spontaneously emits neutrons, causing the bomb to  "pre-detonate" or fizzle out. Reactor-grade material, however,  contains about 20 per cent Pu-240.    Therefore, usually, plutonium from research reactors, where  material can be drawn before the higher isotopes, like Pu-240,  form over time in the core, is used for weapons purposes.    To maximise the explosive yield of a weapon, bare material  is  never used. The fissile core in a weapon is surrounded by a  thick blanket of a reflector material, which scatters the  neutrons emitted during fission back into the core so that they  are not lost out into the environment but cause more number of  plutonium atoms to fission and increase the energy yield.    A suitable reflector material is that which scatters  neutrons  much more than it absorbs them and, at the same time, is light  so that it does not add greatly to the weight of the weapon.  Beryllium metal (density 1.85 gm/cc) fits the bill admirably.  So, all nuclear weapon designs incorporate a thick beryllium  shell around the weapon core.    For an efficient weapon, and not a crude "fizzle" variety, a  beryllium (Be) reflector is a necessity. With a Be reflector,  the critical mass comes down to about 4.5-5 kg.    Data on Be production in the country over the years, and its  off- take by the department of atomic energy (DAE), has been  recently given by this year's report of the Comptroller and  Auditor General (CAG) on scientific departments.    It is from this that one is able to conclude that no proper  weapon could have been fabricated in all these years after the  Pokharan experiment in 1974. That is, to know whether the  emperor who is not seen in public has clothes or not, you look  at the royal tailors' orders.    The Pokharan device perhaps used Be imported long ago  because, at that time, the country had no beryllium production  facility. Establishing such a facility became essential for  various strategic needs of the country in the areas of defence  (for light weight components), space (for light weight gyros),  atomic energy (for various nuclear applications) and electronics  (in the form of copper beryllium alloy products), because export  of beryllium has been embargoed since then by the key Beryllium  producing countries of the world.    Fortunately, India has one of the largest deposits of  beryllium ore in the world and the idea of such a facility was a  feasible one.    Based on feasibility studies done by the DAE in 1977, a  beryllium pilot plant (BPP), with a facility for producing  vacuum hot pressed (VHP) blocks was commissioned in the year  1982 in Vashi near Bombay.    Its originally envisaged annual capacity was 250 kg of VHP  blocks and 10 tonne of copper-beryllium (Cu-Be) alloy (for  electronics applications). Later, this was revised to 200 kg of  metal and 8 tonnes of Cu-Be.    An memorandum of understanding signed among the DAE and its  principal users, namely, the department of space (DoS) and the  department of electronics (DoE), required that the DAE would set  up the plant and operate it while the DOS and the DOE would  share the capital costs and running expenses according to a  formula.    As per this MoU, the DoE would lift the entire produce of  Cu-Be and 50 per cent of Be metal while the other 50 per cent  would be lifted by the DoS.    Herein lies the curious element. If there had been a post-  Pokharan policy to produce weapons, the DAE would have been  slated to lift a certain fraction of the Be produced, but it was  not. Indeed, according DoS sources, after the plant was  commissioned, the DAE seemed to have lost its interest in  beryllium. There is only one interpretation for this. That the  DAE did not need the metal for want of a directive from the  government on the weapons front.    Further, even though, according to the DAE, technical and  operational viability of the plant had been demonstrated by  continuous production and supply, the total quantity of metal  and alloy produced from 1982 to 1993 was 5.87 per cent and 5.33  per cent, respectively, of the envisaged capacities. The cost  of production was also very high.    The CAG has given figures of production and off-take for a  11- year period from 1982. Of a total installed capacity for  this period of 2,200 kg of Be metal, only 129.17 kg had been  produced. Of this, the DoS lifted a total of 101.43 kg while the  DAE lifted only 10.05 kg. The total stock of Be in balance in  BPP, till 1993, was 17.69 kg.    During 1982-89, as per the MoU, DAE's off-take was supposed  to be zero. But, when in 1989 the DoE pulled out of the MoU for  envisaged electronics demand for Be not materialising, the DAE  lifted 8.04 kg. During 1989-93, however, DAE's requirement was  projected at 12.63 kg but it has finally lifted only 2.01 kg,  thus totalling its off-take over 11 years to 10.05 kg.    The other important use of Be is in its use as  beryllium-oxide blocks in research reactors like Purnima-I, II  and III. The metal is also used in the fabrication of neutron  sources for nuclear research and technology.    The DAE, in recent years, has started fabricating such  sources and a substantial amount of Be metal is likely to be  used there. Even 10.05 kg is not sufficient material for one  weapon. So, if we account for all these uses, fabricating a  deliverable weapon with what would be left with the DAE out of  the 10.05 kg is out of the question.    A rough estimate for the amount of Be required, even for a  not too good a reflector, for a critical mass of, say, 8 kg of  plutonium would be about 20 kg in the least. Even if the DAE  commandeers all the stocks of Be that is in the plant's stocks,  it may be just enough for fabricating one efficient weapon.    So, the scenario that the above analysis indicates is that  there is no bomb in the Indian basement, unless, of course, the  figures of production provided to the CAG are not the actual  ones.    Whether this policy of nuclear restraint in the  post-Pokharan  phase is deliberate or is willy-nilly a result of inefficient  beryllium production at BPP, only the DAE knows.</p>

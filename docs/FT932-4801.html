			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Election of LA mayor wide open LOS ANGELES residents go to the polls today to choose a mayor in a neck-and-neck contest as two candidates fight for different kinds of votes in the same city. Mr Michael Woo, a 41-year-old councilman and liberal Democrat who is the grandson of Chinese immigrants, aims to become the first Asian-American mayor of a big US city. But he faces a tight race against Mr Richard Riordan, 62, a political newcomer and millionaire businessman who is a conservative Republican. The winner will succeed Mr Tom Bradley, a liberal Democrat and one of the first black mayors in the US, who is retiring after 20 years. Mr Woo has won broad support from the large immigrant community in Los Angeles and, at the weekend, his campaign focused on south central Los Angeles, the site for the riots of last year. In contrast, Mr Riordan appeals to more affluent suburban voters. He made one of his last campaign stops, over the weekend, in a San Fernando Valley park where a two-year-old was shot to death during a gang-related incident on Easter Sunday in April. Mr Riordan - who says the top three campaign themes are 'safety, safety, safety' - has pledged to put 3,000 more police officers on the streets with a plan financed, in part, by leasing the city-owned Los Angeles International Airport to a private group. Mr Woo has won the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times, the city's leading newspaper. It said of him: 'In a city with a hundred different voices straining to be heard - in a city with a lot of conflict and much too much bad feeling - he is the better listener, and so the better conciliator. And in this fragmented city, it is the better conciliator who'll get results.'</p>

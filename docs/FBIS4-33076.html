			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Homero Campa] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mexican Swaps    The plan for paying off the Cuban debt through investments  began with the Tuxpan Hotel in Varadero. This four-star hotel,  operated by the German firm LTI, is a highly successful venture.  Its average occupancy is 92.2 percent during peak season. It has  233 rooms with ocean views right on the beach. It also has  atmosphere: Tourists are greeted by a stone Aztec calendar as  they walk into the lobby, which is decorated with borders and  figurines made out of precious woods, reproductions of  archeological pieces. Its discotheque, "La Bamba," is famous  because, in the interest of "providing atmosphere," it does not  prevent local Cubans from gaining admittance.    Bufete Industrial designed this hotel in the Mexican style  of  architecture, but all of the construction was done by Cubans. As  with other hotels, the government offered 50 percent of the  shares for sale. In May 1992, the DSC group of Guadalajara, led  at that time by Jose Giral (former director of the Xabre group),  bought the stock. Indecision about how the purchase would be  carried out resulted in delays, however. In 1993, it was agreed  that it would be done by means of swaps. The amount of the  investment was $15 million.    The second project was the El Mariel cement plant, located  in  the port of the same name, 20 kilometers from Havana. It is the  largest of the six cement factories on the island. After the  demise of the Soviet Union and the European Socialist bloc, they  were left without raw materials, and no one had the money to buy  them. According to a study by Donna Rich and Michel Kaplowitz of  Johns Hopkins University, these plants have the potential to  produce 5,500 tons of cement a year.    Lorenzo Zambrano, the majority shareholder in Cemex, came to  the rescue. He formed a joint venture with the Cuban Cement  Union for a total investment of $80 million. Cuba provided half  of that amount in the form of the facilities; $20 million took  the form of swaps, and $20 million was in fresh money from the  Mexican Foreign Trade Bank. Cemex is marketing the cement on the  international market.    The third project, in the petroleum sector, was announced by  Mexico's ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello Macias, in a sidewalk  interview at the end of a ceremony in Cuba commemorating the  birthday of Benito Juarez last 21 March.    "I do not know the technical details," said the ambassador,  "but I understand that Mexpetrol and a Cuban company will work  together to rehabilitate and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos.  They will process Mexican crude oil and other products there."    The Cienfuegos refinery, located in the southern part of the  island, has the capacity to process 3 million tons of crude a  year, according to data supplied by the Cupet company of Cuba.  At present it is partially shut down because Cuba does not have  any petroleum or any money to buy it. Moreover, the plant was  built with Soviet technology and needs renovation.    According to sources close to the negotiations, Mexpetrol  (of  which Pemex is the majority shareholder) and Cupet of Cuba  signed a "letter of intent" and will sign the agreement in two  months. The investment amounts to $200 million, $100 million  from Cupec in the form of the facilities, and $100 million from  the Mexican side, as follows: $50 million in swaps, with stock  in the refinery itself, and $50 million in fresh money.    Although Mexpetrol is heading up the negotiations for the  Mexican side, the Mexican Petroleum Institute (which will  provide the scientific studies) and the private construction  firms ICA and Protexa are also involved. Bancomext will provide  the credit.    This new Cuban-Mexican firm will pay for the credit in cash,  but there is also the possibility that it may make some payments  in refined Mexican crude.    Cienfuegos has one advantage in refining petrochemicals and  by-products: It is directly connected to a supertanker base in  the port of Matanzas, in the western part of the island, by a  187-kilometer pipeline.  <H5>  IUSA vs. Telmex </H5>   These three investments mark the beginning of Mexico's swaps  in Cuba. Other Mexicans are apparently looking for similar  opportunities.    In the case of IUSA, owned by Alejo Peralta, his son Carlos  Peralta offered the Cuban Government an investment project to  modernize the island's telephone system. The current system is  in a state of deterioration, and has 1950's-era technology. His  idea was to bring in satellite communication systems for  international and local calling.    As a prelude, he donated to Castro's government two rural  phone systems valued at $300,000 each. They are now in use in  the Provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana to link up various  agricultural camps.    The younger Peralta's representative in Cuba was Manuel  Cerrillo, who negotiated an investment project amounting to more  than $1 billion, 25 percent in swaps. The deal involved paying  approximately $200 million, equivalent to two-thirds of Cuba's  current debt to Mexico. Thus, it was the biggest investment  project between the two countries. A "protocol agreement" was  even signed.    Suddenly, to the Cubans' surprise, Carlos Peralta said  nevermind. He argued that his envoy, Cerrillo, had gone beyond  the authorized limitations in the negotiations and had signed on  to terms that Peralta had not agreed to. Havana officials were  surprised and irritated. It was revealed, however, that the  investment is not a lost cause, and there is hope that an  agreement can be reached.    In response, Carlos Slim, majority shareholder in Telmex,  stepped into the fray. He also submitted a proposal to modernize  the Cuban telephone system, and during the first week in March  he came to Havana to negotiate a deal.    Slim and Peralta are not the only ones vying to win this  contract from the Cuban Government. Several Spanish and English  firms and a Canadian one are also hoping for a nod from Castro's  government. Castro has formed a special group to study the  proposals.    For the time being, only two other Mexican businessmen have  made direct investments on the island: Luis Nino de Rivera, in a  cellular telephone system that he has operated in Havana and  Varadero for two years; and Monterrey businessmen Mauricio  Fernandez and Danny Tafich, who made a joint investment with the  Castro regime to breathe life into 15 Cuban textile plants that  had been practically idled for lack of capital and inputs.    Other companies have announced investment projects, but  nothing has come to pass yet. One example is Infra, which  belongs to Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, former president of the  National Association of Manufacturers (Canacintra), and which  tried to set up a plant to produce solder. Another is Bancomer,  which talked about introducing credit cards to Cuba and offering  other banking services. Other examples are the Vitro group,  which tried to build a plant to produce glass and plastic  containers; and Bufete Industrial, which intended to participate  in the construction of the Villa Cuba Hotel in Varadero.  <H5>  Mexico: Most Favored Nation </H5>   "Mexico is the most favored nation," stated Ernesto  Melendez,  president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation  (CECE), last year during a meeting with businessmen in London.  "But," he added, "the investment is still at a low level,  considering the two countries' potential."    So far, most Mexican businessmen have confined themselves to  the commerce sector. Some 200 companies of various sizes and  product lines are exporting everything from canned food to  intermediate manufactured goods to Cuba. The volume is small,  however. They do not account for as much as 5 percent of Cuba's  imports. Trade between the two countries reached $125 million in  1992. This is such a tiny proportion of Mexico's exports that  Cuba does not appear in its annual statistical reports on  foreign trade.    "We must be more aggressive about participating in trade  (with Cuba) so as not to be edged out by other countries,"  asserted Gutierrez Camposeco in October, when he was still  president of Canacintra, in a lengthy interview with the Mexican  business magazine EXPANSION.    But Mexican businessmen appear timid and slow to act. "Many  national goods that are sold on the Cuban market are not brought  in by Mexican firms, but by Spanish ones. In other words, the  Spaniards are eating our lunch in Cuba, and with our own  products," said Carlos Sanchez Lara, then Mexico's commercial  attache in Cuba, in June of last year to a delegation of 15  businessmen who had come to the island to look into the  possibilities for joint ventures.    "We cannot allow that to continue," he declared  emphatically.    Furthermore, "Mexico is squandering investment and trade  opportunities in Cuba because it is not up to date on that  market, and it has failed to take into account the very  favorable objective conditions: geographic proximity, stable  economic and political ties, common cultures, favorable  market...."    In the Cuban business world, Mexicans have gained a  reputation for "always saying yes, but not saying when."    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina acknowledged in February  that commercial relations with Mexico "are not as intensive as  we would like. Mexico knows this," he stated, "and we regret  it." He admitted that the economic ties are not commensurate  with the political relations the two countries have maintained,  and he expressed the hope that the situation would change as the  Cuban economy opens up more and more to foreign capital.    On 21 March of this year, Ambassador Carlos Tello stated  that  commercial ties between the two countries "are growing, and I  have been instructed to maintain them, strengthen them, and  expand them."    As if to dispel any doubts, he added: "There will be fresh  money, financing, and investment."</p>

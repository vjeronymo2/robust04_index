			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by D.E.: "Economic Strategy for Poland; Rapid </F> Development, Lower Costs"]    [Text] During the weekend session of the All-Polish Trade  Unions Agreement, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and  finance minister, presented the concept of the "Strategy for  Poland," prepared by the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party  and the Democratic Left Alliance. The document specifies the  goals that the coalition government will strive to achieve  between 1994 and 1997, and envisions the measures that need to  be taken and the threats that may arise. On Tuesday the strategy  was discussed at the session of the government. On Monday the  document reached the various ministers.    The "strategy" should contribute to the maintenance of a  high  rate of economic development. Between 1994 and 1997 the GDP may  increase by approximately 22 percent, that is, by approximately  5 percent a year on average. Real consumption will increase by  more than 10 percent. The rapid increase is to be accompanied by  macroeconomic and systemic stabilization of the economy, which  will lie, among other things, in the lowering of the rate of  increase of the public debt: In 2004 it should not exceed 60  percent of GDP. The budget deficit should drop from over 6  percent in 1992 to approximately 2-3 percent in 1997. The  inflation rate should be lowered to a single-digit figure by  1997. One of the fundamental springboards of the economic  development will be production for export.    The document draws particularly great attention to the  lowering of the social costs of reforms, the improvement of the  living conditions (it is envisioned that the average wage will  rise by 10 percent and the average retirement pension -- by 7  percent); it also stresses just, efficiency-oriented principles  of shaping wages and social insurances. It is expected that  greater pressure will be placed on active forms of combating  unemployment, whose rate should decrease from the current 16  percent to less than 14 percent at the end of 1997.    Here are some of the other main goals that are included in  the "Strategy": striving for a rapid integration with the  European Union, economic competitiveness on an international  level, and reform of the economic center.    Apart from this general section, the "Strategy" also  contains  10 main programs detailing the diagnoses, goals to be achieved,  planned measures, possible threats, as well as execution  criteria of achieving the main goals in such spheres, among  others, as wages, unemployment, development of the rural areas,  and development of the banking sector. Below we have briefly  discussed this detailed section of the document; we have drawn  attention mainly to the measures proposed and to the criteria of  execution. The latter are not quantitive, but only qualitative.  Despite that, in the future they will help evaluate the degree  to which the various intentions of the government have been put  into effect.  <H5>  Partnership-Like Labor Relationships and Negotiation-Related </H5> Mechanism of Wage Regulation    The government wants to create modern labor relationships.  The negotiation-related and decentralized mechanism of wage  regulation will assign the state the role of an arbiter that  resolves disputes between employers and employees.    This goal is to be achieved, among other things, through the  amendment of the Labor Code; as a result, it will become  possible, among other things, to:    -- conclude collective work agreements at the level of  enterprises, branches, and branches and regions;    -- impose on the employer the duty of notifying the employee  on the cause of an intended layoff; the employee will be  guaranteed the right to submit reservations;    -- adjust the leave law to the requirements specified in the  132 MOP [expansion unknown] Convention (among other things,  increase the minimum leave, create legal guarantees allowing the  use of leave every year);    -- prohibit the employee from conducting any activities  which  compete with the employer during the period in which he is  employed and for a year after this period.    Other plans are as follows:    1. Forming -- in democratic elections, in all companies both  public and private employing more than 20 persons -- enterprise  councils as supra-union employees' organs entitled to conclude  agreements at the enterprise level.    2. Amending a packet of laws: on trade unions, on the  organizations of employers, and on the resolution of collective  bargaining; accepting such an interpretation of these laws which  would guarantee a balance between the collective parties and the  work relationships.    3. The status of the Tripartite Commission for  Social-Economic Issues, acting at the central level, will soon  be regulated. Apart from issuing opinions, the commission will  be entitled to launch legislative initiatives, the contents of  which would be binding for all parties.    Possible threats here are the barriers and possibilities of  the economy's development and lack of progress in the  restructurization of the economy, particularly in the ownership,  organizational, substantive, technological, and regional spheres.    The government wants to treat the decline in the number of  working days lost by the economy as a result of strikes as a  criterion for the execution of this plan.   <H5>    Reform of the System of Social Insurance </H5>   The government sees the issue of a systemic resolution of  the  issue of the social insurance as one of the priorities of its  activities. A complex concept of reforming this sphere is being  prepared; preparations are also under way to implement it. It  must be realized, however, that the entire process will take  from 10 to 20 years to complete. At the same time steps will be  taken to increase the efficiency of the existing system.    One of the goals is to decrease the system's tendency to  create conflicts, through the enhancement of its clarity and the  individualization of the accounts of the individual participants  of the system; to gradually decrease the insurance premium  (which now amounts to 49 percent, along with the Labor Fund),  until a proportion comparable to the world level (approximately  25 percent) is reached.    Between 1994 and 1997:    1. The law on financing and organizing social insurances and  the law on the Social Insurance Agency will be changed;    2. There will be an individualization of the accounts of the  individual participants of the system;    3. Principles of paying the subscriptions by employees and  employers will be introduced which will make it possible to  control the state of the account by any interested person at any  time; as a result, private and state-owned companies will better  observe the discipline of paying the premiums, which will  increase the budget's revenues;    4. Identification cards will be introduced for all citizens;  on the basis of the cards, events influencing the state of the  account of each insured person will be registered;    5. The legal, institutional, and organizational framework of  the functioning of the retirement pension funds and of the  functioning of insurance companies will be created;    6. The present tax system will be modified in such a way as  to make it possible for employees and employers to include the  insurance premiums in the costs of obtaining the gains.    Moreover, the following is to be expected:    -- decreasing the number of persons entitled to retirement  benefits by prolonging the required employment period, equaling  the retirement age of men and women, and sharpening the  principles of retiring at an earlier age;    -- suspending the benefits, if a certain income level is  achieved, in the case of persons who are continuing (taking on)  a job after acquiring retirement rights;    -- changing the rules of the valorization of retirement and  disability pensions (departing from the indexation in relation  to the wage movement, in favor of adjustments to price changes;  [no closing parentheses as published]    -- decreasing the number of persons receiving invalids'  pensions, by making detailed diagnoses of the health condition,  by emphasizing rehabilitation before the pension is granted, by  sharpening the criteria of granting invalids' privileges  (especially in the case of persons who have maintained the  ability to work -- for example, liquidation of the third invalid  group);    -- regulating the payments of peasants' subscriptions to  KRUS  [expansion unknown];    -- standardizing the rules of paying sick leave and  maternity  leave benefits in all sectors of the economy;    -- enhancing the efficiency of solutions in the sphere of  social protection for unemployed persons; placing emphasis on  the control of the access to social benefits and using them as  motivational factors.    The government wants to treat the decrease in the share of  expenditures on social insurances in the budget's total  expenditures as a criterion for the execution of the plan.  <H5>  Countering Unemployment </H5>   In this sphere the government wants to pass on to an active  policy, the intention of which is the stimulation of the process  of creating new work places as well as the protection of public  finances.    The goals that have been set are as follows: gradually  lowering the unemployment rate, especially between 1995 and  1997, combating the chronic unemployment, and decreasing the  scale of unemployment among young people.    The main measures that are expected to be taken are as  follows:    1. Strengthening the pro-investment policy;    2. Linking modernization and restructurization programs more  closely to the situation on the labor market.    The demand for labor will be increased, among other things,  by great investment undertakings, initiated by the government,  linked to the modernization of the technical infrastructure of  the country; they will concern, among other things, the  modernization of the road network and the construction of super  highways, the development of the telecommunications,  modernization of the railroads system, development of the  natural gas supply system.    There will be a chance to limit unemployment and minimize  its  social results through the creation of special economic zones on  the foundation of companies with a rich technical  infrastructure, companies which have manufacturing property that  is not fully utilized and which employ highly-qualified  employees. One of the criteria of the evaluation of  privatization undertakings is the protection of work places.  This not only requires that clauses concerning the level of the  guaranteed employment are taken into account in contracts; it  also requires investment commitments whose implementation will  make it possible to maintain the existing work places and create  new ones.    The policy of countering unemployment will be carried out  at the regional level to a considerable degree; the criteria of  including local labor markets in the group that falls under  special activities will be sharpened. In these areas the  instruments that are supposed to cause an increase in employment  will be strengthened and concentrated. These will include, among  others: Entitlement to an accelerated amortization of fixed  assets, tax allowances for the training of employees and  apprentices provided by individuals conducting economic  activity, increasing of the employment limit which will not  result in the loss of the right to pay taxes in the form of the  tax charter, for a certain period -- due to investment  expenditure [as published], credit guarantees for small and  medium-sized companies, granting unemployment benefits directly  to the employers of the unemployed persons.    The following will be carried out in the social protection  system:    1. Modification of the principles of paying unemployment  benefits; greater emphasis will be put on the material situation  of the family of the unemployed person and on the differences in  the situation on local labor markets;    2. Change in the conditions of paying unemployment benefits  and in the registration of the unemployed; unemployed persons  who refuse to accept an offered job or training will be denied  the right to unemployment benefits for a certain period or  permanently;    3. A separate unemployment insurance will be introduced and  a  special insurance fund will be created, made up of the  subscriptions of employers and employees, and earmarked  exclusively for unemployment benefits. The establishment of the  unemployment insurance will lessen the burden on the state  budget -- the burden of financing unemployment benefits, and it  will allow an increase in the amount of money allocated for  active stimulation of employment. The introduction of an  insurance-related form of financing the unemployment benefits  will require (with the current scale of unemployment) that  subscriptions be set at the level of approximately 7-7.5 percent  of the wage fund.    The main criterion of execution will be the decrease in the  unemployment rate.  <H5>  Development of Rural Areas </H5>   The strategic goal in this sphere is to help Polish  agriculture and rural areas reach the standard of the  highly-developed European countries, because this is the only  way to defend Polish agriculture and peasants from foreign  competition.    Development in the conditions of the functioning of the  market mechanism will consist of a gradual limitation of the  rank of agriculture and an increase in the role of food  processing and distribution. This will be accompanied by the  strengthening of economically strong farms, as well as the  departure of weak and inefficient entities from agricultural  production. Following are methods that will be used to stimulate  these processes:    1. Stimulation of nonagricultural activities;    2. Interventionism, that is, a long-term, not a temporary,  program of the state's aid for agriculure. Intervention of the  state will assume the form of targeted aid, and will lead to an  acceleration of structural transformations in agriculture and to  the creation of work places in rural sectors other than  agriculture.    The government will consistently limit direct, nontargeted  intervention, which merely conserves the inefficient system of  production, perpetuates old structures, and defers the  indispensable process of transformations, by taking on a social  function.    The government will work out detailed programs of assistance  targeted for specific types of farms; it will define the  conditions that the peasant and the farm must satisfy to be able  to take advantage of the assistance; the document will also set  down the forms of assistance and methods of returning it (return  payments). So-called cheap credits for agriculture will be a  limited form of assistance and will be available only to young  peasants (to help them get started) and to farms which, with the  help of the state, will pass through a period of transformation  more quickly and which, after modernizing, will be able to pay  off the credit.    The state will provide support and assistance in the  financing of:    -- the biological progress, peasant and social consulting,  investments which result in the lowering of costs, improving  quality, and limiting food losses;    -- the development of the infrastructure, education, and  various forms of training that will help peasants change their  professions and work outside agriculture; the provision of  elementary vocational training.    Emphasis will be placed on the development of vertical  integration, especially on the basis of its simpler form --  contracts between peasants and the government for the supply of  agricultural products. This is an alternative to the central  limitation of production.    The main fears concerning the changes in this sphere is the  danger of conserving the existing situation in agriculture and  the creation of barriers around Polish agriculture which protect  it from foreign competition.    The main criterion of execution will be an increase in the  percentage of inhabitants of rural areas that are employed  outside agriculture in the total number of the population living  in rural areas.   <H5>    Investing in Human Capital </H5>   It is the government's view that the low amounts that were  spent for many years on education and training, constitute a  fundamental obstacle to restructuring the Polish economy today,  as well as a factor impeding our international competitiveness.  Therefore, the government will provide conditions conducive to  investments, both by public and private subjects.    The goal, among others, is to widen the scope of educating  the youth at high school and university levels.    In this area, the following can be expected:        -  Gradual exclusion from the tax basis [podstawa  opodatkowania] with regard to individual incomes, of part of the  expenditures borne on investing in human capital;    -  Inclusion of  part of the expenditures borne on books, professional journals,  scientific equipment and its software, into the cost of  obtaining profit by teachers;    -  Exclusion from the tax basis of  donations for public educational, scientific, cultural, and  health protection units.     The main criterion for execution will be an increasing role  of expenditures borne on education, science, culture, and health  protection, in the GDP.  <H5>  Managing State-Owned Wealth and Processes of Ownership </H5> Transformations    The main goal which the government wants to achieve will be  a  clear improvement in the management of state-owned property  through the establishment of strong, efficient, and productive  management structures. This will be accomplished, among others,  by transformations in the constitutive fundamentals of  state-owned enterprises, strengthening the independence of the  managements of state-owned enterprises of administrative organs,  stabilization of the managing cadre, stabilization of the  managing cadre through the application of managerial contracts  and strong economic incentives, and an institutional separation  of the State Treasury.    Shortly, the government, in cooperation with the concerned  parties, will define areas of the state's crucial interests in  which no ownership transformations are being planned, it will  indicate an enterprise destined for privatization, and it will  create the proper conditions for an efficient and speedy  dissolution and bankruptcy process.    The main means of implementation are:        -  Commercialization of state-owned enterprises and an  institutionalization of the State Treasury;    -  Setting in motion of  the Program of Popular Privatization by establishing National  Investment Funds;    -  Implementation of the  "Stabilization-Restructuring- Privatization" program which is  being introduced with organizational and financial participation  by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The  program covers those enterprises which are in a particularly  difficult situation, and which will be subject to a process of  bringing them back to health;    -  Continuation of the process of  financial restructuring of state-owned enterprises and banks  (which was begun in 1993);    -  Implementation of a long-term program  of financial, asset- related, and organizational restructuring  of those sectors which are particularly significant to the  economy, like mining, the steel industry, the arms industry, and  so on;    -  Privatization of the Polish economy by using all possible  privatization and decentralization-of-privatization-decisions  techniques. Among others, the following will take place:     -- Speeding up the sale of small and medium enterprises into  leasing by employee companies, through a simplification of the  procedures and a liberalization of the terms of leasing;    -- Introduction of a new institution of State Treasury  companies with employees or other private investors, enabling  partial privatization, with the possibility of conducting  full-scale privatization in the future, with the participation  of the same or other investors;        -  Undertaking rectification measures in enterprises that  do not meet the criteria which are indispensable in the process  of commercialization;    -  Speeding up the process of dissolving  enterprises which are continuously ineffective.     The main criterion of performance is an increase in the  contribution of the private sector to the GDP.   <H5>    Medium-Term Financial Strategy </H5>   Meeting repayments and servicing the cost of the foreign  debt, requires development of the sector of production of  export-bound goods and also of goods which are substitutive in  relation to imports. It is a key issue in the long-term policy  of a stable equilibrium in the balance of payments.    The financial strategy for the years 1994-97 is subordinated  to the goal of implementing the fundamental goals of the  economic and social program, that is to say, maintaining the  rate of real economic growth at the level of about 5 percent per  year, and a reduction of the inflation rate below the level of  10 percent in 1997.    Here are the main goals of the government's medium-term  financial strategy:        -  Gradual return to a balance in the budget sector. It  will be taking place through a reduction of the deficits  occurring in that sector vis-a-vis the GDP, from 3.9 percent in  1994 down to 2-3 percent in 1997, and also through a  stabilization of the internal public debt at the level of below  90 percent of GDP and a lessening of the cost of servicing the  debt from about 4 percent of the GDP in 1994 down to 2.5 percent  in 1997. This will make it possible to halt the decreasing trend  occurring in the size of bank credits granted to the  nonfinancial sector, and to accomplish a real growth of these  credits at a rate that would approximate the real growth in the  GDP;    -  Mobilization of domestic savings and an improvement in the  banking system's credit potential, as well as developing the  financial and capital market;    -  Maintaining the rate of real  growth in expenditures and revenues in the 1994-97 period at  below the rate of growth of the real GDP, and also maintaining  the rate of real expenditure growth at below the level of the  rate of real revenue growth;    -  Stabilization of the growth of  foreign currency reserves (but the document fails to define at  what level), despite a negative foreign-trade balance when it  comes to routine turnover in the entire period up to  1997;    -  Gradual reduction of the foreign trade deficit vis-a-vis  the GDP, as a result of a real and almost 1.5-time growth in  exports compared with the growth in GDP, and as a result of  reducing the distance between the real rate of import growth and  the rate of general economic growth;    -  Maintaining the stable  situation in the balance of payments over the medium term, with  a very strict observance of repayments due and of servicing the  foreign debt, in accordance with stipulations agreed upon with  the Paris and London Clubs;    -  Denomination of the zloty and  introduction into circulation of new banknotes and coins  effective 1 January 1995.     Monetary policies will play a fundamental role in  stabilizing  the economy. The main instruments of that policy shall be:        -  Maintaining credits for the nonfinancial sector in  relation to the GDP at the level which is expected at the end of  this year, that is about 19.5 percent;    -  A fall in real and  nominal interest rates; the process will be influenced by the  restructuring and by injecting additional capital into the  banking sector, as well as by a gradual reduction of the rate of  mandatory reserves;    -  A clearly slower rate of reduction of  interest rates on bank deposits than a reduction of interest  rates on export credits, along with (in the initial stage)  guarantees by the state budget;    -  The kind of policies of foreign  currency exchange rates which will maintain a stable relation of  the zloty's real value to convertible currencies, with a  simultaneous observance of the principle of a creeping growth of  the exchange rate, which would be ever decreasing, along with a  fall in the inflation rate;    -  A gradual change in the tax  structure, which would be aimed at increasing the role of  indirect taxes in general tax revenues, with a gradual reduction  in the burden of income taxes, especially through a wider  application of tax breaks;    -  An increased discipline of budget  expenditures, including a reduction of the cost of servicing the  domestic public debt, as well as slowing down the excessive rate  of growth of expenditures borne on retirement pensions, other  kinds of pensions, and social transfers. A fundamental part in  that regard will be played by: A reform in the system of social  insurance, establishment of retirement-pension funds, changing  the principles of indexing of retirement and other kinds of  pensions, a reduction of the cost of social protection along  with targeting those social groups that are really the most  needy, as the recipients of that protection;    -  At least a partial  inclusion of the results of the activity of the economic "gray  area" into the tax rate basis ("tax basis").     The main risk lies in the danger of inflation. Its return --  or a reduction which would be lower than assumed in the program  -- will automatically mean a decreased reduction of interest  rates and deteriorated conditions for investment and economic  growth.    The main criterion of execution will be a fall in the  relation of public debt to the GDP.   <H5>    Development and Reforms of Financial Sector </H5>   The government's main strategic goal is to take further  measures for the sake of developing a strong, diversified, and  efficient financial system. Measures will be continued for the  sake of strengthening the National Bank of Poland's [NBP]  independence and position as the state's currency-issuing bank  and the government's financial agent, with a simultaneous  freeing of NBP of ownership-investment and supervision  functions. The government's policies toward the banking sector  will be very clearly aimed at making its role in the process of  economic growth more active through injecting additional capital  into the banks, an improvement in the security of economic  turnover, and so forth.    Stimulation and supporting the process of consolidation of  commercial banks is supposed to be accomplished through, among  others:        -  Supporting the process of more efficient and stronger  banks taking over weaker banks which are incapable of acting on  their own;    -  Attaching inefficient banks acting in the form of  Treasury-owned joint-stock companies, to those banks which are  the State Treasury's property, and which have demonstrated a  capability to generate profit for the owner and a simultaneous  rise in the real value of their own funds;    -  Establishment of  regional and supraregional banks, with the ultimate goal of  establishing between 10 and 20 of them in Poland;    -  Establishment  of a network of specialized banks, geared toward servicing  specific kinds of activity, specific markets, types of  operations, and so forth;    -  Transforming employee "grant-and-loan  funds" [kasy zapomogowo-pozyczkowe] and cooperative  savings-and-credit funds, into local funds and societies of  credit self-help.     A Bank Guarantee Fund will be established which will  function  as a guarantor of bank deposits. This will take the burden off  the central bank and the state budget in terms of responsibility  in that area.    An independent organ of banking supervision will be  separated  from NBP's structure, giving it the importance of a chief  supervision organ.    Gradual consolidation and demonopolization of the insurance  sector will be conducted, among others through supporting the  process of integration among small insurance companies and  applying selectivity in granting licenses to foreign firms.    By the end of 1994, an insurance supervision division will  be  established within the Finance Ministry, and an independent  Office of Insurance Supervision will be established.    Before the end of 1994, the proper conditions will be  created, enabling operation of both closed and open (of the  "Pioneer" type) trust funds.    The government will support the process of entry into the  market by institutional investors other than trust funds, like  insurance companies, retirement pension funds, and to some  extent also banks, especially those which are geared toward  investment activities and toward guaranteeing new issues  [emisje].    The government will support the establishment of venture  funds [preceding two words in English] to diversify the sources  of financing developmental ventures of a high risk factor, which  by definition cannot be covered by financing coming from banks.    A further development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange will be  continued, among others through the building of a second and  third hall. At the same time, measures will be undertaken to  initiate a stock exchange for date operations [gielda operacji  terminowych] for foreign currencies and stock-market instruments.    The main criterion of performance is a reduction of the  differences between interest rates on deposits and interest  rates on credits.  <H5>  Security of Economic Transactions and Absorption of "Gray </H5> Area"    Development of the so-called "gray area" is a result (and  also the reason) of the lack of security of economic  transactions.    Therefore, the government will make efforts to:        -  Popularize noncash transactions by using bills of  exchange, and by securing executability of claims arising out of  bills of exchange;    -  Encourage the use of checks in economic  transactions;    -  Prevent many crimes in banking, checks, and bills  of exchange transactions, and also increase the rate of  detection of these crimes;    -  Introduce a uniform system of  rendering payments by using magnetic cards (including  foreign-made ones);    -  Introduce the obligation to have a bank  account by every economic unit fulfilling specific criteria (for  instance involvement in economic transactions);    -  Improve the  system of bank noncash settlements, among others through  supporting the work conducted by the National Settlement  Chamber;    -  Introduce institutional barriers to prevent so-called  money laundering.     In relations with foreign countries, and especially in the  state's foreign-currency policies, limitations on capital  transfers out of Poland, shall be maintained over the next few  years. Some provisions for protecting Polish investments will be  widened, through conclusion of bilateral agreements on  protecting and supporting investments.    Perfecting institutional mechanisms in the area of taxes on  merchandise and services, is being planned (widening the subject  and object scope of the tax; perfecting the system of turnover  taxes; eliminating unfair competition; imposing taxes on  unregistered activity, mainly in the so-called "gray area,"  which will be accomplished through a continuously updated and  uniform database on taxpayers; a duty to apply fiscal cash boxes  [kasy fiskalne] in retail trade and other popular services,  which will be introduced in stages; improving the system of  documentation and circulation of documents, among others with  the goal of mutual identification of taxpayers).    Further measures include, among others, the widening of the  scope of investment breaks in income tax, establishment of a  popular taxpayer database, introduction by the Finance Ministry  of a complete and comprehensive information system of real  estate for fiscal purposes, and creating incentives and the  proper conditions for revealing the entire profit by registered  companies.    Effective in 1995, customs services will be subordinated to  the finance minister, making it possible to comprehensively  settle customs and tax payments by just one integrated apparatus.    In addition, the following will be accomplished:        -  Establishing an institution of deposit insurance which  will operate in the form of a fund, guaranteeing bank deposits  by individuals and by economic units;    -  Establishing a credit  insurance fund, with the participation of the State Treasury,  and with the goal of providing credit guarantees for small- and  medium-size enterprises which do not have their own capital --  the fund will make it possible to obtain credits by conventional  means.     The main criterion of execution is a fall in the rate of  economic crime, and a widening of the tax basis.  <H5>  International Competitiveness of Polish Economy </H5>   The main goals are:        -  Establishment of a modern economy that would be  characterized by a significant contribution of exports to the  GDP, and a beneficial position in international  trade;    -  Establishment of the proper conditions that would attract  foreign capital and effectively use it in the process of  development;    -  Poland's integration with the world economy  (European Union, European Free Trade Association, CEFTA), and  Poland's institutional presence in the system of international  cooperation.     The main means of accomplishment are:        -  Persistent implementation of the already existing  programs of action, like: Fundamentals of the states' pro-export  policies, timeframe for the implementation of the state's  pro-export policies, programs supporting Eastern policies,  fundamentals of the policies of economic cooperation with  countries of the former USSR, East and Central Europe, and with  China;    -  Continuation of the process of building a network of  treaty-based agreements which will open up the cooperation of  Polish and foreign economic units, with the goal of a  geographical widening of markets;    -  Intensification of promotion  of exports, especially to European countries, and also to China,  Japan, India, countries of Asia and the Pacific, Latin America,  and the Middle East;    -  Preparing a draft law concerning insurance  with regard to export credits from noncommercial risk, as well  as strengthening and enlarging the Corporation for Export Credit  Insurance.</p>

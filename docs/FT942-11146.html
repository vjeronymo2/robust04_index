			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy sale of Reuters News and financial information group Reuters Holdings was the most heavily traded stock in London and recorded one of its highest daily turnover totals since flotation. The volume was boosted by a Pounds 65m stake sale, believed to have been carried out by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, executed an agency cross of 13.5m shares. The deal accounted for 27m of the day's final turnover of 34m shares and was concluded at 480p a share. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bought 12.5 per cent of Reuters in 1984 and was recently quoted as holding just under 7 per cent of the company's shares. Yesterday's deal represented a reduction of 0.8 per cent. It came just days after Reuters' key European presentation to analysts and potential customers in Geneva. However, most analysts did not believe that it pointed to a change of heart by the company's leading shareholder. They pointed out that Reuters shares had outperformed the FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index by 40 per cent over the past year. With the potential pressure of the trade out of the way, the shares ended the session 11 higher at 500p.</p>

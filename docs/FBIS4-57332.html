			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has  appointed Nitzia de Villarreal commerce and industries minister,  a post she accepted this afternoon and which she will occupy as  of 1 September.    Boris Moreno, secretary to the president-elect, announced  the  decision and said that Villarreal is a founding member of the  Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] who served the Commerce and  Industries Ministry for over 12 years. She also worked in the  hydrocarbons directorate with much professionalism.    [Begin recording] [Villarreal] Of course I will dedicate all  my professional efforts, capability, and energy in my post for  the benefit of the country. The Commerce and Industries  Ministry is one of the engines of economic development. I think  the task is difficult, but I feel capable of accomplishing it.    [Unidentified reporter] What is your goal for your future  position?    [Villarreal] Again, I believe the most important thing is to  hold consultations among parties. With the support of the  industrial and commercial sectors, we can do a good job. The  doors to my office will be open to anyone who approaches,  especially investors, so this country can progress the way we  want it to. [end recording]    Nitzia de Villarreal is a petroleum engineer and has a  master's degree in industrial management. She played a key role  in negotiating the purchase of oil from Mexico and in planning a  national hydrocarbons policy.    The president-elect's secretary also confirmed that only two  cabinet posts have been officially announced.    [Begin Moreno recording] Mr. Gabriel Lewis Galindo has been  confirmed [as foreign minister] by the president of the  Republic, as has the minister of commerce and industries. So  far these are the only posts the president has announced  officially. I would say that all of the posts will be announced  in the next 24 to 48 hours. [end recording]</p>

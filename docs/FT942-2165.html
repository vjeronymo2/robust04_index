			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Lawson sceptical of solution to boom-bust Pledges by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, to avoid a repeat of the boom-bust scenarios of the past are 'somewhat premature', Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said yesterday. 'As experience throughout the world makes clear, abolition of the economic cycle is simply not within the power of any government to deliver,' Lord Lawson said in a lecture organised by the Social Market Foundation and the London School of Economics. Instead of focusing on the short-term vagaries of the business cycle, about which policy-makers could do very little, they should concentrate on boosting long-term performance by improving the supply side of the economy, said Lord Lawson, Britain's longest serving post-war chancellor until his resignation in 1989. 'The plain fact is that the economic cycle is endemic - which means, incidentally, that all the current talk of no return to 'boom and bust is somewhat premature to say the least'. Lord Lawson, delivering his verdict on the government's economic record 10 years after his keynote Mais speech, which became the blueprint for the Thatcher years, repeated his criticism of the government's reluctance to grant independence to the Bank.</p>

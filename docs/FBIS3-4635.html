			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jakarta, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA--Minister of Finance  Mar'ie Muhammad has stated that, if state receipts for the  1993/1994 fiscal year are not as large as were estimated in the  1993/1994 budget, reductions in expenditures will be made, so  that the budget will remain in balance.    He had just finished speaking at a symposium on increasing  the role of BEPEKA [state financial supervisory board] during  the Second Development Era, held in Jakarta on 25 January on the  47th anniversary of the establishment of BEPEKA. Later on, the  minister of finance told reporters that state receipts must  equal expenditures for the budget to be in balance. It is now  estimated that the petroleum price will not reach its goal.  Therefore, to resolve this problem, the government will make  reductions in the budget.    He stated: "At present reductions have been made in several  government departments, for example, by reducing official  travel. The BPEN [National Exports Development Board] is  reducing the number of trade missions sent abroad."    According to present estimates, the average petroleum price  during the 1993/1994 fiscal year will be $16.64 per barrel,  whereas in the 1993/1994 budget it was estimated at $18 per  barrel.    As is known, the budget for fiscal year 1993/1994 is 62.322  trillion rupiahs. Some time ago the minister of finance stated  that every decline in the petroleum price of $1.00 per barrel  results in a loss of $600 million in state receipts. As a  result, if the average price of petroleum is $16.64 per barrel  during fiscal year 1993/1994, whereas the budget estimate was  $18 per barrel, the decline in the petroleum price of $1.36  means that state receipts will decline by $16 billion.    When he was asked about the possibility of using funds from  the Development Reserve Budget, Minister of Finance Mar'ie did  not answer. He said: "I will speak about all of that in  Parliament."    Meanwhile, in his speech at the symposium Mar'ie said that  if, as a result of investigations, it is learned that there are  indications that criminal acts have been committed, the matter  should be reported directly and without prior permission to the  police and the public prosecutor for further steps to be taken.  He said: "It is not necessary to ask for permission. That is the  law. If no action is taken by the individual's superiors, he  should report the matter to the director general. If action is  still not taken, he should report the matter to the minister  concerned or even to the president. In this matter we must be  absolutely correct," he said. Reports to intermediate level  supervisory officials are made only for their information.    The legal basis for this problem is quite broad, both in the  Constitution as well as in the basic explanatory section of  Paragraph 23 of the Constitution of 1945. The matter of  reporting indications of criminal actions is referred to in the  explanatory section of Paragraph 3.    Mar'ie said that, to obtain the desired results, more  harmonious cooperation is needed between BEPEKA and supervisory  authorities. He remarked: "I am not saying that BEPEKA must  start its investigations from zero. However, we must stand on  the principle of effectiveness, except for very large-scale  projects. BEPEKA must investigate matters from the beginning. I  do not wish to reduce the authority of BEPEKA. I am only saying  what I think." He said that we must also keep in mind that we  have limited powers and facilities.    He said that, in addition, there must be good cooperation  between government agencies. He stated: "Even what is  investigated must be open and aboveboard, and there must be  `full disclosure.' If the PAN [state administration  investigative body] has completed its investigation but  Parliament does not clearly understand the matter, Parliament  can ask for a clarification from BEPEKA, because the agency that  conducts the investigation is better informed about it."    Meanwhile, in connection with increasing efficiency,  Minister  of Finance Mar'ie gave the example of the establishment of a new  office in a given department. He said: "BEPEKA must investigate  whether the new office is really necessary and whether its  functions do not `overlap' those of another office."    At the same time, in a discussion in the corridors, J.B.  Sumarlin, chairman of BEPEKA, said that the function of BEPEKA,  among other things, is to collect more complete evidence. This  places BEPEKA in the position of investigator of state financial  responsibility. He said: "If BEPEKA functions properly, it can  optimize the use of public funds." Furthermore, BEPEKA also  investigates the use of state financial resources to determine  whether they are properly and effectively employed in carrying  out approved programs. Regarding the view that only smaller  projects should be investigated, Sumarlin said that this is not  true. He stated: "It is not true that large-scale projects are  not investigated. Investigations of these projects have not been  completed, and the government is sufficiently open."    He said that state financial investigations use the device  of  an audit. At present state financial investigations in countries  overseas cover 30 percent of budget volume, whereas in Indonesia  only 10 percent is covered by BEPEKA, while the remaining 90  percent is handled by other institutions, such as the BPKP  [Finance and Development Supervision Board] and other agencies.    On this occasion Kwik Kian Gie, an economic observer, said  that BEPEKA should conduct state financial investigations of 60  percent of the budget volume.    The role of BEPEKA as an investigative body should be  considered from its technical ability to handle cultural  questions, such as overcoming "embarrassment" in pursuing its  inquiries. It must have the courage to say what is true and to  discuss corruption as a whole, even if what it reviews under the  law causes the financial foundations of the state to shake  because of the amount of money involved.    Meanwhile Aberson Marle Sihaloho, a member of the Committee  on the Budget in Parliament from the FPDI [Indonesian Democracy  Party Faction], said that to strengthen the role of BEPEKA, it  must be an "independent" agency. It must be separated from the  functions of investigation and supervision.    Investigation of state financial management is handled by  BEPEKA. The authority of BEPEKA only covers formal truth.  Meanwhile, Parliament, which examines the substance of truth,  has no function in this matter. He said: "This is because what  BEPEKA investigates is only a sector or subsector and is not an  entire program and activities under it."    Hamzah Haz, a member of the Committee on the Budget from the  PPP [United Development Party] Faction, stated that in approving  the state budget the position of Parliament is stronger than  that of the government. Parliament is the supreme budget  authority. Therefore, in this matter Parliament truly exercises  the authority of the MPR [People's Consultative Council]. This  function of Parliament is different from that of BEPEKA,  however, in carrying out its duty separately from the  government. However, BEPEKA does not stand above the government.    Recalling the fact that BEPEKA is a budget supervisory  agency  established by Parliament to work with the government, while the  position of Parliament is stronger than that of the government,  BEPEKA should be closer to Parliament than to the government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have to broker a truce with our neighbors and  embark on a revival of the economy and the restoration of our  cities. We also demand the proclamation of the autonomy of the  Banja Luka region and the setting of democratic elections for  the assembly and government of the Krajina. This is stated in  the statement released by the Banja Luka Regional Council of the  Serbian People's Front just before the New Year holidays.    We were (?pushed) into battle in order to ensure that all  Serbs live in one state, but 100,000 of us were killed in the  process. In addition to this, we are threatened by an  international slaughter. Our Krajina can live and prosper  without Pale. That is why we demand that normal people be  allowed to conduct political life. They are lying when they say  that the corridor means life for our children, because our  children have a greater need for living fathers. Corridors will  abound in peacetime, and they will be as wide as our hearts.  However, when we say all this, we are openly arrested and  persecuted by Karadzic's henchmen. This is stated in the  statement issued by the Banja Luka Regional Council of the  Serbian People's Front.</p>

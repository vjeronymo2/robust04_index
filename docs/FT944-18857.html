			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec Sports shares dive 33p - Warning that margins will continue to slide follows losses of Pounds 7m Shares in Hi-Tec Sports tumbled by 33p to 45p yesterday as the sports shoe and leisure wear company reported a fall into headline losses in the six months to July 31 and suggested that margins would continue to slide until at least the spring of 1995. In a period of significant changes within the group, pre-tax profits of Pounds 776,000 were turned into losses of Pounds 7.11m after exceptional charges of Pounds 5.91m and interest payable Pounds 401,000 higher at Pounds 1.54m. The restructuring was now over, said Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman and 53.19 per cent shareholder, and the loss-making activities had been 'dealt with'. Apart from the closure of the European subsidiaries, the most important event has been the disposal of 60 per cent of Cofex, the Dutch company which makes fashion jackets under the Bad Boys brand name. In the period it incurred unchanged trading losses of Pounds 1.95m, and accounted for Pounds 202,000 of interest charges and Pounds 5.1m in respect of goodwill previously written off. Mr van Wezel said that the losses this time masked underlying growth in the the group's core rugged outdoor footwear and were different from the recessionary losses of two years ago. Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 59.4m), including Pounds 3.73m from discontinued operations. On continuing activities, margins were down about 2 per cent across the group. Stripping out Cofex, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 2.9m) on turnover up at Pounds 56.7m (Pounds 53.9m). Mr Peter Butler said that having never been properly monitored, group stock was now being managed at lower levels and that these stock reductions would continue. Stock provisions had been raised by Pounds 500,000. Discounting seasonal swings, debt had been reduced by Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 21.3m. In North America, operating profits fell to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2m) on turnover of Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 23.6m). Mr van Wezel said a sudden fall-off in the fashionability of the Magnum law enforcement boots among urban youth disguised a 22 per cent rise in sales of the core hiking boots. There was also a hiatus when the group repositioned its products and withdrew them from discount retailers. Some Pounds 4m of sales were lost. In the UK and Ireland profits eased by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 700,000 on sales up 9 per cent to Pounds 21.6m. Sales of brown boots rose from 12 to 19 per cent of the total. South Africa did well since the elections, accounting for some Pounds 5m of the rest of the world's Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 6.8m) total. Profits were Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 700,000). The group has changed its auditor from KPMG Peat Marwick to Touche Ross. It has also changed its year-end from January 31, 'in the middle of our delivery season' to April 30. The interim dividend is 1.6p (1.25p), increased for the 15-month period. The directors are taking up the scrip alternative, so the cash element is covered 1.4 times, even though losses were 15.6p (earnings 1.4p) per share. Forecasts for the year to January 31 have fallen to Pounds 2m or earnings of 3p, for a prospective multiple of 15.</p>

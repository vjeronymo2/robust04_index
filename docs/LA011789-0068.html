			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MEDIA BID FAREWELL TO REAGAN, SHULTZ  </P> <P> The Soviet media once fumed at President Reagan, but the nation's two most  prestigious newspapers bid respectful and even fond farewells Monday to Reagan  and his secretary of state, George P. Shultz, for helping U.S.-Soviet  relations.  </P> <P> "Of course, Reagan has remained Reagan, the anti-Communist and the troubadour  of Western society," the government newspaper Izvestia said in a front-page  article. "But the restructuring of international relations could not bypass the  White House."  </P> <P> In 1984, Reagan quipped into an open microphone that he would begin bombing the  Soviet Union in five minutes. In the last days of his presidency, however,  Soviets recall not those "five minutes" but his five summit meetings with  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Izvestia said.  </P> <P> "And this is not because we have short memories but because a long road lies  ahead of us, which we can only overcome together," wrote the newspaper's  commentator, former U.S.-based correspondent Melor Sturua.  </P> <P> Pravda, the Communist Party daily, painted an extraordinarily intimate portrait  of Shultz, Reagan's secretary of state since July, 1982, and declared: "It will  be just to note that Shultz was one of the architects of the turning-point in  Soviet-U.S. relations."  </P> <P> In the recent warming between the superpowers, Pravda said, "Shultz's realism  had a telling effect, as well as his sober recognition of the fact that in the  nuclear age, the self-preservation of our two countries can be guaranteed only  by the avenues of dialogue."  </P> <P> The U.S. secretary of state is also the father of five children, an experienced  gourmet cook, an ardent golf and tennis player and an avid devotee of ballroom  dancing, Pravda told its readers -- surprising revelations in a country where  most citizens know virtually nothing about the lives of their own leaders.  </P></p>

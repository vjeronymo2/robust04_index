A passenger in his car, Michael Jackson, 35, of Littlerock, suffered  major injuries.  </P> <P> In the other car, the driver, Steven Schroeder, 33, of Murrieta, Calif., also  suffered major injuries.

All of the injured were treated at hospitals in the Antelope  Valley, Officer Miguel Siordia said.  </P> <P> Siordia said it is unclear why the driver did not stop his car at the  intersection.

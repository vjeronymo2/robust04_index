			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: White knight moves in for Brabant with Pounds 9.6m offer BRABANT Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas explorer which has been fighting a paper bid from fellow resource company Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday threw itself into the arms of a North American white knight in a last ditch effort to avoid a hostile takeover. The board has recommended a 58p per share cash offer from Houston-based Energy Development Corporation, a subsidiary of a New Jersey public utility, valuing Brabant at Pounds 9.6m. The price compares with Brabant's flotation price of 155p in October 1990. If the EDC offer succeeds, Brabant will withdraw from the USM. Aberdeen, which itself is battling a hostile bid from Pittencrieff, the natural resources and telecommunications group, indicated yesterday that it intended to take up the EDC offer. Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing director, said the company would make a Pounds 500,000 profit after 'transaction-related expenses'. The EDC deal was agreed late Monday night as it became apparent that shareholders representing more than 40 per cent of Brabant were not supportive. Mr Nicholas Gay, finance director, said that as recently as Wednesday, Brabant had been confident of victory in its battle against Aberdeen. However on Thursday, a New York arbitrage firm had managed to buy some 12.5 per cent of Brabant's shares from small shareholders. Towards the end of the week it was also discovered that one of Brabant's largest institutional investors was anxious to dispose of its stake. Mr Gay said that after these events - and taking into account the 21 per cent either held by or pledged to Aberdeen it became apparent that Brabant would be very vulnerable even if Aberdeen's bid failed. EDC, which is being advised by Charterhouse, said it had received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer representing 18.94 per cent of Brabant.</p>

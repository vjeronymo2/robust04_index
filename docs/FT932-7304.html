			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Attack on Daf buy-out 'subsidy' LABOUR-controlled Lancashire County Council yesterday asked Mr John Major to intervene in the receivership of Leyland Daf trucks and confirm whether rival bidders to a management buy-out team have been offered government financial backing. Lancashire Enterprises, the county council's privatised economic development agency, is supporting the team trying to buy out the truck assembly plant in Leyland. The agency suspects rival bidders have been offered help by the Scottish Office to bid for both Leyland Daf's axle plant in Glasgow and the Lancashire plant. Mrs Louise Ellman, deputy chairman of the agency and leader of the council, said this would be a misuse of public funds, favouring Scottish jobs at the expense of English ones. Under the management bid, Lancashire Enterprises would buy the Leyland factory, lease part of it to the management for production and develop the rest, together with the 230-acre surrounding site, as a business and technology park. Barclays Development Capital is providing equity support. Arthur Andersen, the receiver, agreed the Pounds 40m-plus deal in principle a month ago, but said it would continue to talk to other bidders during completion negotiations. The receiver hopes to complete any deals by mid-June and said there were several other bidders. Only one, Mr Ian McKinnon, a former chief executive of Leyland Bus, had agreed to be named. Mr McKinnon has refused to name his financial backers. The Scottish Office last night refused to comment on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.</p>

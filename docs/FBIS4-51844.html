			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta -- January-December 1993 period saw an  increase of 3.84 percent in Indonesia's imports with December  registering an import increase of 1.30 percent compared with the  corresponding period in 1992, a report from the Ministry for  Trade discloses.    According to report made available to ANTARA here over the  weekend, the import increase is lower than 20.96 percent of  increase registered for 1988-1992.    Indonesia's imports in December totalled 2.821 billion U.S.  dollars, while in December 1992 the figure stood at 2.785  billion U.S. dollars.    During January-December 1993 period, the total imports rose  to 28.3 billion U.S. dollars from 27.3 billion U.S. dollars  recorded in the previous year.    The report also said that the increase of import value in  1993 was low in comparison with that of 1992 because of the low  growth in the import value of non-oil/gas commodities, which in  its turn was attributed to the low growth registered in the  import of capital goods and auxiliary raw materials.    All this, the report continued, illustrates that in 1993  domestic investments, either new investments or expansion of  existing investments, did not develop well.    Likewise, the report noted production activities did not go  on at a pace as rapid as that during 1988-1992.    However, it is interesting to note, the report continued,  that compared with the value recorded for 1992, imports of  consumer goods decreased in value in 1993, adding that this  decrease was related to the decline in the imports of beverages  and processed foods for households and durable consumer goods.    The report revealed that the imports of consumer goods in  1993 went down by 5.95 percent, viz. from 1.176 billion U.S.  dollars registered in 1992 to 1.106 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

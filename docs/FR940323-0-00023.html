ICI subsequently changed its name to Zeneca Ag Products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54354), EPA issued a notice that announced that Zeneca Ag Products, P.O. Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, submitted a petition (3F4232) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation to permit residues of acetochlor and its metabolites containing the ethyl methyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxy ethyl methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety, to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents, in or on the raw agricultural commodities soybean grain at 0.1 ppm, soybean forage at 0.7 ppm, soybean hay at 1.1 ppm, wheat forage at 0.5 ppm, wheat straw at 0.1 ppm, sorghum forage at 0.1 ppm, sorghum fodder at 0.1 ppm, sorghum silage at 0.05 ppm and sorghum hay at 0.2 ppm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received in response to the notices of filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monsanto Co. and Zencea Ag Products formed a partnership, Acetochlor Registration Partnership (ARP). The ARP revised PP 3F2966 and PP 1F4011 by proposing the establishment of tolerances for residues of acetochlor and its metabolites containing the ethylmethyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxy ethyl methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents in or on the raw agricultural commodities field corn grain at 0.05 ppm, field corn forage at 1.0 ppm, and field corn fodder at 1.5 ppm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The company name for the filing notice of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54354) should have read Acetochlor Registration Partnership instead of Zeneca Ag Products. During the course of review, it was determined that the proposal for PP 3F4232 needed further clarifications. The ARP amended PP 3F44232 by proposing the establishment of tolerances for residues of acetochlor and its metabolites containing the ethyl methyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxy ethyl methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents, in or on the raw agricultural commodities soybean grain at 0.1 ppm, soybean forage at 0.7 ppm, soybean hay at 1.0 ppm, wheat grain at 0.02 ppm, wheat forage at 0.5 ppm, wheat straw at 0.1 ppm, wheat forage at 0.1 ppm, sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm, sorghum forage at 0.1 ppm, sorghum fodder at 0.1 ppm, sorghum silage at 0.05 ppm, and sorghum hay at 0.2 ppm. The forthcoming update of Table II of the Residue Chemistry Guidelines will not list sorghum silage and sorghum hay as commodities requiring residue data. Therefore, the tolerance proposals of sorghum silage at 0.05 ppm and sorghum hay at 0.2 ppm are being withdrawn, since establishment of tolerances on these commodities is not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the tolerances on wheat grain at 0.02 ppm and sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm were not previously published, EPA will soon publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of the ARP's petition to establish these tolerances. This document will allow 30 days for public comment on the regulated wheat grain and sorghum tolerances. All other revisions to pesticide petitions 3F2966, 1F4011, and 3F4232 by the ARP involved clarifications of recent rewording of previously published proposals or minor changes, e.g., lowering the soybean hay tolerance to 1.0 ppm from 1.1 ppm; therefore, no additional period of public comment is needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. The acetochlor toxicological data listed below were considered in support of these tolerances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Acute toxicology data submitted place technical acetochlor in toxicity category II for eye irritation, toxicity III for acute oral, acute dermal, and acute inhalation. Technical acetochlor is in category IV for primary skin irritation and is a skin sensitizer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A 3-month feeding study submitted by Monsanto with rats fed dosages of 0, 40, 100, and 300 milligrams /kilograms/day (mg/kg/day) resulted in a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) of 40 mg/kg/day based on loss of body weight and decreased food consumption at 100 mg/kg/day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A 3-week dermal study submitted by Monsanto with rabbits fed dosages of 0, 100, 400, and 1,200 mg/kg/day resulted in a NOEL for systemic effects of 6,400 mg/kg/day based on mortality and decreased body weight at 1,200 mg/kg/day, (HDT). The lowest effect level (LEL) for dermal irritation was 100 mg/kg lowest dose test (LDT). A NOEL for dermal irritation was not established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A 3-week dermal study submitted by ICI with rats fed dosages of 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day resulted in minimal to mild skin irritation after 21 days. Signs of systemic toxicity were not apparent at any level. Higher doses were not possible because of severe dermal toxicity at higher doses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In a 1-year feeding study submitted by Monsanto, with dogs fed dosages of 0, 4, 12, and 40 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 12 mg/kg/day based on decreased body weight gains in males, decreased terminal body weight in females, testicular atrophy with accompanying decreases in absolute and relative testicular weight, increase in relative liver weights in male and females, and clinical chemistry changes at 40 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In a 1-year feeding study submitted by ICI, with dogs fed dosages of 0, 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day based on increased salivation, ornithine carbamyl transferase, and triglyceride values accompanied by decreased blood glucose levels and liver glycogen levels at 10 mg/kg/day. Interstitial nephritis, tubular degeneration of the testes and hypospermia were reported. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In a developmental study submitted by Monsanto, with rats fed dosages of 0, 50, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day, acetochlor did not induce developmental toxicity in rats up to 400 mg/kg/day (HDT). The maternal NOEL was 200 mg/kg/day based on matting and/or staining of the anogenital region, a decrease in mean maternal weight gain during the treatment period, and in adjusted mean weight gain on gestation day 20 at 400 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In a developmental study submitted by ICI, with rats fed dosages of 0, 40, 150, and 600 mg/kg/day, the developmental NOEL was 150 mg/kg/day based on increased resorptions, post-implantation loss, and decrease in mean fetal weight at 600 mg/kg/day (HDT). The maternal toxicity for this study was 150 mg/kg/day based on animals sacrificed moribund, clinical observations, and decreased body weight gain at 600 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In a developmental study submitted by Monsanto, with rabbits fed dosages of 0, 15, 50, and 190 mg/kg/day, (females) acetochlor did not induce developmental toxicity in rabbits up to 190 mg/kg/day (HDT). The maternal toxicity NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day based on loss of body weight during dosing at 190 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In a developmental study subbmitted by ICI, with rabbits fed dosages of 0, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day, acetochlor did not induce either maternal or developmental toxicity up to 300 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. In a two-generation reproduction study submitted by Monsanto, with rats fed dosages of 0, 30.4, 74.1, and 324.5 mg/kg/day (males) or 0, 44.9, 130.1, and 441.5 mg/kg/day (females), the reproductive NOEL was 30.4 mg/kg/day for males and 44.9 mg/kg/day for females, based on decreased body weight gain of F2b pups at 74.1 mg/kg/day for males and 130.1 mg/kg/day for females. A NOEL for systemic effects was not established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. In a two-generation reproduction study submitted by ICI, with rats fed dosages of 0, 1.6, 21, and 160 mg/kg/day, the reproductive NOEL was 21 mg/kg/day based on significant reductions in pup weight at lactational day 21 and total body weight gain during lactation at 160 mg/kg/day (HDT). The parental NOEL was 21 mg/kg/day based on reductions in body weight, accompanied by slight reductions in food consumption and significant increases in relative organ weights at 160 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. In a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by Monsanto with mice fed dosages of 0, 75, 225, and 750 mg/kg/day carcinogenic effects noted included increased incidence of liver carcinomas in high-dose males, total lung tumors in females at all dose levels, carcinomas of lungs in females fed 75 and 750 mg/kg/day, uterine histiocytic sarcomas in females at all dose levels, and total benign ovarian tumors in mid-dose females. Other dose-related changes included (1) increased mortality and decreased mean body weights in both high-dose males and females, (2) decreased red blood cell count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin in high-dose females at terminal sacrifice, (3) increased white blood count in high-dose males at terminal sacrifice, (4) increased platelet count in mid- and high-dose females at terminal sacrifice, (5) increased mean liver weight and liver-to-body-weight ratios at study termination in all dose groups of males and in high-dose females; increased absolute and relative kidney weights in all dose groups of males at termination; increased absolute and relative adrenal weights in all groups of males and in high-dose females at study termination; and (6) increased interstitial nephritis in high-dose males and females. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. In a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by ICI with mice fed dosages 0, 1.1, 11, and 116 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 1.4, 13, and 135 mg/kg/day in females, carcinogenic effects noted included an increase in pulmonary adenoma in both male and females at the high dose. Pulmonary tumors were confirmed as adenomas or carcinomas of the lung parenchyma and were all of the alveolar type. The NOEL for systemic toxicity in females was 13 mg/kg/day based on a significant increase in anterior polar vacuoles in the lens of the eye at 135 mg/kg/day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. In a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by Monsanto, with rats fed dosages of 0, 22, 69, and 250 mg/kg/day (males) or 0, 30, 93, and 343 mg/kg/day (females), carcinogenic effects noted at 250 mg/kg/day in males and 343 mg/kg/day in females included hepatocellular carcinoma in both sexes and thyroid follicular cell adenoma in males. Nasal papillary adenomas were noted in male rats at 69 mg/kg/day and above and in females at 93 mg/kg/day. A NOEL for chronic effects was not established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. In a repeat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by Monsanto, in rats fed dosages of 0, 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg/day oncogenic effects noted at 50 mg/kg/day (HDT) included neoplastic nodules of the liver, follicular adenoma/cystadenoma of the thyroids and papillary edema of the mucosa of the nose/turbinates in high dose animals. The NOEL for chronic effects was 10 mg/kg/day based on decreased body weights and body weight gain in both sexes, high cholesterol levels in males, increased absolute and relative kidney and liver weight in males, and increased testicular weights at 50 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. In a 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by ICI, with rats fed dosages of 0, 0.8, 7.9, and 79.6 mg/kg/day, carcinogenic effects noted at 79.6 mg/kg/day (HDT) included a significant increase in nasal epithelial adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in both sexes at 79.6 mg/kg/day. Also, at that dose nasal carcinoma was present in two males and one female rat at this dose. Rare tumors in the form of benign chondroma of the femur and basal cell tumor of the stomach were also observed at 79.6 mg/kg/day. The systemic NOEL was 7.9 mg/kg/day based on decreased body weight gain, decreased food efficiency, increased organ to body weight ratios, increased plasma GGT and cholesterol at 79.6 mg/kg/day (HDT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. In mutagenicity testing, submitted by Monsanto, acetochlor was weakly positive in the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay with and without activation in the mouse lymphoma assay. Acetochlor was negative in a DNA damage repair assay in rat hepatocytes, a Salmonella assay, and two (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  chromosomal aberration studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. In mutagenicity tests conducted by ICI, acetochlor induced a reproducible, positive, mutagenic response in strain TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium with metabolic activation at 100  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> u <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/plate (however, this was less than the 2 X background mutation, but was significant at p less than 0.05). Significant increases in number of revertant colonies were not induced in strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA98, and TA100. Acetochlor was not clastogenic in a mouse micronucleus test at doses tested (898 and 1,436 mg/kg in males; 1,075 and 1,719 mg/kg in females). Acetochlor was clastogenic in cultured human lymphocytes both in the presence and absence of 59 mix at 100  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> u <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/ml, and in the absence of 59 mix at 50  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> u <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/ml. Acetochlor induced a weak DNA repair (measured by UDS) in rat hepatocytes derived from animals exposed in vivo at 2,000 mg/kg. In a structural chromosome aberration study, acetochlor at doses 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg resulted in reduced fertility during weeks 2, 3, and 4 of this study, as shown by reduced pregnancy incidence, decreased implants per pregnancy incidence, increased preimplantion loss, and loss, and decreased time implant per pregnancy. Early late intrauterine deaths were not affected in this study. There was positive evidence of mutagenicity at the mid- and high-dose levels in this study. Available testing for acetochlor by Monsanto was referred to the Toxicology Branch Peer Review Committed (PRC) for evaluation on September 12, 1985. Based on available information, the PRC classified acetochlor as a B2 Carcinogen-Probable Human Carcinogen for the following reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Increased incidence in rats of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in males. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. An increased incidence in mice of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes, lung carcinomas, uterine histiocytic sarcomas, benign ovarian tumors, and kidney adenomas in females. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Positive mutagenic data in the CHO/HGPRT and mouse lymphoma assays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Positive carcinogenicity data on structural analogues, alachlor, butachlor, and metolachlor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After review of the repeat chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in rats and reevaluation of slides from the original rat study, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee met February 8, 1989, to discuss acetochlor with special reference to its carcinogenic potential for causing nasal tumors. The PRC cited an increased incidence of nasal adenomas in rats in (2) studies and a stronger analogy to alachlor which also causes tumors. The PRC reaffirmed the classification of acetochlor as a B2 carcinogen (probable human carcinogen) and recommended that the quantitative risk assessment (Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> *1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) be based on the data on nasal turbinate papillary adenomas in male and female rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Results of the peer reviews were referred to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) on September 28, 1989. The SAP agreed that acetochlor should be classified as a B2 carcinogen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available testing for acetochlor, submitted by ICI, was referred to the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee on October 16, 1991, for discussion and evaluation of the weight-of-the-evidence on acetochlor with particular reference to its carcinogenic potential. The PRC agreed that acetochlor should be classified as a Group B2_Probable Human carcinogen. This was consistent with earlier decisions based on Monsanto data. The combined data strengthens the Group B2 classification. The committee noted that the two data bases on acetochlor from two different registrants were in close agreement with each other concerning the major tumor types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of risk characterization for acetochlor, a low-dose extrapolation model applied to the experimental animal tumor data was used for quantification of human risk (Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). For quantification, the Committee recommended separate calculations for both sexes of rats using the combined incidence for nasal tumors for each sex. The separate values were then combined using appropriate statistical methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RfD was based on a NOEL of 2.0 mg/kg/day established in a 1-year feeding study with dogs (ICI) and using an uncertainty factor of 100 is calculated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) for the general U.S. population for corn uses is 1.7 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mg/kg/day or 0.1% of the RfD. The TMRC for the soybean, sorghum and wheat rotational crop tolerance is 1.1 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mg/kg/ kwt/day or 0.5% of the RfD. The total TMRC for all crop tolerances for the general U.S. population is 1.3 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mg/kg kwt/day or 0.6% of the RfD. For the mostly highly exposed subgroup, nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the TMRC from the corn uses and rotational crop uses is 4.9 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mg/kg kwt/day (0.2% of RfD) and 3.6 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mg/kg kwt/day (2% of the RfD) respectively, for a total of 4.1 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mg/kg kwt/day or 2% of the RfD. TMRC is calculated assuming that residues are at the established tolerances or at maximum residue limits if the tolerances do not include all metabolites and that 100 percent of the corn crop is treated with acetochlor and that the rotational crops would all be grown in fields where acetochlor-treated corn has been grown. The TMRC discussed here include the commodities wheat grain and sorghum grain being proposed elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> *1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of 0.017 mg/kg/day, the upper-bound lifetime cancer risk was calculated to be 2.9 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for field corn tolerances and 1.9 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the rotational crop tolerances. The upper-bound carcinogenic risk from corn and the rotational crop tolerances (including sorghum grain and wheat grain which are proposed elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) was calculated to be 2.2 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data lacking include an unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exposure and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vitro <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  culture) for metabolite 57, and a cytogenetics assay for aberrations using cultured human lymphocytes for metabolite 57. The petitioner has been notified of these deficiencies and has agreed to submit the studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are currently no regulations against the registration of this chemical for use on corn. Even though acetochlor is classified as a B2- carcinogen, EPA believes that the establishment of these tolerances will not pose an unreasonable risk to humans as a result of dietary exposure. The establishment of these tolerances utilize less than 1% (0.6%) of the RfD. The upper bound carcinogenic risk of 2.2 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is in the range of 1 X 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a level generally presumed to be no greater than a negligible risk. Morever, this estimate is considered worst-case, and it probably overestimates the dietary cancer risk. It is unlikely that the following assumptions made by the Agency, namely, (1) that residues will be at the establised tolerances levels, (2) that 100 percent of the corn crop will be treated with acetochlor, and (3) that all rotational crops will be grown where acetochlor treated corn has been grown, are actually the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pesticide is useful for the purpose for which tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue is adequately understood for the purposes of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology (high-pressure liquid chromotography (HPLC) using an oxidative coulometric electrochemical detector (OCED)is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead-time from establishing tolerances to publication, the enforcement methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement.

Therefore, EPA is establishing the tolerances as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , file written objections and/or request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor`s contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted if the Adminstrator determines that the material submitted shows the following; there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.

In the New Year address, he designated this year as the year  of revolutionary turn when socialist construction in our country  will enter a new development stage, and as the year of rewarding  struggle for the entire party, the whole country and all people  to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts by fully  mobilizing themselves.    Seeing the spirit of struggle of party members and working  people, who have risen in the rewarding struggle to effect a  new, great upsurge, we again realize that the great Chollima  upsurge, which the great leader personally initiated, has been  led to a constant upsurge thanks to the energetic leadership of  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We recall these proud  annals of our revolution with emotion.    Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and  people, has indicated: We should effect a great upsurge and a  great leap in socialist construction by upholding the  revolutionary banner of the chuche idea--the red banner of  revolution. Thus, we should resolutely break the spearhead of  the enemy's attack which is directed at us and should fully  demonstrate the true nature of chuche Korea and the might of  socialism.    When we look back upon the history of great upsurges in  socialist construction, we come to recall, first of all, the  great Chollima upsurge. Initiated under the wise leadership of  the great leader, the consistently carried out great Chollima  march brought about great reform, in cataclysmic change, by  compressing time, and opened a great era of prosperity and  development.    The dear comrade leader said during his visit to the land of  Kangson during the initial stages of the great Chollima upsurge,  that he was greatly encouraged by all that he had heard about  the resolution of the working class, and that he firmly believes  that the working class in Kangson will repay the great leader's  lofty trust and expectations without fail.    While assisting the leadership of the great leader who  constantly gave on-the-spot guidance, the dear comrade leader  was keenly aware of the loyalty of the working class to the  party throughout the country and of the boundless creative power  of the popular masses. Thus, he consolidated the will to  constantly succeed with the history of great upsurge on this  land.    The will cherished by the dear comrade leader when the  tradition of great revolutionary upsurge was provided in our  country has been embodied as refined leadership from the late  1960's to the present. As a result, great upsurges were  constantly created in the history of socialist construction in  our country.    To cope with the extremely strained situation in the later  part of the 1960's, the great leader put forward the line of  simultaneously advancing economic construction and national  defense construction. During that time, the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong- il wisely led the struggle to effect a new great  revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction.    While meeting with functionaries of science and education  department of the party Central Committee in June 1967, the dear  comrade leader gave scientific answers to theoretical and  practical problems raised in socialist economic construction in  a statement on correctly comprehending political and moral  stimulation [chaguk] and material stimulation. The dear comrade  leader gave the scientific explanation that in a socialist  society, priority should be given to political and moral  stimulation, that this stimulation should be supported by  material stimulation, and that in socialist society, importance  should be attached to speed above all else, so that speed is  regarded as the basic factor. As a result, an ideological and  theoretical guideline enabling us to effect a new great  revolutionary upsurge in all domains of economic construction  and national defense construction was provided.    In July 1967, the dear comrade leader expounded upon the  direction of ideological work to inspire all people to the great  upsurge. He emphasized that all functionaries and workers  should highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and arduous struggle, vigorously wage the technological  revolution by producing to the maximum and saving to the  maximum, and more actively carry out the Chollima workteam  movement.    In July 1967, while giving guidance to the work of Kangson  steel plant, dear comrade leader became aware of the lofty  revolutionary zeal of the working class. As soon as he returned  to the party Central Committee that day, he prepared militant  slogans, including "Let us effect a great revolutionary upsurge  once again by continuously accelerating the great Chollima  march," and encouraged functionaries of the party Central  Committee to go down to the lower echelons to carry out  political work with these slogans.    Visiting the working class in Yongsong in August 1967, dear  comrade leader concretely explained the essence and significance  of the party's new policy for effecting a great revolutionary  upsurge. He encouraged and inspired the working class in  Yongsong to advance at the van of the great revolutionary  upsurge by proudly cherishing deep trust by the great leader.    Thanks to the wise leadership of dear comrade leader, the  flames of the great revolutionary upsurge, which were set ablaze  by the great leader among the working class in Yongsong, became  more fiercely aflame across the country, and a new great upsurge  was effected on all fronts of economic construction and national  defense construction.    Our revolution, facing a new period in the 1970's, was  raised  onto a high stage when the slogan on remodeling the entire  society on the chuche idea was put forward and implemented and  socialist construction was developed into a great majestic  battle.    This reality urgently raised the demand not only for firmly  maintaining the already accomplished revolutionary upsurge in  socialist construction, but also for enhancing it to an even  higher stage.    With uncommon wisdom and scientific insight, dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il keenly realized the matured demand of  revolutionary development and revolutionary aspirations of the  popular masses. By putting forward a unique and outstanding idea  on the speed battle, he vigorously inspired the entire party,  the whole country, and all the people to the march of the speed  battle -- a new general march for victory in the great socialist  construction battle.    The speed battle is a basic combat formula to push ahead  with  all works in a lightning manner and is a revolutionary principle  for implementation of work. The basic demand of the speed  battle is to push for work with maximum speed by mobilizing all  forces and to ensure the high-quality of the work. The basic  method for vigorously carrying out the speed battle is to push  ahead vigorously with the ideological and technological  revolution and to support organizational guidance work. Let us  all rise in the speed battle.    Since ideas and theories pertaining to the speed battle and  the party's slogans containing such ideas and theories were put  forward, the history of the great upsurge in socialist  construction in our country, which proudly decorated the fifties  and the sixties with the great Chollima march, became more  brilliant in the seventies with the majestic march of the speed  battle.    The march of the speed battle was a new march of our people  who accelerated socialist construction by pushing ahead with all  work in a lightning manner and with incomparable speed, which  was more speedy than the hurricane-like speed of the era of  great Chollima upsurge. This march was a great all-people march,  which advanced with uncommon speed and with the spirit of adding  the speed battle to Chollima.    With the beginning of the majestic march of the speed  battle,  our socialist construction effected a new upsurge. The flames of  the speed battle enabled us to create a new Chollima speed, such  as the speed of 70-day battle, and to register a miracle of  accomplishing the six-year national economic plan far ahead of  schedule.    The flames of the speed battle fiercely blazed in the  eighties, and enabled us to build on this land everlasting  monumental creations throughout the country, including a  10,000-ton press in Yongsong, a large-size oxygen separator in  Nagwon, the Tower of Chuche Idea, the Gate of Triumph, the Great  People's Study Hall, Changgwang Street, Samchong Square in  Komdok, and Sohae Lockgate.    The policy of the speed battle, whose might has already been  displayed through practice, is demonstrating greater vitality  every day. The bugle sound of the speed battle has become a  powerful force of pushing for the struggle to achieve the  party's revolutionary economic strategy.    The great revolutionary upsurge, which our people should  effect to achieve brilliantly the party's revolutionary economic  strategy; and the great revolutionary upsurge, which our people  should create anew with the might of the single-hearted unity  and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, is the  optimistic and trustworthy revolutionary upsurge due to the  iron-clad will and refined leadership of the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il, who is a genius of revolution and construction.    Just as our people effected the great Chollima upsurge by  upholding the lofty intention and wise leadership of the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a new great revolutionary upsurge  will be effected on this land without fail, because of the might  of the people who are firmly united with the dear comrade leader.    Thus, we will smash antisocialist maneuvers of the enemy and  will demonstrate to the entire world once again the firmness and  might of popular mass-centered socialism of our own style.</p>

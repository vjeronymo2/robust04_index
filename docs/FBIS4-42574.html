			<p>BFN     [Text] Replying to an Albanian Foreign Ministry statement  made yesterday accusing Greece of blocking European Union [EU]  aid, thus punishing Albania and the Greek minority, Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said Greece is following  an open-door policy toward Albania. He said the Greek  Government wants good relations with Albania, adding that it  respects Albania's territorial integrity. He stressed, however,  that the cornerstone of good bilateral relations is respect for  the human and minority rights.    Referring to Albanian-EU relations, the Foreign Ministry  spokesman said Greece is obliged to tell Albania that its  relations with the EU depend on respect for human rights. Bikas  recalled that 350,000 Albanians live and work in Greece, thus  strengthening the Albanian economy with $300 million a year.</p>

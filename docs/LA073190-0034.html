			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLEMENS ACHING SHOULDER GIVES WHITE SOX PAIN  </P> <P> Roger Clemens is hurting, but he has found a way to turn the pain around.  </P> <P> Clemens scattered nine hits Monday night, pitching his second consecutive  shutout as the Boston Red Sox downed the Chicago White Sox, 3-0, at Boston.  </P> <P> "I'm throwing zeroes, but I've been fortunate," Clemens said. "I'm just praying  I can work myself through this. I've had to quit a little throwing on the side,  but I'm making good pitches. Maybe I'm more of a pitcher now.  </P> <P> "I've been pretty upset the last couple of weeks since word got out. I don't  want anyone to know when I'm hurting. Once word gets out other teams have an  advantage on me. And I don't like that."  </P> <P> Taking a regular turn despite occasional right shouler pain that "feels like a  cramp in the back of the leg," Clemens (14-5) struck out eight and didn't issue  a walk in pitching the 23rd shutout of his career.  </P> <P> Clemens needed 125 pitches to extend his scoreless streak to 23 innings,  continually pitching out of trouble, especially in the first few innings.  </P> <P> The Red Sox remained one game behind Toronto in the AL East, and Chicago fell  three games behind Oakland in the AL West.  </P> <P> Wade Boggs had two doubles, driving in one run and scoring one, and Carlos  Quintana hit a solo homer, his seventh, in helping Clemens beat Chicago's Adam  Peterson (1-3).  </P> <P> Oakland 6, Seattle 2 -- Reliever Mike Jackson walked Dave Henderson to force in  the go-ahead run and the Athletics scored four times with two out in the  seventh to beat the Mariners at Oakland.  </P> <P> Seattle starter Randy Johnson (9-7) lost his fourth consecutive start.  </P> <P> Terry Steinbach followed the walk to Henderson with a two-run single and Felix  Jose singled home another run.  </P> <P> Rick Honeycutt (2-2), the third of four Oakland pitchers, got the victory with  relief help from Dennis Eckersley, who pitched 1 1/3 innings for his 32nd save.  </P> <P> Toronto 9, Baltimore 2 -- Kelly Gruber had three hits, including a two-run  homer, and Todd Stottlemyre allowed six hits over six innings to snap a  four-game losing streak as the Blue Jays routed the Orioles at Baltimore.  </P> <P> George Bell hit the 200th home run of his career and Pat Borders added a  two-run homer for the Blue Jays, who had 12 hits, including three by Mookie  Wilson.  </P> <P> Texas 3, Milwaukee 1 -- Bobby Witt allowed four hits in seven innings for his  sixth consecutive victory as the Rangers beat the Brewers at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Witt (9-8), who is 5-0 in July, struck out five and walked three.  </P> <P> Jeff Kunkel, a .147 hitter, broke a 1-1 tie with his first home run since last  September a blast off Bill Krueger (5-6).  </P> <P> Kansas City 7, Cleveland 6 -- Gerald Perry homered to start a four-run fourth  inning and Andy McGaffigan won his second consecutive start as the Royals beat  the Indians at Cleveland.  </P> <P> McGaffigan (2-0) gave up one run on five hits in 5 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE  </P> <P> Houston 6, San Francisco 1 -- Danny Darwin pitched eight strong innings and the  Astros scored five runs in the eighth with the help of two errors to beat the  Giants at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Houston broke a 1-1 tie when right fielder Mike Kingery misplayed Rafael  Ramirez's bases-loaded sacrifice fly to score the first run.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Carl Nichols singled home two runs and the final two came home  when Matt Williams misplayed a routine grounder by Bill Doran.  </P> <P> Atlanta 4, San Diego 3 -- Oddibe McDowell hit a leadoff homer in the 11th  inning and the Braves beat the Padres at San Diego to snap a five-game losing  streak.  </P> <P> Reliever Dwayne Henry (2-1) got the win with relief from Tony Castillo.  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / People: Morgan Grenfell tempts former ambassador Sir John Whitehead, British ambassador to Tokyo for the past six years, recalls how, in the early 1970s, a group of his FCO colleagues chose to move into City merchant banks which were looking to spread their wings internationally. 'I was slightly tempted at the time and, if I had gone, it might well have been to Morgan Grenfell.' Now Sir John, who retired in August, is this week taking up the role of senior adviser to the Morgan Grenfell Group, pursuing what he describes as 'almost a sentimental attachment as well as a nice offer'. His elder son, Simon, who happens already to be at Morgan on the international banking side, recently returned from two years in Moscow. Other senior advisers to Morgan Grenfell include Lord Pennock, former deputy chairman of ICI, and Sir Peter Carey, former permanent secretary at the DTI. In what he says will be the largest commitment in his new incarnation in the private sector, Sir John will initially be advising the group on Japan, a country in which he has lived for a total of 17 years. But he thinks he can be of use in a much broader role, with an input into business in the whole of the Asia Pacific region as well as gradually in Europe. 'His name will embellish the notepaper but we also expect him to do a lot more,' says Michael Dobson, Morgan's chief executive. Usefully for Morgan, which is now owned by Deutsche Bank, Sir John speaks German, having spent four years in Bonn as well as having read the subject at Oxford. He says he has yet to meet Deutsche's boss, Hilmar Kopper. A tireless promoter of UK-Japan trade - the ex-ambassador points out that during his tour Japan moved from being the UK's 16th to its ninth best export market (after the US and seven European nations) - Sir John is also advising the President of the Board of Trade on British export policy as well as helping the Welsh Development Agency with its inward investment programme.</p>

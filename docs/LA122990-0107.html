			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSULTANTS ARE SPREADING WORD ON WORLD TRADE  </P> <P> For 15 years, Ryusuke Hoshino worked his way up the bureaucratic ranks of the  Japan External Trade Organization in Tokyo to become the director of its  prestigious U.S. market research division.  </P> <P> As a top official in the Japanese government trade organization, Hoshino  traveled extensively to help expand his nation's trade ties with countries in  North America, Asia, Europe and Africa.  </P> <P> But one day, he did the unthinkable in Japanese society. He quit his job at age  40, moved his family to Santa Ana, where he has many friends and business  associates, and started his own international trade-consulting firm.  </P> <P> In so doing, Hoshino joined a growing legion of business people who are forming  their own international consulting firms to take advantage of a boom in  international trade.  </P> <P> Hoshino and others like him see opportunity in the political and economic  changes that are sweeping the world, changes that are already altering the  complexion of global commerce. The thawing of Cold War tensions has meant an  easing of trade restrictions between the West and East. And the removal of  trade barriers among the 13-member nations of the European Economic Community  will create new opportunities in that market beginning in 1992.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Pacific Rim countries like Japan and Taiwan are slowly opening their  markets to foreign products to help shrink huge trade surpluses with the United  States.  </P> <P> And, of equal importance, a sluggish U.S. economy has prompted many American  firms to get serious about selling abroad to help fuel their growth.  </P> <P> In Orange County, 1990 was a big year for international deals. There were  transactions to sell fuel-cleaning systems in Spain, hamburger franchises in  Indonesia, computer hardware to China, Playboy and other magazines in the  Soviet Union and to mine gold in the Philippines.  </P> <P> And these deals sparked demand by companies in Orange County and elsewhere for  consultants who specialize in a particular country's business practices,  government regulations, customs and language.  </P> <P> Nationwide, there was a 25% jump in requests for consultants, according to Carl  Kline, president of National Consultant Referrals, a San Diego firm that  matches companies with professional consultants. In 1990, his firm has logged  more than 12,500 calls from companies seeking consultants. About one-fourth of  the approximately 4,000 consultants listed in the firm's referral service were  added this year.  </P> <P> "Many companies, especially during an economic slowdown, do not want to keep a  very expensive permanent staff, so they keep a small core staff to keep their  overhead low and use consultants for special projects," Kline said.  </P> <P> One consultant new to the trade is Bernard Jubb, formerly a communications  director for MAI Systems Corp., a Tustin computer company.  </P> <P> Jubb was laid off during a corporate restructuring at MAI in October.  </P> <P> Jubb, a native of Great Britain, hopes to use his knowledge of Western European  markets to help U.S. companies seeking business in those markets after European  economic unification in 1992.  </P> <P> Likewise, his familiarity with the U.S. market, he reasons, may be useful to  European companies that want to sell their products in the United States.  </P> <P> "I can do the marketing studies and test market their products for them," he  said.  </P> <P> "What I don't have is a lot of corporate resources, but I have the ability to  make fast decisions and move very quickly to put my decisions into action."  </P> <P> The lure of increased trade opportunities have also prompted executives in  troubled businesses to get into the consulting field. Markram Nawar, a Newport  Beach developer, turned to consulting when the housing market went into a  slump.  </P> <P> Nawar, an Egyptian immigrant, has helped U.S. and Canadian companies put  together barter trade deals with the Soviets, working through an Egyptian firm.  </P> <P> "Opportunity came, and I had the contacts, so I put the deal together," said  Nawar, who is paid consulting fees by Egyptian and Canadian companies.  </P> <P> "I realized it's so easy to make money in trading and consulting," he said.  </P> <P> Encouraged by his success, Nawar has decided to set up an export-import and  trade consulting business, which he hopes will carry him through until the real  estate market recovers.  </P> <P> U.S. companies are learning that each foreign market is unique, and they are  increasingly hiring consultants who are knowledgeable about those markets, said  Pete Maddox, a managing partner of the Lido Group in Orange.  </P> <P> Maddox was one of several consultants who worked with Speedy International, an  Orange-based company that set up several quick-printing franchises in India,  Japan and Western Europe in 1990.  </P> <P> "Each foreign market that American companies do business with has its own  highly unique characteristics and those who understand and adapt to those  characteristics succeed," he said.  </P> <P> But not everyone has the expertise to become a consultant, said Kline, of  National Consultant Referrals.  </P> <P> A consultant is an expert in a specific field and other areas such as  marketing, contracts and pricing, he said.  </P> <P> "Our database contains experts in their chosen fields and does not include  temporarily unemployed executives," Kline said.  </P> <P> "We require the person to have successfully done one or two consulting  assignments."  </P> <P> Hiring an inexperienced consultant can result in deals collapsing after a  considerable investment of time and money, soured relations with an  international partner and other problems.  </P> <P> The best way for a company to determine if a consultant is qualified for a job,  Kline advises, is to examine his or her track record in arranging similar  deals.  </P> <P> The National Bureau of Professional Management Consultants in San Diego has  pushed for a consultant certification program, similar to the test that  accountants must pass to become a certified public accountant.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Francisco Ramirez Cardenas] </F>   [Text] Havana, 2 May (NOTIMEX) -- Thousands of Cubans today  continued besieging the special stores that sell in dollars for  fear of renewed price increases and the replacement of the U.S.  currency by a local convertible peso.    [Words indistinct] National Assembly (Parliament), which is  examining a harsh program of adjustments to reduce the budget  deficit and the cash surplus. The budget deficit is currently  4.2 billion pesos and the excess working capital totals 11.636  billion, both equivalant to dollars at the official exchange  rate.    For over a week, long lines of people have been gathering at  the doors of the so-called diplomatic stores (diplotiendas)  spurred by rumors to the effect that upon making purchases their  dollars will be devaluated. This devaluation will become  effective with the official issuance of new bills called  certificates, which the people will exchange for devalued pesos  at an as yet unspecified rate, according to diplomatic sources.    The purpose, according to the government media, is to  exercise control over the growing dollarization of the island's  economy. In August 1993 the government legalized the possession  and use by citizens of freely convertible foreign currency.    Managers of stores such as the Caracol Chain, Panamericana,  and Tecnitiendas over the weekend required the help of police to  control cases of extreme tension among people in the lines. On  San Rafael Street, an ancient commercial area where state-owned  establishments' display cases are empty, the multitude  overflowed the sidewalks and tangible tension at times posed a  threat to the glass display cases. The manager of a Caracol  store in the old Free Havana hotel issued instructions to have  one of the lines moved back approximately 50 meters from the  facility because "they hardly allowed room for the tourists,"  who are given priority.    At the supermarket located at the intersection of 5th and  42d  Streets in the once exclusive Miramar neighborhood, NOTIMEX saw  a line of Cubans with bags stuffed with various items, including  household appliances such as pots, television sets, and tape  recorders. These purchases, which some diplomats attributed to  panic, were confused with many people's purchases for "Mothers'  Day," which is celebrated in Cuba on the second Sunday in May.    Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez yesterday  defended the plan to collect a greater volume of dollars by  selling products in those stores at higher prices and by taxing  individuals whose salaries are paid in foreign currency. "The  established policy is to collect the highest margins of profit  through high prices, from foreign currency holders. These funds  are then redistributed throughout the country for the people's  benefit," according to Rodriguez.    At those stores, some of which bear the acronym TRD (foreign  currency collection stores), prices are (?comparable) to those  in the big cities of developed countries such as Tokyo, Paris,  and New York.    Through the legalization of the dollar, the promotion of  foreign investments, and tourism, the government is attempting  to deal with the serious shortage of foreign currency resulting  from the loss of its relations, preferential trade, and aid from  the now defunct USSR. Since the legalization, the dollar has  become the only currency with real purchasing power and for some  the ownership of dollars has become a relief from the shortage  of food, medicines, and other consumer goods.    According to Rodriguez, the taxation of income received in  foreign currency would be applied to those people who receive  payment in dollars and not to those who receive money from  relatives abroad, such as exiles in the United States and other  countries.    Having been authorized to undertake self-employment,  producers who have no property and individuals who provide  services are asking their clients for dollars, each of which go  for 100 to 120 pesos on the flourishing black market.    Rodriguez also outlined to the legislators a package of  monetary measures that include price and public service tariff  increases, the implementation of taxes, the cessation of  subsidies and heretofore free services, without dismissing the  possibility of a change of national currency.    President Fidel Castro on Sunday told legislators that it is  not only a matter of reorganizing the country's finances but of  revaluating the money and salaries of state employees, 76  percent of whom receive an average of 180 pesos a month.</p>

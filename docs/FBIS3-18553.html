While the papers and television  jointly sang the refrain that "there is no coup," this was in  fact confirmed by statements made by General Hursit Tolon,  secretary general of General Staff, and Colonel Dogu  Silahcioglu, head of the Public Relations Department of the  General Staff, to the effect that "DEP [Democracy Party] leader  Hatip Dicle's statement has generated indignation within the  Armed Forces," and by President Demirel's statement that "the  Army is uneasy." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Landing at the Cankaya Presidential Palace </H5>   These are the developments which led up to the General  Staff's warning to the Government: Five noncommissioned cadets  were killed by a bomb explosion at Istanbul's Tuzla train  station on 12 February. The PKK's [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  revenge teams claimed responsibility for the attack. The  developments took a new turn when, replying to Guneri Civaoglu's  questions on ATV [television station] on 17 February, DEP leader  Hatip Dicle said: "I do not approve of the Tuzla incident, but,  everybody in military uniform is a target during a war.  However, the Geneva treaty prohibits the targeting of  civilians." These words triggered the process that ended with  the warning by the General Staff.    Gures went to Cankaya Presidential Palace on 18 February  without a prior appointment. The chief of the General Staff  said the generals serving in the southeast were enraged, and  criticized Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk and Parliament  for producing nothing but words.    This was followed by a mini-security summit with the  participation of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Gunes' warning  that "there is serious concern" was also repeated in a veiled  manner at the summit. After the meeting, SABAH's Ankara  reporter quoted political circles as saying "a decision was made  about a number of DEP deputies." At the demand of Gures, this  meeting decided to immediately lift the immunity of Hatip Dicle  and a number of DEP deputies. [passage omitted]</p>

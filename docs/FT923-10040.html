			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: Why it pays to cut back a mortgage - Serious Money THE AVERAGE Briton is saving, not spending, and reducing his debts, according to the statistics. This shows a lot of sense. With interest rates at 10 per cent and inflation under 4 per cent, real returns are over 6 per cent, very high by historical standards. Unemployment is rising and people are afraid of losing their jobs; all this makes it a good time to save and a bad time to borrow. Many people, of course, are struggling to meet their present interest payments. But those fortunate enough to have savings should, apart from paying off such obviously high-cost debts as credit cards and overdrafts, not neglect mortgage repayment as a way to improve their finances. There is generally little point, tax distortions apart, from having borrowings and savings simultaneously. Obviously, you should have some 'rainy day' savings to meet unforeseen bills and spending on holidays or a new car. But it is highly unlikely you ever will get as much interest on your savings as you will pay out on your borrowings. This is especially true now as building societies seek to widen the margins between savers and borrowers. What is more, the income from your savings normally will be taxable whereas the interest payments on your loan (except the first Pounds 30,000 of a mortgage) will not be tax-deductible. The result is a hefty net loss to you. Take someone with a Pounds 35,000 mortgage who is paying a rate of 11 per cent. He is a top-rate taxpayer who also has Pounds 10,000 in the building society earning 10 per cent gross - a net rate of 6 per cent. If he took Pounds 5,000 out of the building society to pay down the mortgage, the resulting loss of interest income would be Pounds 300 a year. But the mortgage interest saving would be Pounds 550 a year, a net annual gain of Pounds 250. For a basic-rate taxpayer, the annual gain, on the same assumptions, would be Pounds 175. Now, some might claim they can do better with their savings than simply leaving them in the building society. But they would have to achieve a gross return of 14.67 per cent (if a basic-rate taxpayer) or 18.33 per cent (if top-rate) to make it cost-effective not to repay their mortgages at 11 per cent. How many investors can be confident of doing so well? Besides which, the beauty of paying down your mortgage is that it can be a virtuous circle. The monthly reduction in the interest bill gives the investor greater scope for saving - which can lead to further mortgage repayments. There is one important caveat. The lender might impose penalties or waiting periods on partial redemptions - and will almost certainly do so if you have a fixed-rate mortgage. The penalties might outweigh the benefits of repayment, so check with your lender and do your sums before you send off the cheque. The calculations become more difficult once you deal with repayments of mortgages under Pounds 30,000. In the past, it has often been stated blithely that such a loan is cheap borrowing and represents a 'good thing' for everyone. But the abolition of higher-rate tax relief has weakened this argument. The effective cost of an 11 per cent mortgage to a taxpayer is 8.25 per cent. You certainly should be able to beat that return in a Tessa (although your investment will be limited to Pounds 3,000 a person in the first year and Pounds 1,800 thereafter). The zero preference shares of investment trusts also should offer a better return (although it will all come in the form of capital gain). An equity investor might hope to beat an after-tax return of 8.25 per cent a year although he could not be certain. But it is hard to think of an investment that will bring an immediate benefit equivalent to an 8.25 per cent tax-free monthly income, which is the effect of paying down the mortgage. Nor is the money used to repay a mortgage lost for ever. The investor can always 'gear up again' by increasing his mortgage loan next time he moves house, or even by re-mortgaging. Repayment also increases your equity in your home - and, thus, your security - in the event of further falls in house prices. Mortgage repayment also could bring extra savings flexibility. If a borrower has used an endowment policy or some other savings vehicle, as security for the loan, it is now free to perform some other task such as school fee funding or retirement planning. Alternatively, the policies can simply be left as potential security for the home-owner's next move up the housing ladder. You certainly should not abandon an endowment policy in mid-term - that would be a surefire way of losing money. The days when it was smart to take out as big a mortgage as possible, and wait for inflation to erode the cost, are over - at least until the next housing boom in the 21st century. Indeed, it could be very difficult to 'get rich quick' over the next few years, whatever your chosen method of investment. Paying off part of your mortgage will not make you rich, but it could prove to be astute money management - and a simple way to improve your standard of living.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / DTI warned on digital TV use Time Warner, the US media group, yesterday warned the British government that no other country in the world was considering the early introduction of digital television on terrestrial transmitters. The warning came from Mr Tom McGrath, president of Time Warner International Broadcasting, after a meeting on the issue at the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI is finalising its decision on digital television and whether the launch of a conventional analogue Channel 5 would limit the introduction of digital services. Time Warner is a member of a consortium interested in the Channel 5 franchise. The other members are Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and MAI, the broadcasting and financial services group which controls Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company. At least one other group, led by NBC, the US network company, wants to have the chance to bid for a Channel 5 licence. The Independent Television Commission has made clear it would like to decide next month to go ahead and advertise a fifth national channel, but needs to be sure that the DTI will make the necessary frequencies available. Time Warner believes digital services in the foreseeable future will develop on cable and satellite rather than on land-based transmitters because of the difficulty of having to rebroad-cast existing channels on digital. The company cites the example of Germany where new local analogue television licences are now being awarded.</p>

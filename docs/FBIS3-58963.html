The heads of the respective air forces which signed the  accord at the Toreejon air force base near here confirmed their  support for talks currently under way with the manufacturers to  reduce the price of each aircraft.    The Eurofighter project, a lighter version of the original  European Combat Aircraft, was launched in December 1992 in the  wake of defence budget cuts and changing requirements after the  end of the Cold War.    The aircraft is being funded 37.5 percent by Britain, 3O  percent by Germany, 19.5 percent by Italy and 13 percent by  Spain.</p>

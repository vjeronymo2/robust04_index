			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: SA 'relaxed' on credit rating - Madrid Conferences Digest Mr Chris Liebenberg, South Africa's finance minister, told international bankers yesterday he was 'relaxed' about the forthcoming rating of the republic's creditworthiness by the US investor service agencies Moody's and Standard and Poors and by Nippon of Japan. 'On fundamentals we should be an A but I understand there should be uncertainties until we have proven that we can deliver our policies,' he said. 'If we come out with a BB I'll be relaxed. Any rating is better than having none at all as we had before,' said Mr Liebenberg, who succeeded Mr Derek Keys as finance minister two weeks ago.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (CNS) -- Minister of the State  Planning Commission of China and also head of the group of the  national price inspection, Mr. Chen Jinhua, made a speech at a  national meeting on the price inspection opened today, saying  that the drastic price rise in China had slowed down with the  implementation of various kinds of macro-control and price  control measures as well as launching of the price inspection in  the whole country. [sentence as received]    Mr. Chen said that, through efforts in the past few months,  authorities at various levels in China had increased their  consciousness to control and administer prices under the  condition of market-based economy, and both production and trade  enterprises had now realized that they should accept price  control conducted by the state and should not do whatever they  wanted. The price situation had begun to change.    Mr. Chen said that achievement made in the course of price  inspection was great, however, it should not be overestimated.    He analyzed that the reform and opening to the outside world  had kept its momentum since this year. Various kinds of reform  measures in fiscal and tax, financial, foreign trade and foreign  currency as well as investment system had been functioning  smoothly after they were put into practice, some functioned even  better than expected. The national economy was gradually moving  in the direction demanded by macro-control. However, there  still existed some unfavorable factors in agricultural  production at present, and inflation still maintained a high  level. Therefore, to stabilize prices and to curb inflation  remained a key task of macro-control.    Mr. Chen called for strengthening control in price rise of  daily necessities and basic services which would seriously  affect people's life and had aroused strong reaction from the  society. They included grain, cotton, chemical fertilizer,  rural electric power supply, steel products and process oil.</p>

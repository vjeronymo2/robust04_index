			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli says his government's  main priority is to try to carry out an economic restructuring  which provides either for winding up or updating the loss making  enterprises. He believes this can help slow down production  slump, stimulate the manufacture of competitive products and set  conditions for the development of more promising sectors to  update the country's economic potential.    In an interview with INTERFAX, Sangheli said that the state  sector would continue to be the backbone of the economy though  after being reformed. The government sees restructuring as one  of the important directions for enhancing the manageability of  the state sector.    Sangheli said that "management machines" would be set up in  sectors depending on their specifics: from direct government  support to sectors such as power generation and transport down  to corporations, holdings, stock companies with the  participation of state capital. He said that as a form, stock  holding companies were more preferable than others. On the  other hand, this can help privatize state property by the use of  bonds (Russian-style privatization vouchers--IF). On the other,  it will help plants achieve greater economic self-reliance, give  them an opportunity to merge with their counterparts, promote  stable contacts with related industries and lure foreign  investment if need be.    Starting from this month, said the prime minister, large  profit-making businesses will be put for sale for privatization  vouchers on a regular basis. Together with the reorganization  of state and leasing businesses into stock companies, the  government plans, starting from July, to launch a massive  campaign for selling state-run businesses as integrated property  complexes and to finalize privatization of retail trade,  catering and services later this year.    Sangheli said that a group of large state enterprises would  be transformed into closed-end stock companies with a government  stake running at more than 80 percent. The operation of such  businesses also involving private investment is to be regulated  both by existing and new laws. Government regulation is needed  to help retain their production capacity and carry out measures  for the conversion or updating of production.    Sangheli said that under a parliamentary resolution, part of  the state-owned businesses in a number of sectors were not  subject to privatization. These, he said, will be transformed  into stock companies, wholly government-owned or with foreign  participation, but with the government holding to the  controlling package. The government is also to remain in  control of businesses relating to its natural monopoly.    The government is planning to bring a new law on state  enterprises and work out a package of measures to enforce it.    Sangheli also spoke of government plans to launch a campaign  this year to reorganize debtor plants. Expertise is also to be  held in the next two years of key sectors of the economy to test  out their possible advancement from the point of view of new  technologies and socioeconomic policies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] reported today  it has started a preliminary investigation into the possibility  that some of those who have died in Chiapas were executed and  received a coup de grace. Referring to the investigation, the  PGR said autopsies and ballistic tests were performed yesterday  with 30 corpses found in Ocosingo, Chiapas.    The PGR reported 26 of these corpses showed no signs of  having received a coup de grace shot. The studies and experts'  reports on the four other corpses, which showed a shot in the  skull, revealed they had died on different days and at different  hours and showed that the shots were fired from a short  distance. It also reports that two corpses sustained shots with  calibers that are smaller than those reserved for or used by the  Armed Forces. A third corpse sustained injuries caused by a  very powerful weapon, and a fourth corpse sustained shots fired  by a shotgun, given the metal shrapnel wounds it had, the PGR  said.    The PGR also said that in three of the cases the reports  rule  out the possibility the shots were fired by a member of the  Mexican Army, because it does not use the type of weapon used to  inflict them. Referring to the shot fired by a very powerful  weapon, no one has been able to ascertain from which side it  came, because the armed and violent group has been using that  type of weaponry, the PGR said.</p>

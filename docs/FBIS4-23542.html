			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 8 SAPA -- The truth commission  proposed by Justice Minister Dullah Omar was an "ambush" for  opponents of the African National Congress, the Conservative  Party [CP] said on Wednesday. The CP called for a "general  amnesty" for all people who committed crimes with a political  motive. The cut-off date for such an amnesty should be the date  it is announced.    On Tuesday, Mr Omar announced that the government intended  keeping the December 6, 1993 cut-off date for applications for  amnesty from prosecution for offences committed with a political  motive.    The CP had asked that the cut-off date be extended to  include  offences committed by rightwingers who set off a series of bomb  blasts that killed 19 people shortly before the April elections.    The CP sharply criticised Mr Omar for saying opponents and  defenders of apartheid would be treated differently.    Constitutional affairs spokesmAn Fanie Jacobs said the  minister's statement differed to the interpretation of President  Nelson Mandela's. He said the CP would approach Mr Mandela again  if necessary.    The CP said thousands of African National Congress  supporters  had been given amnesty and release in terms of agreements  between the ANC and the National Party and that these had  occurred without a public statement of the offences for which  amnesty had been granted.    "Public hearings in the remaining cases would affect non-anc  members or supporters. This process implies an inherent unequal  handling of the remaining cases," the cp statement said.    The composition of the commission would also reflect the  minister's stance on the amnesty issue. The CP said it opposed  the establishment of new structures to deal with an amnesty.    The December 6 cut-off date had been unilaterally decided  upon by the government parties.    "In the time between December 6, 1993 and the completion of  the elections there were many cases of violence such as the mass  murder at Shell House, countrywide killings of policemen and car  bombs at Johannesburg, Germiston and Jan Smuts aIrport.    "The election is now over and political violence has  declined  dramatically. It would be unrealistic in the determination of  the cut-off date for the amnesty to ignore these facts," the CP  said.    The party also criticised the appointment of Advocate Arthur  Chaskalson as chairman of the Constitutional Court, saying he  was an ANC supporter.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong pressures inside ERM THE FRENCH franc yesterday came under strong pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism for the first time since January, in spite of a cut in the Bundesbank's officially posted interest rates, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank's decision to ease its discount rate by 50 basis points to 7.50 per cent had been well anticipated by foreign exchange dealers. However, the decision to keep the Lombard rate unchanged at 9.00 per cent was a cause of disappointment. Some dealers suggested that the Bundesbank's decision not to lower the Lombard rate, which acts as an effective ceiling for German interest rates, was a sign that German monetary policy was still being eased very slowly. The French franc fell as low as FFr3.4120 per D-Mark for the first time since January 6 this year, closing at FFr3.4100. Its ERM floor against the D-Mark is FFr3.4305. A more worrying sign for the French authorities was that the franc slumped in the ERM grid to -72 percentage points against its central Ecu rate, from  54 percentage points on Thursday night. Once a currency drops to -75 percentage points, it is generally accepted that its central bank needs to respond by tightening monetary policy or open intervention. The dollar lost more than a pfennig against the German currency, dropping as low as DM1.6520 and closing at DM1.6540. Dealers were more encouraged to sell the US currency on the Bundesbank move, because high German rates still provide a much better rate of return than US ones. In New York the dollar fell to a close of DM1.6415. The only currency to perform strongly against the D-Mark was sterling, boosted by a surprising drop in the number of people out of work in the UK in February. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 22,000 last month, when the market had been expecting a rise of 35,000. The pound jumped more than 2 pfennigs immediately after the news broke, bought by a broad range of foreign exchange operators. The UK currency ended in London at DM2.4400, up 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day and 5 1/4 pfennigs on the week so far. Tensions inside the ERM will dominate over the next few days. 'All the signs are in place for another big speculative attack inside the ERM in the next week or so,' said Miss Joanne Perez, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. But she continued to believe that the French franc would survive the pressures from the market. However, the omens for the franc are uncertain. One dealer suggested that the Bank of France had not intervened to support the currency because of a need to build up foreign exchange reserves. By contrast, the Bank of Spain intervened in support of the peseta at Pta71.50 against the D-Mark, although the currency remains well above its ERM floor.</p>

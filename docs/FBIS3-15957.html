In Zhirinovskiy's view, by meeting opposition leaders and  former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy, "who did not represent  anybody," before sitting with the president, Nixon was  "discourteous to the head of state." Meeting Yeltsin was  expected to be the highlight of Nixon's visit.    Zhirinovskiy was not sure whether he would meet with Nixon.  He did not have an official word on this but knew that such a  meeting was on Nixon's schedule.    Zhirinovskiy made it clear that his country "never assumed a  posture" or refused contacts. He said that his party had been  invited to a reception in the U.S. Embassy Thursday night on the  occasion of Nixon's stay in Russia. Zhirinovskiy's deputy in  the LDPR and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Aleksandr  Vengerovskiy would attend the reception.</p>

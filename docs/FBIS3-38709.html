			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["g. batt" interview with Greens leader Gianni Mattioli in </F> Rome; date not given: "This Pact Mortifies Us"--first paragraph  is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- Children of the gentle planet, of the  laughing sun, of the party with the doors slammed. Feeling  mocked by [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary]  Occhetto, they have spoiled the party.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Mattioli, why this rupture?    [Mattioli] It goes back a long way. Twenty days ago it  became clear that this alliance would consist of well-behaved  forces, the archaeologists of communism, this rascal [Rete  Secretary] Orlando, and others. On Tuesday [1 February], before  the joint signature, [Greens coordinator] Ripa di Meana repeated  that our joining was conditional: freezing of the 12-trillion  lire for the high-speed train, freezing of the 16 trillion of  Anas, Montalto di Castro, Giota Tauro [power stations], freezing  of the arms industry involved in the bribery and corruption  scandals. Occhetto was reassuring: First sign, and then we  will clarify the program. No way. The program can wait , but  in the meantime they are pinning us against the wall on the  question of candidates.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Hence it is a problem of parliamentary  seats?    [Mattioli] We discovered yesterday that the number of safe  seats reserved for us is well below the number that we have in  parliament right now. While we are growing....    [LA REPUBBLICA] Safe in what sense? Is this first majority  vote not new territory for everybody?    [Mattioli] Studies and projections exist which allow us to  forecast. I ask myself how one can ask electors to vote for  people they do not know, for unknown party or cooperative  movement officials, and not, instead, for the proponents of a  civilized society.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In other words, your quarrel with the PDS is  that it is not giving you strong seats to guarantee the election  of environmentalists?    [Mattioli] The Democratic Alliance has lots of candidates.  For two months it has worked for an electoral coalition. It  has been screaming so loudly that in the end it gets everything.  Our main talking partner is the PDS, it is they who deal out  the cards. If it wants to win, it should renew itself in those  areas where it has electoral control: in Emilia and Tuscany.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Passing over its own candidates to allow  yours through?    [Mattioli] Let it choose. If it thinks that it can capture  voters with the old faces (while people are so hungry for  renewal that they even clutch hold of [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi, the man who celebrated the confirmation of Craxi's  parliamentary immunity), let it go ahead. If it wants to win,  it also needs us. I would recommend political generosity.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In such uncertain elections?    [Mattioli] I am not interested in what goes on in back  rooms,  I am fully aware that everyone is asking seats from the PDS. We  do not want the moon, it is not Occhetto's job to look after us.  It is we who are bringing votes in to  the alliance. As for the others (Democratic Alliance [AD],  Social Christians), I do not know.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You are against the AD's request for the  prime minister to be designated before the vote?    [Mattioli] There is a time for everything. Let us first of  all see who is backing the government. Let us win the  elections. Then let us designate a leader. [Prime Minister]  Ciampi again? Fine. Provided that, unlike his first  government, he includes our demands in his program.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And if you are ignored.    [Mattioli] We are not unscrupulous tightrope walkers like  [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. We will not move to the center,  nor will we stand in the elections on our own. We can quit  Parliament. In fact, it is by remaining outside that we won the  fight on the major nuclear issues.</p>

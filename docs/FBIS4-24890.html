			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chuan Hsun-che (0278 6061 5074): "Numbers of </F> Political Prisoners Cited in a Document"]    [Text] How many "political prisoners" are still in jail in  mainland China? This is always an enigma. International human  rights organizations and Amnesty International have made  painstaking efforts to discover the facts. The CPC authorities  have never made public the relevant figures.    Between 7 and 9 April, at the national work conference  attended by heads of the public security organs, the state  security organs, the armed police units, and the judicial  organs, the CPC authorities for the first time revealed the  numbers of people charged with the counterrevolutionary crimes  of subversion, sedition, and sabotage, or who were serving  prison terms after being found guilty of such crimes, or who had  been arrested and detained on suspicion of such crimes.  According to the reports submitted by the local public security  and judicial departments and the statistical materials (up to  the end of March 1994), 1,730 people were serving prison terms  after being found guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes.    At that time, 87 people had been arrested and were awaiting  trial on charges of counterrevolutionary crimes.    More than 160 people were being detained for investigations.    Prisoners of this type released on bail or receiving medical  treatment outside prison but still deprived of political rights  numbered 135.    The following are the numbers of prisoners jailed in some  localities:    Qinghai, more than 380.    Sichuan, 357.    Anhui, 82.    Guizhou, more than 100.    Liaoning, 66.    Xinjiang, 220.    Yunnan, more than 60.    Ningxia, 83.    Hunan, 37.    Hebei, 41.    Shaanxi, more than 60.    Beijing, 28.    Jiangxi, 46.    Tibet, more than 80.    The above figures are cited from the document (file number  940028) issued by the Ministry of Justice on 6 April.</p>

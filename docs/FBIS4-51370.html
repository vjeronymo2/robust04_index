			<p>BFN     [Text] Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Regional People's Government, and Ding Tingmo, deputy  secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional CPC  Committee, gave separate interviews in Nanning on 18 and 19 May  to a group of reporters from the capital. Cheng Kejie and Ding  Tingmo made extensive comments to the reporters about the  region's gratifying situation in reform, opening up, and  economic construction.    On the whole, they said, the situation of Guangxi is this:  The economy is developing, the political situation is stable,  the nationalities are united, and the society is progressing.  In the past few years, Guangxi's GNP has maintained a  relatively high growth rate. The township and town enterprises  have developed in a sustained and rapid manner, and their growth  rate has been in the forefront in China for three years running.  Agriculture has developed steadily, good harvests have been  reaped for several successive years, and there has been marked  progress in the construction of the infrastructure, such as  transportation, telecommunications, and power. The momentum of  development in a number of key construction projects is very  good, and the pace of opening to the outside world has also been  accelerated. The actual amount of foreign capital used has  increased by a big margin as compared with the past. In  addition, greater efforts have been made to help the poor.    Talking about why Guangxi has made gratifying achievements  in  reform, opening up, and economic construction, Cheng Kejie and  Ding Tingmo said it is mainly because of the policies for  Guangxi formulated by the central authorities. It is also the  result of the concerted efforts of various trades and  professions, party members and cadres at all levels, and people  of all nationalities in Guangxi who are using Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance for practice.    Cheng Kejie and Ding Tingmo hoped that the reporters would  visit various localities in Guangxi, tell the public more about  the region, and make valuable suggestions on the work there.    The group of reporters from the capital arrived in Nanning  on  18 May. The group consists of nine reporters from seven  newspapers and magazines, including RENMIN RIBAO, ZHONGHUA  YINGCAI HUABAO, LIAOWANG WEEKLY, CHINA DAILY, BEIJING REVIEW,  and NONMING RIBAO. They will go to Nanning, Beihai, Fangcheng  Port, Yulin, Hechi, Liuzhou, and Guilin to report on what they  see, and spend half a month on the road.</p>

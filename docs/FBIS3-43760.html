			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The international press revealed yesterday that the  Luanda government is planning a major offensive against the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA],  using modern deadly sophisticated war materiel received from  Brazil, Argentina, and the DPRK. Now, there are reports of a  new massive invasion of Angola by powerfully equipped Cuban  soldiers who are already in Luanda, under the cover of civil  servants and businessmen. Eduardo dos Santos counts on these  soldiers to carry out its military adventures against  UNITA-controlled areas in northern, northeastern, and central  Angola.    This is a clear violation of the New York Accords of  December  1988, under which all Cuban soldiers should leave Angola by May  1991, within the framework of the independence of Namibia.    What is more, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived  in Luanda yesterday [as heard]. According to the Futungo de  Belas Palace, he is in Luanda to strengthen historical relations  of friendship and solidarity between Cuba and Angola and discuss  the possibility of strengthening relations in various fields,  including exchanging information.    The Havana government invaded Angola in 1975 and imposed on  the Angolan people the Communist and dictatorial government of  the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party.  Accordingly, the visit to Angola by Roberto Robaina is simply  aimed at inspecting the return of Cuban soldiers to Angola to  bring more deaths to the martyred Angolan people.</p>

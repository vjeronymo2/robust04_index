			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Big loss at German engineer Mannesmann, the German engineering group whose products range from pipes to mobile telephones, made a net loss of DM513m (Pounds 205m) last year, a sharp swing from a net profit of DM63m in the previous year. The group, which in February warned that it would make a heavy loss for 1993, blamed the reverse on one-off restructuring costs coupled with the impact of further losses in its mobile-phone operations. In a statement, Mannesmann said it would be cutting its 1993 dividend to DM5 per share - down from DM6 in the previous year. At the same time, the group confirmed that Mr Werner Dieter, architect of the group's expansion away from traditional pipe manufacturing activities into car component production and mobile phones, would be stepping down as chairman of the group's management board following this July's shareholders meeting. Mr Dieter's successor is to be Mr Joachim Funk, 59, currently finance director and deputy chairman of the Mannesmann management board. The results for the group included a one-off charge of DM515m to cover restructuring costs. The rationalisation measures undertaken last year would lead to a lasting improvement in earnings, Mannesmann said. Another factor behind the group's poor performance was a DM224m loss on its D-2 mobile-phone operations, down from a loss of DM340m in the previous year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "National </F> Minorities and the Parties"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  Hungarian Democratic Forum -- Place on the National List </H5>   A separate chapter in the election program of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] deals with the situation of the national  minorities living in Hungary and the possible solutions to their  problems. The National Committee accepted the party's Gypsy  policy guidelines in 1992 and this has now been built into the  current program. They stress the need to address the Gypsy  population because, in their view, this community, the largest  among the national minorities, is in the most difficult  situation in the currently changing world. MDF spokesman Karoly  Herenyi said that their program contains short and long term  crisis management. In the short term, they want to solve the  problem of Gypsy unemployment. The MDF considers it important  to have the traditional Gypsy handicrafts restored. In their  view, in the long term, the problems of the Gypsy population  will be solved through organizing their education. Hungary's  first Gypsy middle school established by the Ghandi foundation  is a good example of this.    He called it unfortunate that the leaders of the national  minorities enter the elections on party lists because, when they  get into Parliament, they will have to fulfill the expectations  of the party, then the parliamentary group, and they will only  be able to represent their own national minority in third place.  Two Gypsies are on the MDF's national list: Jozsef Raduly, the  leader of a 100- member Gypsy orchestra, is in 48th place, and  he is followed in 49th place by Florian Farkas, leader of the  Lungo Drom Gypsy organization.  <H5>  Alliance of Free Democrats -- Not According to the Principle </H5> of Reciprocity    The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] emphasizes that the  national minority issue cannot be made part of the election  campaign, parliamentary deputy Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said. He  added that this applies both to the minorities living in and  outside Hungary.    Szent-Ivanyi believes that the rights of domestic minorities  have to be guaranteed with agreements based on a broad  consensus, and their parliamentary representation, which has not  yet been resolved, also has to be ensured. In the SZDSZ's view,  a mouthpiece organization for the national minorities would be  set up by the domestic minorities forming a society that would  delegate an ombudsman to Parliament every year from a different  group, thus creating a rotation system.    A separate chapter deals with the issue of the national  minorities in the SZDSZ's election program: Their main  principle is that the situation of the domestic minorities  cannot be made dependent on the situation of Hungarians living  beyond the borders. The principle of reciprocity does not apply  in this case. The state is obliged to ensure the rights of  national minorities: The program recommends practical solutions  to preserving the identity, and to ensuring education and the  use of the native language. The party will prepare to amend the  national minority law at all points where it has not lived up to  expectations and they also intend to place the national minority  financing system on new bases.    The Free Democrats [SZDSZ] have not consciously made an  effort to have national minority representatives but it is no  accident that there are many among them -- for example Antonia  Haga, Boleszlav Pelcsinszki, Ferenc Wekler, and Tamas Freund --  because, owing to the SZDSZ's attitude, these people enjoy  working in this party.  <H5>  Hungarian Socialist Party -- Violation of the Constitution? </H5>   According to the Socialists [MSZP], the parliamentary  representation of the national minorities has to be resolved,  parliamentary deputy Csaba Tabajdi said. Unfortunately, the  Constitution has been violated in relation to the national  minorities in the past four years. If we become the government,  we will immediately start inter-party talks on solving this  issue. The current situation can be remedied either through  by-elections or when local elections are held. The national  minority law is a means, rather than a goal, for us: A change  should take place in the life of the national minorities, for  example, in education. An overall government program is needed  to achieve this. We have to set up the two 500 million forint  funds in the budget as prescribed by the law, and this has to be  provided for two years. The MSZP's program also includes legal  measures against negative discrimination, and its justification  lies in the fact that some statements have been made and acts  have been committed to offend ethnic groups and national  minority members in recent months. Action against discrimination  is not laid down adequately in the Hungarian legal system.    Replying to whether the MSZP has any deputies belonging to  national minorities, Tabajdi said that the Gypsy Tamas Peli and  the ethnic Slovak Mrs. Robert Jakab are on the party's list.    As for an ombudsman, Tabajdi said that it does not  substitute  for the parliamentary representation of national minorities,  which is their right as citizens, because an ombudsman for  national minorities can mainly remedy legal violations, while  the parliamentary deputies can initiate the prevention of legal  violations or can participate in the fight against  discrimination.   <H5>    The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] -- </H5> Strong Representation Needed in the Local Governments    The KDNP's program has a separate chapter on the national  minorities. According to Gyorgy Holvegyi, the KDNP's national  minority expert, it is most important to strengthen the national  minorities' sense of self-identity because this is the only way  that they will be able to have representation in proportion to  their size. Regardless of their size, the national minorities  are due extra rights. The Christian Democrats emphasize that  the national minority representations have to develop from the  local self- governments to the highest level because this is the  only way that their true level of organization and inner  strength can be seen. In their view, the now frequent  questioning of the legitimacy of the national minority  federations can be avoided in this way. With the KDNP's deputy  candidates, one's ethnic origin is not indicated but, for  example, a number of ethnic German deputies are running in  Baranya county in southern Transdanubia, who have established  rather good relations with the organizations of Germany's  Christian Democratic Union and the Austrian People's Party.  They are expecting several visits from these sister parties  during the campaign; however, on the basis of the electoral law,  foreigners are always reminded that direct campaigning is not  allowed.</p>

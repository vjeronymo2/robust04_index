			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: National Semi tries to pull out of a death spiral - The US semiconductor company is taking steps to end its decline and make a come-back National Semiconductor is fighting its way out of a death spiral, according to Mr Gil Amelio, president and chief executive. Under the buccaneering leadership of Mr Amelio's predecessor, Mr Charles Sporck, National Semi was the epitome of the rough, tough US semiconductor company. Its strategy was simple: to drive down costs and prices and push up market share. But since the mid-1980s, it has been in decline. It had expanded ambitiously in areas of semiconductor production which became suddenly unfashionable. It has been eclipsed in memory chips by the Japanese and in microprocessors by its compatriots Intel and Motorola. Last year, National Semi lost Dollars 117m before tax from continuing operations on sales of just over Dollars 1.7bn, its fourth year in the red at both the operating and pre-tax level. Under Mr Amelio, who took over in early 1991, staff numbers have been trimmed, old and unprofitable plants closed and investment redirected towards fast-growing areas of the market, especially networking products and communications. But Mr Amelio has no illusions about the size of the task remaining. He says: 'Because for so many years we were frankly defocused, frankly unprofitable, it will take time to change perceptions. Over a period of time, I think we will build a new kind of reputation, but I am not so naive as to think I can do it in 18 months.' Wall Street is taking a sympathetic if scarcely euphoric view of his efforts. The slide in the company's share price, which saw it fall from a high of over Dollars 20 in 1987 to a low of less than Dollars 4 in mid-1990, seems to have halted. It is now hovering around the Dollars 12 mark. Mr Amelio, 49, is a semiconductor industry veteran who began his career in Bell Laboratories and has since served as general manager of Fairchild Camera's microprocessor division and president of Rockwell Communications Systems. His manufacturing background proved valuable in diagnosing National Semiconductor's sickness - too many plants making the wrong kind of semiconductors. He explains that in the 1970s, the company's heyday, semiconductors were building blocks, sold in billions to be incorporated into bigger systems. Manufacturers could sell all they could make: In the 1980s, however, the market changed irrevocably. According to Mr Amelio, National failed to appreciate the transformation. Chips became so complex they resembled complete sub-systems rather than components. The new trick was to build a relationship with the customer so that the use to which the semiconductor was to be put was fully appreciated and the customer's requirements understood. National did none of those things, and its market share began to slip. 'Unchecked,' Mr Amelio observes of the spiral, 'you crash and burn.' His plan to avoid that involves three measures: First, he is restructuring the manufacturing base. Three factories have already been sold or closed, and only seven will remain of the 11 currently operating. Those seven, Mr Amelio estimates, will have enough capacity to support a Dollars 5bn turnover company. Second, it is abandoning its role as a broad-based supplier in favour of concentration on three areas: communication products, analogue devices and microprocessors for personal computer peripherals. Third, control of the company is being split along product and market lines; separate groups have been established for commodity products and higher value sub-systems. The restructuring charge for plant and people in 1991 was Dollars 150m. The headcount by the end of the year will be under 24,000, a fall of more than 8,000 in two years. Productivity is rising accordingly. Taking productivity as sales divided by total labour costs, Mr Amelio reckons the best semiconductor houses such as Intel achieve over 3.0. National is presently at 2.7, the aim being to reach 3.0 some time next year. Spending on research and development is down, however, to Dollars 192m last year, about 11 per cent of sales, from Dollars 225m four years ago. Mr Amelio claims this is the right amount, pointing out he has shifted research and development priorities drastically. Investment in networking has risen from 9 per cent of the total to 17 per cent. In analogue devices it has gone from 19 per cent to 26 per cent. R&amp;D on commodity products, by contrast, has been cut from 21 per cent to just 5 per cent. The question remains if National can make an effective come-back without spending the large sums in plant and research its larger competitors are committing. Intel, for example, is spending at a rate of almost Dollars 1bn a year on plant and equipment. National's capital spending last year came to Dollars 189m. Mr Amelio's optimism is unquenchable, however. 'The explosive growth in the 1980s was in personal computers. In the 1990s it will be in communications. We are going to do our damndest to be at the head of that parade.'</p>

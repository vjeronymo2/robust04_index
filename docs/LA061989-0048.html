			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS MAKE RUN FOR IT, WIN, 5-3;  </P> <P> GIBSON, GONZALEZ GET THE MOST OUT OF SLOPPY PLAY BY BRAVES  </P> <P> In the fifth inning with the Dodgers leading the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, Sunday,  it appeared to be merely another high pitch from Zane Smith to Kirk Gibson.  Merely another ball four on a day in which Smith would walk four.  </P> <P> But as anyone in the National League will attest, Gibson doesn't walk anywhere.  </P> <P> The ball escaped catcher Jody Davis and Gibson's walk turned into a sprint. He  rounded first, rounded second, and finally stopped at third after teammate Jose  Gonzalez had scored from first.  </P> <P> The man who routinely turns singles into doubles had outdone himself by turning  a walk into a "triple," firing up the Dodgers and sending them to a 5-3 victory  before 43,050 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> On a day when Fernando Valenzuela won his third consecutive game for the first  time since April of 1987, on a day when Jay Howell took another step toward the  All-Star game with his 14th save in 16 opportunities, it was Gibson who stole  the show.  </P> <P> "I would pay to see Kirk Gibson play ball," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said.  "And that's the highest compliment one could pay him."  </P> <P> Said Gonzalez: "You know when Gibson is up there, you have to be hustling,  because he's going to be hustling."  </P> <P> Gibson, who jubilantly punched the thick afternoon air with his right hand  several times after reaching third base, later smiled.  </P> <P> "That's the type of play that really excites me," he said. "I love running the  bases like that."  </P> <P> After Atlanta's Andres Thomas gave the Braves a 1-0 lead with his ninth home  run of the season in the first inning, the Dodgers came back with a run on two  triples (Alfredo Griffin, Mariano Duncan) and a fly ball (Gonzalez) in the  third. Speaking of aggressive baserunning, when was the last time you saw two  triples in one inning?  </P> <P> All of this, however, only served to set up the fifth, during which Gibson's  race began after Gonzalez hit a one-out single to center.  </P> <P> Up stepped Gibson, who a minute later watched as Smith's ball four pitch zoomed  inside and nearly hit him, bouncing off Davis' glove and rolling to the  backstop.  </P> <P> "I know Gonzalez is running, I know he's going to third, so I figure, I've got  to at least go for second, get a throw down there, see what happens," Gibson  said.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, you've got to force the issue."  </P> <P> What he forced was Davis' hurried throw to second, a throw made with little  regard for Gonzalez speeding around third. Second baseman Jeff Blauser  intercepted the ball in front of second base while Smith hurried to cover the  plate. He arrived at the plate too late, with Gonzalez having already scored.  </P> <P> Smith then mishandled Blauser's low throw. Gibson ended up on third.  </P> <P> "You know, I've scored from second on a wild pitch before," Gibson said. "When  you're running the bases, you've just got to give yourself all options. You've  got to run hard to first, because if you don't, there's no way you have a  chance of ever taking second. And you have to run hard to third because you  just don't know what will happen once you get there."  </P> <P> Gibson later scored on a fly ball by Jeff Hamilton, and then showed he can  still do the ordinary by turning a single into a double in the seventh.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, John Shelby caught on, turning one base into two in the sixth,  doubling and then eventually scoring the Dodgers' final run on a botched  suicide squeeze on which the Braves pitched out but muffed the rundown. Third  baseman Ron Gant dropped the ball when he was supposed to catch it and tag  Shelby off third.  </P> <P> All of which might explain why the young and erratic Braves lead the league in  errors (69) after committing two more. Pitcher Smith, meanwhile, leads the  major leagues in losses at 1-11.  </P> <P> "We didn't catch the ball today," said Brave Manager Russ Nixon. "We catch the  ball, we win."  </P> <P> Or perhaps if they catch a little wind, they win. After Howell relieved  Valenzuela in the eighth, he found himself holding his breath in the ninth  after pinch hitter Jeff Treadway singled and pinch-hitter Darrell Evans lofted  a long fly ball down the right-field line that hooked foul. Evans then struck  out, and Dion James flied out to end the game.  </P> <P> Valenzuela gave up three runs in 7 1/3 innings for his third victory after  beginning the season with five straight losses. The Dodgers finished the home  stand 6-4.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, West-leading San Francisco took a bold step by trading for  Philadelphia reliever Steve Bedrosian. Said Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive  vice president: "I'm not going, 'Oh my gosh, a trade was made today,' " Claire  said on a day during which two good center fielder/leadoff hitters, the kind  the Dodgers might covet, were also traded around the league -- Philadelphia's  Juan Samuel to the New York Mets for Lenny Dykstra.  </P> <P> "We're alive, we're breathing and we have hope," Claire said. "We had reached a  point where we could have folded, but we didn't. If we aren't getting the kind  of offense we need, we must manufacture runs . . . and that's what we did well  (Sunday)."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said Mickey Hatcher would return  from the disabled list tonight, his strained left hamstring having recovered.  Infielder Tracy Woodson, who will have his right quadriceps muscle examined by  team doctors today, will likely go on the disabled list. Woodson has only  played four times, going hitless in six at-bats, since being recalled from  triple-A Albuquerque June 6.  </P> <P> Willie Randolph was scratched from Sunday's lineup because of a sore left  shoulder apparently hurt while he was sliding on a first-inning steal attempt  Saturday. He was replaced by Mariano Duncan, who moved Kirk Gibson out of the  leadoff spot for the first time in a week and wound up going two for two with a  double. If there is one player the Dodgers can't afford to lose, it's Randolph.  He has 20 hits in his last 49 at-bats for a .408 average, lifting his overall  average to a team-leading .295. Randolph has hit that well only once in his  13-year big league career, .305 for the New York Yankees in 1987.  </P> <P> Judging by the crowd reaction, the highlight of a pregame romp by Dodger  old-timers Sunday was the appearance of Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda (1954-55).  He sharply grounded the first pitch from Dick Calmus (1963) through the legs of  third baseman John Kennedy (1965-66) for what was ruled a base hit and then  took the mound to get the game's only strikeout against the only batter he  faced, Bill Grabarkewitz (1969-72). In case anybody was counting, a team of  former Dodgers from the 1955, 1959 and 1981 world championship teams defeated  the players from the 1963 and 1965 title teams, 6-2, led by a double and three  RBIs from Reggie Smith (1976-81).  </P></p>

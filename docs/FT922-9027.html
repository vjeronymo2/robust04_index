			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Pound and shares up on recovery hopes SHARE prices and sterling continued to rise yesterday, as investors registered optimism about economic recovery in the UK. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares finished at 2,725.7, up 23.8, to reach a record close for the third day running. The pound edged up half a pfennig to DM2.945, its highest close in London against the D-Mark for nine months. In New York it finished at DM2.9404. Sentiment about an upturn was helped by this week's half-percentage point cut in UK base rates to 10 per cent, together with a sharp rise in new car sales. Both shares and the pound have benefited from buying pressure from international investors, especially from Japan and Germany, who appear to be taking a sanguine view of UK growth prospects. The 66-point advance in the FT-SE 100 index during the week has been especially helped by sterling's continued rise within the 10-currency European exchange rate mech-anism. Starting the week above only the Danish krone, sterling has leapfrogged the lira, the French franc and the punt in the past few days. It is now only slightly weaker than the D-Mark, the central currency in the system. Mr Richard Kersley, an equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London investment bank, said the mood of optimism had been fired by the perception that sterling's strength could give the Treasury room to cut UK borrowing rates still further in the next few months. But he warned against over-optimism. 'People may have become more confident, but so far we have seen very little hard evidence about the pace of any recovery.'

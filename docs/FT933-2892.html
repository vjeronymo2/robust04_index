			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bernard Matthews shares up 6p after recovery to Pounds 4.64m SHARES in Bernard Matthews climbed 6p to 79p as the poultry processor announced pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to July 18 more than doubled from last time's depressed Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 4.64m. Turnover increased from Pounds 65.7m to Pounds 88.9m. Mr David Joll, managing director, said Matthews was in 'a recovery situation', but had gained its profits rise 'under difficult conditions'. The profits advance in continuing operations to Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 2.15m) on turnover of Pounds 79.3m (Pounds 65.7m) came mostly from branded added value products, he said, adding that this now included a new range of cooked meats. This latter had grown from nothing a year ago to a Pounds 20m brand now. Also, the low-priced imports from Europe and the US which had adversely affected 1992 had partly been pushed out by the devaluation of sterling as well as by low-priced UK turkeys, Mr Joll said. He emphasised that last year whole birds accounted for only 17 per cent of sales and had been a loss-making part of the business. Very competitively priced UK turkeys had driven up consumption at Easter from about 2m normally to about 3.5m, partly because lamb had been expensive. Acquisitions - essentially Sarvari Baromfiipari, the Hungarian producer of turkey, chicken, goose and duck meat acquired for Pounds 2.7m in March - contributed Pounds 9.6m to turnover and Pounds 464,000 to profits. Mr Joll expected the profits to rise once Matthews had brought its technology to bear and introduced its product range. Sarvari serves the Hungarian, Austrian and Swiss markets. Progress in France, where Matthews will spend more than Pounds 4m in TV advertising this year, has been slower. The company said it still has substantial in-roads to make in the French market. Rather than simply agreeing with the headquarters of the various French food store chains to stock Matthews' products, Mr Joll said the company often had to convince regional managers, and in some cases, individual store managers. The dividend is lifted by a 'cautious' 10 per cent to 1.1p, payable from increased earnings of 2.5p (1.13p) per share.</p>

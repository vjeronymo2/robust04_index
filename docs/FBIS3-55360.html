The message says:    "The faction of deputies of the Saeima or parliament, `For  Fatherland and Freedom', considers it necessary to call your  attention to the fact that issues of ethnic minorities and terms  of granting citizenship are quite different, completely separate  things. It is recognised that `an ethnic minority' is a term  generally applied to those citizens of a country who do not  belong to the indigenous population of the country. The number  of such people in Latvia equals to 365,043 which amounts to more  than 20 percent of the total of citizens. They are granted all  citizen rights, moreover, the minority groups are also given  large opportunities to develop their cultural autonomy. Thus  there is no particular problems with ethnic minorities in  Latvia."    "Meanwhile Latvia does face problems concerned with foreign  nationals which have come to this country during the years of  occupation, and their descendants. In violation of  internationally recognised laws the invader country, the former  Soviet Union, has brought a vast number of its civilians into  the occupied country. Russia, which nominally has taken over the  commitments of the former Soviet Union, is seeking to put an  international pressure on Latvia in a bid to make it legalize  consequences of occupation and colonization, instead of  providing means for repatriation of the people transferred here  under the occupation. Regrettably, those groundless claims have  been met with understanding and encouragement also in some  influential international bodies, as it is shown by your  recommendations to Latvia, which would help to maintain  political influence of Moscow here, endorsing it to pursue  criminal policy of Stalin and Hitler. The faction 'For  Fatherland and Freedom' calls on you to not only to counsel  Latvia, but also to exercise your authority to ensure the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to voice as  strong a support to repatriation of the persons transferred to  Latvia under the occupation, as it is voting to the demand for  Russian troops pull-out, as well as to provide a wide political  and financial aid to the process."    One of the reasons for writing the letter was the fact that  the high commissioner who is visiting Latvia, has scheduled  meetings with representatives of various factions of the Latvian  parliament, but he, incidentally, failed to slate talks with the  faction "Fatherland and Freedom."</p>

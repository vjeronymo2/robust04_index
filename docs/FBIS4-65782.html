			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's  recent visit to the United States and meeting with President  Bill Clinton were the subject of commentary in the Greek press.  <H5>  Tilt to U.S. Viewed </H5>   K.I. Angelopoulos comments in the 30 April-1 May Athens  daily  I KATHIMERINI on Prime Minister Papandreou's perceived foreign  policy tilt toward the United States to the detriment of the  European Union (EU). While Papandreou's entourage was aware he  believed that developments in the Balkans brought Athens closer  to Washington than to Brussels, the prime minister's recent  visit to the United States confirmed his "spectacular" switch,  Angelopoulos writes. Papandreou did not hide his satisfaction  over the White House "understanding" of the Greek problems. He  did not hesitate to express to Greek-American audiences his  "bitterness and disappointment" at the lack of "solidarity" on  the part of the EU. Following his meeting with President  Clinton, Papandreou "exempted" the United States from any  responsibility for the Yugoslav tragedy, blaming the EU instead.  Angelopoulos comments that these developments are occurring  during Greece's term as EU president and wonders whether the  Skopje issue will prove "fateful" for Greek-EU relations. It is  well-known that the views of a majority of EU partners on Balkan  issues do not coincide with those of Athens, Angelopoulos  continues. The country's EU partners showed from the start that  they did not wish Greece to be the EU "representative" in the  Balkans, with Germany, France, Great Britain, "and even Italy"  signaling that a "new Balkan order would be their own preserve."  Angelopoulos observes that there are risks involved in  Papandreou's tilt toward the United States, given that the Greek  economy depends to a great extent on EU funds.  <H5>  Trip Results "Positive" </H5>   According to an editorial in the 25 April Athens daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Papandreou's meeting with President Clinton  produced "rather positive" results, tempered by problems related  to the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations. Among the  positive developments, the editorial continues, are President  Clinton's acknowledgment that Greece is "rightfully" concerned  about the Skopje issue; his statement that "we are concerned  about the Greek minority in Albania" and his acknowledgment that  "Greece is facing the problem with wisdom and discernment"; his  expression of interest in the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the  Turkish prime minister; and his acknowledgment of Greece's  important role in the Balkans. However, the Cyprus issue  remains unresolved, with President Clinton assigning  responsibility for a solution to his negotiator, and  Athens-Ankara relations are still a "puzzle" for the President,  with him only wishing for cooperation between the two countries  while making no mention of what Turkey should do to achieve it.  The visit, the editorial concludes, showed that while further  understanding and development of Greek-American relations are  possible, reservations should be maintained.  <H5>  Cartoons Lampoon Papandreou Policy Change </H5>   A cartoon in the 24 April Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA  shows a disgruntled Papandreou listening to a beaming President  Clinton stating that "Greece can play a leadership role in the  Balkans...behind Turkey, Albania, and Skopje." Another cartoon  in the 23 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA depicts Papandreou, accompanied  by his wife Dhimitra, insistently and plaintively knocking on  the White House door, calling "Biiill," after climbing a number  of steps, each labeled with slogans progressively more friendly  to the United States. The lowest is labeled "Americans,  murderers of people," the next "out forever from NATO," then  "out with the [U.S.] bases of death," followed by "the struggle  is coming into its own," "forward for better days," and  "Greek-American business."  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

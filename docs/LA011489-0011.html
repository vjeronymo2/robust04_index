			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BAD COMMITMENT  </P> <P> President-elect George Bush has promised a continued flow of American arms to  the guerrillas at war with the government of Angola, a most regrettable  commitment.  </P> <P> We have been told that he promised the guns to facilitate national  reconciliation talks and because he is convinced that the resumption of  clandestine arms shipments by the United States in 1986 was a key factor in  winning the Southern Africa peace agreement now in place. We think him mistaken  on both counts. Reconciliation in Angola can best be spurred by leaving the  conciliation to African states while cutting off the flow of arms that have  devastated the land, killing thousands and leaving a terrible legacy of maimed  civilians -- many of them the deliberate targets of guerrilla land mines. We  are convinced that the peace agreement that has emerged is the result of South  Africa's decision, after eight years of costly delay, to end its war against  Angola and to grant independence to Namibia. The flow of American arms served  essentially to prolong the violence and encourage South Africa to prolong its  illegal hold on Namibia.  </P> <P> We regret also the timing of Bush's initiative, coming just as the first Cuban  troops were being withdrawn from Angola in conformity with the peace agreement  that was negotiated by the United States. The principal function of the Cuban  troops has been to defend the Angolan government, and the American petroleum  installations in Angola, from attacks by South African troops and by the UNITA  rebels armed by South Africa and the United States.  </P> <P> There is an ominous suggestion in this Bush initiative that the new  Administration will pursue the failed policy of the old in terms of unleashing  military power, instead of diplomatic power and economic reform, to address  isolated crises in the developing world -- including Nicaragua. Peace prospects  have been improved in Southern Africa because South Africa has decided to tame  its bellicose policies against its neighbors, not because of the flow of U.S.  arms to UNITA rebels. Peace prospects have improved in Central America not  because American arms have raised the level of hostilities but because the  leaders of the nations in the region have begun to take responsibility for  ending the hostilities.  </P></p>

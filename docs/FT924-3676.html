			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / How Lamont betrayed the thrifty pensioner: Fifteen per cent loan rates were a glittering chance not least John Major and Norman Lamont - Wednesday, September 16, was indeed Black. And the adjective has stuck, adhesive in its unoriginality. But, for a large number of Britons, one moment on that day stood out as a briefly glittering prospect of happiness and prosperity. That moment was when Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, told the Bank of England to increase base rates to 15 per cent. And the people to whom this act held out such high hopes were those who lend more than they borrow. Alas, their hopes were dashed. Lamont was not being serious. It was just a stunt to impress currency dealers, and not a particularly cunning one, at that. Since then, interest rates have scuttled down to half the level Lamont pretended he was prepared to defend four months ago. To read the newspapers, you would assume that this is a matter of pure delight; that nothing could be better. But, for millions, it is a bitter blow. Those people should be the object of our sympathy. We are not talking here about professional bankers and affluent City types (there are some left). We are talking about pensioners who supplement their meagre state benefits with the income from a lifetime's hard-earned savings. That income has been cut savagely, and through no fault of their own. They were led to believe that the government would use whatever high rates were necessary to defend the value of the pound ' their pound ' and now they have seen their trust betrayed. These poor old people have suffered in other ways through this abrupt policy switch. Their state pension is linked to the retail price index. Into this index, the government ' admittedly, with some lack of logic ' had included the cost of mortgages. As those rates have tumbled, there has been what learned economists call the 'double whammy': the pensioners have not just lost out on their interest income but their indexed pension has been deflated, too. Gone are the days, last seen under a Labour government, when pensioners' remittances were linked to wages. Now comes the triple whammy. What is it that old people spend their savings on, above all other items? Foreign travel. Suddenly, these poor folk have seen the effective cost of their one great pleasure in life increase by about 25 per cent as the pound has slid against the tourist currencies. Why is it that the press has not rushed to the defence of our prudent pensioners? The newspapers usually are avid to do so. I guarantee that the first hypothermia death of the winter will hit every front page in Britain. And any Tory member of parliament who dares to suggest that the defunct old dear in question should have been more sensible and worn a balaclava indoors will be denounced ritually from the popular pulpit of the tabloids. Why, I wonder, does this discrepancy exist. The reason could be simple. Journalism is a young person's profession. Even the editors of our grandest or most successful newspapers tend to be in their 40s, some even younger. They ' and their leading pundits ' are at the stage in their lives when borrowings mount: they have school fees to provide for, and a house which must live up to their professional status. What their proprietor pays them does not seem enough. They must borrow. So, they see a tumbling in interest rates as a very good thing. They find it difficult to understand that there is anyone who would disagree with that. They long for the days when the cost of financing a mortgage was less than the increase in the value of the house on which it was secured. They, at least, are old enough to remember just how much fun could be had on that particular gravy train although, naturally, none of them ever did the smart thing and jumped off the property merry-go-round when it was moving too fast for comfort. They might just be vaguely aware that the only people likely to have done that on any scale were their parents, or those of that generation. And, just possibly, they feel a teeny bit jealous of the provident wrinklies, especially if they happen to be their own parents. Whatever their reasons for not making a great song and dance about the plight of the pensioners, the press is missing a populist trick, something of which it can rarely be accused. Just because old people are less visible than the gregarious and noisy young, it does not mean that they are few. I recall my father telling me that, when he was chancellor, he got a lousy press whenever he raised interest rates, but that he had many more genuine letters of complaint when he cut them.

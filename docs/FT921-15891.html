			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (11): The platform option - Export Zones, tempted by Mauritian miracle THE Mauritian miracle, based largely on the success of that island's export processing zone (EPZ), has encouraged Kenya to try the export platform option. Two companies are exporting processed vegetables and packaging materials from the privately-operated Sameer Industrial Park in Nairobi, owned by Firestone East Africa. Phase I of the development comprises 12 production units, of which two are operational and another two - one to export machine components and the other rubber and leather goods - will come on stream soon. There are some 45 candidates for the remaining eight units, and Firestone plans to develop the second phase of the park. The Kenyan government is establishing a state-operated EPZ at Athi River, 26km from Nairobi, funded by the World Bank. It will have 12 units and should be open for business by mid-1993, and a second phase will be developed by private sector operators. The African Development Bank is interested in financing a second government-owned estate, this time at the port of Mombasa, which would be ready in 1994, while the Commonwealth Development Corporation is considering developing a privately-owned EPZ alongside. At Nakuru, a Kenyan private developer has plans to create an EPZ and there are two more private proposals for estates at Thika and Nairobi. The zones are outside the Kenyan exchange control system so that there are no restrictions on profit and dividend remittances. The organisers claim that Kenya is ideally located to penetrate regional markets, especially the 19-member Preferential Trade Area. There are no quotas on Kenyan exports of garments and textiles to North America or the EC, and there is abundant cheap labour, with unskilled workers being paid Dollars 50 monthly. Hopes are highest for exports of textiles, electronics, rubber and leather goods and furniture. Some businessmen believe there is scope for fruitful co-operation with South Africa, saying that businessmen from the south are considering using Kenya as an 'offshore' location both for the manufacture of exports to Third World countries and for processing products for reimport to South Africa. This strategy assumes that domestic South African production is going to be dislocated by industrial and political unrest and undermined by high labour costs. The EPZ programme expands and supplements the manufacturing-under-bond (Mub) scheme which has attracted more than 30 companies. In both cases all production must be for export, both schemes involve complete exemption of duties and enjoy different tax holiday arrangements. The main differences are that Mub is not confined to specific locations, and it is designed to foster processing of indigenous raw materials rather than imported ones, with an emphasis on agro-processing. Mr Silas Ita, who chairs the EPZ authority, believes the two schemes will have a vital demonstration effect in the Kenyan economy. If the EPZ succeeds in increasing non-traditional exports, it will demonstrate to sceptical old-school Kenyan civil servants that liberalisation is preferable to regulation and controls. On the private sector side, EPZ success would convince investors, local and foreign, that their scepticism about government policy is unjustified while at the same time developing the export culture that manufacturing industry needs so desperately.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Call for little change to A-levels A-LEVELS should remain largely unchanged but with strict limits on coursework, the School Examinations and Assessment Council said yesterday. The council, which is the government's advisory body on examinations, published principles for the development of A-levels - the main exams taken by 18-year-olds for entry into higher education in England and Wales. The principles include an obligation to limit coursework to no more than 20 per cent of each A-level course.</p>

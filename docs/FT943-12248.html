			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Two more companies use FIDs Marling Industries and Adam &amp; Harvey announced foreign income dividends yesterday, doubling the number of companies that have taken advantage of rules in last year's budgets to relieve surplus advance corporation tax. The FID scheme was designed to help companies which derive a substantial portion of their profits abroad. They pay abnormally high taxes when their UK corporation tax liabilities are insufficient to offset the ACT they have paid on their conventional dividends. The first two companies to announce FIDs were BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group which earns about 70 per cent of its profits abroad, and Courts, the household furniture retailer which has a large Singapore subsidiary. A number of other companies are suffering from surplus ACT, particularly after their UK profits shrank during the recession. However, companies are proving slower to adopt FIDs than tax advisers had expected. Several companies such as Burmah Castrol, the lubricants maker, and Keller Group, a recently floated construction company, have expressed interest in FIDs but have yet to implement them. The tax changes allowing companies to pay dividends from foreign income without incurring ACT came into effect on July 1. Marling Industries, an industrial textiles maker, said yesterday that its FID would save Pounds 200,000 in ACT, which it would pass on to its shareholders via an increased dividend. A final pay-out of a net 0.57p is recommended, making a total of 0.77p (0.65p), on a capital base increased 10 per cent by a rights issue last July. The increased dividend will compensate non-tax paying institutional shareholders which would have clawed back the ACT on conventional dividends. Adam &amp; Harvey, an international distributor and steel stockholder, is recommending a final dividend of 11p gross payable as a FID, making a total of 18.5p gross for the year. This represents a 23 per cent increase for non-tax paying shareholders and 42 per cent for UK tax payers. The board said it would review annually the balance between ordinary and foreign income dividends, and it is probable the current balance would alter as unrelieved, carried forward ACT, now standing at about Pounds 400,000, is absorbed.</p>

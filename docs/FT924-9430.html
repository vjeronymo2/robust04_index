			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: More important than getting numbers right is reasoning and understanding behind them Sir, At the risk of being accused of 'sour grapes' could I suggest that Peter Marsh have a word with Samuel Brittan? Impressive though the number crunching behind his survey (October 30) of UK GDP forecasts may be, it panders to what Brittan calls 'the profoundly misguided view that making (short-term) forecasts is what economics is all about' (November 2). As is their duty, the members of our economics team are ready to fall on their swords over the inaccuracy of their predictions for UK GDP in 1991 (accounted for by a period of over-optimism in early 1990). However, I would suggest that the survey provides a distinctly partial view of their abilities as forecasters, let alone economists. UK GDP is merely one of the hundreds of variables which they are involved in forecasting and by no means the most important. As rewarding as it must be for the winners to receive their economic Oscars, perhaps the more obvious conclusion to be drawn from this survey is that economic forecasting is a very imprecise art. More important than getting the numbers right are the reasoning and understanding that lie behind them. If the chancellor, or indeed any institutional investor, chooses his advisers on the basis of the 'winners' and 'losers' in your survey this year, then they risk being disappointed and surprised when next year's envelope is opened. Our evidence suggests that institutional investors show a more genuine understanding of the quality of underlying analysis than is implied by the results of your survey.

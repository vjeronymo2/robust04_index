			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Banks condemn Treasury stance on swaps advice BANKS WHICH have lost Pounds 550m on invalid swap agreements with local authorities yesterday strongly rejected suggestions by the Treasury that adequate legal advice had not been taken before entering into the agreements. The swaps, ruled illegal by the House of Lords earlier this year, involved the exchange of interest obligations, mostly from fixed-rate to floating-rate, by local authorities seeking to improve their financial management or taking a view on interest-rate movements. Mr Lars Evander, head of the foreign bankers section of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), said the level of legal risk in the UK had prompted his bank, Svenska Handelsbanken, to switch most of its non-sterling swaps business to Hong Kong, where the legal environment was more satisfactory, a move which appears to support claims that the swaps issue has damaged London's status as a financial centre. The government decided earlier this week not to intervene in the tangle of invalid transactions between the banks and the local authorities. Many of the 80 banks involved plan to go back to court to attempt to recover about Pounds 125m of their losses through restitution - the return of all payments made to local authorities under swap contracts. 'The banking industry did take all possible steps to satisfy itself that local authorities were able to undertake swaps,' said Mr Humphrey Norrington, chairman of the BBA's steering committee on swaps. Measures included legal advice and the use of standard documentation, as well as additional assurances from local authorities. The Treasury acknowledged that most banks 'entered the agreements in good faith', but an official said they should have been aware of the 'limited legal capacity' of the councils and taken extra care to protect their legal position. Mr Evander said the episode 'shows the UK legislative system is not suited for innovative financial markets.'</p>

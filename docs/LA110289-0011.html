			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITING LENGTHY CRIMINAL TRIALS  </P> <P> The column "When Justice Runs Out of Gas" (Op-Ed Page, Oct. 23) contains both  dangerous thinking and naivete which is surprising from an attorney such as  Royal Oakes.  </P> <P> Megatrials are anomalies which happen only rarely. However, in a system of  justice as large as the one in Los Angeles, the overlapping of them will occur  from time to time. Thus, the Richard Ramirez (Night Stalker) and McMartin  Pre-school trials took place concurrently. These types of unusual occurrences  should be viewed as just that and not as a reason to change a system of justice  which has, generally speaking, worked wonderfully well for 200 years in this  country and for much longer than that in Great Britain.  </P> <P> Oakes seems to attempt to put the blame for lengthy criminal cases on the  defense, implying that lengthy voir dire is conducted only by defendants and  directly stating that the defense uses unscrupulous tactics to lengthen trials.  He also states that trial courts are so worried about having "perfect" trials  that every whim of a defense lawyer to delay the trial is indulged. Courts of  appeal have not and are not reversing convictions for minor errors committed by  trial courts.  </P> <P> The real reason for megatrials is that prosecutors often file every possible  crime rather than attempting to limit the trial and do a second trial if  necessary. With the sentencing scheme in California, it is unnecessary to  charge 50-100 counts of child molestation as a conviction on 15 counts would  suffice for a prison sentence from which the defendant would never be released.  </P> <P> There is no need to reform a system which has worked wonderfully for 200 years  merely because two or three unusual cases last a long time.  </P> <P> ANDREW E.

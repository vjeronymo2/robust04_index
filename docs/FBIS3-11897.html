The result of the  programs will then be commercialized and the profits divided  among the participants.    The initiative to sign the agreement came from the  Brazilians. The negotiations began last February with the visit  of UERJ Rector Hesio Cordeiro and Paulo Jorge Paes Leme,  director of the Polytechnic Institute, to Havana.    Cuban Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegret  was in Rio de Janeiro yesterday to coordinate with Hesio  Cordeiro the details for signing the agreement. Cordeiro will  return to Cuba on 20 March to sign the final terms of the  agreement.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Blow to Turkey's borrowing plans Turkey's plans to tap the international bond market were dealt a blow last week when Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading credit rating agencies, downgraded the country's debt rating. Moody's cut Turkey's foreign debt rating to Ba1 from Baa3, which reduces it from investment to sub-investment grade. Because of the borrowing rules affecting some US institutions, Turkey may find it more difficult to sell its paper in the Yankee bond market, the US market for foreign issuers. It could also impair Turkey's ability to raise debt finance in Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Turkey's debt rating from BBB to BBB - , which keeps it just within the limit of investment grade ratings. According to treasury figures, Turkey's external debt, both public and private, stood at Dollars 59bn at the end of September, against Dollars 51bn at the start of 1993. However, with a spate of new issues before the year end, bankers estimate the figure is closer to Dollars 62bn. Over the past two years, Ankara has looked increasingly to foreign debt to finance the current account and budget, at a time of high domestic interest rates. Shifting its borrowing from syndicated loans to bonds, it has been able to diversify its investor base and improve the maturity profile of its debt. Like other low-rated borrowers, Turkey offers attractive high-yielding paper. However, Moody's decision reflects continuing concern over Turkey's large current account deficit and deteriorating budget picture. Although Moody's notes improvements on tax reform, and state asset sales, the agency forecasts further spending pressures and expects political concerns to force the government to go slow on further reform. The S&amp;P downgrade also reflected 'a lack of progress in combatting the fiscal deficit in 1993 and the absence of a credible programme to reduce the deficit in the medium term'. For 1994, the Turkish treasury has announced a more conservative borrowing target, with plans to float around Dollars 1.3bn of bonds to cover its external financing needs. In 1993, Turkey tapped Japanese, German and UK bond markets for close to Dollars 4bn. In addition, Dollars 3.8bn of project financing has been extended to Turkish public sector enterprises and local municipalities. Turkey issued a sterling bond for the first time in 1993 and this year is looking at possible issues in both the French and Spanish bond markets. The 1994 budget envisages Dollars 2bn in foreign debt interest repayments. The current account deficit is expected to come back slightly to Dollars 4.4bn, according to Treasury estimates, compared with a provisional estimate of Dollars 5bn in 1993.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Singapore establish new record highs HEIGHTENED hopes of a discount rate cut initially pushed up share prices, but a late afternoon fall in the yen prompted profit-taking, and the Nikkei average ended marginally lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei lost a net 59.51 at 20,841.98, having risen to a high for the day of 21,025.60 during the morning, the first move above the 21,000 level since June 7. However, the subsequent profit-taking pulled the index down to a low for the session of 20,749.47 just before the close. Volume increased to 320m shares from 234m. Dealers led market activity, while foreign investors were active buyers. Overall rises still led declines by 648 to 309 at the close, with 199 issues unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks was finally 6.29 easier at 1,681.75. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.42 firmer at 1,281.34. The dollar, which fell to a record low of Y100.40 in the morning, managed to close higher following comments by government officials which suggested that an economic stimulus package was being formulated for the autumn. Traders said buy orders were cancelled soon after the yen moved back to the Y101 level. In spite of the Nikkei's retreat, some analysts said the underlying tone remained firm. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson International said: 'People do not seem to be reacting to bad news because they do not want to sell into a bottoming economy.' Profit-taking depressed steelmakers and shipbuilders, Nippon Steel shedding Y2 to Y390, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y11 to Y700 and Hitachi Zosen Y4 to Y606. Trading houses, which had firmed recently on hopes of an interest rate cut, lost ground. Itochu, the most active issue of the day, receded Y7 to Y625 and Mitsubishi Y10 to Y1,160. Oil issues gained further ground: Koa Oil was Y20 stronger at Y1,050. Brokerages, which had eased on Monday on reports of heavy losses at Cosmo Securities, turned upwards on bargain hunting. Nomura Securities put on Y10 at Y2,210 and Nikko Securities Y10 at Y1,350. Cosmo was once again suspended for the day on the three major exchanges. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 53.71 to 22,718.49 in volume of 25.4m shares. Electrical, machinery and textile issues weakened, while domestic demand related stocks firmed. Roundup THERE were further record highs established by the Hong Kong and Singapore markets yesterday. HONG KONG made fresh headway, helped by strong overseas buying, and the Hang Seng index ended 39.30 higher at another all-time closing peak of 7,528.79. Earlier in the session it reached 7,541.77 before succumbing to profit-taking. Turnover swelled to HKDollars 5.3bn from the previous day's HKDollars 4.6bn. Property shares were the day's only losers as banks led the market forward. HSBC Holdings, which releases its interim results later in the month, was the most active stock in turnover of HKDollars 341m as the shares climbed HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 85.50. Profit-taking was evident in the property sector, with Hang Lung Development relinquishing 10 cents to HKDollars 11.70 and Henderson Land losing 20 cents to HKDollars 21.50. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index attained a new record close of 1,928.34 with a rise of 5.45. Volume decreased to 111.8m shares from the 115.4m registered on Monday. Among the actives were Great Eastern Life, Java Fund and Jurong Engineering. In KUALA LUMPUR the index neared its previous record close set earlier this month, the composite index advancing 12.15 to 784.91. Tenaga and Telekom, which have a combined weighting of 40 per cent in the index, firmed 30 cents apiece to MDollars 10.70 and MDollars 15.60 respectively. SEOUL was in uncertain mood as sentiment remained upset by the government's ban on false-name trading. The composite index finished 2.73 down at 688.94, but off the day's low of 679.76. Turnover amounted to Won356.4bn. Among the actives were companies with low price/earnings ratios, popular with foreign institutions, following rumours that the government might lift the ceiling on foreign ownership from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. AUSTRALIA was lifted by strength in National Australia Bank, a firmer gold sector and optimism ahead of the federal budget. The All Ordinaries index closed 14.4 ahead at 1,885.1 in turnover of ADollars 448.6m. NAB appreciated 28 cents to ADollars 11.24 following a number of brokers' upgrades. The golds index moved up 68.0 to 2,148.9 on the overnight bullion price rise in New York. North Flinders Mines moved forward 30 cents to ADollars 12.80 and Plutonic 25 cents to ADollars 7.15. BOMBAY rallied after a weak start, with most leading shares ending firmer. The BSE index climbed 73.65 to 2,576.98. COLOMBO was pulled lower by a fall in blue chips, the all-share index shedding 13.67 to 748.85. Turnover expanded to SLRs85m from SLRs57.2m.</p>

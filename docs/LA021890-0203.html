			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TANKER SPILL TO RAISE STORM OF INVESTIGATIONS  </P> <P> By the time cleanup crews began dabbing at the American Trader's spilled cargo  with absorbent pads last week, a host of officials, politicians and citizens  had turned some of their attention from the oil-stained beaches toward a  thicket of investigations.  </P> <P> By week's end, at least two lawsuits -- one seeking $10 million for local  gill-net fisherman, the other asking for unspecified damages on behalf of  coastal residents and merchants -- already were filed. And inquiries and  investigations of all kinds had been launched.  </P> <P> No less than 40 state, federal and local entities are trying to ferret out what  happened and who is financially liable for the spill that fouled 14 miles of  beach, temporarily devastated the fishing industry, killed hundreds of marine  birds and cost British Petroleum, which owned the oil and has coordinated the  cleanup, an estimated $10 million so far.  </P> <P> U.S. Coast Guard investigators conducting the lead inquiry began looking into  every aspect of the mishap, from the accuracy of navigation charts to broader  questions about whether large tankers should use the berth where 394,000  gallons of oil spilled into the sea on Feb. 7.  </P> <P> Politicians geared up for hearings, which could begin this spring. The state  attorney general's office pulled together its investigative and legal team for  a suit against the owners and operators of the vessel.  </P> <P> The State Lands Commission initiated reviews of coastal leases with mooring  terminals, state Fish and Game was assessing wildlife damage, the Coastal  Commission was reviewing lessons from previous spills, and the city of  Huntington Beach began scrutinizing its contract with the refinery that owns  the offshore mooring.  </P> <P> At the federal level, the Departments of Justice, Labor, Interior and  Transportation -- along with their various sub-agencies, including the FBI --  also were in gear before the ship had even straggled back to Long Beach for  repairs.  </P> <P> Even New York-based American Trading Transportation Co., which owns the vessel,  was running an in-house investigation, based on the presumption that the ship  encountered waters more shallow than navigation charts indicated.  </P> <P> "I don't have the faintest idea what all these other groups are hoping to  find," Sanford Schmidt, American Trading's president, said. "I really don't  know how long all of this will take or where it will lead. I really don't."  </P> <P> Investigations Spread  </P> <P> Each investigative body will probe slightly different aspects of the accident,  but all can be expected to focus on a few common points -- the depth of the  water near the mooring where the accident occurred, the conduct of the captain  and crew and the adequacy of the cleanup efforts.  </P> <P> The full results of the probes are months, even years off, and could lead to  civil penalties and stricter controls on the oil industry. Criminal charges are  possible but not likely, officials say.  </P> <P> Eleven days after the spill, key parts of the overall effort still rest with  the Coast Guard, the lead agency in addressing the causes of the spill.  Conducting the two-pronged investigation are Cmdr. Paul Larson, Lt. (j.g.) Neal  Reardon and Lt. (j.g.) William Drelling.  </P> <P> "We are in the fact-finding stage, the evidence-gathering stage," said Cmdr.  Scott Porter, assistant director of marine safety in California. "Every day  they are coming across new leads that must be checked out. We are putting in a  lot of hours."  </P> <P> Coast Guard officials consider the American Trader inquiry an informal  investigation because there was no loss of human life. The events leading to  the accident are fairly clear, and investigators do not expect it to be  especially difficult to unravel. Although they remain an option, formal panels  of officials to take testimony about the accident are not necessary at this  point, Porter said.  </P> <P> So far, the investigation has focused on the crew's conduct, the depth of the  water around the mooring, the possibility of inaccurate navigational charts,  and the position of the ship at the time of the accident, Porter said.  Investigators are also reviewing broader questions about whether large tankers  should use the offshore terminal owned by Golden West Refining Co. of Santa Fe  Springs.  </P> <P> The mooring master and American Trader's senior officers were all tested for  drugs and alcohol in the hours immediately following the accident. Those tests  came back negative, so impairment is not expected to figure in the further  inquiries.  </P> <P> How Deep Is Mooring?  </P> <P> Those findings are among the few hard facts that have been released so far by  the Coast Guard. Nevertheless, some of the points underlying the inquiry are  already known: The 21-year-old American Trader is 811 feet long, 125 feet wide  and can carry 565,000 barrels of oil. Its draft is 43.7 feet fully loaded, and  shipping company officials have said it was full on Feb. 7, when it made its  fateful approach toward the mooring off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Ships with drafts more than 43 feet or lengths greater than 1,000 feet are not  allowed into the berth, which has charted depths of around 51 feet.  </P> <P> The actual depth of the water is much at issue, however. Preliminary  indications show that the tanker might have been operating in water five feet  shallower than that indicated on depth charts when it struck its port anchor,  puncturing the hull twice.  </P> <P> Porter said the Coast Guard has received no official complaints from mariners  about the waters around the Huntington Beach mooring, hence the depths noted on  navigation charts have remained unchanged since at least 1975.  </P> <P> Under way or in the planning stages are no less than three surveys to find out  the actual depth around the mooring. Golden West, under orders from the Coast  Guard, began to take soundings last week.  </P> <P> American Trading Transportation Co. and British Petroleum also are surveying  the bottom, and the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  wants to do an independent depth survey for the government.  </P> <P> "Just how many surveys we need is a good question," Porter said. "I would hope  one would suffice, but everyone has their own legal interest in this."  </P> <P> With the depth at one offshore mooring in question, the Coast Guard has ordered  an investigation at 15 other tanker moorings off the California coast to  determine whether they may conceal hidden safety problems. No findings have  been made yet.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure this is not a problem that could result in a disaster  anywhere else," Porter said. "The fact that this one (off Huntington Beach) has  been used safely for years and years and now there's a problem -- that  certainly raises a question about the others."  </P> <P> When their investigation is finished, Larson, Reardon and Drelling will submit  their findings and recommendations to Coast Guard headquarters in Washington  for approval. If the commandant's office concludes that new regulations are  warranted to prevent similar mishaps, it can appeal to Congress for  legislation.  </P> <P> If crew members are ultimately suspected of negligence or gross incompetence,  they could face charges brought by the Coast Guard in federal administrative  law courts. The civil proceeding, which is akin to a criminal trial, can result  in reprimands, suspensions or revocations of marine credentials for the  offending mariner.  </P> <P> While that would end the Coast Guard's involvement with the case, it will  barely mark the beginning of the broader investigation. Chief among the parties  awaiting the Coast Guard's findings -- and already initiating inquiries of  their own -- are two groups of plaintiffs who have filed suit against British  Petroleum and American Trading Transportation Co.  </P> <P> "We're going to try to depose the captain, the people on watch, the people  dropping the anchors, everybody," said Howard Sacks, an admiralty lawyer  representing a group of gill-net fisherman. "We're going to want the fedometer  readings (which indicate the depth of the water under a ship), the bell book  (which indicates orders to the ship's engine room) and the ship's logs."  </P> <P> On Friday, Sacks notified the court that he hopes to depose the American  Trader's captain, Robert La Ware, on Thursday. Sacks has also requested access  to many of the ship's records.  </P> <P> Who Pays, How Much  </P> <P> As the lawsuits wind their way through the judicial system, a bevy of state  agencies is launching investigations that will head in many directions at once.  </P> <P> Air and water quality agencies say they will attempt to evaluate damage to the  air, shoreline and ocean. Local governments are expected to try to discern the  effects on tourism and land values. The U.S. Department of Transportation could  exercise jurisdiction to investigate the effects of the spill on a  transportation waterway.  </P> <P> At the state level, the Lands Commission has already launched a review of the  leases for 16 offshore oil terminals -- including the mooring where the  American Trader spilled its load. A broader investigation of the facilities is  expected to follow.  </P> <P> Charles Warren, executive director of the commission, said the agency "found  nothing of concern" after meeting with Golden West executives and a cursory  review of the company's lease and operating procedures.  </P> <P> "We are going to look at everything -- depth, oil spill plans, operating  procedures, equipment and maybe some stuff we can't even think of right now,"  said Jim Trout, assistant executive director of the agency.  </P> <P> The State Lands Commission is one of a half-dozen or so state agencies whose  legal case against British Petroleum and American Trading Transportation will  be borne by the state attorney general's office. The state agencies are lumped  together as part of the Interagency Oil Spill Committee, which is convened in  response to spills and which consists of agency representatives on loan to the  coordinating group.  </P> <P> Its findings, which will be months in the making, then go to the attorney  general, who will be responsible for charting the central legal battle over the  American Trader spill. Results of that battle will determine who pays -- and  how much they pay -- for the environmental damage to Orange County and its  coastal waters.  </P> <P> The attorney general's suit will likely parallel a 1988 case in which Shell Oil  spilled 434,000 gallons of oil into water near Martinez in Northern California.  The settlement in that case resulted in a $19.5-million payment by Shell to the  state.  </P> <P> "Frankly, because our main interest is in restoring or replacing the damage to  the environment, we're probably more interested in pursuing civil remedies"  than criminal ones, said John Saurenman, a deputy attorney general in the Los  Angeles office.  </P> <P> Indeed, officials said that figuring out what to seek in terms of civil  penalties poses perhaps the most complicated part of the inquiry. Federal  prosecution under the Clean Water Act is also possible.  </P> <P> "The biggest part of the investigation right now is putting together a damage  assessment," Saurenman said. "We need to determine how much all of this stuff  is worth and who is liable for it, because we're going to be asking them for  money."  </P> <P> There are few guides in assessing the losses. But officials will rely on  experts in an an obscure but increasingly significant field known as "economic  valuation of wildlife" or "environmental valuation."  </P> <P> "There aren't many easy answers," said Dave Dick, a public affairs officer for  the Fish and Game Department. "How much is a deer or a gull or a wild animal  worth? I don't think it's an exact science."  </P> <P> All the same questions that bedevil legal and environmental experts will emerge  at the center of a widening political inquiry into the accident as well,  officials predicted. In Washington and in Sacramento, elected representatives  have landed on the American Trader accident as vindication for an array of  ideas.  </P> <P> Some see it as a death-knell for offshore oil drilling; others see it as  strengthening the case for those wells so fewer tankers will be needed.  Proponents of legislation that would require tankers to be double-hulled argue  that an investigation should focus in on whether the Feb. 7 spill would have  happened had the American Trader not been a single-hulled vessel.  </P> <P> The state Assembly's Select Committee on Oil Spill Prevention and Response  Preparedness, which has subpoena power, is already planning to hold a hearing  in Huntington Beach to evaluate the causes of the spill and the effectiveness  of the cleanup.  </P> <P> Both subjects raise the tempers of committee leaders.  </P> <P> "What were these guys doing with a full tanker steaming into shallow water?"  asked Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro), vice chairman of the  committee. "You can bet we're going to want some answers to that question."  </P> <P> ANIMAL VALUES: How much is a pelican worth? The state must set a value. A41  </P></p>

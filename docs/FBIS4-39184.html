			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Most Polled Kazakhstanis Want Return to </F> Ruble Zone"]    [Text] Many Kazakhstanis think it was a mistake to bring  in their own currency last November.    This is shown by an opinion poll taken in the Republic by  Alma-Ata's [Almaty's] Giller Institute. Some 62.5 percent of  those residents of the capital who were polled are convinced  that the country should return to the ruble zone. Only 21  percent of respondents categorically oppose this step. In the  six months the national currency has been in existence, its  value has fallen more than eight times over.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by staff reporter Li Jianxing </F> (2621 1696 5281): "Goods Supply: From Scarcity to Abundance"]    [Text] The ration coupons and certificates shown here have  now become collector's items. But for decades before reform and  opening up, and even in the first few years after reform and  opening up began, they were in control of the Chinese people's  daily life all the time.    At that time, no matter what you wanted to buy, you had to  have ration coupons or certificates. Almost everything, be it  food, clothing, houses, utensils, or transport, had to be  obtained with "the tickets." Someone once did a survey and  found that, in the 1970's, every person in Guangzhou typically  carried as many as 65 commodity ration coupons and certificates.    When discussing grain coupons, an old comrade said with  emotion: In the 1960's and 70's, when you were going on a  business trip, you first had to take your ration book to the  grain store to get grain coupons. You had to take grain coupons  with you when you were away from home to attend a conference or  to stay in a hotel. Even having a breakfast or snack out  required grain coupons. But today the situation is really good.  Not only were bicycle ration coupons, color television ration  coupons, soap ration coupons, sugar ration coupons, and oil  ration coupons all scrapped long ago, even grain coupons --  which had the largest variety, biggest quantity, and longest  history among all ration coupons -- have been abolished.    Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up, alongside  the rapid development of China's economy, commodity supply has  become more and more sufficient. In 1992, the national  commodity retail volume reached 1.0894 trillion yuan, seven  times the 1978 figure, representing a net increase of 933.6  billion yuan. In rural areas as well as in urban areas, shops  have such a comprehensive array of goods that there is just  about everything one would expect to find. In 1992, the retail  volume of consumer goods nationwide reached 961.3 billion yuan.    In the 15 years of reform and opening up, the life of the  Chinese people can be compared to sesame in bloom, with each  flower growing higher than the last. However, we still have  quite a long way to go to reach the goal of "moderate  prosperity," and our country's national income is still rather  low compared to developed countries. This is especially true  with peasants, whose per-capita annual income last year was only  approximately 800 yuan. This requires us to vigorously throw  ourselves into reform and economic construction, work hard to  develop production, create more material wealth, and satisfy the  ever-rising demand of the general public for material and  cultural life.</p>

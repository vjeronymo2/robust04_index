			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Last lap in South Africa YESTERDAY'S historic agreement leaves South Africa within reach of what once was a dream. Over 300 years of white domination will end when the country's electorate goes to the polls next April, under a constitution which enfranchises the black majority. It marks the penultimate step in the dismantling of an evil system that brought pain and humiliation to millions. The ending of minority rule has been made all the more remarkable by the fact that President F W de Klerk has had the wisdom and courage to preside over the dissolution of white minority rule. Equally remarkable has been the part played by his main political adversary, Mr Nelson Mandela, who emerged from decades in jail calling not for revenge, but for reconciliation. But the last stage of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy may prove the most hazardous. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the predominantly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, and the white-led rightwing Conservative Party, reject yesterday's outcome. Even if they can be persuaded to participate, the battle for power through the ballot box will demand unprecedented tolerance in a sharply divided society where more than 12,000 people have already died in politically inspired violence since Mr Mandela's release in February 1990. Maintaining law and order will challenge the integrity of security forces predisposed to white minority rule. But above all, the coming weeks will pose the first test of the constitution. How voters cast their ballot - indeed whether some vote at all  -will be determined as much by their assessment of the merits of the constitution as by the appeal of the parties themselves. Careful examination Many South Africans are only now taking in what their representatives have won or lost at the negotiating table. This calculation will require careful examination of a constitution whose final shape did not emerge until last night. In many respects, what has been published is a model for other African countries. Proportional representation guarantees that any party winning five per cent of the vote will have a seat in the executive. The Bill of Rights accommodates cultural differences while guaranteeing equality under the law. There is also a formula for equitable allocation of state revenue to the provinces. It is not the winner-take-all constitution that was the basis for majority rule in the rest of the continent. But some critical issues need clarification, and the outcome could help decide whether Inkatha and the white right decide to participate in the poll, or try to sabotage it. Adequate role Although the constitution envisages a government of national unity, it remains to be seen whether minority parties are given an adequate role in the exercise of executive power. And although Mr Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) has shifted from its opposition to provincial assemblies, the extent of the powers they are accorded are either not clearly defined, or subject to being overruled by central government. Given these uncertainties, the role of the 11-member court that will arbitrate in constitutional disputes is critical. Yet composition of this body will be determined by the post-election majority party, putting the court's independence in question. If whites' and other minorities' concerns and fears prove well founded, as this complex agreement comes under wider and closer scrutiny, defections from the ruling National Party to Inkatha or the far right Conservative Party will weaken President de Klerk's authority in the demanding months ahead and heighten the prospect of extreme rightwing violence. If the powers offered provincial assemblies are of little substance, it may be impossible to persuade Chief Buthelezi to participate in the election, raising the frightening prospect of further conflict in his home province of Natal. Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela were the architects of the new constitution: they must address these concerns, and reassure the doubters, if they are to keep South Africa on course for democracy.</p>

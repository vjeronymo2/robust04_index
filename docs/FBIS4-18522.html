			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans O. Alfredsson: "Center Party Preparing for </F> Congress on EU"]    [Text] In contrast to the Social Democrats, the Center  Party is electing new delegates to the congress who will decide  the party's stand on the national referendum on the EU [European  Union]. EU opponents are expected to involve themselves deeply  before the district meetings, which will pick the delegates just  before and after Easter.    In the case of the Center Party, it is justified to speak of  a special party congress. The Social Democrats' EU congress,  which, according to plans, will take place in May or June, is  not a special but a reconvened congress. It will be the same  delegates as to the ordinary party congress last fall. With the  Social Democrats the opponents do not have any opportunities to  mobilize during the spring and try to select persons with  similar views.  <H5>  Can Leave the Government </H5>   The Center Party's executive committee decided last Monday  [14 March] that the previously scheduled extra congress would be  held in May, about a month before the ordinary meeting. The idea  is that the very splintered Center Party will then take a stand  for or against membership in the EU.    Party leader Olof Johansson has already stated that a no  from  the meeting is likely to lead to the Center Party leaving the  government.    Since the Center's EU meeting will be held so close to the  ordinary meeting, the local party districts do not have time to  hold their regional meetings and appoint new delegates to both  the regular national congress, which is taking place in Falun,  and the special congress, which will probably be held in  Stockholm. This means that the EU decision will to a large  extent be made by delegates other than those who dealt with the  EU issue during last year's ordinary meeting in Falkenberg.  <H5>  Want To Keep the Neutrality </H5>   The last three ordinary Center Party congresses have stated  that Sweden should try to become a member of the EU but on one  very firm condition: that the neutrality policy will be kept.  The latter means that Sweden would not participate in the  defense cooperation in the Western European Union, WEU.    A long series of opinion polls have shown that the EU  opponents are in a clear majority among the Center Party's  members and sympathizers. According to the most recent poll by  the Central Statistical Bureau, SCB, 58.3 percent are said to  have voted no in November. Only 17.5 percent are said to have  voted yes and 21.7 percent were uncertain.    Even immediately after the presentation of Sweden's  agreement  with the EU a few weeks ago, there were more opponents than  supporters; 46 percent of the Center voters then said in a Sifo  poll that they would vote no.</p>

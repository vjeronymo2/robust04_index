			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Japanese PM to make debut in supporting role Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new Socialist prime minister, makes his debut on the international stage at Naples, facing the world's spotlights with little of substance to say. Mr Murayama is aware that his Group of Seven partners will be eager for evidence of government action to stimulate Japan's economy, and to curb the massive trade surplus, a factor in the recent rise of the yen and decline of the dollar. To this end, he has gone to Naples with a promise to extend the current year's one-off income tax rebate to future years, but with no figure in mind. He has a deregulation package, prepared 10 days ago by the previous government, but already criticised by the US and the European Union for falling short of expectations. Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin should expect no more than comradely correctness from Japan's prime minister when they meet at Naples. Mr Murayama, who will hold a bilateral meeting with Mr Yeltsin on Sunday, will have little choice but to maintain Japan's euphemistically named Russian policy of 'expanding equilibrium'. In plain English, that means any increase in bilateral Japanese economic aid will continue to be linked to progress on their territorial dispute. Tokyo would, as it did at last year's G7 summit, provide its share of any multilateral aid package. But Japan's first left-wing prime minister for nearly 50 years is unlikely to change its curious position as the only G7 country that has not yet normalised relations with a post-cold war Moscow. Within these constraints, Japan's relations with Russia are gradually unfreezing. Mr Yeltsin pleased the Japanese government at his summit last autumn with the then prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, by formally accepting for the first time that there was a territorial issue and that the two sides should try to solve it. On the Japanese economy, Mr Murayama will tell his G7 partners of plans to enlarge an existing Y430,000bn (Pounds 2,738bn) public works programme, covering the 10 years to 2000, but he will be unable to provide further details. Finally, he will be able to point to a sharp 6.7 per cent decline in the current account surplus in May as a sign that the troublesome gap could be starting to shrink. Japan will also be hoping to obtain something from the summit, yet the chances look poor. It is keen, like France, to see exchange rates on the agenda, though Mr Jiro Saito, the vice-finance minister - the ministry's top bureaucrat - does not believe currencies will be the main theme. Tokyo is worried that the US has not been more vigorous in defending the dollar and is keen to see concerted international intervention. Here, Japan faces the double problem of attracting US support and arguing against Germany's belief that intervention cannot reverse the market trend. Japanese officials are expecting US President Bill Clinton to treat his first meeting with Mr Murayama as a diplomatic courtesy call. To officials' relief, they do not expect him to demand concrete progress this weekend on the long-running US-Japan trade dispute, as had seemed possible when the Hata administration was in power. That will now be left for July 14, when officials on both sides relaunch negotiations on market access for US cars and car parts.</p>

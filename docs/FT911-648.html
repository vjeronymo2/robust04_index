			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): BT union alters tactics on pay THE National Communications Union, which represents 140,000 engineering and clerical staff within BT, has abandoned its tactic of putting in a single annual pay claim and will now negotiate separately with BT's individual businesses. The move is tacit recognition by the union of the difficulty of maintaining its traditional line that all pay bargaining should be conducted centrally. The decision was taken ahead of this year's pay negotiations which are likely to be particularly tough because of falling inflation. It has also been influenced by the continued devolvement, and in some cases sale, of what BT sees as 'non-core' activities which fragmented pay bargaining. The first meeting on 1991 pay has already taken place between the union and the largest of the companies, BT plc. The NCU has submitted a claim for a 'substantial increase' in pay and allowances and more holidays. A pay settlement of 8 per cent has already been reached between the NCU and management at Fulcrum Products, the former BT-owned components manufacturer. Mr Tony Young, NCU general secretary, writing in the latest issue of the union's journal, says the recession and falling inflation will make negotiations difficult this year. 'We also need to recognise the range of businesses with which the union has to negotiate,' he added. The NCU was now involved in 16 sets of pay negotiations with widely differing circumstances in many of the businesses. This was further complicated by settlement dates stretching through from April to October, said Mr Young.</p>

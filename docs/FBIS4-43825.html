			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "P.R.-D.": "Mr. Emmanuelli's Changing </F> `Sectarianism'"]    [Text] Michel Rocard claimed to speak the truth. Henri  Emmanuelli practises blunt speaking. "I would always prefer to  be a left-wing brute who works rather than an anesthetized  Parisian intellectual," he explained last September. "Nuances,"  he also said, "are valuable for thinking but a hindrance to  action." Since he entered politics, this man has been unable to  escape his caricature. It can be summed up in a few words:  gloomy, irritable, archaic, and sectarian. It hampers him,  serves him, and protects him all at the same time. On Sunday,  19 June, it made him first secretary of a Socialist Party [PS]  which is seeking an identity.    He brings to the party the perfect background of the  grandson of a Corsican shepherd, the son of two Communist  militants, orphaned early in life by the death of his  working-class father, who was electrocuted in a work accident in  1958. He also offers it the career of a child whose fragile  health and modest background did not prevent him from becoming a  student of political science, and then starting his career  through the prestigious door of the financial company of the  Edmond de Rothschild bank. He also has a long record as a  militant, close to Mitterrandism, within the Convention of  Republican Institutions, and then the PS.    He also brings the support of his region which, from his  election in 1978 as deputy for Les Landes, and his accession,  four years later, to the chairmanship of the regional council,  has never been disputed. His entry into government as secretary  of state for the overseas departements and territories from 1981  to 1983, then secretary of state for the budget until 1986,  confers on him a national political dimension. His election in  January 1992 as speaker of the National Assembly made him the  fourth-ranking person in the state for a year.  <H5>  Loyal to the President </H5>   This model career would suffice to give him legitimacy.  Events have added a dramatic dimension. In July 1992, the day  of the opening of the PS congress in Bordeaux, the man who was  the party's national treasurer learned, in the press, that he  was to be charged by Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who was  investigating various cases to do with the activity of the  consultancy offices providing the PS' secret funding. For the  members meeting that day, Henri Emmanuelli became a symbol. In  order to "restore" his "honor," the following year, when he was  brought before the magistrate, Henri Emmanuelli was bold enough  to resign as deputy and verify with pride that he still had the  confidence of the voters in Les Landes.    These successes conferred on him a freedom of speech which  he  has never abanoned. A loyal supporter of Mitterrand (the  president's residence at Latche is in his constituency), he can  also be surly and rebellious. In March 1990, he contributed to  the failure of Laurent Fabius' first attempt to take control of  the PS in the battle of the Rennes congress. At the time,  Fabius's supporters did not have words harsh enough to mock the  "archaism" of the deputy for Les Landes who, having become  president of the National Assembly's Finance Committee in 1991,  sometimes virulently opposed the political and economic  policiesi of Pierre Beregovoy.    Paradoxically, this same "archaism" became one of Henri  Emmanuelli's major assets on Sunday [19 June] in his accession  to the post of first secretary of a party desperately seeking to  regain a left-wing label. As for the sectarianism with which  the deputy's name is associated, it has proved capable of  change: from April 1993, when he was the architect of the "coup"  perpetrated by the Rocard clan against Laurent Fabius, to this  June Sunday which marked his collaboration with his former enemy  to succeed Michel Rocard.</p>

A statement issued by the embassy said that  the PLO had transferred tens of millions of dollars since July  1991 from its accounts in Kuwait to Jordan and Switzerland  without any Kuwaiti objection.    The statement emphasized that "the people and Government of  the state of Kuwait adopt a principled stance in support of the  Palestinian people's just cause and legitimate rights."</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VANDALS LEAVE SIGNS OF RACE HATRED;  </P> <P> CRIME: A BLACK FAMILY FEELS THE FULL IMPACT OF BIGOTRY, AND THEIR HOME IS  HEAVILY DAMAGED.  </P> <P> At the crest of a softly rolling South County hill, the wide street of big  homes set off by rosebushes and plum trees hardly seems the setting for a hate  crime.  </P> <P> But six days ago, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, bigotry  accompanied by a particularly vicious brand of vandalism visited a black family  on Barents Street, leaving behind tens of thousands of dollars worth of  destruction and spray-painted racial slurs, an act that has outraged and  alarmed the Orange County Human Relations Commission.  </P> <P> "There is no place in the county any more that is immune to it," said  Commission Chairman Rusty Kennedy, who has scheduled a news conference for this  morning with religious and community leaders and representatives of the  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "We are coming together to join hands to say this county does not tolerate this  kind of bigotry," Kennedy said. "It's sort of a reach-out to the family.  There's a victim here; there's a family feeling isolated."  </P> <P> Although there is no firm count of hate crimes in Orange County -- money  earmarked to monitor such crimes was axed from the budget last year by the  governor -- some officials fear that this particular kind of violence is on the  rise. They cite the vandalism earlier this month committed in the home of a  gay-rights activist in Anaheim, and the attack in August on high school  cheerleader Amber Jefferson, whose mother is white and father is black.  </P> <P> On Monday evening, Delano De Silva and his wife, Laverne, led an insurance  adjuster through their two-story, $370,000 home to assess the damage.  </P> <P> Across their newly re-upholstered ivory brocade couch, across the cathedral  ceilings, across a mirror in the living room, the same racial slur is  spray-painted in black.  </P> <P> The neighborhood, says the 42-year-old father of three teen-age sons, has been  in shock since the vandals went on a rampage inside his home last Wednesday  afternoon. Law enforcement officials say the break-in on Barents Street is the  first such serious hate crime that they can recall in South County.  </P> <P> "I've never been violated like this," De Silva said.  </P> <P> De Silva, who works as an insurance underwriter in Irvine, was born in Panama,  one of eight children of a Panamanian boat builder. He joined the U.S. Air  Force in his early 20s, later became a U. S. citizen and went to college on his  GI benefits.  </P> <P> "We thought we had already dealt with things like this," said De Silva, who  speaks with a faint Spanish accent. He said he has told his children that,  "this is a part of growing up, this is a part of the real world. . . . You  can't hate. There are things you are just going to have to walk away from."  </P> <P> It was 14-year-old Duvahn De Silva -- a Laguna Hills High School freshman who  plays trumpet in the band -- who discovered the break-in after walking home  from school. The vandals hadn't stopped at graffiti: every faucet in the house  had been turned on and the sinks blocked, flooding the house.  </P> <P> Much of the wall-to-wall carpeting has been been heavily damaged and sits in  warped rolls; the dining room ceiling is cracked and falls in chunks onto the  floor. A chandelier sits on an antique oak table, among several family mementos  that were damaged.  </P> <P> Among the most serious losses for Duvahn were his Nintendo video games and his  Air Jordan sneakers. Both were stolen.  </P> <P> "We are definitely looking at this as a hate crime," said Sheriff's Lt. Robert  Rivas, who said investigators worked through the weekend but have no suspects.  Under a 3-year-old state law, so-called hate crimes, that is, crimes sparked by  bigotry, are automatically prosecuted as felonies.  </P> <P> "It's the first one we've dealt with down south that I know of. . . . It will  not be tolerated," Rivas said.  </P> <P> De Silva said he will send news accounts of the break-in to his oldest son,  19-year-old Jason, who is serving in the Marine Corps in Atlanta. He worries  that Jason is not "conscious enough of security."  </P> <P> "I want him to know things like this can happen." De Silva said. "Then I want  to get on with my life."  </P></p>

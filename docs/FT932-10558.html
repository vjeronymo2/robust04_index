			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Havel death plot uncovered AN assassination plot against Czech president Vaclav Havel was uncovered yesterday and five of the alleged plotters were arrested, Mr Jan Ruml, the Czech interior minister, said last night. Mr Ruml said police had identified seven suspects, all foreigners. The five who were detained will be held in custody for 30 days while investigations were carried out. He said the police had intercepted an anonymous letter threatening Mr Havel's assassination. Several clues in the letter led to the arrests and the discovery of weapons. The nationality of the would-be assassins was not disclosed, but several commentators suggested a possible link with the Bosnian crisis. Last month Mr Havel on a visit to Washington denounced Serb atrocities in Bosnia and compared the West's cautious approach towards Serbia with western appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s.</p>

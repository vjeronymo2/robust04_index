Nugent, individually and as co-partners, trading and doing business as RN Nutrition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This matter concerns claims made in respondents' direct mail and mail order catalog advertisements for their calcium supplement, ``BoneRestore.'' The Commission's complaint alleges that respondents engaged in deceptive advertising by making unsubstantiated claims that BoneRestore prevents, treats, and cures bone disease, bone ailments and their related symptoms, and that the product is superior in this regard to other calcium supplements and/or estrogen. The complaint also alleges that respondents falsely claimed to have scientific substantiation for these claims. In addition, the complaint alleges that respondents made unsubstantiated claims that consumer testimonials appearing in their advertisements reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public who have used BoneRestore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order prohibits the respondents from representing that BoneRestore, or any food or dietary supplement, food, or drug: builds and restores bone; stops bone loss; helps persons with weak bones; treats osteoporosis; relieves pain; is superior to calcium or estrogen; prevents fractures; straightens spinal curvatures; and that it provides any benefit in the prevention, treatment or cure of osteoporosis, arthritis, back pain, or other bone ailments, unless respondents possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part II of the proposed order prohibits respondents from representing that any endorsement of BoneRestore represents the typical or ordinary experiences of members of the public who have used the product, unless respondents possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

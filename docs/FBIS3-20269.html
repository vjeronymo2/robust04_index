			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sophie Huet: "Prime Minister Reaffirms Authority </F> of United Nations"]    [Excerpt] Yesterday, Edouard Balladur spoke of "the end of  East-West antagonism" which "has increased the freedom of  countries and peoples." However, "this freedom means that  international relations must be organized better." Addressing  the 91st Interparliamentary Union Conference [IPU] at UNESCO  Headquarters, which ends its work on Saturday, the prime  minister reaffirmed the authority of the United Nations, which  "remains the only organization with the legitimacy enabling it  to make decisions and act on behalf of the entire international  community."    According to Edouard Balladur, the United Nations should not  be "deprived of the control of executing the decisions it  adopts," and, to this end, it must "be given the means which it  is currently lacking." "Admittedly, defense organizations can  act in support, as is the case in the former Yugoslavia, but  they cannot act instead and in place of the United Nations,"  insisted Balladur, who has asked Senator Francois Trucy for a  report on the adaptation of French military resources for  missions carried out within the UN framework. The prime  minister then added that "a great deal remains to be done,"  especially in the area of improving civil and military  procedures.  <H5>  Praise for the French-Speaking World </H5>   The prime minister, who has proposed a "pact of stability in  Europe," which will be launched at a conference in Paris 26-27  May, said that it was not a question of "a new institution or a  new declaration," but of an "exercise in preventive diplomacy,"  aimed at "stanching any sources of divergence or friction"  between the countries "with a calling to join the European  Union." This document, Balladur insisted, "will mark the entry  of our continent into a new era of stability and prosperity."  [passage omitted]</p>

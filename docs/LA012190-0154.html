			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR RILEY, MILESTONES ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH MAGIC  </P> <P> Pat Riley's benchmark victories indicate his development as a coach and the  formation of a team that achieved unequaled success in the decade.  </P> <P> There were several recurring themes in Riley's first, 50th, 100th, 200th,  300th, 400th and 450th victories. Magic Johnson was the dominant player,  averaging 22.2 points, 14.4 assists and 7.2 rebounds in those seven games.  </P> <P> And, Riley usually deflected credit with self-deprecation.  </P> <P> A look at those games:  </P> <P> No. 1  </P> <P> Nov. 20, 1981  </P> <P> Lakers 136, San Antonio 116  </P> <P> Paul Westhead had been fired the day before, Riley promoted. Jerry West, later  to become the club's general manager, joined Riley on the bench to help coach.  Johnson, whose trade request two nights earlier had precipitated Westhead's  firing in the minds of many observers, was booed by Forum fans.  </P> <P> Johnson scored 20 points, had 10 rebounds and 16 assists. Mitch Kupchak made 11  of 12 shots, had 25 points and 17 rebounds. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 30  points.  </P> <P> "Just wing it, just like me," Riley said when asked if he had given the team  advice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No. 50  </P> <P> April 19,1982  </P> <P> Lakers 120, Phoenix 115  </P> <P> It was the last game of the regular season, at Phoenix. The Lakers, still  adapting to Riley as a coach, finished with a 57-25 record, third best in the  NBA behind Boston and Philadelphia. Johnson had a triple-double with 15 points,  15 assists and 12 rebounds. Abdul-Jabbar scored 34 points.  </P> <P> Afterward, the coach provided a quote laden with what later would be dubbed  Rileyisms: "We're riding a crest of positivism now. Last year, there was a lot  of negativism surrounding the team at this time."  </P> <P> No. 100  </P> <P> March 22, 1983  </P> <P> Lakers 123, Seattle 108  </P> <P> It took Riley 138 games to reach 100 victories. Only Boston's Red Auerbach, in  135 games, and the Minneapolis Lakers' John Kundla, in 137, won that many  faster.  </P> <P> Johnson had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists against the SuperSonics, then  a heated division rival.  </P> <P> Said Riley: "There was no problem motivating these guys. They felt Seattle was  making a challenge."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No. 200  </P> <P> Feb. 17, 1985  </P> <P> Lakers 117, Boston 111  </P> <P> It was a customary Laker-Celtic game. Johnson out-dueled Larry Bird at the  Forum, scoring 37 points to Bird's 33. Celtic Coach K.C. Jones complained about  the officiating. Riley said the victory "quieted the talk that we can't beat  the Celtics, not this year. They have been our tormentors."  </P> <P> Riley on reaching the 200-victory milestone: "It feels good to do it against  the green and white."  </P> <P> No. 300  </P> <P> Dec. 7, 1986  </P> <P> Lakers 132, Golden State 100  </P> <P> Gordon Edes, then covering the Lakers for The Times, wrote that Riley "made a  stab at humility" afterward. Said Riley: "I don't really pay much attention to  the numbers, but it's a great honor. I'd say this team has won 150 of them on  their own, without me."  </P> <P> How many, Riley was asked, do the players think they have won? "About 300,"  Riley replied. No. 400  </P> <P> March 9, 1988  </P> <P> Lakers 104, New York 99  </P> <P> After Johnson had scored 26 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and handed out nine  assists to help give the Laker coach his 400th victory in his 540th game, Riley  took another stab at humility.  </P> <P> "Even you writers could win 400 games with this team, I think," Riley quipped.  </P> <P> Wrote Edes: "To say Riley was responsible for the Lakers' winning, they say,  would be like crediting the weatherman for a sunny day."  </P> <P> No. 450  </P> <P> Feb. 26, 1989  </P> <P> Lakers 134, Phoenix 122  </P> <P> It was only Game 54 of 82, but Riley told his players it was the most important  game of the season, because the Lakers were only 1 1/2 games ahead of the Suns  in the Pacific Division standings.  </P> <P> After Johnson had scored 25 points and added 19 assists and six rebounds,  Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said of Riley's comment: "Riley gets that way.  I'm sure you'll hear that from him again."  </P> <P> Said Riley: "To me, they all are the most important. I think (the players) know  that." SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

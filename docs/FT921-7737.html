			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries given boost by January inflation data US TREASURY prices changed direction yesterday, recovering most of their previous day's losses as investors took heart from the consumer price index for January. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was 3/4 higher at 100 15/16, yielding 7.91 per cent, after dropping about 13/16 on Tuesday. Gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, with the two-year note unchanged at 99 3/8 , yielding 5.23 per cent. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange overnight system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 5 1/4 per cent, above the Fed's perceived target for the rate of 4 per cent. The Fed's action, which adds liquidity to the banking system, was widely expected and did not signal a change in monetary policy. An encouraging CPI report for January provided the impetus for yesterday's rally. The index rose only 0.1 per cent, below the 0.3 per cent increase the market had expected. The core rate, excluding food and energy, was 0.3 per cent higher. Longer-dated maturities were also helped by rumours that the Fed was buying bonds for its own account. GERMAN government bond prices slipped back following Tuesday's weakness in the US Treasury bond market and ahead of the German M3 money supply figures for January which are due this week. Traders said there had been no sign of any significant change in the Bundesbank's monetary policy at yesterday's securities tender. The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM41bn at a two-tranche securities tender, allocating DM30.7bn of 28-day funds mostly at 9.40 per cent and DM10.3bn of 56-day funds mostly at 9.45 per cent. That represented a net addition of DM700m in liquidity. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.75 and traded down to 87.72 yesterday afternoon after moving in a narrow range of 87.64 to 87.80. JAPANESE government bonds ended a touch lower due to the yen's weakness and Tuesday's fall in the US Treasury bond market. The yen traded at between 128.0 and 128.4 to the US dollar but traders said there was no sign of central bank intervention. The futures contract had fallen back from its opening level of 102.11 to close at 102.01 where it remained well supported, traders said. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.40 per cent, traded in a narrow range of 5.385 to 5.41 per cent and closed at 5.41 per cent. UK government bonds opened on a weak note and ended little changed on the day in light trading. The Liffe gilt futures contract slipped from its opening of 97.23 to 97.19 before moving back to 97.24 by late afternoon. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 116 3/8 and fell to 116 3/16 . Traders said the 0.4 per cent rise in January UK retail sales announced yesterday had been seen as an encouraging sign.</p>

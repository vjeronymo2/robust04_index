			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Recession curbs truck numbers THE number of trucks above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight operating in the UK fell by nearly 3.5 per cent last year to 415,000. Truck sales have more than halved since the peak reached in 1989. The total stock of trucks licensed in the UK is at its lowest level for 10 years, according to a report published yesterday by the Department of Transport. The decline was partly due to the recession but it also reflected the continuing trend towards the use of heavier vehicles, according to the report.</p>

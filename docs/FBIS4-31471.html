			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 8 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today  approved the debt repayment agreement with Russia closed on May  30 by the Czech deputy finance minister, Premier Vaclav Klaus  told journalists after a cabinet meeting. The agreement  concerns the repayment of $3.5 billion of Russian debts to the  Czech Republic by the year 2003.    "The Government considers this agreement to be a remarkable  success and is content with this one bird in the hand, for the  two fat ones weren't so much in the bush as up in the clouds,"  said Klaus. He mentioned the fact that the Czech negotiators  had succeeded in fixing the amount of the debt, interest rate  conditions, an exact term of specific repayments, and a  one-to-one exchange rate of the rouble to the dollar.    Klaus specified that the agreement means the Czech Republic  will receive $52 million this year, $101 million the next and  $391 million in 1996. He said that it had been clear from his  April meeting with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow  that the debt would not be repaid with oil or gas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar delivered  almost a two-hour speech in the Slovak parliament today.    In the first part of his speech, he spoke about the results  achieved by his government. In the second part, he expressed  his view on his conflict with the president, whose speech of 9  March led the opposition to propose a vote of no-confidence in  the government.    Vladimir Meciar emphasized that the president had no  constitutional right to control the government and initiate its  dismissal. Vladimir Meciar proposed that either the controversy  should be forgotten or the president should resign. One minute  after [the president resigns], Meciar would resign as well.    Meciar also said that, if no early parliamentary election  were held by the end of June, a referendum would be carried out,  as a result of which there might be 90 government deputies in a  parliament with 150 seats.    The prime minister offered alternative solutions to the  situation: the government staying in power till the early  elections or an agreement between the political parties or  forming a coalition with the Party of Democratic Left [SDL]. He  said that if the Cabinet is dismissed and a new government  formed, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] would go  into opposition and its ministers would not take part in the new  government.    Vladimir Meciar warned against the interruption to  continuity  should he be dismissed and expressed the belief that, after the  elections, he would return to government.</p>

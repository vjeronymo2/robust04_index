			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Irish milkmen discover talent for butchery  -Tim Coone analyses the shifts of alignment shaking up the Republic's food industry CONVENTIONAL wisdom says: 'One man's meat is another man's poison.' Some 10 years ago, this was true of the Irish food sector, where meat and dairy processing have traditionally been two distinct and separate industries. Each has evolved isolated from the other. However last week's acquisition by Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy group, of Barretts &amp; Baird, the UK meat processing group, reflects the steady transformation taking place in the Irish food industry and the gradual abandonment of old corporate prejudices. The IPounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) Irish milk processing industry, once highly fragmented and characterised by a proliferation of small farmers' co-operatives, has in the past decade become concentrated through mergers and acquisitions. It is now dominated by five companies, four of them quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange. Their growing financial muscle and management expertise, has converted them into an emerging force in the European market. The recognition of the need for diversification out of their home markets and into new and complementary product lines has given them a voracious appetite for acquisition both at home and abroad. Last month, the collapse of United Meat Packers (UMP), the Republic's second largest meat processor, presented them with an important opportunity. That company is now in receivership, and tenders closed last Friday for the purchase of its six plants in Ireland. Mr John Donnelly, the receiver, says that more than two dozen tenders have been received, four times the number he had expected. Several of the dairy processors are believed to have made bids. The IPounds 1bn beef industry is undergoing what is probably its biggest shake-up since Ireland joined the EC in 1973 when the Common Agricultural Policy's intervention payments system (a price-supbecame the engine for the sector's growth. What began as a mechanism to mop up surpluses though, became the central pillar of support for the industry, and eventually its greatest weakness. EC beef intervention stocks reached a record high of 800,000 tonnes in 1991, 342,000 tonnes coming from Ireland. More than three quarters of Irish beef steers are now being sold into intervention. The Irish Livestock &amp; Meat Board says cattle slaughterings at export plants reached 1.5m head in 1991, an all-time high. Two companies had come to dominate the Irish meat-processing industry - Goodman International and UMP. Both are privately run, and both have developed a reputation of intense secrecy over their management and operations. The lack of public scrutiny of their finances caused the big Irish banks and institutional investors to steer clear of any deep involvement. 'The Irish banks have skilfully tiptoed around the meat processing industry,' says one market analyst. Foreign banks are the principal creditors to the industry. With the help of foreign credit and government export guarantee insurance, the two companies developed important markets in the Middle East in the 1980s. However, these collapsed with the Gulf war and the scare over bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow disease'. Thrown back onto intervention buying, where profit margins are very tight at around 2 per cent, the big beef processors faced a squeeze. Voracious users of working capital and burdened with heavy interest charges for capital investment in plant, the strains soon began to show. In August 1990, a High Court examiner was appointed to Mr Larry Goodman's Goodman International, Europe's largest meat processor, when it transpired that the company could not meet payments on more than IPounds 650m owed to its creditor banks. Agreed debt restructuring is now underway, but the company's future remains in doubt, not least because of a litany of alleged fraud and malpractice at Goodman plants. This is now the focus of a lengthy and expensive investigation by a High Court-appointed Beef Tribunal. Together with the placing of UMP into receivership, this signifies that 60 per cent of Ireland's beef and meat processing capacity faces a possible carve-up. In stark contrast to the private Goodman and UMP, the publicly-quoted Kerry Group last month reported a 25 per cent rise in profits and a 30 per cent increase in turnover, largely on the back of a diversification from its dairy interests into meat processing. Acquiring plants in the UK, US and Ireland, together with distribution networks through supermarket chains, Kerry has led the restructuring of Ireland's food processing industry. Some 50 per cent of its turnover now comes from meat processing. The other major dairy processors, such as Avonmore and Waterford Foods, are following suit. Public companies such as these, with a strong track record and solid support from institutional investors, should have little problem in raising cash from the equity market to dominate eventually the meat processing industry. For some time Dublin stockbrokers have been singing the praises of Ireland's largest food companies, pointing to their good value and low price/earnings ratios, and their diversification into the US and European markets. One potential obstacle to their long-term growth though, is their hybrid co-operative/plc structure. Their parent co-operatives, made up of milk producers, hold the majority stake in each company and their articles of association currently prevent that stake from falling below 50 per cent. The psychological barrier for these co-operatives, to cede control to institutional shareholders in the interest of longer-term diversification and expansion, will be a difficult one to break. Analysts believe that Kerry is the first likely to do so, as the parent co-operative stake is now only 57 per cent following a recent rights issue. Once that barrier is broken, it will mark a watershed in the Irish food industry, paving the way for others to follow and for the Irish companies to become important players in the European food market. What has been made clear by the UMP and Goodman crises, is that Ireland's beef industry has been long due for change, and that as a stand-alone industry, dependent upon intervention and concentrated in the hands of highly geared, privately run companies, it is not viable. The diversifying dairy companies, with their strong retail outlets and access to the equity market, have pointed the way forward and are likely to be the ones who will now carve the beef industry into more competitive units with a stronger institutional base. Such consolidation will be both logical and healthy for Ireland's agriculture and food industry, which exports IPounds 3.5bn of products annually, or 21 per cent of the total.</p>

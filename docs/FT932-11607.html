			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Doctors: a life-threatening problem - Dominic Lawson urges the government to break the medical profession's conspiracy of silence ONCE UPON a time I was butchered by a dentist. He decided, after I had walked in from the street complaining of a toothache, that a number of my wisdom teeth needed to be extracted then and there. After titanic efforts, he succeeded. In the days following, my condition, as the bulletins say, went from bad to worse. The dentist assured me that these were 'normal post-operative conditions.' Eventually my jaws locked and septicaemia set in, or so I was told by the hospital surgeon before an emergency operation. As far as he was concerned, the mess made of my teeth was consistent with the sort of injuries received by people whose heads have come into violent contact with an unresisting object. When I emerged from hospital, I returned, with some vague thoughts of violent revenge, to the practice where the dentist worked. I was told that he had returned to New Zealand. At the time I harboured some suspicions that the hospital had rung up the dental practice to let them know what had occurred and that the man with the pliers had decided not to face the consequences of his actions. He need not have worried. I had no intention of sueing. As seems to be usual in such incidents, and in ones far more serious than mine, the medical and paramedical professions are never prepared to reveal to patients just what they think of their colleagues, no matter how responsible the patient or how irresponsible the colleague. This is a principle defended as fiercely as the Hippocratic oath. The reason, I think, is not mere loyalty to individual colleagues, or even a sense of 'there but for the grace of God go I' It seems that the medical profession wishes to create the impression that there are no such things as bad doctors, that all practising surgeons have clear eyes and steady hands. This guild mentality defies all reason and commonsense. There must be a wide range of ability in any profession. Just as we must accept that there are good, bad and awful journalists, there must also be good, bad and awful doctors. True, unlike journalists, who do not have to pass any exam, all practising doctors must at some time have passed a stringent examination, invigilated by their peers. But that does not mean that they do not fail to keep up with developments, or become fuddled by alcohol in disappointed middle age. Some months ago, on holiday, I met a doctor who, off duty, let slip the unspoken truth, known to those inside his profession but hidden from those outside. It was at the time of the government's publication of tables monitoring, for the public's benefit, the length of operating waiting lists in the various National Health Service hospitals. 'These tables,' said the doctor, 'are not the things you really need to know as a patient. What you need is the tables showing the rates of deaths from specific sorts of operations at all the big NHS hospitals. You would be amazed to see the differentials in death rates following even routine operations.' 'Where can I see these tables?' I asked. 'You can't,' he replied. 'But I can, and I can assure you that I'd study them very carefully before deciding where I'd go for a big operation.' On Tuesday, however, The Times blew the medical profession's cover by publishing tables taken from statistics on hospital performance issued to health authorities by the department of health. These showed that some hospitals had death rates after general surgery six times higher than others. Naturally, the medical profession pooh-poohed the notion that this proved that some hospitals were simply very bad at surgery compared with others. The director of public health in Yorkshire, Dr Bob Haward, whose hospitals featured among the very worst, said: 'What happens in a hospital depends on what is going on outside it. I don't find death rates helpful.' Nor, too, I imagine, do dead patients. The figures did not give the full picture. For that we will need to see the sort of tables that my doctor friend can see, showing death rates operation by operation. Only when that happens will the government have truly honoured its pledge to give NHS users the information they deserve as consumers. And only then will we start to see a decline in medical complacency and incompetence. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

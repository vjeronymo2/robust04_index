			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Effortless cheer marks Clarke's debut as chancellor AT LAST the Conservatives had someone to cheer. Mr Kenneth Clarke's first appearance as chancellor at the Commons despatch box offered nothing to anyone hoping for an insight into his thinking on the intricacies of monetary or fiscal policy. But then the sullen, serried ranks of Tory MPs who had earlier sat through his predecessor's savage attack on the prime minister were not in the mood for amateur economics. Bemused and bewildered at their party's infallible ability to shoot itself in the head, they wanted their spirits lifted: a politician to wipe the beaming grins of their counterparts on the opposition benches. Mr Clarke delivered. The man who had admitted earlier in the day that, yes, he had been known to cross the street to start a fight, set about Mr Gordon Brown. The shadow chancellor was congratulated on his jokes. Mr Clarke admitted that even he sometimes found it difficult not to laugh at the jibes directed at his cabinet colleagues. But where was Labour's policy? Mr Brown's speech had had 'about as much policy content as the average telephone directory'. He warmed to the theme: 'The best parts of it came when you were quoting me.' The Tory MPs who had sat glumly through Mr John Major's defence of his record cheered. Mr Clarke raised the level of invective. An attempted interruption by a Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's one-time campaigns co-ordinator and image-maker brought a scornful dismissal of his party's reliance on public relations glitz. 'If you think we have achieved what we have achieved so far and what we are going to achieve by plastic red roses and smart suits you have another think coming'. The Tories cheered again, louder. Mr Clarke stuck with the theme. There was nothing original in attacking Labour for refusing to offer its alternatives. Mr Lamont in his time had used the technique effectively. But Mr Clarke - just 14 days in the most difficult job in the government - exhibited effortlessly the political skills which his predecessor so sadly lacked: confidence, humour, and above all, a willingness to discuss economic policy in the terms understood by the voters. Mr Clarke's Treasury would concern itself with the real world - with jobs, with business. The Tories cheered again. There was just time for a few thoughts on economic policy, Echoing earlier media interviews, Mr Clarke spoke of his determination to sustain the recovery, to hold down inflation, to tackle the 'iceberg' of the public sector borrowing requirement. He reminded his backbench fans he would expect their support when he took the hard decisions needed to restrain public spending. Mr Clarke sat down to a roar of approval. Mr Major patted him on the back. As the two men walked towards the voting lobbies, their colleagues on the backbenches kept their thoughts to themselves. The government subsequently secured a majority of 24 (302-278) to defeat a Labour motion condemning the prime minister's 'betrayal of election promises and commitments on economic and social policy'. A government amendment deploring 'scaremongering stories' about public spending peddled by Labour MPs was carried by a majority of 30.</p>

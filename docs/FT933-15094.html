			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BAe set to conclude Taiwan venture BRITISH Aerospace appears set to conclude its Pounds 250m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation at the end of this month, following reports that the Taipei government has offered a Dollars 250m (Pounds 166m) interest-free loan to help develop new aircraft models. BAe refused to comment on the reported loan offer for the regional jet manufacturing and leasing joint venture. However, the company said it was happy that 'negotiations were coming to a conclusion and that everything was on course'. In recent weeks, with little sign of movement from either BAe or TAC, there have been fears of protracted delays. Speculation centred on difficulties over the provision of leasing finance by state-owned Taiwanese banks to TAC. Both partners must get bank guarantees to cover finance for leasing aircraft. However, the development loan from the Taiwan government appears to have dampened any fears. 'It has got to be good news,' said one analyst. The state's offer was likely to mean that the Taiwanese banks would soon come into line on lease finance. BAe and TAC, which is 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, signed a joint venture deal at the beginning of the year to manufacture and lease RJ passenger jets. The loan of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 300m would be for the development of an advanced RJ jet, the RJX. Total costs of developing the RJX have been estimated at Dollars 1bn. The current aircraft will be manufactured for at least three years at BAe's UK factories, saving some 3,000 jobs.</p>

The legislators'  patience was put to a severe test by the Army commander who the  legislators say had given his word to attend this session.    Senator Bernard Sansaricq has condemned the general's  attitude. The president of the second Senate office could not  contain his reprobation and anger. He had hoped for the  formation of a new government as a solution to the political  crisis. Edner Jean filed a report on the day in the Senate:    [Begin recording] [Dupiton in Creole] The general did not  give a date when he commented on the complexity of the case to  me. I understood and did not ask him for a date. He told me only  that he was considering the situation and that at the  appropriate time, he would come because he understands. [end  recording]    [Jean in French] This report on the meeting planned with the  Army commander in chief had the effect of putting a damper on  the enthusiasm of the senators of GARD, Action Group for the  Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty, who finally  revealed on 23 February the contents of the well-announced  surprise -- formation of a new government to manage state  matters.    The convening of General Cedras was most likely planned as a  catalyst to begin the process of definitely excluding President  Aristide. However, the absence of the general came to disturb  the plan already implemented by those senators, an affront for  which Bernard Sansaricq will not forgive General Cedras. It is a  serious insult. The Army commander in chief must give an account  to the nation, asserted Sansaricq. Senator Sansaricq is willing  to go to Army Headquarters to demand the resignation of Gen.  Cedras. [passage omitted]    This statement had the effect of shocking the Senate of the  Republic, led for some time by just one political current, that  of GARD. Most of the members of this body for the first time  clearly dissociated themselves from the stance of their  president. [passage omitted]    Finally, Sen. Belizaire intervened at the podium, asking for  the withdrawal from the agenda of the point concerning the  attendance of Gen. Cedras, which would be postponed  indefinitely. This does not detract from the determination of  those senators to form a new government in the country. [end  recording]</p>

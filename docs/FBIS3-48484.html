			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Demand for domestically produced reconnaissance  satellites is rapidly growing in the Defense Agency [DA]. Since  North Korea successfully conducted a test launching of its  "Nodong-1" ballistic missile, which can directly hit Japan, the  agency has been stressing the need for tools to keep track of  North Korea's missile development. The agency is currently  reviewing the "National Defense Program Outline" upon the  request of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and is supposed to  draft the revised outline by the end of this year. The new  outline is expected to emphasize reinforcement of the nation's  intelligence-gathering and analysis capability. Procurement of  military satellites is difficult for Japan because a 1969 Diet  resolution rules out the nation's development of space  technology except for peaceful purposes. However, it appears  that the agency thinks the prime minister may like the proposal  for obtaining the satellites since he tends to attach importance  to high-technology equipment.    Full-fledged reconnaissance satellite systems are currently  possessed by only three nations -- the United States, Russia,  and China. If Japan decides to build its own military  satellites, neighboring nations would certainly react strongly  to the decision. Even within the country, the Social Democratic  Party of Japan, a coalition member, would strongly oppose such  an attempt.    A reconnaissance satellite system should have ground  facilities worth over 150 billion yen [Y], and three to four  satellites, which would cost at least Y40-50 billion each. A  senior Defense Agency official said: "Taking maintenance  expenses into account, the satellite system would cost several  hundred billion yen." Moreover, as the trail-blazing pioneer of  space development, the United States may react negatively to  Japan's attempts to develop its own space technology. Even in  the Defense Agency, few people believe the plan can come to  fruition easily.    The Defense Agency has already begun studying the political,  technical, and financial problems involved in obtaining  satellites within the 1990's. A senior official said: "In the  next five-year defense buildup plan, which will begin in fiscal  1996, we would like to advocate the need for Japan to obtain its  own reconnaissance satellite, at the least."    The introduction of reconnaissance satellites has been an  earnest desire of the Defense Agency, which aims at establishing  Japan's own system for gathering and analyzing strategic  information. At present, Japan depends to a large extent on the  United States for military data on its immediate strategic  environment.    In Diet interpellation in 1985, former Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone expressed a positive stance toward Japan's  obtaining its own reconnaissance satellites. At that time,  however, the government could not further discuss tangible  measures for obtaining the satellites due to the 1969 Diet  resolution saying "Japan's development and use of space  technology should be limited to peaceful purposes." However,  the Defense Agency is seeking a breakthrough for obtaining  satellites on the pretext of the government's 1985 statement  that "it is possible for the Self-Defense Forces to use  information provided by general-purpose satellites, such as  weather satellites."</p>

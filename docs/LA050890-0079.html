			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BERLIN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA PERFORMS AT SEGERSTROM HALL  </P> <P> Having delivered an unusual, primarily post-Romantic program at Pasadena's  Ambassador Auditorium Thursday, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra on Sunday  brought to the Orange County Performing Arts Center another all-orchestral,  Romantic agenda.  </P> <P> At the Ambassador, conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy offered the indulgent banality  of Scriabin's Third Symphony. At Segerstrom Hall, he gave us the indulgent  glory of Strauss' "Also Sprach Zarathustra." As on Thursday, the orchestra  played boldly, loudly and sometimes imperfectly. Precision of attacks does not  appear to be one of Ashkenazy's top priorities.  </P> <P> But intensity, excitement and drama are high on the conductor's list, and his  high-voltage reading of Strauss' lofty Nietzschean tone poem certainly bore  that out. Ashkenazy has in this orchestra a sturdy, energized brass section,  percussionists who rarely pull punches and, most remarkably, a string choir  that penetrates with Brobdingnagian strength. As a result, key moments in the  work exploded with vigor; the most climactic of these proved earth-shattering.  </P> <P> This was not simply an aggressive, cataclysmic performance, however. Ashkenazy,  finishing up his first year as principal conductor of the Berlin ensemble,  brought out telling details with striking clarity. The various woodwind  soloists played with great sensitivity, and concertmaster Hans Maile delivered  his extended solos with confidence and style.  </P> <P> Though "Also Sprach Zarathustra" was composed only 20 years after Brahms' First  Symphony, few musicians would claim that the two works should receive the same  treatment. Yet Ashkenazy's Brahms proved nearly as extroverted -- and often  nearly as loud -- as his Strauss. To be sure, he brought spellbinding  excitement and unforgettable power to the familiar score. Yet much of the  dramatic impact was lost by virtue of the sheer muscularity of the playing.  </P> <P> Again, the music-making, while by no means flawless, was first-class. All of  the players seemed to play as if their lives (not their livelihood) depended on  it. But they played with such constant force that the work did not take on any  real shape. Thus, to give the finale's coda the importance it needed, Ashkenazy  had to coax his players to play with such headlong abandon that the listener  felt as if he were sitting a few feet under a rapidly moving elevated train.  </P></p>

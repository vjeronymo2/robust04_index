			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Southern African leaders meeting in Botswana today,  including President Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and President de Klerk,  and Nelson Mandela from South Africa, were talking about the  troubles in Lesotho's Army. Clashes between opposing factions  have been going on in Maseru for almost two weeks, since one  section demanded a big pay increase, but there are those who  think it might have been an incipient plot against the  government of Ntsu Mokhehle. The leaders decided to set up a  task force to look into actions such as sending a detachment of  peace-keeping troops to Lesotho, but the Lesotho opposition BNP  [Basotho National Party] has been quick to issue a statement  objecting. On the line to Maseru, Robin White asked the BNP  leader, Evaristus Sekhonyana, what messages they will be sending  to Botswana and Zimbabwe.    [Begin recording] [Sekhonyana] We have said very, very  clearly: We may not have the power to stop those who want to  intervene in the country. We have said it, but we have said  that, were they to be tempted with this intervention, they  honestly would be doing so against a unified political  impression of the entire nation. This is our bidding. We have  equally said that there are actions....[pauses] You know, this  nation--unfortunately--may be small, but it is a nation of very  proud people. They have not exhausted their local remedies, and  we have said that, you know, the action of intervening at this  stage before the local remedies have been exhausted will be  considered by Basotho, the sovereign Lesotho, as a naked  interference--and in fact a very strong word we are using--as a  rape against our nationhood, a desecration of our constitution  and its highest institutions, and a contempt upon his majesty.    [White] But isn't it pretty obvious that local solutions  have  failed?    [Sekhonyana] No. Only today, the secretary general of the  Commonwealth is starting his initiative, and we just don't  understand how the secretary general of the Commonwealth can  begin his initiative today. The heads of churches, the  political leaders, the nongovernmental organizations have all  been united today in saying that local remedies have not been  exhausted. And only today, the Commonwealth secretary general  started this initiative. And somehow, in another capital, a  decision has been taken to intervene militarily. We humbly  request they rethink.    [White] If they were to come, what would you and your  supporters do?    [Sekhonyana] There is nothing. What do you do against a  military intervention? But all I am sure is that Basotho will  not welcome it. That is one thing I am sure of. It may help  the government if the government feels that it is going to be a  helpful solution, but it is definitely not to become a welcome  mission by Basotho.    [White] Mr. Sekhonyana, inspite of your denials, the feeling  persisted in some way these soldiers who are rebelling are  supporters of your party.    [Sekhonyana] Well, I really do not know, because, you know,  this was concocted by the government and it is utter rubbish.    [White] I know you say it has got nothing to do with you,  but  what is your message to these rebel soldiers?    [Sekhonyana] The message we are making is that we are  pleading with both sides in the Army. We are pleading. We join  our comrades in other parties. We join the churches. We join  the nongovernmental organizations. Today, the wives of the  soldiers made a pleading: For heaven's sake, why do you play  into the hands of those who have got bad designs on you? For  heaven's sake stop fighting, lay down your arms, go under the  structured command. This is the plea. This is the request of  us in the entire nation. [end recording]</p>

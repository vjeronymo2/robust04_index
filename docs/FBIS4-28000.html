			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 7 (BERNAMA) -- The contract for  the purchase of Russian MIG-29 air superiority jet-fighters for  the Malaysian Air Force was signed here today.    The multi-billion ringgit contract for 16 single-seater and  two twin-seater MIG-29, ground support equipment and spare parts  marked a significant breakthrough for Russian defence  manufacturers into the Southeast Asian region.    The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) would be the first air  force in the region to operate the Russian frontline  jet-fighters which would be delivered within 14 months.    The contract was signed between the government of Malaysia  and the Moscow Aircraft Production Organisation (MAPO) and the  state corporation for export and import of armaments and  military equipment Rosvoorouzhenie Russia.    Finance Ministry secretary-general Tan Sri Mohamed Sheriff  Kassim signed for the Malaysian Government while the Russian  defence manufacturers were represented by MAPO director-general  V. Kousmine and Rosvoorouzhenie director-general V. Samoilov.    Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Defence Minister Najib  Tun Razak and visiting Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets, witnessed the ceremony held at the treasury.    Together with the contract signing, Malaysia and the Russian  defence manufacturers also signed two memoranda of understanding  [MOU] -- one, for industrial participation, and two related  agreements.    Under the MOU for industrial participation, general areas  for  industrial cooperation with local defence industries would be  identified while the second MOU was for the setting up of a  technical services centre by a tripartite joint venture to  provide technical support for the aircraft.    The two related agreements signed were for counter-purchase  of US$95 million worth of Malaysian palm oil by Russia over a  five-year period and the offset programme.    Under the offset agreement both sides should identify areas  for transfer of technology to be implemented over a period of 10  years.    Airod Sdn. Bhd. [Company Limited], the country's privatised  aircraft inspection, repair and overhaul depot, and local  telecommunications firm, Sapura Holdings, have been identified  as recipients of the project.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Jobs: Time for advertisers to find a new joke - Psychologists' research paints portrait of Britain's most tediously jibed-at profession THE Jobs column couldn't help feeling a mite dis-appointed with the Royal Air Force on seeing the results of this year's British recruitment-advertising awards. Given the RAF's traditions, I would not have expected it to choose such a soft target for the ad for trainee pilots and navigators which has just won it the topmost prize. The picture shows a small boy running about, arms outstretched, having a game of aeroplanes. The headline says: Can you honestly remember anyone playing chartered accountants? The award-presenters comment: 'This advertisement communicates a sentiment that all of us recognise.' True enough . . . but one would have thought that the RAF's ad agency, J Walter Thompson, could have recommended a more original butt for the joke. After all, I can't honestly remember anyone playing corporate finance directors, or even journalists either. At the same time, however, the announcement of the award and my jaded reaction to it have left me in an ambivalent position. For today I am at last able to deliver on a promise I made almost two years ago, on March 28 1990 to be precise. My topic that day was a study by two psychologists in Northern Ireland, Jackie Granleese and Timothy Barrett, of accountants' personalities. And while it shed instructive light on the popular image of its subjects, as exploited by the RAF, it had the defect of a limited scope. Besides being all men, the accountants covered by the study were solely of the Irish chartered sort, albeit coming from both north and south of the isle. So knowing that the two shrinks were using the same psychological yardstick  -the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire - on men belonging to the chartered institutes of Scotland and of England and Wales, I promised a further report in due course. The findings arrived just the other day. The only trouble with them, in the light of my reaction to the RAF's ad, is that they confirm the popular image aforesaid. As in Ireland, so in England, Wales and Scotland, the typical personality of the male chartered accountant is one which most other brands of workers would see as matching the comedian John Cleese's description of the species as 'irrepressibly boring and dull'. In the two psychologists' words, the characteristic make-up shown by their tests on 100 or so members of each of the three institutes is 'the socially confirming, stable introvert'. They then add: 'Such an individual is typically calm, even-tempered, controlled and unworried. Quiet, introspective, reserved, fond of books rather than people, he is someone who tends to plan ahead and who distrusts the impulse of the moment. He does not like excitement, takes matters of everyday life with proper seriousness and likes order in his life. He is reliable, somewhat pessimistic and he places great value on ethical standards.' Moreover, the shrinks say that such comparable evidence as exists on accountants in the United States and Canada shows that there, too, the typical male member of the profession has much the same traits. Even so, what's wrong with that? OK, he may not be the life and soul of the party. But, given the value he places on ethical standards in particular, we'd surely all benefit from having a lot more of him around elsewhere. NOW to the table below which is drawn from the Day Associates consultancy's latest three-monthly survey of pay and perks in City of London banking. The figures are based on data supplied by over 90 international banks and investment houses, and the full report covers 214 different jobs at various levels. Anyone wanting it should contact Day's Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; telephone 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723. The VAT-inclusive price is Pounds 141 to concerns which take part in the survey, and Pounds 200 to others. My extracts, which provide at best a loosely approximate guide to the real state of pay, are confined to 17 fairly senior positions. First we have basic salaries - the lower quartile referring to the person a quarter way up from the bottom of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to the person mid-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down. Next comes the average salary followed by the percentage of it typically received as a bonus. The last two columns show the percentage of the job-holders whose perks include a car, and its average price. FINALLY, a reminder about my last week's announcement of Bowater's initiative in sponsoring, along with the FT, the trial run of an advertisement in our pages in which unemployed executives may offer their services at Pounds 50 apiece. In the trial, due to run the week after next, the chance is limited to people with business-development skills, and there's room for only six self-ads of at most 60 words each, including the person's real name. Those to appear will be chosen at random from entries reaching me here by the deadline for copy, which is February 19. Even so, three impressive looking starters have already arrived at the gate.</p>

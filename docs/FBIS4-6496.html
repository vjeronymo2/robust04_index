			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Former member of the  parliament of France and member of the European Parliament  Pierro Ceyrac and president of the Summit Council for World  Strategy of Japan Hirogatsu Ota, who were members of the  Pyongyang-visiting group of former heads of state and government  and politicians of various countries, were interviewed by KCNA  before leaving Korea.    Saying he was deeply impressed during his Korea visit,  Pierro  Ceyrac noted:    "What I want to stress is that socialism of Korea is  fundamentally different from the social systems in other  countries. I mean that socialism of Korea is based on  deep-rooted love between the leaders and the people, and love of  the people for their country. Korea is the only country of this  kind, I think. "Such unity and such patriotism of the Korean  people strike me with admiration. As she has such unity and  patriotism, Korea is very strong and afraid of nothing."    Hirogatsu Ota said he witnessed the looks of the working  people joyfully spending the auspicious April holiday. He said:    "The sight of the people of whole country significantly  celebrating the birthday of the great leader gave me the  impression that the whole country which is one family was  spending the holiday together with the father. In a word, Korea  can be said to be a large harmonious family.    "Witnessing all this, I gained a better knowledge of the  healthy social and moral ethos and the peaceful and harmonious  social atmosphere of Korea."</p>

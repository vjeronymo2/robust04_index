			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / China to get briefing on HK poll: Patten to seek Major's endorsement for policy proposals BRITAIN is to brief China on plans for conducting Hong Kong's 1995 elections before Mr Chris Patten unveils them next month in his first key policy speech as governor. Mr Patten is due in London today to seek the personal endorsement of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, for his programme for the last five years of British rule in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. He will also give a preview to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who will brief Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, when they meet in New York at the United Nations General Assembly next week. Mr Patten will make public his programme for Hong Kong's constitutional and social development when he opens the Legislative Council session on October 7. He will visit Beijing soon afterwards. China will scrutinise with particular anxiety the proposals for the 1995 elections, which will be decisive for Hong Kong's political stability in the run-up to and beyond 1997. Mr Patten is likely to tell the Chinese that they must accept a substantial degree of democracy in Hong Kong if they want a successful takeover of the colony. He is expected to stand firm against pressure to form a cabinet composed of representatives from the legislature. He is expected to encourage the development of a more independent and effective legislature by which the government would need to win its consent for its legislation but would not depend on a parliamentary majority. This could mean an increase in the number of democratically elected members above the 20 already agreed, or - if China prefers - a broader base for the so-called 'functional constituencies', representing mostly professional and business interest groups, which choose 30 members. The governor has the power to make these constituencies more representative of the population at large. He also has discretion to decide the electoral system for the direct elections. The liberals favour first-past-the-post, while China and its conservative supporters in Hong Kong prefer a proportional system. Mr Patten is expected to announce government spending proposals for housing, education, the environment and other social policies as well as far-reaching constitutional reforms which he hopes will lay the foundation for a smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty in mid-1997. Today, Mr Patten will also brief the UK government on his proposals for solving the impasse with China about funding Hong Kong's new airport. This will be presented to China's representatives at a meeting in Hong Kong tomorrow</p>

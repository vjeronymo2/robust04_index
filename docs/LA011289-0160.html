			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> LOW-COST HOUSING HEARING  </P> <P> A Planning Commission hearing has been set for next Thursday to consider a  proposed amendment to the city's fledgling General Plan that officials say is  needed to encourage development of affordable housing.  </P> <P> If approved by the City Council, the amendment would be the first since the  General Plan was adopted last June.  </P> <P> The proposal, backed by city housing officials, would allow nonprofit  developers to build up to twice the number of units allowed under the plan for  certain low- to moderate-income housing projects of 20 or fewer units, said  Debbie Potter, the city's housing and economic development manager.  </P> <P> In the parlance of housing officials, low-income people earn 50% to 80% of the  median income; a moderate income is 80% to 100% of the median. In West  Hollywood, the median annual income is $18,367 for a single person and $21,060  for a couple.  </P> <P> Potter said a nonprofit developer has expressed interest in building affordable  housing on a parcel on the city's east side. The General Plan would allow only  eight units on the land, but the developer insists that at least 16 units are  needed to make the project economically feasible.  </P></p>

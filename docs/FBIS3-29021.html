Needless to  say, the announcement is an important event which will exert a  favorable influence not only on U.S.-Vietnamese relations but  also on the situation in Indochina as a whole.    In recent years, Vietnam has done a host of work searching  for U.S. soldiers missing in action from the Vietnam war. It  can be stated with certainty that after the lifting of trade  embargo, Hanoi will more actively cooperate with Washington in  solving this issue which is rather sensitive to the American  people.    Another factor in lifting the trade embargo is economics.  U.S. business circles have estimated that their losses in  Vietnam resulting from the trade embargo amount to $700-800  million annually. It is true that U.S. companies are allowed to  do business in Vietnam, but this is only in partnership with  companies of other countries. Such business restrictions can,  of course, limit the profits of U.S. businessmen. According to  experts' estimates, Vietnam is one of the few Southeast Asian  countries with the best potential for economic cooperation.  Undoubtedly, Vietnam is also an indispensable springboard for  economic cooperation with other countries on the Indochinese  peninsula.    The lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam will also exert  a  favorable influence on restoring U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic  relations and political contacts. Washington has decided to set  up a liaison office in Hanoi, and it can be converted into a  diplomatic mission in the future.    What is noteworthy is that the lifting of the embargo on  Vietnam has also activated the campaign in the United States to  end the trade embargo on its neighbor, Cuba. Many mass  organizations and business representatives have taken part in  the campaign. U.S. businessmen are dissatisfied over being  deprived of the opportunity to invest in Cuba while their  competitors from Europe and Latin America are actively exploring  markets in Cuba. As time passes, the lifting of the U.S. trade  embargo on Cuba will likely become a more heated issue.</p>

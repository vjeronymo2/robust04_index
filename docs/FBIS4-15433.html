			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga, 8 Apr -- "Spoken apologies are not enough,"  Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said in regard to Russia's  references to an erroneous mention of Latvia in an order by  Boris Yeltsin on setting up bases on the territory of that  Baltic state. "In the given situation it will not be possible to  sign the agreements initialled and additional talks are needed,"  the head of government stressed. "But they can only take place  after the order in question is recalled at official level."    Valdis Birkavs spoke on local television on Thursday  evening.  He arrived in the studio after cutting short his attendance at  a meeting of the governing coalition in the Saeima, and laid out  the position of the "Latvias Tselsh" faction, which is part of  the coalition with the Christian Union faction. Birkavs has  frequently stressed that a treaty on withdrawing troops from  Latvia is necessary, but "all obscurities should be removed."  In his words, "if a treaty is not signed, great uncertainty  will arise given the aggressive aims of Russia expressed in the  document signed by Mr. Yeltsin." In his opinion, "Russia has  shown that it does not need a treaty, but for Latvia it is  necessary."    Concern has been caused at the Latvian Foreign Ministry by  the information that Russia's Foreign Ministry had not taken  part in the drafting of the document. "If that is the case how  are the President's orders prepared?" Maris Riekstinsh, Latvian  Foreign Ministry state secretary asked. "We have not received  any clarifications and have only the report that a mistake was  made."</p>

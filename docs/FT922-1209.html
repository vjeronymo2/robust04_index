			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Syndicate must extend cover TOUCHE ROSS &amp; CO AND OTHERS v BAKER House of Lords (Lord Templeman, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Mustill, Lord Slynn of Hadley): June 18 1992. A DISCOVERY extension clause in a line slip insurance policy giving the assured an option to extend cover after non-renewal by the underwriters, is not collectively binding on all participating syndicates but may be invoked against an individual non-renewing syndicate irrespective of whether the others have renewed. The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr Colin Baker, representative underwriter for Lloyd's Syndicate 126, from a Court of Appeal decision (FT, March 6 1991) that Syndicate 126 was bound to extend cover to the plaintiff assureds, Touche Ross &amp; Co and five other accountancy firms under excess professional indemnity policies. LORD MUSTILL said that for many years a professional indemnity programme had been organised by Minet &amp; Co. The policies were written in layers under line slips. Some 120 companies and syndicates took part. Substantial lines were taken by Lloyd's Syndicate No 126. The relevant lines were on the first and third excess layers. The policies contained 'discovery extension' clauses, giving the assured an option exercisable before expiry of the policy, to prolong cover for a further period in exchange for additional premiums. The protection afforded by prolongation related only to claims arising from acts already done before expiry of the policy. In the 1980s, the insurance market contracted rapidly, so that to find replacements for full cover on non-renewal became more difficult, and the right to buy time by deploying the discovery extension clause cover became more important. The underwriters elected to terminate cover under the primary and first excess layers from May 31 1987, and the third excess layers from May 31 1986. The assured then set about Warning, Overset column replacing the cover, in particular by seeking to persuade the existing insurers to reinstate it on renegotiated terms. Not all insurers were willing to participate. Accordingly, the assured invoked the discovery extension clause. With one exception the non-renewing insurers accepted invocation of the clause without demur. That exception was Syndicate 126. It maintained that the clause must be exercised against all the insurers or none. The assured disagreed, maintaining it would be absurd to read the policy as requiring invocation of the clause against insurers who were willing to continue full cover. Mr Justice Leggatt found in favour of the assured. His decision was upheld in the Court of Appeal. Syndicate 126 now appealed. The appeal turned on the application of well-established rules and practices to the terms of the policies. None of the following propositions were in question: 1. Every underwriting member of Lloyd's incurred liability to the assured on a several, not joint, basis (see section 8(1), Lloyd's Act 1982). 2. Notwithstanding that his rights and liabilities were several, the individual 'name' never acted on his own in creating insurance contracts. He underwrote through an agent. Business was conducted on a grouped basis, through syndicates. 3. When an underwriting agent took a line on a policy for his syndicate, he called into existance a bundle of individual contracts between each name and the assured, identical save as to the respective proportions taken by the names. That bundle was agglomerated with the other groups of contract created when other syndicates took a line on the same insurance. 4. There was complete delegation by the name to the agent of all powers relating to conduct of his underwriting business. 5. In practice, it often happened that some of the delegated powers were further delegated to others. Such onward delegation was often effected in unison by all subscribers to the risk. For example, several syndicates might authorise a third party to contract on their behalf - as happened here with the line slip. The first of those characteristics of Lloyd's insurance was said by the assureds to lead directly to dismissal of the appeal. They said the underwriters' argument treated the contract as if it were bipartite, with the assured on one side and the insurers as a group on the other. They said that to understand the contract in that way was to ignore the fundamental rule that Lloyd's insurance involved not one contract, but a group of bundles of contracts. The fact that the underwriters were severally bound entailed that the assured were entitled, and bound, to exercise the contractual option in an equally several manner. That was not accepted. The case was about the separate treatment of syndicates, not individual underwriters. The logic of the argument if carried through, would lead to the conclusion that the assured would have the right to exercise the discovery extension option separately against each individual name. Such a result would run entirely contrary to the way in which Lloyd's conducted its business. Thus, although the first principle had an important part to play in the appeal, it did not lead directly to a decision in favour of the assured. In interpreting the policies to see which of two possible arrangements for creation of an option to extend was intended, the practical implications of preferring one would be an important element. Clause IV condition 3(b) of the policies provided that 'this policy' should be extended annually 'unless . . . either party has given the other due notice that the expiry date shall not be extended'. Condition 5 provided that 'if the underwriters shall refuse to extend this policy', the assured had the right on payment of an additional premium, to extension of cover granted by 'this policy'. Counsel for the insurers relied on the repeated use of 'this policy', and drew attention to 'either party'. He said that use of the sin-gular made it plain that the subscribers to the policy were regarded as a single body. The argument must be approached with caution. Experience showed that insurance documents in the London market were rarely drawn with the precision of language needed for grammatical contrasts to be a reliable guide to intention. The practical consequences of the underwriters' argument were sufficient to show that the absence of any sign that subscribers' rights were to move in unison represented the true sense of the document. If the underwriters' argument was sound its logic must also require that the extension notice was also to be given for all subscribers or none. Since the policy was self-renewing that would mean that if all but one of the subscribers wished to bring it to an end but the others did not, all the individual contracts would roll inexorably on from anniversary to anniversary until the dissenter could be brought into line. That seemed completely at odds with the need for the individual syndicate or company to be constantly reassessing its position in regard to its own strategies, capacity and exposures elsewhere. If that view was right, the insurers' argument was unsustainable, since the discovery extension clause could not be read as requiring the option to be exercised against all, if some subscribers had chosen to remain with full cover. The notion that the parties could have intended the giving of an extension notice to those who were willing to extend - a notice which would be a useless formality and the source of unnecessary future effort - was unacceptable. There was nothing in the words of the policy to compel the result for which the underwriters contended, and everything in the practical considerations to the opposite effect. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For the underwriters: Anthony Boswood QC and Guy Philipps (Simmons &amp; Simmons). For the assured: Jonathan Mance QC and Robert Bright (Lovell White Durrant).</p>

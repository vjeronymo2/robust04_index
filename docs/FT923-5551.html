			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Outdoors: Fancy a flutter? THE HIGH Brown Fritillary, one of Britain's fastest butterflies, is probably also its most endangered. Since 1950, its range has contracted by 94 per cent, leaving only 37 known colonies country-wide. The orange-brown butterfly, with chequered upper wings and silver dots beneath, is threatened by the decline in traditional woodland management and by the attack on bracken. High Brown caterpillars feed on violets found among bracken. As bracken disappears, so do the butterflies. Gardeners can do their bit to encourage butterfly conservation by choosing specific plants and flowers that attract them. You will have a tough time enticing the High Brown because of its specialised needs, but many of Britain's 54 other resident species are bound to pay a visit . Butterflies need nectar for energy, warmth to become active, and shelter from wind. Those that might visit your garden depend on its location, soil type and the proximity of heathland, grassland or broadleaf woodland. Woodland species such as the White Admiral will probably not drop in, but you can expect those that are widely distributed and feed from a range of plants. Long-flowering plants that appeal to butterflies include aubrieta, buddleja, candytuft, heliotrope, lavender and scabious (annual). Most butterflies appear in the summer and autumn, so concentrate on plants that flower then. The least expensive way of creating a butterfly garden is by sowing annual seeds, but you can also buy wild flower seedlings and bulbs from specialists such as John Chambers, which delivers by post.

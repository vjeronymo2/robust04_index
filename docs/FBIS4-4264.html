			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial propaganda and ideological work  conference was convened in Kunming's People's Victory Auditorium  this morning. The conference was devoted mainly to relaying and  implementing the spirit of a recently concluded national  propaganda and ideological work conference, studying a new train  of thought for the province's propaganda and ideological work,  formulating relevant propaganda and ideological work measures,  opening up new vistas for the province's reform and development,  and pressing ahead with the province's economic growth.    Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu delivered an  important speech at this morning's conference in which he  stated: Giving full scope to propaganda and ideological work has  remained one of the party's basic experiences and one of its  traditional superiorities. Now that Yunnan's reform, opening  up, and economic development have entered a new historical  period, we are confronted with a new round of strategic  transformation. Should we fail to strengthen the party's  propaganda and ideological work; enable the broad masses of the  people to comprehend and master the party's line, theories,  principles, and policies in the new historical period; and  consciously join hands with the broad masses of the people in  deepening the on-going reforms; we will find it impossible to  complete the second-round strategic transformation successfully.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: In carrying out the party's  propaganda and ideological work, we should adhere unswervingly  to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as a basic guiding principle; should  submit to and serve the overall interests of emancipating the  mind, grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding  opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability;  should subject propaganda and ideological work to these overall  interests; and should secure a correct political orientation for  propaganda and ideological work. In addition, we should make  unreserved efforts to publicize the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, as well as the overall interests  of the entire party and country, with a view to turning  spiritual strength into material strength and to pressing ahead  with reform, construction, and development.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu maintained: Arming the whole party with  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is  now a basic task of the party's ideological and theoretical  building and of its propaganda and ideological work. In order  to accomplish this basic task, in the near future the provincial  party committee should directly and successfully organize four  clases for principal leading cadres at and above the county  level to study the 'Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume  three. Various areas across the province should effectively  organize more than 0.9 million office and enterprise cadres to  study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three, and  should continue to successfully carry out annual rotational  training of grass-roots party members.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu said: An important task facing the  party's propaganda and ideological work at the moment is to  guide public opinion correctly. We should firmly grasp key  links, such as the mass media; make redoubled efforts to  correctly guide the mass media; make the mass media contribute  to continued reform, opening up, socialist spiritual  civilization, democracy, and legal system building; and make the  mass media more capable of encouraging and mobilizing people to  contribute to national prosperity, nationality solidarity, and  social stability. To this end, we should energetically further  reform in news and the mass media; strengthen news and mass  media management; keep a firm grip on the mass media; give full  scope to the principal mass media; make continued efforts to  develop modern mass media; and step up foreign-related  propaganda work.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu asserted: At present, we should orient  the party's propaganda and ideological work to training a new  generation of socialist people with lofty ideals, moral  integrity, cultural accomplishments, and sense of discipline;  step up ideological and ethical education on patriotism,  collectivism, and socialism; further prosper socialist culture;  work harder to meet the growing cultural demands of the broad  masses of people; produce more healthy, beneficial, rich,  varied, and strongly appealing spiritual products for the broad  masses of the people. The propaganda, culture, and radio and  television departments; literature and art federations; writers'  associations; and social sciences academies at all levels across  the province should meticulously organize the production of  cultural products that reflect the theme of the times so as to  enable the broad masses of the people to enjoy lots of excellent  movies; television programs; plays; and musical, dance, fine  arts, literary, and theoretical works every year.    In conclusion, Secretary Pu Chaozhu stated: Propaganda and  ideological work has remained a crucial component of party  building work. Party committees at all levels across the  province should attach great importance to and earnestly enhance  leadership over propaganda and ideological work; place  propaganda and ideological work high on the agenda; acquire a  profound understanding of the importance of propaganda and  ideological work from the high strategic plane of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and of implementing and  carrying out the party's basic line; provide this year's reforms  with ideological guarantees; and energetically promote two  civilizations in a coordinated fashion.    This morning's conference was presided over by Liang  Jinquan,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, and attended  by a number of provincial leaders, including Zhao Shumin, Li  Jiating, Zhang Baoshan, Meng Jiyao, Wang Tianxi, Bao Yongkang,  Zhao Tingguang, Li Jing, Li Linge, Qiu Chuangjiao, and others.    More than 2,000 people attended this morning's conference,  including the leaders and propaganda department directors of  autonomous prefectural, prefectural, city, and county party  committees; leaders of provincial departments, commissions,  offices, bureaus, people's organizations and leading party  groups; party committee leaders from institutions of higher  learning; leaders of enterprises party committees; and  participants in the on-going provincial higher education work  conference, provincial foreign- related propaganda work  conference, provincial cultural work conference, the eighth  provincial radio and television work conference, provincial  literary and art federation meeting, and provincial news and  publication work conference.

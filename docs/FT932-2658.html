			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (3): Agreement would help - Anthony Robinson examines the debt problem THE increasingly widespread view that the Polish economy has turned a corner and resumed a path of steady growth is making life more difficult for Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Warsaw's plenipotentiary for debt negotiations with western commercial banks. Mr Krowacki, charged with negotiating a debt reduction agreement with the 360 creditor banks represented by the London Club, is seeking a 50 per cent reduction on the Dollars 12.1bn capital and accumulated interest owed to the banks. Earlier this month the Polish government appointed Kidder Peabody, the US investment and brokerage house, to advise the Polish team. Poland is obliged to seek a debt reduction deal by the terms of its April 1991 agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors. They have agreed to write off at least 50 per cent of Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt in two tranches, provided that it followed IMF-approved policy guidelines and has sought comparable terms from its non-official creditors. But the banks, reluctant to go beyond the standard 35 per cent reductions associated with Brady-type debt restructuring agreements, and facing even more extensive debt reduction demands from Bulgaria, have been reluctant to concede the Polish case. 'I'm fighting against the misconception that because the economy is starting to grow we can pay more,' says Mr Krowacki. In the long term, higher investment, foreign capital inflows and income-raising tax reforms should raise Poland's capacity to repay debt. In future, repayment capacity will be determined essentially by balance of payments, not budgetary factors, he concedes. But for the forseeable future Poland's capacity to repay debt will remain determined by budget constraints. These are dictated by the need to finance social security and other spending and yet keep overall government outgoings within tough IMF-determined limits on the budget deficit. With support from the IMF, which recently approved a Dollars 660m standby loan, and from the World Bank and other institutions, together with higher foreign equity capital inflows, Poland's economic planners are looking forward to a decade or more of 5 per cent annual growth. 'In the long run we will repay our debts from higher growth and higher exports. But we are already committed to foreign debt repayments of about Dollars 4bn a year by the year 2005 under the terms of our Paris Club commitments. It will be very difficult to add repayments under a London Club agreement, even with a 50 per cent reduction agreement,' Mr Krowacki argues. An agreement now would remove a barrier to foreign investment in Poland, reduce Poland's country risk profile, lower borrowing costs and open the way for an influx of western banks to service international and local clients. Many of Poland's bank creditors have already written off much of their Polish debt or traded it on the secondary market where Polish paper has risen in recent weeks to about 30-31 per cent of face value. A debt agreement would therefore show up as an exceptional profit in many bank balance sheets, as Mr Krowacki would like to buy back between 25-30 per cent of Polish debt for cash, and various options for the remainder. 'I believe 1993 offers a window of opportunity for a mutually beneficial settlement which I hope to reach this summer. I'm glad to see that some banks agree with me. Both sides have grasped the situation and that is why we are talking to each other,' Mr Krowacki adds.</p>

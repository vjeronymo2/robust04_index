			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Leading Article: FW's Rubicon PRESIDENT FW de Klerk's speech last night may well prove to be as momentous as his landmark address in February 1990. On that historic occasion, he set the stage for the release of Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, and Mr de Klerk's subsequent partner in South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy. Some 2 1/2 years later, it seems that the partner has become the adversary. Over the past few days, both sides have thrown down the gauntlet: the ANC when it launched a mass action campaign designed to force Mr de Klerk to concede in the streets what he will not concede at the conference table. Last night, it was Mr de Klerk's turn. He understandably rejected an ANC takeover by street power, but failed to recognise that, wherever the blame lies, his government has within its means the capacity to tackle the violence that scars South Africa. The old battle for power is rejoined and, unless both sides step back, only a pyrrhic victory can be the outcome. It may now be too late for the two sides to come together to talk. The point has perhaps been reached where South Africans need to be saved from themselves. The offer of mediation made by the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, should be picked up.</p>

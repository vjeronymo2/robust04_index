			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Australian SE to set up Asian board The Australian Stock Exchange is keen to set up an 'Asian board' of perhaps two dozen Asian-based stocks, which could form a recognisable sub-sector of the Australian stock market. According to ASX officials, this could become a reality in as little as 12 months, although the initial number of stocks might be half the targeted sum. In the medium term, an ASX 'Asian index' based on these stocks, and even some derivative products, could be feasible extensions. Mr Ray Schoer, head of operations in the ASX's companies department, says the exchange is currently talking to some 20 Asian companies about listings. Assuming no sudden dive in share prices, perhaps half of these could join the market this year. Such companies, he carefully stresses, are not just casual inquirers. Nor are they interested in a secondary listing. In all cases, the Australian market would be the place where the bulk of the trading in their shares would be conducted. According to the ASX, the geographical spread within this group of potential market newcomers is fairly wide, although Guangdong province in southern China dominates. Of the 20-odd interested candidates, 15 come from China, including 11 from Guangdong. One emanates from Singapore; two from Papua New Guinea; one from Malaysia; and two from Korea. The business activities involved range from manufacturing to finance. The list includes one bank. Why should any Asian company choose to have its shares traded in Australia? Melbourne-based Sino Securities, which handled the first China listing on the ASX last year, has two explanations. The first is to raise new capital, and attract a 'diverse book' of shareholders in the process. The second is to acquire the 'status' of a Western quote. In both regards, Australia has something to offer. It houses a sizeable Western investment community, and a fund management industry which has grown significantly as private pension money has surged. Yet it also sits within the Asian time zone and has an expanding Asian population. The ASX is also fairly accessible to Western investors. It only came into existence when the state exchanges merged in 1987. It lagged badly in terms of transfer and settlement systems, but, having updated these and introduced a Flexible Accelerated Security Transfer process offering investors a statement of shareholdings rather than certificates, it can fairly claim to be user-friendly, especially for non-locals. The downside is that it lacks the clout and kudos of a market like New York. Companies seeking large funds for expansion, for example, would not find Australia very suitable. The nation seems capable of ploughing only some ADollars 20bn (USDollars 14.3bn) of new money into the stock market annually. 'The total market capitalisation of the first dozen entrants might be around ADollars 500m,' says Mr Schoer. If expectations are realised, the Asian influx will mean a significant change to the ASX's profile. At present, the market houses just 50 overseas stocks, out of a total of 1,155 companies, most of which emanate from other English-speaking nations. Business in a few shares, such as Hong Kong's Dairy Farm, is brisk. But for many of the US and UK multinationals, these listings are largely cosmetic.</p>

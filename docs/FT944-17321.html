			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Hurry for a quick fix Fixed-rate mortgages have been rising this year as the cost of borrowing on the wholesale money markets has risen. But while a good number of fixed rates remain available, Ian Darby, of mortgage-broker John Charcol, believes they will disappear quickly. 'There is still a lot of old money in the markets, but new money priced on the post-base rate rise is more expensive,' he says. 'I don't think the old money will be around for more than another week.' Five-year fixed rates of 6.99 per cent, available at the beginning of the year, have given way to very resistable new offers. The latest, launched this week, includes a three-year fixed rate of 9.5 per cent from Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester; a four-year fix from Woolwich of 9.49 per cent; and a 4 1/2  year fix (to February 28 1999) from Barclays bank at 9.75 per cent. The table shows some of the better rates available, including five-year fixes of 8.15 per cent from the Britannia and Lambeth building societies. But you need deposits of 40 or 25 per cent respectively. As long-term money becomes expensive, the choice for borrowers is likely to be between a shorter-term fixed rate or a discounted variable rate. Since interest levels are now on the way up, taking a short-term fix means you can be relatively sure you will not be undercut by lower mortgage rates. The standard variable rate is now just over 8 per cent so the two-year, 4.95 per cent fix from Charcol looks attractive. Always check that the fees on a fixed rate are not too high and try to avoid mortgages tied to compulsory insurance - you could well find cheaper insurance elsewhere. Check, too, that the mortgage still applies if you move house within the fixed rate period, since you do not want to have to pay the early redemption penalties which are always attached to fixed-rate mortgages. Lenders have been trying to wean borrowers off fixes and on to their variable rates by offering discounts and cashback offers. Discounts tend to represent better value - the lender reduces its variable rate for a specified period by a set proportion. The table shows that Northern Rock is offering a 5.25 percentage point reduction until the beginning of 1996. Since its variable rate is 8.15 per cent, borrowers will have to pay a mortgage rate of only 2.89 per cent until then (or 5.25 points lower than the society's variable rate if it changes). 'Lenders are waging a discount war,' says Darby. 'If you want a variable rate, then a discount is very good value. But if you are on a five-point discount for a year, and base rates increase again, you could find yourself moving from 3 per cent to 9 per cent in the space of a month.' If you want to avoid that kind of shock but still want a discounted rate, Alliance &amp; Leicester is offering a smaller discount of 1.6 percentage point spread over three years. An alternative is to accept a cashback offer instead of a discount. Royal Bank of Scotland has just launched an extremely competitive variant on the standard cashback offer of 'take out a mortgage with us and we will give you Pounds Pounds Pounds cash up-front'. Borrowers will receive from the bank the equivalent of their first regular monthly payment (to a maximum of Pounds 1,000) every year during the life of the mortgage. The mortgage is available on repayments as well as interest-only mortgages backed by an endowment, personal equity plan or pension. The early redemption penalty is one month's interest in the first three years. Remember, however, that the cashback could be taxable.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  BEST MORTGAGE BUYS: FIXED AND DISCOUNT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lender                      Rate % (APR)      Fix until     Max adv.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Rock                5.49 (5.6)        1/6/96         95% John Charcol                 4.95 (5.1)        1/7/96         95% National Counties            7.25 (7.7)       1/10/97         90% Britannia                    8.15 (9.0)        1/9/99         60% Lambeth                      8.15 (9.4)        1/9/99         75%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCOUNT RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lender                      Rate % (APR)        Max adv.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Rock                8.14 (8.4)            90% Northern Rock                8.14 (8.4)            90% Bank of Ireland              8.05 (8.4)            90% Principality                 8.14 (8.5)            75% Alliance &amp; Leicester         8.10 (8.5)            95%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST TIME BUYERS: FIXED AND DISCOUNT RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lender                      Rate % (APR)        Max adv.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National &amp; Provincial        1.75 (1.8)            90% Yorkshire                    1.90 (2.1)            95% Northern Rock                8.14 (8.3)            90% Greenwich                    8.10 (8.7)            95% Alliance &amp; Leicester         8.10 (8.5)            95%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lender                                  Fee/RP     Comp b/c?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Rock                  Pounds 250/4mts          Yes John Charcol                    Pounds295/3mts           No National Counties              Pounds 275/3mts           No Britannia                      Pounds 275/6mts          Yes Lambeth                        Pounds 250/6mts          Yes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCOUNT RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lender                           Discount until      Comp b/c?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Rock                2% to 1/1/98 =6.14%        Yes Northern Rock              5.25% to 1/1/96=2.89%        Yes Bank of Ireland            5.1% to 1/11/95=2.95%         No Principality               5.14% to 1/11/95=3.0%        Yes Alliance &amp; Leicester         1.6% for 3 yrs=6.5%         No  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST TIME BUYERS: FIXED AND DISCOUNT RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lender                           Discount until      Comp b/c?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National &amp; Provincial           Fixed to 1/8/95          No Yorkshire                       Fixed to 1/8/95         Yes Northern Rock              5.25% to 1/1/96=2.89%        Yes Greenwich                     4.7% for 1 yr=3.4%       None Alliance &amp; Leicester         1.6% for 3 yrs=6.5          No  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: John Charcol  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            TOP ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- An annuity provides guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum investment.

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREAT OF SNOW COSTS ABBOTT A START  </P> <P> Be it Angel run production or the weather, rookie pitcher Jim Abbott continues  to be undermined by the things he can't control.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Abbott's third major league start was put on hold when the threat of  snow forced the postponement of the game against the Chicago White Sox at  Comiskey Park.  </P> <P> Abbott, who had been scheduled to pitch against Chicago's Bill Long, will skip  a turn, meaning his next start should be next Monday night at Anaheim Stadium  against the Baltimore Orioles. Rather than push his entire rotation back a day,  Angel Manager Doug Rader decided to bump Abbott, 0-2, and keep No. 1 starter  Mike Witt, 1-2, on schedule to pitch tonight.  </P> <P> Witt will now oppose Long, 1-1.  </P> <P> With the Angel pitching staff on a surprising roll -- two consecutive shutouts  and a 2.66 team earned-run average -- Rader was reluctant to tamper with the  alignment of his top four starters. And with Abbott still searching for his  first run's worth of support -- he has been on the wrong ends of 7-0 and 5-0  scores -- the cold climes of Chicago are not exactly conducive to major  offense.  </P> <P> Thus, Abbott will wait for warmer temperatures -- and the often accommodating  Orioles -- to bid for his first victory.  </P> <P> Tuesday's game has been rescheduled for Thursday, Sept. 14, the next time the  Angels visit Chicago.  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield, sidelined with a strained right chest muscle, was  re-examined Tuesday by Dr. Lewis Yocum, who reported that Schofield had made  "some improvement, but was still not ready."  </P> <P> According to Yocum, Schofield continues to feel discomfort when extending his  right arm.  </P> <P> "He still needs more time," Yocum said.  </P> <P> Schofield hasn't played since last Tuesday.  </P></p>

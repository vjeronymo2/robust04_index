			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Taiwanese airline gains funding to buy aircraft TAIWAN'S central bank has agreed to provide USDollars 790m to help fund purchases of aircraft by EVA Airways, the island's second international airline, Reuter reports from Taipei. A central bank official said the loan was the largest made from Dollars 10bn of foreign currency reserves which the bank set aside in February to finance major economic projects and overseas investment by local companies. The Dollars 790m will be lent to a consortium of 15 local banks, headed by state-owned Chiao Tung Bank, which agreed to a 12-year loan of USDollars 1.05bn to EVA earlier this year. EVA, set up last July by the Evergreen Group, the container shipping operator, will use the loan to buy four Boeing 767s, eight Boeing 747s and six McDonnell Douglas MD-11s that it has already ordered. All are to be delivered by 1995. The airline flies five jets to eight destinations, most in south-east Asia. It will start flying to the US at the end of the year and hopes to start flights to Vietnam and Australia.</p>

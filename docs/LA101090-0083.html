			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARBECUE CURBS: NO NEED TO FUME YET;  </P> <P> CONSUMERS: A BAN ON CHARCOAL LIGHTER FLUID OR PRE-SOAKED BRIQUETTES WON'T TAKE  EFFECT UNTIL 1992. IN THE MEANTIME, MANY ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE WHEN FIRING  UP THE GRILL.  </P> <P> Take heart, beach and back-yard barbecuers. There's hope for starting the  barby, even without charcoal lighter fluid or pre-soaked briquettes, both of  which will be banned in the Los Angeles Basin beginning in 1992.  </P> <P> And you may find you like the taste of the food better, too.  </P> <P> Alternative products -- wax-treated chips and cubes of wood or sawdust, wood  with natural resins, chimney or electric starters, nontoxic starting gel -- are  available on the market now. So are different kinds of wood -- mesquite,  hickory, alder, maple, orange, pear, cherry and apple -- to add different  flavors.  </P> <P> The latest flap for the $500-million-a-year charcoal briquette industry came  last week when the South Coast Air Quality Management District voted to  prohibit the sale of charcoal lighter and fluid-saturated briquettes in Los  Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, on Jan. 1, 1992, in an  effort to reduce smog levels.  </P> <P> Although AQMD officials admitted that the elimination of lighter fluid to start  fires will cut less than two-tenths of 1% of the pollution in the basin, this  is the first time they have taken on consumer products in the war on air  pollution.  </P> <P> AQMD officials say that residents of the four-county area use about 2,700  gallons of lighter fluid a day to ignite barbecue fires, emitting an average of  two tons of pollutants into the air (lighter fluid is made from 100% petroleum  compounds, the main smog component).  </P> <P> For their part, the industry-estimated 2 million barbecuers affected by the  impending ban seemed to take the news in stride, probably because it doesn't  begin for 1 1/2 years. In a spot check of groceries, barbecue shops and home  center stores, none reported a rush on charcoal lighter fluid. A few did  receive inquiries about alternative starting methods for barbecue cooking.  </P> <P> Barbecue industry representatives, though, were not so complacent.  </P> <P> "If I were an inventor, I'd be looking at Los Angeles," said Sandra Burton,  executive director of the Barbecue Industry Assn. in Naperville, Ill., which  represents manufacturers and suppliers of barbecue products. "We never knew  (lighter fluid emission) was a problem. We know that pollution is bad (in  Southern California) -- we're not arguing that point. We just would have liked  to have had a little more time to reformulate the products so they will meet  the standards."  </P> <P> Industry representatives are gearing up to find new formulas for non-polluting  liquid starters. "There's already a prototype product, a reformulation, that  reduced emissions by 50%," Burton said. "If there's a way to make them useable,  then we're going to do it."  </P> <P> Burton said two-thirds of Americans who barbecue prefer to use charcoal lighter  fluid.  </P> <P> Oakland-based Kingsford Products Co., which sells the majority of charcoal used  in the U.S., found through sales data studies that 65% of Los Angeles  barbecuers use lighter fluid to start their fires.  </P> <P> Kingsford, a division of Clorox Co., manufactures regular charcoal, pre-soaked  briquettes, pre-treated individual bags and charcoal lighter fluid starter.  </P> <P> "We're hopeful we'll be able to come up with something that meets the (AQMD)  standards," said Kingsford spokeswoman Sandy Sullivan. "We're primarily looking  at liquids. The paraffin and wax products have been around a long time . . . .  We're working with the AQMD technical team on developing a methodology for  testing (liquid starter), so it can become environmentally acceptable."  </P> <P> However, Burton and Sullivan warn consumers not to use gasoline to ignite fires  because it is dangerously flammable.  </P> <P> An independent market research study, commissioned by Kingsford in May, showed  that 4 1/2% of those surveyed would opt for gasoline if charcoal starter were  banned. "We didn't expect it to be that high," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Under the new AQMD regulations, consumers will not be fined for using charcoal  lighter fluid or pre-treated briquettes in 1992, but stores will be prohibited  from selling it -- if the liquid emits more than 0.02 pounds of pollutants each  time it is used. Retailers who do sell the prohibited barbecue products can be  assessed fines of up to $25,000 per day.  </P> <P> Propane and natural gas-fueled grills already comply with the new AQMD  standards, as do electric starters and metal chimneys that use paper for  starting charcoal fires. So do many wax-coated fire chips and nontoxic starter  gels.  </P> <P> Consumers seem to be favoring the more natural products, wood and  paraffin-coated charcoal, rather than chemicals, according to Mike Varley,  vice-president of the Australian-headquartered Galore Group, which operates 13  Barbeques Galore stores in California.  </P> <P> "There's been a very big swing in the last few years toward alternative  products and gas barbecues," Varley said. "The propane gas or the natural gas  (grills) cost more money to begin with, but far less in the long run." Gas  grills, he explained, can run from about $79 to $1,200.  </P> <P> Among the alternative products are Happy Jack, a single-use bag of mesquite and  oak wood charcoal coated with wax; Fire Flakes, wax-coated wood chips; Fat Wood  and Fire Light Sticks with natural resins; Seymour Fire Blox, nontoxic  fiberboard impregnated with wax.  </P> <P> Gelron Corp. (formerly Jiffy Products) in Lisle, Ill., manufactures Enviro-Fuel  Gel Fuel and Hawaiian Fire Ring, an odorless, alcohol-based gel that is put in  a metal ring and placed under the bottom grate of a barbecue.  </P> <P> In addition to limiting pollutants from back-yard barbecuing, the AQMD also is  looking into ways to measure -- and restrict -- restaurant emissions.  </P> <P> The AQMD would like to reduce restaurant emissions by 90%, but it does not have  a protocol for measuring pollutants emitted by restaurants, whether restaurants  emit one or 50 pounds of pollutants a day, according to Robert W. Small Ph.D.,  director of the Center for Hospitality Management at Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District's charcoal lighter sales ban is  the first district effort to target a consumer product to try to clean up the  Los Angeles Basin's air. The AQMD board, formed in February, 1977,  traditionally has regulated such operations as factories and oil refineries to  reduce air pollution. But as part of a sweeping plan approved March 17, 1989,  it now is aiming at industrial, commercial, agriculture, government and  consumer products.  </P></p>

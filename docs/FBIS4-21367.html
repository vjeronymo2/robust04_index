			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Calvo Sans: "Prioritizing Environmental </F> Legislation"]    [Text] With the elections for convention delegates  approaching, there is speculation in the environmental community  about how the issue of the environment will be dealt with in the  new Constitution. At least for now, apart from official  statements, this concern is not getting any answers from  politicians.    The law requiring a partial reform of the National  Constitution (24.309), resulting from the Menem-Alfonsin accord,  leaves the issue open, but no agreements have been reached about  addressing it.    Given the present paralysis on the hazardous wastes law  because of the refusal by some provinces to adhere to a  standardized legal system covering the entire nation, nobody in  the political arena dares think that the "federal plan" may be  incompatible with this new situation. The statement has been  heard that "it is politically unworkable to demand that the  provinces turn over control of the environment to the national  government."    In recent statements, criminal law expert Miguel Angel  Aguilera has emphasized the need to "prioritize the  environmental system by granting it adequate protection in our  Constitution" and by criminalizing actions detrimental to the  environment. He described environmental crimes as "white collar"  crimes.    The legal specialist said that "with the exception of some  types of water pollution (which is, par excellence, the old  environmental crime), in general Latin American criminal codes  lack provisions designed to protect the environment."    Earlier Aguilera had said that "Argentine society, acting  through its institutions and nonprofit foundations or  organizations, has expressed its concern." He then urged members  of Congress to respond to this concern by enacting legislation.    As the constitutional reform approaches, Aguilera cited the  examples of Panama and Spain. Their constitutions speak of the  "state's fundamental duty to ensure that the population lives in  a healthy environment free of pollutants, where the air, water,  and foods fulfill the requirements for the adequate pursuit of  human life."    Aguilera's statements reflect a "principle-based" concern  that is common in the environmental community. But some analysts  want our new Constitution to contain more than just a formal  statement.    Although later laws will actually enact regulations and  implement the principles defined in the Constitution, the new  "Magna Carta" should be explicit in one aspect: it should not  contain any elements that might become obstacles to  environmental protection.    As an example: the rigid federalism of our present  Constitution has become an insurmountable obstacle, blocking  adequate legislation on the management of "hazardous wastes,"  something which is absolutely essential from this time forward.</p>

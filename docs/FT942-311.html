			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (2): An odd fascination - Business A-Z / Tony Jackson cannot resist 'the anthology syndrome' Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Business Leaders By David Jeremy and Geoffrey Tweedale Bowker-Saur, Pounds 35 250 pages British culture, we are sometimes told, still has a snobbish distaste for business and commerce. Forget the supposed transformations of the Thatcher years: look at an establishment bible such as Who's Who - jam-packed with obscure bureaucrats, academics and politicians, and scarcely an entrepreneur among them. As a general proposition, this may be getting out of date. But there is certainly enough of the old bias left to justify a book such as the Dictionary of Twentieth Century Business Leaders, which seeks to encapsulate the lives and achievements of about 750 tycoons in the space of 250 pages. The big question about any such publication, of course, is who it includes and who it leaves out. For the reviewer, this is bound to bring on what might be called 'the anthology syndrome' - that is, the urge to pick through the book in search of favourites, and quarrel with the results. So here goes. In the media world, Cecil King of the Mirror gets in, as does Lord Hartwell of the Telegraph: but not the great white shark, Rupert Murdoch, arguably the most powerful media mogul of the century. Among the ranks of the crooked, Robert Maxwell has a distinguished mention. But one looks in vain for his kindred spirit, the financier and MP Horatio Bottomley (twice bankrupt, twice acquitted of fraud and finally jailed in the 1920s). Some of the inclusions seem positively quirky: John Hyde Christie (1836-1926), founder of the long-defunct Scottish dye firm, the United Turkey Red Company, or the coal-owner James Arthur Joicey (1880-1940), whose only obvious claim to fame is the fact that he was found dead in the grounds of his castle after a rabbit shoot. Contrast these with some of the more stark omissions, such as Jules Thorn (1899-1980), founder of the Thorn electrical business, or Lord Keith (1916-) who, besides being chairman of Rolls-Royce and Hill Samuel, managed the remarkable feat of firing the chairmen of both STC and Beecham in the space of three months in 1985. But the book has the odd fascination of its kind. I found myself browsing through the entries under the letter S, and counting how many I had heard of. The answer was fewer than half: but I consoled myself with the reflection that of the remainder, all but six were born in the last century, and would have retired before I left school. The book is thus largely historical in tone. This raises the question of how illuminating that history proves. It is diverting to read of John Percival Savage (1895-1970), who ran Boots in the 1950s: his reign, say the authors, 'proved to be an interregnum between more dynamic leaders. Uneasy in command, his insecurity induced him to shout and swear at subordinates who despised or feared him'. But if the dictionary is imperfect, it is nevertheless a worthwhile addition to the sum of knowledge. Who's Who, for instance, contains 37 people called Matthews. It leaves out the one best known to the British public, the turkey breeder Bernard Matthews. Who's Who does, however, include Lord Matthews, late of Trafalgar House. Other business peers it includes are Lord Stevens of Express Newspapers and Lord Hollick of MAI. None of these is in the Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Business Leaders, but Bernard Matthews is. From an establishment viewpoint, this might seem perverse. But in a sneaking anti-establishment way, one gets the point.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT ALONG THE WAY  </P> <P> Many events will supplement the L.A. Marathon activity this weekend. In  addition to participation in the marathon by a celebrity running team (all in  support of charities), there will be community entertainment along the route,  and stereo equipment installed at 10 locations will provide music to inspire  the runners and spectators.  </P> <P> KCOP-TV Channel 13 will provide live national television coverage, including  activities at the start-finish location on Figueroa Street, north of the Los  Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Activities at that location will be in full swing  from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with music, dance and food booths.  </P> <P> For some, the festivities get under way today in Beverly Hills, where an  International Breakfast Run gets moving at 8 a.m. Entering the event are  runners from around the world who have arrived to participate in Sunday's  marathon. Flags of 50 countries will be carried through the streets of Beverly  Hills, beginning and ending at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly  Drive.  </P> <P> Tonight, from 6:30 to 9:30, Westside Pavilion is the site for a "Carbo-Load"  party. Competitors in the marathon will be there to stock up on carbohydrates:  One thousand pounds of pasta have been ordered to feed from 3,500-5,000 hungry  runners and their families. Entertainers include Olivia Newton-John, comic Paul  Rodriguez, the Raiderettes and various musical groups. Tickets, at $10 each,  can be purchased today at the L.A. Marathon Health &amp; Fitness Expo at the  Airport Hilton Hotel, or at the door if available.  </P> <P> Closer to home (for many) will be 10 entertainment centers positioned about  every 2 miles along the marathon route on Sunday. The diverse cultural sights  and sounds of Los Angeles neighborhoods will be featured.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: PINIELLA INTERESTED IN REDS, BUT IT'S UP TO GEORGE  </P> <P> Lou Piniella says he is interested in becoming the Cincinnati Reds' manager --  if New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner will let him.  </P> <P> Piniella managed the Yankees in 1986, 1987 and part of the 1988 season and is  under contract to the Yankees as a special adviser to Steinbrenner at a  reported salary of $400,000 for the next two years.  </P> <P> "Sure, I would like to have that job -- definitely," Piniella said. "That's a  good ballclub. But a few things would have to fall into place."  </P> <P> During this past season, Steinbrenner effectively blocked the Toronto Blue Jays  from talking with Piniella by asking for player compensation.  </P> <P> "This might be a different situation in that it is a National League team,"  Piniella said. "But, honestly, I don't know how George would react."  </P> <P> The Reds refused to say whether they are pursuing Piniella as a candidate,  although they've mentioned almost everyone else who is available.  </P> <P> WHIO-AM radio in Dayton reported Monday evening that Piniella was in Dayton on  Monday to talk with Reds' officials, and that he was offered the managing job  during the visit.  </P> <P> Reds spokesman Joe Braude, contacted after the report was aired, said the team  had no comment about it. "I don't know anything about anybody visiting," he  said.  </P> <P> Reds General Manager Bob Quinn said he interviewed Reds' interim manager Tommy  Helms, planned to interview at least two more candidates and considers former  Houston Manager Hal Lanier and ex-Cleveland Managers Pat Corrales and Doc  Edwards to be among candidates.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Kwik Save expands with Shoprite buy Kwik Save is consolidating its position as Britain's leading discount grocer by purchasing 117 of Shoprite group's stores in Scotland and northern England for Pounds 45.4m in cash. Under the terms of the deal Kwik Save - which yesterday announced a 7.5 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 135.6m - will acquire assets with a book value in October 1993 of Pounds 59.6m. The deal signals the end of the rapid rise and fall of Shoprite in mainland Britain, after it expanded away from its roots as a supermarket, property and motor retailing group in the Isle of Man in 1990. It is a blow to Mr Deryck Nicholson, Shoprite's chairman, who, ironically, is the son of one of Kwik Save's co-founders. The acquisition would give Kwik Save almost 10 per cent of the Scottish grocery market - which it has been trying to break into for 18 months, but where it has only six stores after experiencing difficulties finding sites. Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive, acknowledged the acquisition might cause 'some short-term pain' - it will dilute earnings slightly this year - but believed sales could quickly be boosted by converting Shoprite stores into Kwik Saves. Shoprite is the first failure among the discount chains that have expanded rapidly in the UK during in the 1990s. Its shares were best performers in the food retailing sector last year, peaking at 241p last February. They fell 1p to 21p yesterday. Kwik Save shares gained 15p at 551p. Shoprite has issued two profits warnings in four months and has been working closely with its bankers since July. Analysts believe it expanded too quickly, paying too much for sometimes substandard sites. Mr Charles Good, managing director of Scottish operations, denied the deal was a distress sale, but acknowledged that with no sign of improvement in the market 'to try and soldier on would have been catastrophic'. Shoprite's directors warned that if the disposal is not completed, 'the group is unlikely to be able to trade out of its financial difficulties'. Shoprite proposes to use the deal's proceeds to repay borrowings, and refocus on its remaining eight supermarkets and other operations in the Isle of Man. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 19</p>

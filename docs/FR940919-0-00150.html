			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is aware of 10 actions in the last 2 years in the Sacramento Valley, including agricultural conversion and urban development, that have resulted in the damage or destruction of as many as 17 hectares (43 acres) of vernal pools, exclusive of associated watersheds, that likely provided habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Dan Strait, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pers. comm., 1993). Some of these activities were undertaken without authority under the Clean Water Act. At least one of these parties likely intended to alter the elevations of the site to eliminate one or more of the parameters used by the Corps to define a wetland according to their 1987 jurisdictional manual. Other similar deliberate activities that are damaging or destroying vernal pools are likely occurring throughout the Central Valley (D. Strait, pers. comm., 1993). The Service is concerned that unless a final rule for the four species is issued and effective immediately upon publication, this may result in landowners knowingly destroying the habitat of these animals. Previously, this has occurred with other endangered species that inhabit vernal pools in the Santa Rosa area of Sonoma County (C. D. Nagano and J. C. Knight, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. obs., 1992). Because of the immediate threat posed by these on-going activities, the Service finds that good cause exists for this rule to take effect immediately upon publication in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Not known to be applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or predation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are a food item in the diet of migratory waterfowl and other native animals (Krapu 1974; Swanson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1974; J. King, pers. comm., 1992). However, this naturally occurring predation is not considered a threat to the continued existence of these crustaceans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Introduction of the bullfrog ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rana catesbeiana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to areas inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp appears to increase the threat of predation facing this crustacean. These amphibians are voracious predators on many species of native and exotic animals. Large numbers of vernal pool tadpole shrimp were found in stomach content analysis of bullfrogs captured in vernal pools in the Chico area (Marc Hayes, Oregon State University, pers. comm., 1993; Robert Fisher, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Although bullfrogs are unable to establish permanent breeding populations in vernal pools, dispersing immature males take up residence in these areas during the rainy season (Mark Jennings, U.S. National Biological Survey, pers. comm. to Peter Sorensen, 1994). A number of bullfrogs were observed at Jepson Prairie during the winter of 1992/1993 (C. Nagano, pers. obs. 1992/93). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vernal pool tadpole shrimp were found to have been parasitized by flukes (Trematoda) of an undetermined species at the Vina Plains, Tehama County (Ahl 1991). The gonads of both sexes were greatly reduced in size and their body cavities were filled with many young flukes (metacercariae). Ahl concluded that parasitic castration was the major limiting factor affecting reproduction of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp at the Vina Plains. The range and extent of this parasite is unknown. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are no known diseases affecting the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The primary cause for the decline of these species is loss of habitat from human activities. State and local laws and regulations have not been passed to protect the four species included in this final rule. Other regulatory mechanisms necessary for the conservation of vernal pools have proven inadequate and ineffective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental review process under the California Environmental Quality Act for projects that result in loss of habitats that support these animals sometimes requires development and implementation of mitigation plans. However, the effectiveness of this statute in protecting vernal pool habitat has not been consistent. As documented above, fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp habitat typically has been eliminated without offsetting mitigation measures. Most mitigation plans that have been required were designed specifically for vernal pool plants. The artificial creation of vernal pools as compensatory mitigation has not been proven scientifically to be successful (Ferren and Gevirtz 1990; Zedler and Black 1988; J. King,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992; M.

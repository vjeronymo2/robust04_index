			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Minister's yen to end recession JAPANESE people reached for their calculators yesterday after Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, announced that knocking noughts off the yen would lead the country out of 'recession'. A redenomination, he argued, would revive the economy by stimulating demand for new vending machines - of which there are some 5m in Japan - and paper. The Bank of Japan was not amused and the Finance Ministry was embarrassed. Past calls for a redenomination have been inspired more by pride than fiscal policy. Many Japanese believe Y1.27 to the dollar sounds better than the present rate of about Y127. Instead of just yen, according to Mr Watanabe's plan, there would be yen, sen and rin, with 100 sen to the yen, and 10 rin to the sen. A similar system existed before the Second World War. Older Japanese people believe that a return to the yen and sen would be a symbol of the country's successful rise from the ashes. The word 'sen' is still sometimes used to denote fractions of a yen, but the smallest denomination now is the flimsy one yen coin. Mr Watanabe is also deputy prime minister, a faction head of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and the next in line for a stint as prime minister. He has a reputation as a straight talker, although this has led to public apologies for insults to Americans, Chinese and Brazilians in recent years. In a public address, Mr Watanabe said redenomination should come as soon as possible. It would revive the economy by creating new demand for a range of currency-linked products, including accounting materials, vending machines, paper and computers, he said. Finance Ministry officials said revising the currency system would make no real difference to the economy. An ailing Tokyo stock market drew some encouragement from the idea but the paper industry was the only sector to report an increase in stock prices. A surprised Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, insisted that the central bank was not considering a redenomination. He opposed the idea because the costs would outweigh the benefits. He also cast doubt on another of Mr Watanabe's statements, the suggestion that Japan's economic conditions are 'similar' to those of the Great Depression. The country is officially expecting 3.7 per cent growth this fiscal year, and 3.5 per cent next year. Editorial comment, Page 18 World stocks, Page 39</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 31 January (MTI) -- The ruling Party of  Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) holds the view that  sober-minded forces in Romania and Hungary may succeed in  normalizing bilateral relations in the soonest possible time,  including the conclusion of a basic treaty.    This is contained in the message PDSR Chairman Oliviu  Gherman  has sent to the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). The message  was handed over to MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn by a delegation led  by Romanian Ambassador Ion Donca today [31 January]. Horn told  MTI that the message was a reaction to former MSZP statements on  Hungary's relations with its neighbours.    Signed by Gherman, the message stresses that the PDSR met  with a great deal of satisfaction the Hungarian socialists'  position calling for a historical reconciliation between Hungary  and its neighbours, including Romania.    In Gherman's view, this reconciliation should be confirmed  by  a basic treaty, which would recognize the current borders and,  on the basis of international norms, contain mutual commitments  to guaranteeing minority rights.    The settlement and development of relations would promote  the  two countries' integration into the Euro-Atlantic system and  facilitate their democratic transformation, runs the message.    In reply to it, Horn confirmed that the MSZP was pressing  for  Budapest and Bucharest to conclude a basic treaty, declaring  both the inviolability of borders and the full enforcement of  ethnic minority rights.    In the MSZP's view, Hungary and Romania are interdependent  as  far as their relationship with European integration  organizations is concerned. Thus they should not act against  one another, on the contrary, they should make every possible  joint effort to enforce their interests in this field.</p>

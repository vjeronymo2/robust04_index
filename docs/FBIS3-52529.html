			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The official announcement on the resumption of  Israeli-PLO talks has just been issued in Jerusalem and Tunis.  The statement was made simultaneously by Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, head of the Israeli Liaison Committee, and  Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], head of the Palestinian delegation.    Following is the text of the announcement:    The two sides reaffirm their total commitment to the letter  and spirit of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. They believe  that the talks in Norway, Versailles, and Cairo will help to  achieve an agreement that will quickly turn the DOP into a new  reality on the ground. Once an agreement is reached, it will  be impossible to change it unilaterally. The two sides have  agreed to resume the Taba negotiations on the basis of the DOP  and the understandings reached in Cairo.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0730 GMT on 6 January adds  that "the talks will resume on 10 January. Sources in Jerusalem  expressed their satisfaction with the compromise formulated by  Peres and Nabil Sha'th"]</p>

The president of the Chamber of Deputies has stood in  favor of the office presided over by Firmin Jean-Louis. Frantz  Robert Monde, who leads the debates in the Lower Chamber, has  called the senators to their senses. While reminding them that  the deputies are willing to work for a solution to the political  crisis, Frantz Robert Monde invited the senators to join the  deputies in their position. Frantz Robert Monde is interviewed  by Edner Jean:    [Begin recording] [Monde] The deputies have risen above it.  If a solution is still being blocked, the fault does not lie  with the deputies who knew how to rise to the aspirations,  expectations, of trust vested in them by the people. Despite  divergences in political and ideological opinion, the deputies  found a common denominator for the interest of the nation and  voted strategies for alleviation of the crisis. [In Creole] It  is an opportunity for me to thank the great men of this Chamber  of Deputies, while calling on the wisdom of the senators so they  can understand [back to French] that the others, those who are  before us, have every interest in widening the gulf within our  institutions to prove that we Haitians cannot do well. There  is one office, plus a group of dissident senators.    [Jean] Which office is that?    [Monde] The office of Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis. I received a  letter from Ebrane Cadet, who is the first secretary of both  offices -- he is the only winner. He is first secretary in  Jean-Louis' office, and first secretary of my colleague, Sen.  Bernard Sansaricq, with whom I have some deep geographical ties  and a certain similar political view.    I do not think it is up to the president to take a stand on  this matter, but rather it is up to the assembly, despite the  fact that I represent the majority in this chamber. I think that  the 18 January senators have a chance with their plan, which  provides for a prime minister not from Aristide's ranks, who  will be a more-or-less neutral prime minister. We will not find  him. [as heard] However, he will have influence on the  arbitration committee. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Conservatives fearful of a future without Heseltine: Alison Smith on how the party might cope if it lost its most prominent 'left-winger' THE DISMAY of shocked Tory MPs goes beyond the fact that for some weeks one of the cabinet's most formidable operators will not inevitably be there to handle the latest piece of political bad news. What, ask some of them, if the trade and industry secretary decided to resign? His departure would give Mr John Major difficulties well beyond even those of losing a senior colleague and key adviser. Any further cabinet re-shuffle would inevitably cause tensions, coming so soon after the one which was supposed to last until next summer, and which itself left a sour aftermath. The feeling of instability would be heightened by the widespread expectation at Westminster, that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is likely to want to leave the cabinet before the next election. With Tory party infighting continually breaking into the open, the prime minister's task in re-balancing his cabinet would be particularly sensitive. The right might well see the opportunity to break the 'stranglehold' by the left of the party on the three economic departments: the Treasury under Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr David Hunt at the department of employment, and Mr Heseltine at the DTI. But the prime minister's attempts to win over manufacturing industry would suffer if there were a different brand of politics at the head of the DTI. Mr Heseltine's re-organisation and reforms would have no certainty of survival under a right-wing minister, and the DTI's increasingly influential voice within government, would be a casualty of any less powerful minister. Beyond Whitehall, Mr Heseltine's departure would leave a political vacuum. Although there are signs of economic recovery - and Mr Clarke's move to the Treasury means that the Tories are better-placed to make the most of them - many MPs still feel battered by recent events. Losing the trade secretary's rare ability to launch such effective attacks on the opposition that even divisions among Conservative backbenchers temporarily fade into the background would be deeply demoralising. The government would also be left woefully short of experienced heavyweights, intensifying pressure on Mr Major to appoint a senior 'minder' or adviser to fill the role Lord Whitelaw carried out during the Thatcher administration. Mr Heseltine's reputation was tarnished by the fiasco over the pits closure programme, but is still deeply trusted by the prime minister. The coal debacle effectively finished his prospects of ever becoming party leader, leaving him as someone whose loyalty to Mr Major could not be doubted even by his critics. That quality, coupled with his sheer political longevity, makes Mr Heseltine a figure who could not be replaced at a moment's notice.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Management: Rewards and risks of 'delayering' Some companies call it 'delayering'. Others use the looser but just as ungainly jargon term 'downsizing', or even (heaven help us) 'rightsizing'. What they all mean, in the simple English which far too few of them use, is 'the removal of management layers'. The pioneers of the process, led by American General Electric, first swung into action when business was good in the mid-1980s; GE itself took out three layers of middle and senior management. Now, cut to the quick by the vicious pincer effect of recession-hit sales and searing competition, big business as a whole is following suit in a mad rush to cut costs, streamline bureaucracy, and speed up decision-making. This week Ford of Europe confirmed that middle and senior management will be especially hard hit in the imminent round of about 2,500 job cuts; it is removing two of what it says is a current average of seven management layers. IBM is already in the process of a very similar exercise, while its arch-rival Digital Equipment is endeavouring to follow suit. Among purely service companies, a notable recent layer-slasher has been British Airways, which has reduced to an average of five (from eight or nine) the number of levels between chief executive and front line. In principle, at least, the rewards - and the feasibility - of layer-removal are self-evident. The market-driven need for quick decision-taking is being made achievable, in the most advanced companies, by: the emergence of cost-effective information technology networks that remove the need for the traditional battery of paper-pushers; the development of much more cross-functional team-working, without the need for bureaucratic demarcation between them; and the increasingly proven ability of even lowly-placed employees to take decisions on their own account. But the creation of flatter management structures also has its risks. They are considerable when, as so often, a company rushes into it primarily for cost reasons, paying inadequate attention to the accompanying need for a radical streamlining of formal procedures, and a sharp change in the way managers and other employees behave towards each other. In such cases, the removal of layers can demoralise and even nearly cripple an organisation. GE's own experience proves the point. In the first few years after it began the process, the result among managers in some parts of the company was overload, stress, demotivation and inefficiency. As successive layers were removed, the number of people reporting to each surviving manager shot up from the traditional five or eight to 15 or more. At the same time, many existing procedures were continued as before. The result was that more and more work was pushed down the line. Some people thrived, but others buckled under the pressure. Many left GE. It was not until late 1988 that GE really began to fix the problem, with a regular, structured process called 'work-out', in which business leaders meet 100 of their people at a time for frank sessions at which unnecessary procedures and what GE calls 'bad habits' are brought into the open and (usually) dumped. Behind the process lies the notion that the job of a manager in a flattish organisation is no longer to control people, but to empower, trust and coach them. Other companies have learned from GE's experience. In parallel with its removal of two layers - leaving between three and six between its chief executive and its front-line operators - BP Exploration, the oil-drilling arm of British Petroleum, has run Work-out-like 'Fitness Workshops'. The rest of BP is now following suit. Today's hasty layer-removers must learn that relatively flat organisations cannot operate effectively for very long on anything like the same principles as the steep pyramids which they replace. To put it crudely, surgery must be accompanied by a character change.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Chase pays Dollars 363.5m for US Trust arm Chase Manhattan, the US bank, agreed to pay Dollars 363.5m for the custody and other securities processing businesses of US Trust, reinforcing its strong position in these markets. The all-stock transaction will bring Chase about Dollars 237bn in additional assets under custody. Of these, Dollars 127bn are held for institutional investors for whom US Trust acts as domestic or global custodian; Dollars 74bn are assets of US mutual fund groups; and Dollars 36bn are held for closed-end investment trusts. The acquisition will confirm Chase's position as the biggest global custodian of securities. With US Trust's 50 per cent share of the US investment trust business, it will also become the biggest in this field. Investors marked down the bank's share price on fears that the deal would dilute earnings per share. Chase said it would counter this by increasing its stock buy-back programme to purchase the same number of shares it issues under the transaction. Absorbing US Trust's securities servicing businesses will cost about Dollars 40m, but lead to annual cost savings of Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m thereafter, Chase said.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gerdau buys second state company GRUPO GERDAU, Brazil's largest privately-owned steel producer and its 13th largest privately-owned group, has bought a second state-owned steel company, less than three months after buying the first. It bought Acos Finos Piratini at a privatisation auction last week for Dollars 105m, 153 per cent over the minimum asking price. The sale was the seventh in President Fernando Collor de Mello's privatisation programme, which began last October. In November, Gerdau purchased the Cosinor ironworks for Dollars 14.1m. With the purchase of Acos Finos Piratini, Gerdau gets a foothold in the specialised steel sector. In 1991, the newly-privatised company sold about 140,000 tons of finished products, about 30 per cent of which was exported. Gerdau estimates the company's productive capacity at about 200,000 tons a year. Gerdau outbid Eletrometal, a Sao Paulo producer of specialised steel, to take control of 88.9 per cent of Acos Finos Piratini. The company is located in Rio Grande do Sul, in the same state as the parent group's headquarters. Several auctions are scheduled for the coming months. The next is due today when Goiasfertil, a producer of phosphate, goes on the block. Petrochemical groups, Petroflex and Copesul, go up for sale on March 18 and May 15 respectively.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Lex Column: ICI ICI's decision to pull out of its loss-making nylon business is to be welcomed, particularly since it gets world leadership in acrylics and Pounds 250m cash in exchange. But the deal raises a mildly disturbing question. The list of traditional commodity businesses ICI has lately abandoned also includes fertiliser, soda ash, lime and salt. In theory, it should be replacing these with more specialised products offering higher added value. But in the past year, it has pulled out of a large part of its advanced materials business. This deal takes it out of engineering plastics. Where is the ICI of the future? Granted, the nylon deal is not quite done yet. Du Pont's case for being allowed to take a European market share of up to a third in some products rests on the need for a regional champion to take on Far Eastern producers in world markets. It remains to be seen whether Brussels is receptive to the idea; and if not, how far the rest of the deal can be rescued. In the meantime, another nagging question remains. At its best in the 1980s, the nylon business was no more than decently profitable. With hindsight, it might usefully have been sold off in the last wave of ICI restructuring a decade ago. Could there be other businesses the company is failing to tackle this time round?</p>

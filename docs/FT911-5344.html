			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: An 'evil' that restores the right balance Sir, I think it is perverse for you to say that road-pricing is the least of all evils. As you rightly point out, at present motorists pay only a fraction of the cost that society incurs because of their action. Road-pricing would help restore the rightful balance. It is therefore a good thing. Following your logic, would the 55p price of the Financial Times also be an evil? Andrea Casalotti, 8 Elvaston Place, London, SW7</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thatta, May 11 -- Massive tree-felling has been  occuring in the district which can be gauged from the fact that  some 200 trucks loaded with wood reach Karachi from here  everyday.    While the rest of the world is striving to combat pollution  and arrest environmental degradation, rapid destruction of  forests in Thatta district is posing a serious threat to the  environment and the picturesque landscape.    According to official data, Babool seed broadcasting has  been  carried out on 10,569 acres from 1990 till now as against that,  12,000 acres have been denuded by illegal tree-felling during  the same period.    Sources in the forest department claim that the department  earned Rs [rupees] 8.6 million by selling wood only during  1992-93, whereas a large quantity of wood was given to the  favourites of some influential persons, free of cost. Some 3,569  acres of forest land were leased out to abadgars for  cultivation, the sources added.    Out of 36 small and big forests spread over 138,000 acres in  Thatta district, nine riverine and inland irrigated forests on  8,900 hectares have been selected and Babool seed broadcasting  has been carried out with the assistance of the Asian  Development Bank. The bank has allocated Rs 1144 million for  afforestation in Sindh. The scheme will take seven years to  materialise.    Enumerating reasons for the deforestation, the sources said  that since the operation of the Ghulam Mohammad Barrage (Sukkur  Barrage) in 1957 and its four major canals -- Phuleli, Pinyari,  Channel and K.B. Feeder -- on the Right Bank of the Indus, water  has been diverted to irrigated areas which resulted in short  water supply to forests and caused their destruction.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 14 INDICTED IN POT-FARMING OPERATION  </P> <P> A federal grand jury in Phoenix has indicted 14 men accused of operating a  multimillion-dollar network that allegedly dug high-tech subterranean marijuana  farms beneath desert land in the Antelope Valley and Arizona.  </P> <P> The indictment, released Thursday, is the first issued since federal drug  agents last month discovered the highly organized ring, which was allegedly  headed by construction contractors. The operation is a major, previously  unknown supplier of marijuana to California, as well as other states including  New York, authorities have said.  </P> <P> Federal investigators and sheriff's deputies have raided four underground farms  equipped with elaborate, automated growing systems, two in the Antelope Valley  and two in Bullhead City, Ariz. They have seized 23,000 marijuana plants valued  at $77 million.  </P> <P> Authorities have also raided two homes in Lancaster and in the Barstow area  where they said new indoor farms were being built.  </P> <P> Investigators said the case, which has spurred a new law enforcement focus on  the movement of growers from Northern California outdoor plantations to indoor  sites in Southern California, will probably result in more arrests and charges.  </P> <P> "The amounts are massive," Assistant U.S. Atty. James Lacey in Phoenix said of  the amount of drugs seized thus far. "It could be this thing evolves further."  </P> <P> Ten of those named in the indictment are already in custody, including  45-year-old Frank Edward Gegax, the Lancaster plumbing contractor alleged to  have financed and supervised the operation of each farm on properties owned by  "front men."  </P> <P> Gegax and his brothers -- fellow contractors Michael and Alan Gegax, ages 49  and 44 -- are charged with conspiracy to distribute marijuana and two counts of  possession of marijuana in connection with a farm near Lancaster and the two  Arizona farms. Facing the same charges are three brothers -- David Larson, 28,  Daniel Larson, 26, and Donald Larson, 32, of Bullhead City, -- and their  cousin, Robert Benson, 28, of the Bullhead City area.  </P> <P> The indictment charges Richard F. Yerger, 28, the owner of the ranch house east  of Lancaster where investigators recovered 8,000 plants from a concrete bunker,  with conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The three men who allegedly worked as  caretakers at the farms were each charged with conspiracy to distribute  marijuana. One of those men also was charged with possession.  </P> <P> Alan Gegax and three other suspects indicted are still at large, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The indicted suspects face between 15 to 25 years in prison if convicted, Lacey  said. Arraignment has been set for Wednesday.  </P> <P> An attorney for Yerger said he believes his client is innocent. No attorney  could be reached for Frank Gegax, who will be transferred from Los Angeles  County Jail to federal custody next week along with Yerger and two of the  caretakers. Attorneys for the other defendants also could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> The indictment does not mention one of the Antelope Valley sites, a farm where  2,500 plants were recovered beneath a newly built house, owned by Yerger's  father, Richard E. Yerger. He has not been arrested or charged. Investigators  are still trying to determine how that operation fit into the network,  authorities said, and new charges may be filed.  </P></p>

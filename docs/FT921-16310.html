			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Names on wills ALTHOUGH I have two Christian names I have normally used the first one only. My bank account, building society and investments are all in my first name. I have drawn up a simple will on a will form which I have signed with my first name only. Do you consider this will be valid? It is sufficient to sign in your usual form of signature ie. with one Christian name only. You should however give your full names at the head of the will document. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THREE CHEERS: PLACENTIA MAN'S PHOTO WINS A PLACE OF HONOR  </P> <P> The award-winning picture taken by Placentia amateur photographer Dick Krueger  has become part of a permanent display at Eastman Kodak's Journey Into  Imagination Pavilion at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> The picture, titled "Flying Cowboy," won $200 for Krueger, an insurance sales  manager, and was taken at a rodeo in 1988 at the Orange County Fairgrounds. It  was chosen from about 500,000 entries.  </P> <P> Krueger, 56, attends Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa and often works as a  photographer for the college newspaper.  </P> <P> Mary Katherine Parks, 37, a Huntington Beach single mother of three, was  awarded $3,000 for academic excellence in a Kaiser Permanente nursing  scholarship program.  </P> <P> The Golden West College nursing student, who is expected to graduate in  December and work as an emergency-room or intensive-care nurse, began to pursue  a nursing career two years ago after the death of her husband.  </P> <P> "I decided on a career in nursing," she said. "I had to ask myself, 'What is my  family going to do?' and I knew it would need a good income."  </P> <P> Her children are ages 5, 7 and 9.  </P> <P> Greg Scaffidi of Placentia was awarded third place in the Arthritis  Foundation's national photo contest. His photographs, like others in the  contest, depict people in various activities, settings and situations conveying  messages of hope for those with arthritis. They are on display at the Little  Shop of Posters in Fullerton.  </P> <P> Four Orange County men who led police to a accused purse snatcher hiding under  a car in a Costa Mesa parking lot were declared Outstanding Citizens by the  Newport Beach Villa Nova Restaurant and presented with commemorative plaques  and complimentary dinners.  </P> <P> Alan Cirson, Richard Collins, Mark Vanous and Richard Henson combined to chase  the suspect by car and on foot.  </P> <P> Danny Herrera, a Golden West College cosmetology student competing against 45  other contestants, won first place and $300 in the recent Men's Hair Cutting  and Styling Competition at the Long Beach Convention Center.  </P> <P> "In the middle of the cut, I realized that most of the other contestants were  styling (hair) the same way as me," said the Huntington Beach resident, who  changed the style midway through the event. "Obviously, it paid off."  </P> <P> Golden West student Don Anderson of Yorba Linda won fourth place and $25.  </P> <P> A photo portrait of Jewell Plummer Cobb, the soon-to-retire president of Cal  State Fullerton, has become part of the National Research Council's collection  in its headquarters building in Washington.  </P> <P> The council selects outstanding people who have become leaders in the fields of  science, engineering and medicine.  </P> <P> An innovative program that provided free picture books for newborn infants at a  local hospital earned Clinton Elementary School in Garden Grove a "Celebrate  Literacy" award from the International and Orange County Reading associations.  </P> <P> The school's "Born to Read" program consisted of a school paper drive and book  sale to raise $150 to purchase storybooks for each infant born at Garden Grove  Hospital and Medical Center during Children's Book Week last year.  </P> <P> The project was intended to emphasize reading throughout a person's life.  </P> <P> Placentia resident Larry D. Banares, culinary arts instructor at Orange Coast  College and executive chef at the Hotel Queen Mary and Port Properties in Long  Beach, was named Orange County's Chef of the Year.  </P> <P> A former culinary arts student at the college and a former chef at the  Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, Banares, 31, oversees 12 restaurants and three  bakeries, supervising a staff of 124.  </P> <P> He is a member of the World Assn. of Cooks' Societies and is vice president of  the Orange Empire Chefs' Assn.  </P> <P> Anaheim Park Ranger Eric Johnson won the city's third $500 graffiti award  following the arrest and conviction of a suspect who was spray-painting at  Brookhurst Park.  </P> <P> Johnson asked for the suspect's driver's license after noticing that the man  placed a spray can in his jacket. He then called police, as making arrests is  not part of a ranger's duty.  </P> <P> Besides receiving three years' probation, the suspect paid a $300 fine and $435  in restitution fees.  </P> <P>  Submit items to Three Cheers, The Times, c/o Herbert J.

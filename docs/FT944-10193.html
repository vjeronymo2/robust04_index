			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons helped by global recovery Four Seasons Hotels, the luxury chain in which Saudi Arabia's Prince Al-Waleed recently bought a minority stake, has benefited from a strong recovery in the international hotel business. The Toronto-based company's third-quarter earnings climbed to CDollars 3.2m (USDollars 2.4m) or 12 cents a share, from CDollars 398,000, or 2 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 409.1m from CDollars 326.1m. Operating earnings climbed by 59 per cent to CDollars 14.5m. The yield at Four Seasons and Regent hotels, defined as occupancy multiplied by the realised room rate, rose 17 per cent. Reservations climbed 20 per cent in the first nine months of this year which, according to Four Seasons, points to further growth ahead. Next year's performance should be bolstered by new hotels which opened this year in Mexico City and Singapore, and a resort in Palm Beach. New properties are due to open over the next 12 months in Chiang Mai (Thailand), Jakarta and Istanbul. Four Seasons said that its debt, totalling CDollars 367m, remains unacceptably high. It expects to lighten the debt burden by about one-third by the end of 1995, mainly through asset disposals. It announced yesterday that it had sold its real estate interest in the Four Seasons hotel in Austin, Texas, and its 15 per cent equity stake in the Boston Four Seasons. The group is seeking a buyer for its flagship property in London.</p>

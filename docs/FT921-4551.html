			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Buchanan still poses threat to Bush bandwagon: President adds South Carolina to tally of primaries PRESIDENT George Bush has added another state to his tally of primaries with a convincing victory in South Carolina, but was again unable to quash completely the challenge of Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right-wing opponent. Bush campaign managers said his 67 per cent of the Republican vote would be a springboard for tomorrow's Super Tuesday contest, when 11 states, seven of them in the South, cast their ballots in presidential primaries or caucuses. 'I believe this will send a strong signal to all the Super Tuesday states,' Mr Bush told his supporters at the weekend. In the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas received a boost from Saturday's voting, with an overwhelming victory in South Carolina. Mr Clinton - whose earlier career again came under the spotlight yesterday with a newspaper report raising questions about his involvement in property deals after he became governor - also won in Wyoming. Mr Buchanan's 26 per cent share of the Republican primary vote fell below the scores in New Hampshire and Georgia which enabled him to claim second place as victory. But Buchanan campaigners still called the result another vote of no confidence for Mr Bush, who benefited from the all-out support of South Carolina's governor, Mr Carroll Campbell, and the state's entire Republican establishment. 'In this state, 67 per cent, with this machine and governor, is a bad score for George Bush,' said Mr Michael Graham, state co-ordinator for the Buchanan campaign. Some Republicans deserted their party's primary to vote for former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the Democratic ballot. But Bush and Buchanan supporters agreed they had crushed the candidacy of Mr David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who came near winning the governorship of Louisiana last year. Mr Duke won 7 per cent of the Republican vote. Mr Buchanan said he would not withdraw from the race despite suggestions from the Bush campaign that he should. 'We will go to Michigan,' he said 'and make it the Georgia of the north' - a reference to his success there. He indicated he would support Mr Bush in the presidential election if he failed to win the nomination. But not all Mr Buchanan's supporters feel the same way. 'I voted for George Bush in 1988 but he's turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. If Buchanan doesn't get the Republican nomination I intend to vote for whatever candidate the Democrats run,' said Mr Bill Otto, a broker in Columbia, the state capital. Among the Democrats, Mr Clinton won more heavily than expected in South Carolina, with 63 per cent against 19 for Mr Tsongas, his closest challenger. 'What we were aiming for was 50 per cent. This is about as good as you can do with someone running against you,' said Mr Frank Holleman, state director of the Clinton campaign. But Mr Clinton also won Wyoming's Democratic party caucuses, letting him claim he region of the South. Mr Tsongas won Arizona's primary with 34 per cent, compared with 29 per for Mr Clinton and 28 per cent for former Governor Jerry Brown of California. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa won only 6 per cent of the vote in South Carolina, despite his last-minute bid for black votes by campaigning with Mr Jesse Jackson and attacking Mr Clinton's civil rights record. Mr Harkin is trying to keep his campaign alive until Illinois and Michigan hold their primaries on March 17, but may be forced to withdraw before that.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS)  intends to take an active part in ensuring security in the free  economic zone Nakhodka situated in Russia's Far East.    Chief of the FCIS Public Relations Center Aleksandr  Mikhailov  reported to Interfax Saturday that Director of the service  Sergey Stepashin who was on an inspection trip throughout this  region this week commissioned local counterintelligence officers  to fulfil this task.    In Mikhailov's words, separate criminal clans use the  opportunities of the free economic zone to inflict damage to the  economy of the country as a whole and to the economy of the Far  East in particular.    Stepashin called counterintelligence officers to adopt all  necessary measures to ensure normal functioning of Nakhodka free  economic zone.</p>

The accord is designed to  end the political crisis that has continued for several months  in Yemen.    The Yemeni president and his deputy left the Jordanian  capital separately this afternoon after holding a prolonged  meeting with King Husayn of Jordan.    Security and political sources in Sanaa have said that  troops  and tanks affiliated with a unit of the former north Yemeni Army  are besieging the city of Zinjibar in southern Yemen in the  aftermath of clashes with troops affiliated with the former  south Yemeni army. The clashes erupted after troops affiliated  with the north Yemeni army attempted to detain a colonel  affiliated with the south Yemeni Army at a military checkpoint.    Yemeni sources in Amman said at noon today that at least  four  persons were killed in the clashes between the two sides.</p>

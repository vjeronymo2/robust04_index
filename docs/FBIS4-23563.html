			<p>BFN     [Text] The Organization of African Unity, OAU, could now  brace itself to fulfill its financial obligations following the  closure of its heavy commitment in the struggle against  apartheid in South Africa and the imminent dissolution of the  OAU special fund for the liberation of Africa.    Addressing the 60th ordinary session of the OAU Council of  Ministers in Tunis yesterday, the honorable minister of foreign  affairs, Mr. Molapo Qhobela, said he hoped that the member  states would now be in a position to concentrate better on their  financial obligations to the regular budget of the OAU. Mr.  Qhobela welcomed South Africa, which was formally admitted as  the 53rd member of the OAU at the Council of Ministers' meeting.  One of the main battles of the OAU for decades, since its  founding in 1963, was to dismantle apartheid.    The minister said the admission of South Africa, whose  tenacious struggle for freedom and democracy commanded universal  recognition, brought a particular kind of joy to Lesotho, which  is South Africa's closest neighbor. Commenting on the report of  the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Achmed Salim, on the  organization's activities since the last summit of heads of  state and government in Cairo last year, Mr. Qhobela said  commendable progress had been made by the organization over the  past year. In particular, the minister applauded the work  achieved in the areas of management, of peaceful transitional to  democratic rule, economic integration, as well as work on  conflict resolution among African countries.    Mr. Qhobela recalled with gratitude the contribution made by  the OAU towards resolving, through peaceful means, the crisis  situation that resulted from the confrontation between the two  warring factions in the Lesotho armed forces earlier this year.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Packer's Westpac purchase keeps the markets guessing - The Australian bank was an obvious target, but what is Kerry Packer's strategy? A SINGLE question was reverberating around Australia's business community yesterday: what is Kerry Packer up to? It is a question which has been asked many times before. As usual, it prompted plenty of speculation, but few answers. There was little surprise when Mr Packer, the entrepreneurial owner of the Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress) publishing group, emerged on Thursday as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake in Westpac Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank. Market gossip had linked Mr Packer with Westpac since October, when the bank's ADollars 3-a-share, ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 825m) rights issue had closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving dozens of sub-underwriters holding some 290m shares. The shares, representing about 19 per cent of Westpac's expanded share capital, were worth significantly less than ADollars 3 in the stock market, and were ripe for acquisition by a buyer with plenty of cash. But why was Mr Packer willing to bail out the underwriters when so many other shareholders, including many of Australia's institutional buyers, were unwilling to take up their rights only a few weeks earlier? Is he simply spending some of his cash on an undervalued recovery stock? Is he hoping to pick up windfall profits if a rival bidder appears? Or does he want to run Westpac? Only three people know the answer: Mr Packer, who is believed to be playing polo in Argentina; Mr Al Dunlap, the irascible American chief executive of ConsPress; and Mr Packer's son Jamie, who is being groomed to inherit the company. None are likely to explain the strategy unless forced to do so. As Mr Packer told a parliamentary committee last year, the affairs of ConsPress are no business of anyone but the sole shareholder - himself. However, Mr Packer has clearly been poised to make a major investment since March, when he completed a reconstruction of ConsPress which left the group debt-free with assets of about ADollars 3bn, including ADollars 1bn in cash. He spelt out his long-term strategy in broad terms in a rare interview in April with Australian Business Monthly, one of his own magazines. 'I believe that over the next two or three years there are going to be terrific opportunities, and that anyone in a position such as ours will be able to take advantage of anything that comes up,' he said. Westpac's problems made it an obvious target. Shortly after the rights issue debacle, five directors resigned, including the then chairman, and the bank subsequently reported a net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year ended September, after writing off more than ADollars 2.6bn against bad and doubtful loans. The bank's problems were reflected in its share price, which fell from ADollars 4.52 in January to a low of ADollars 2.39 earlier this month, presenting a rare opportunity to acquire a significant stake cheaply. Westpac shares closed at ADollars 2.99 yesterday, suggesting that Mr Packer has already made a small profit on his holding, which was acquired at prices of between ADollars 2.52 and ADollars 2.93. Mr Packer may expect the shares to continue to rise as the bank returns to profitability over the coming year. He may also be positioning himself for the possibility of a victory by the opposition conservative coalition in next year's federal election. That would probably lead to an easing of restrictions on bank takeovers and open the way for a bid for Westpac from one of Australia's stronger banks. However, Mr Packer is rarely a passive investor. His strategy is to buy undervalued companies, and add value to his holding by restoring profitability as quickly as possible. To do that, he needs control, and the key question is what level of control he thinks he will be able to exercise over Westpac. By Friday evening, ConsPress is believed to have expanded its shareholding to the 10 per cent ceiling on individual limit on shareholdings imposed by Westpac's deed of settlement and the federal Bank Shareholdings Act. The act allows a maximum individual shareholding of 15 per cent, with the approval of Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), who would have to rule that the increased stake was not against the national interest. Mr Dawkins' office said yesterday that Mr Packer had not requested permission to exceed 10 per cent. However, a 1986 precedent involving Mr John Spalvins' Adsteam group suggests he will be allowed to increase his stake if he wishes. A 15 per cent holding would not give Mr Packer control. But it would probably give him two board seats, and a level of influence comparable with that wielded by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, which also owns 15 per cent of Westpac. Given his record, Mr Packer's goal would probably be to speed the bank's return to profitability by accelerating the recovery programme announced recently by Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing director. Analysts say it is not clear how that might be done. But Mr Packer's views appear remarkably similar to those of the AMP, which recently gave Westpac a six-month deadline to deliver a significant improvement in performance. Mr Ian Salmon, AMP managing director, was enthusiastic about Mr Packer's investment yesterday, suggesting that there may be a degree of common ground. If that were so, Mr Packer's influence could be much greater than his limited shareholding would suggest. For the time being, however, there are still no real answers to what Australia's most enigmatic businessman is up to. But, barring an unexpected collapse in the share price, he seems likely to make a healthy profit whatever happens.</p>

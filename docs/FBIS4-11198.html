			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the Ramada Inn Hotel in San Salvador by Angel </F> Iraheta -- live]    [Text] [Iraheta] We are here at the Ramada Inn Hotel, where  Dr. Ruben Zamora has just confirmed that he telephoned  presidential candidate Dr. Armando Calderon Sol to congratulate  him. Let us listen to Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate  of the leftist coalition made up of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front, Democratic Convergence, and National  Revolutionary Movement:    [Zamora, in progress] .... dignity. First we want to thank  all Salvadorans who voted for us and tell them that their wishes  for change and a better way of life are still alive. We will  continue working toward those things. [Words indistinct] for  the force attained through these electoral events to fulfill our  commitment and to continue working hard first for full  compliance with the peace agreements, and second to defend and  promote the interests of the majority in our country to attain a  true state of development with justice and (?happiness) for all  Salvadorans.    We have reached specific agreements, such as the agreement  on  electoral reform, with the Nationalist Republican Alliance and  its candidate. We want to voice our willingness to immediately  begin the electoral reforms that our country needs so much. We  are certain that Dr. Armando Calderon Sol will keep his campaign  promises. Thank you for your attention.</p>

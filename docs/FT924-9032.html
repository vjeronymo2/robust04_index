			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Lost lessons of Winston's recession: In 1925, Keynes warned the Chancellor of depression. Has Lamont repeated Churchill's mistake? JOHN Maynard Keynes spent most of his professional life explaining how Britain could avoid the distress and waste of high unemployment. His disciples, who dominated economics after the Second World War, believed that as a result of his work, the great depression of the 1930s need never happen again. Yet British unemployment reached more than 3.1m in 1986. Now, six years later, the dole queues are again lengthening and an end of the recession is not in sight. Was Keynes's lesson neglected or has he proved to be, in some sense, wrong? To understand these contemporary questions one needs to go back to the period before Keynes's work, the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (published in 1936) - to the 1920s. It was abnormal British unemployment rather than lack of demand in the world economy that he sought to explain in A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) and A Treatise on Money (1930). Above all, he wanted to show that, by overvaluing the pound in 1925, the Bank of England was forced to set interest rates too high to allow full employment. It is from this perspective that we should look at what Keynes has to offer us. In the 1920s, Britain was in a self-induced depression, with the world economy moderately prosperous. Similarly today, the issue is not the collapse of the world economy, but the collapse of the British economy. Indeed, while Keynes was writing his General Theory to explain how a closed economy can run down, Britain was recovering from the world depression with a cheap money policy. So the parallel is with the 1920s, not the 1930s: the theme, the monetary mismanagement of the British economy. Keynes's vision of Britain in the 1920s was of an arthritic, or perhaps merely mature, economy suffering from a deflationary overdose inflicted by a financial oligarchy, too proud and ignorant to attend to social detail. He was well aware of the structural weaknesses of the British economy - the incompetence of business management dominated by 'third generation men', the obstructionism of the trade unions, 'once the oppressed now the tyrants' - the general resistance to change. He was infuriated that monetary policy, instead of trying create a favourable climate for overcoming these weaknesses, made them lethal. When the government imposed its package of economies on September 8 1931 in a last effort to keep Britain on the gold standard, he exploded before a group of Labour MPs: 'I speak from a full heart. The course of policy pursued so far has reduced us to a point of humiliation one could not have conceived'. At the same time, Keynes understood that stable exchange rates were good for a large trading economy. The dilemma he faced was how to combine a monetary policy geared to maintaining full employment (that is, relatively easy credit) with membership of a fixed exchange rate system. Keynes was the first to realise, or at least say, that exchange rates should reflect the competitive power of national economies and not be used to force downward adjustment of money costs. If so used, any system of fixed exchange rates would break down. By overvaluing sterling in 1925, Britain destroyed the gold standard system which it had created, just as by overvaluing sterling within the ERM in 1990, Britain has come close to destroying the mechanism so painfully constructed in the 1980s. The reconciliation of the two requirements of domestic and international stability required, Keynes thought, keeping the whole world in 'quasi-boom'. This was the neglected lesson of the 19th century. Over that period, he said in 1930: 'Prices were on the whole tending upwards, and allowing for the sharp increase in efficiency which was going on all the time. There was never any occasion to use bank rate to bring about a downward adjustment of wages.' The problem which dominated his lifetime was how to set Britain back into the right starting position for this ascent to prosperity after the catastrophic 'interruption' of the first world war. In the 1920s, this seemed to him a problem of restoring the domestic equilibrium of wages and prices, disrupted by the wartime and postwar inflation. This, he thought, should be done before stabilising the exchange rate. The defeat of the postwar inflation had left a legacy of over 10 per cent unemployment. Prices had fallen faster than money wages, so that employers had been forced to cut costs by reducing their workforce. Today, although prices are rising, employers face similar pressures because wages have risen faster. So in both periods, the purchasing power of wage earners (real wages) rose. In 1922, Keynes said: 'The continuance of unemployment is to an important extent due to the fact that we have got the level of wages out of gear with everything else. The only way in which they will get into gear will be by an increase in the level of prices'. He wanted to get prices up to induce employers to take on more workers, and the exchange rate down to ensure that the price of British goods did not rise too much. The Treasury and the Bank of England, however, took a similar view to that enunciated by Norman Lamont, the present Chancellor, when he said on July 10 of this year: 'The way to success is to adjust your costs to your exchange rate, not the other way round'. The monetary policy pursued by the authorities throughout the early 1920s was dominated by their desire to put sterling back on to the Gold standard at its prewar parity with the dollar (Dollars 4.86). Employers would be expected to cut wages and prices sufficiently to make export industries competitive at that rate. The Treasury / Bank view of the 1920s was echoed in the Medium Term Financial Strategy adopted by the Thatcher government in 1980 and in the overvaluation of sterling in 1990. The assumption linking the two eras was that if monetary policy is credible, business behaviour will adjust to the monetary framework set by the authorities. In his evidence to the Macmillan Committee Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, said: 'I have never been able to see myself why for the last few years it should have been impossible for industry starting from within to have readjusted its position'. Keynes knew this was myopic. In March 1925, Winston Churchill, the Chancellor, gave a dinner party, to which he invited Keynes and Reginald McKenna, the two foremost opponents of the return to gold. They were to battle it out with two Treasury officials, Lord Bradbury and Otto Niemeyer. Keynes and McKenna stuck to the point that British prices had not fallen enough to support the prewar value of sterling. Going back to gold at Dollars 4.86 would overvalue the pound by 10 per cent, requiring a 10 per cent fall in money wages. Bradbury and Niemeyer retorted that only returning to gold at the old parity would stop Britain living in a fools' paradise of inflated real wages. The gold standard, they said, was 'knave (ie politician) proof'. In the end McKenna, a former Chancellor, gave way. 'There is no escape; you have to go back; but it will be hell', he said. Keynes stood firm. Keynes saw that the only way a policy of high interest rates can cause prices to fall is by withdrawing from employers the financial means to employ labour at the existing level of money wages. It means 'intensifying unemployment without limit, until the workers are ready to accept the necessary reduction of money wages under the pressure of hard facts'. He suspected that the government would shrink from the logic of its policy. Bank rate would be kept high enough to attract foreign funds to London and retard domestic investment, but not high enough to break workers' resistance to money wage reductions. The result would be to 'jam' the British economy in a low employment trap. 'The fundamental blunder of the Treasury and the Bank of England' he wrote in 1928 'has been due, from the beginning, to their belief that if they looked after the deflation of prices the deflation of costs would look after itself . . . Unemployment will not decline unless businessmen have the incentive of plentiful credit, high hopes and . . . a slight inflation of prices but not of costs'. It was in this context that Keynes developed his plan for loan-financed public works. The forced devaluation of sterling on September 21, 1931 unlocked the British economy. Interest rates came down, facilitating a housing boom; employment recovered from the depressed levels of the world slump. But this era of floating exchange rates was accompanied by protectionism, barter agreements and restrictive trading blocks. The end of the second world war provided the opportunity for the fresh start which had eluded the world after 1918. Keynes evolved an 'ideal' plan for a currency union to reconcile the advantages of the old gold standard with sufficient national monetary autonomy to maintain full employment. There would be fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates; creditor countries would not be allowed to 'hoard' their surpluses; they would be automatically available as cheap overdraft facilities for other countries at an international clearing bank. The Bretton Woods agreement of July, 1944 fell short of Keynes' hopes, being based on the different idea of an international monetary fund. Nevertheless, Keynes was convinced that internationalism was back in business. In May 1944, he denounced the 'technique of little Englandism' as inconsistent with Britain's tradition. 'With our own resources so greatly impaired and encumbered, it is only if sterling is firmly placed in an international setting that the necessary confidence in it can be sustained'. Some morals of this tale are easier to draw than others. Keynes was right to argue that international currency regimes, however desirable, will break down if they become instruments of deflation. British experience under the ERM and the gold standard support this. If we want a liberal market order to survive, it must be consciously stabilised. During the 1980s, when Western governments were recovering their monetary virtue, the banking system went haywire, spurred on by the demand for loans on the back of inflated asset prices. Keynes' belief that the stability of the international economy depends on 'measures to control capital movements' deserves close scrutiny. The lessons for Britain are less clear. The problem of getting wages into closer equilibrium with prices, after decades of inflationary expectations, is more difficult than it was in 1922 or 1931. But this must happen if there is to be a durable recovery in employment. The 1990-92 experience showed that it is a hopeless business to get wage inflation to fall faster than price inflation. But it is also difficult in a recovery to make sure that wages rise more slowly than prices, which must happen if employment is to grow. A policy on pay is inescapable. Finally, it is more difficult to see what kind of international framework offers Britain its best hope. If the world economy continues to falter, the pressure towards economic blocs will strengthen: we can see them in embryo: the EC, NAFTA, East Asia. If this happens, Britain would be faced with a dreadful choice, since it can no longer organise an economic bloc of its own. Its best hope would lie in co-ordinated efforts to expand the world economy coupled with trade liberalisation. It is the spirit, rather than the letter, of Keynes which applies today. Keynes understood that market systems work best when underpinned by broad agreement on aims and behaviour. This has been true of the successful 20th century economies - the US, Germany, Japan. Underlying the monetary mismanagement of the British economy has been a failure to agree on values and institutions. So Britain oscillates between inflation and unemployment, undervaluation and overvaluation. Today's challenge is to give Keynes' vision of a middle way a new form for a new age.

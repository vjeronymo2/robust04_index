			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;060) for eye and face (&sect;1910.133), head (&sect;1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training in the proper use of PPE (&sect;&sect;1910.132 (d) through (f)) (54 FR 33832). The proposed general industry revisions were consistent with the corresponding provisions of the proposed rule for shipyard employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128, 1910.129 and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry PPE standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;057) (55 FR 13423). Again, the criteria proposed for general industry PPE were consistent with those proposed for shipyards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive records, including hundreds of comments and several thousand pages of hearing testimony. On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in the Docket S&hyph;060 proceeding. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirement so that it provides clear direction regarding what constitutes adequate training and what circumstances trigger a requirement for retraining. In addition, the final rule added requirements for the certification of the hazard assessment (&sect;1910.132(d)(2)) and certification that the required training has been provided and understood (&sect;1910.132(f)(4)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, based on the rulemaking record for general industry fall protection PPE (Docket S&hyph;057), the Agency is considering further limiting or prohibiting the use of body belts and non-locking snaphooks in personal fall arrest systems. In particular, the evidence in the record supports the conclusion that an employee who falls while wearing a body belt as part of a personal fall arrest system is substantially more likely to suffer death or serious injury than would be the case if the employee were wearing a full body harness. Furthermore, the rulemaking record indicates that locking snaphooks designed to prevent ``roll out'' (where snaphooks become accidentally disengaged during use) provide a higher level of employee protection than single-action (non-locking) snaphooks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it is appropriate to facilitate employer access to safety and health standards by maintaining separate standards for general industry (part 1910) and for the shipyard industry (part 1915), the Agency believes that the substance of those standards should be consistent. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent rulemaking records, that PPE used in shipyards does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry. Therefore, the Agency has determined that the information generated in the general industry rulemakings should be taken into account as the Agency drafts the final rule for shipyard PPE, as well. To this end, OSHA is incorporating the general industry PPE rulemaking records (Dockets S&hyph;057 and S&hyph;060) into the record for the shipyards PPE rulemaking. In addition, OSHA is reopening the written comment period for the shipyard PPE proposal so the public has an opportunity to comment on the newly incorporated materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA is requesting comments on these five specific issues: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certification of hazard assessment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The Agency believes that employers are able to determine and evaluate the hazards of their particular workplaces and to use this information for proper PPE selection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;1915.152(b) required employers to select the types of PPE to be used by employees based on an assessment of the workplace hazards relative to PPE. The comments on proposed &sect;1910.132(d), which contained identical language, indicated concern about the level of documentation required for hazards assessment (Exs. 3:1 and 3:68). In regard to the general industry rulemaking, OSHA concluded that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance officers and affected employees with appropriate assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed. Given the performance-oriented nature of the rule, the Agency determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be unnecessarily burdensome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

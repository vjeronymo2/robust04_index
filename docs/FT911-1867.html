			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Ex-takeover chief criticised: DTI attacks accountancy firms over Sound Diffusion collapse A DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry report has sharply criticised Mr David Macdonald, a former director-general of the Takeover Panel, and the accountancy firms Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young, now merged as Ernst &amp; Young. The report concerns the collapse of Sound Diffusion, an electrical equipment leasing company, which went into receivership in December 1988, eight months after launching a Pounds 9.5m rights issue. The inspectors say Mr Macdonald, chairman of the company from December 1987 to December 1988, and fellow non-executive director Mr Francis Howard: 'failed to ensure that the reasons for the rights issue were sufficiently stated'; 'should not have been party to the wording in the (rights issue) document to the effect that the problems of the past were behind the company when they should have known this was not the case.' The inspectors say that Mr Macdonald made an interim announcement in October 1988 which they feel 'gave a misleading impression of the company's profitability and prospects'. The report says Ernst &amp; Whinney (sole auditor between August 1985 and October 1987) and Arthur Young (sole auditor subsequently) 'either failed to identify or otherwise accepted serious defects in the company's accounting practices and did not adequately audit the amount receivable under finance leases' - the company's principal asset. The report concludes that Sound Diffusion's accounts took too optimistic a view of the likely profitability of many of its leases. However, the inspectors say that 'in our view, no single factor or person was responsible for the failure.' Mr Macdonald said that the inspectors' conclusions on lease accounting were 'at odds with what the leasing experts in two leading firms of accountants had concluded'. Ernst &amp; Young expressed surprise 'that the inspectors believe that the accounting policies were a contributory factor to the failure of Sound Diffusion. The significant accounting issues arising out of the report turn on a difference of opinion between the inspectors and of the two sets of auditors involved as to the application of a new accounting standard. . . .we. . . .believe that the policies adopted were appropriate.' Sound Diffusion. Investigation under section 432 (2) of Companies Act 1985. HMSO Pounds 32. Background, Page 27</p>

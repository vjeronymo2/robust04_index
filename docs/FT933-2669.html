			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Leading Article: The reform of healthcare WHEN 40 of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies combine to advocate the reform of healthcare services, the first reaction of health policymakers will be to count the spoons. Many countries have curbed spending on prescription drugs as part of measures to halt the growth in health budgets. So it is not hard to detect self-interest in the pharmaceutical companies' new-found concern for health economics. Yet the study published this week by Pharmaceutical Partners for Better Healthcare, the industry's new pressure group for health reform, offers sensible proposals to deal with a policy challenge that cannot be ducked. While some countries have succeeded in halting the growth in the share of GDP consumed by health, most face a sizeable gap between demand for healthcare and funding. The ageing of populations and new and more expensive types of treatment maintain an upwards pressure. All too often, national healthcare reforms are undertaken in isolation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has done much to collect data on health costs and spending, and to analyse trends. But as an intergovernmental organisation, it finds it hard to advocate solutions unpalatable to member countries. The pharmaceutical companies claim with justification that they have a 'unique global perspective' in what has so far been an intensely local debate. Cost-consciousness That perspective has led them to construct a blueprint for healthcare reform that seeks to create more competition in the funding and provision of health services to increase efficiency. It also provides incentives to encourage cost-consciousness among insurers and consumers. And it suggests a mechanism for funding a basic package of health services for all without rationing by price or queue. Parts of the model are utopian - not least the idea of an omniscient risk adjustment fund that would be able to help competing insurers provide the basic package of services to all comers whatever their state of health. It is also difficult to define that basic insurance package - attempts in Oregon, New Zealand and some parts of the UK have not been unqualified successes. And experienced health professionals may be unconvinced by the study's view that there is no need for regulation of the pharmaceutical industry in a competitive health system. However, important elements of the model can be recognised in several countries' health reform programmes. A recent OECD study found that several European countries were converging in their health reforms in ways close to the proposed model. This suggests that the model is both workable and a target that countries could adopt in long-term structural reform strategies. Shied away Equally, the model provides a benchmark to evaluate reforms in progress in countries such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, and those to be launched next week in the US by President Bill Clinton. Many European countries have shied away from the model's idea of asking patients to contribute to their treatment. While the revenue raised can be modest, such payments encourage consumers to adopt more healthy forms of behaviour and discourage them from wasting health resources. The UK health reforms have introduced greater competition between hospitals, family doctors and other health providers. But the only competition between the bodies that fund healthcare is on the margins, through the minority of family doctors who control their patients' health budgets. With the overall budget tight, a winter of hospital closures and lengthening queues for treatment is inevitable in the absence of alternative sources of funding. As for President Clinton's package, it seems to achieve at least one important element in the industry's model with its promise of a universal healthcare scheme. However, it should also be judged by the extent to which it alters the incentives for doctors to over-treat, hospitals to over-invest and patients to demand ever more expensive services. So long as insurance is largely funded by employers, consumers will not have sufficient incentive to argue for efficiency and economy.</p>

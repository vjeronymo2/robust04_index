			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkey has said that Greece giving permission to  the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] to open a bureau in Athens  is further new and concrete proof that this country sees nothing  wrong with backing terrorism.    Answering a question on the issue, Foreign Ministry  Spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said that this adverse behavior by Greece, which  came at a time when the realities behind the PKK terrorist  organization's terrorism is better understood and banned in  Europe, throws light on Greece's mentality as it concerns Turkey.    Ataman said: It is obvious that Greece never gained and  never will gain anything from an approach that treats Turkey's  enemy as its friend. Opening a terrorist bureau in Athens is  against Greece's agreement regarding fighting terrorism as  stipulated by international provisions. It is extremely  disconcerting that Greece, which has itself been target of  various terrorist organizations, is backing another terrorist  organization.    Ataman noted: The Greek ambassador was called to our  ministry in view of the developments in Athens. We described  the incident as a hostile act, conveyed our reaction, and  submitted a request that Greece abide by international  requirements.</p>

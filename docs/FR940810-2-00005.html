The Secretary must determine such total amount as will give due consideration to the interests in the U.S. sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (``GATT''). Such total amount consists of (1) a base quota amount, (2) a quota adjustment amount, and (3) an amount reserved for the importation of specialty sugars as defined by the Untied States Trade Representative. The base quota amount is allocated by the United States Trade Representative to the supplying countries and areas listed in paragraph (b)(i) of additional U.S. note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(ii) of additional U.S. note 3 authorizes the Secretary to modify any quantitative limitations (including the time periods for which such limitations are applicable) which have previously been established under paragraph (a)(i), if the Secretary determines that such modification is appropriate to give due consideration to the interests in the U.S. sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the GATT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (iv) of additional U.S. note 3 also provides that sugar entering the United States during a quota period may be charged to the previous quota period with the written approval of the Secretary. This notice will constitute such written approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 11, 1993, the Secretary of Agriculture established the current quota period of October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 and a total quota amount of 2,268,000 metric tons, raw value. (58 FR 28545). This quota period now is being shortened by two months, but any allocation of the current quota amount that has not been filled will be allowed to be entered during the next quota period and charged back to the previous quota period. In addition, this notice establishes a new 14-month quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, with a total quota amount of 1,322,978 metric tons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice is hereby given that I have determined, in accordance with additional U.S. note 3, that the current tariff-rate quota period is changed from the period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 to the period October 1, 1992 through July 31, 1994. Any amounts previously allocated to any country for the quota period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 that have not been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, by July 31, 1994 and that are subsequently entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption will be charged to the quota period October 1, 1992 through July 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I have further determined, in accordance with additional U.S. note 3, that the total amount of sugars, syrups, and molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.01, 1701.12.01, 1701.91.21, 1701.99.01, 1702.90.31, 1806.10.41, and 2106.90.11 of the HTS which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the tariff-rate quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 is 1,322,978 metric tons, raw value.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will not  visit any country besides El Salvador and Guatemala during his  upcoming trip, a ranking official at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs said Monday [23 May].    The official, who requested anonymity, made the statement to  refute an earlier press report that the premier will make a  secret visit to Mexico on his way to the two Central American  countries.    Bilateral ties between Taiwan and Mexico have held stable  despite the lack of diplomatic relations, he pointed out, noting  the Taipei economic and cultural office opened in Mexico City on  May 1. The two countries suspended official ties in 1971.    Lien will leave for San Salvador May 30 as President Li  Teng-hui's special envoy to attend the inauguration of newly  elected President Armando Calderon Sol on June 1.    He will then proceed to Guatemala City June 2 for a four-day  visit and is scheduled to return to Taipei June 7.</p>

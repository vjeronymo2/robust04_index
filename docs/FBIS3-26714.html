The first version entitled "Chaired by Jiang Zemin"  was published in the Political &amp; Social section of the 10  February China DAILY REPORT, page 6]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Feb (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central  Committee and the State Council sponsored a Spring Festival  get-together for exchanging greetings at the Great Hall of the  People this morning. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC  Central Committee, state president, and chairman of the Central  Military Commission, and Li Peng, State Council premier and  Standing Committee member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau, extended New Year's greetings to everyone present, a  happy new year to the people of all nationalities in the country  and the compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as  Overseas Chinese, and cordial greetings to international friends  who care for and support China's modernization drive.    The banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People was  brightly  lit and decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. Jiang  Zemin, Li Peng, Hu Jintao, and other party and government  leaders, responsible comrades of all central party, government,  Army, and mass organizations; retired veteran comrades who have  contributed to socialist revolution and construction, officials  from the democratic parties and patriotic figures without party  affiliation, foreign friends who have helped China's socialist  construction, and representatives from all walks of life in the  capital -- totaling some 4,000 people -- attended the  get-together. They exchanged festive greetings and celebrated  the new year with jubilation.    Jiang Zemin officiated over the get-together and Li Peng  made  a speech. [Li Peng's remarks were excerpted out of first version  published in the 10 February DAILY REPORT]    Li Peng said: The year 1993 was one in which we implemented  in an all-round way the 14th National Party Congress guidelines  and triumphantly marched along the path of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. We have made important  achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive.  A new situation has emerged in all fields of work.    He pointed out: The year 1994 will be one in which the  national economy will maintain its momentum of sound  development. It will also be a year crucial to our efforts to  push forward reform. We must take as our guide Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in an  all-round way the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress  and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure, maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy; safeguard political  stability, and promote social progress in an all-round way.  He said: The main tasks of reform this year are: 1) to  effectively organize the implementation of major measures for  fiscal, taxation, financial, investment, and other reforms, and  to establish and improve the system of macroeconomic regulation  and control; 2) to continuously change the operating mechanisms  of state-owned enterprises and to seek effective ways to  establish a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of  the socialist market economy; and 3) to appropriately advance  price reform after giving full consideration to the tolerance of  the different sectors of society, and to develop and perfect the  market system.    Li Peng emphasized: Seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability are the overall interests of the work of this year.  All fields of work must be subordinated to and serve these  interests. We should promote the reform of the economic  structure during the rapid growth of the national economy; at  the same time, we should also maintain the steady growth of the  national economy during the transformation of the economic  structure. Therefore, we must conscientiously and properly  handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. We should uphold the principle of "grasping two  links at the same time and putting stress on both links." While  concentrating our efforts on economic reform and development, we  should continue to do a good job in strengthening the building  of the CPC, and we should vigorously strengthen the building of  socialist spiritual civilization. We should develop socialist  democracy, strengthen the legal system, deepen the  anticorruption struggle, and effectively solve public-order  problems in a comprehensive way to create a favorable  environment for reform and development.    Li Peng said: Let us -- guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as  the core -- unswervingly implement the party's basic line,  strengthen the great unity among all nationalities in the whole  country, be of one heart and one mind, wage hard struggle, and  strive for new victories in socialist modernization!

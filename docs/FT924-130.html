			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Improved earnings forecast by BCI BANCA Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank, has forecast improved 1992 operating earnings in spite of the need for higher provisions and write downs. Last year, BCI, one of the country's main privatisation candidates, reported gross operating profits of L1,139bn (Dollars 825.9m) and net earnings of L317.5bn. BCI said its latest results indicated a second-half upturn compared with trading conditions in the first six months, when it reported operating profits of L594bn. But it warned of heavier write-downs this year on securities and problem loans, while expenses had risen on account of its branch opening plans, which saw an increase in its total network to almost 700 units. Internationale Nederlanden, the big Dutch banking and insurance group, has bought the remaining 40 per cent in Sviluppo, the Milan-based financial services group, it did not own. The deal represents a change of tack for Mr Francesco Micheli, the financier whose quoted Finarte group controlled Sviluppo. Meanwhile, Mr Micheli is to stay on as chairman of Sviluppo.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER IN EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> After visiting El Salvador with a human rights group and then roaming the halls  of Congress to lobby against military aid that feeds the death squads and the  military oppression, we know that this aid will continue.  </P> <P> Congressmen seeking re-election still cannot face the "soft on communism" slur.  They will vote our tax money to continue the war against the church and the  people of El Salvador because they cannot define what the slur means. Anyone  accused of it must be guilty of it unless they beat their chest in public and  "get tough." We learned that in the Cold War.  </P> <P> Sadly, we discovered that even the liberals in Congress are still trapped in  the left-right syndrome of thinking. "The left won in Nicaragua -- we cannot  let them win in El Salvador," they say.  </P> <P> Slogans are always better and easier in politics than facing an issue.  </P> <P> BYRON MORGAN  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

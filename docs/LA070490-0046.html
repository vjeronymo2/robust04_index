			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOLDOUT JUROR DOUBTED INTENT OF SILBERMAN  </P> <P> The sole juror who held out for acquittal on the central charges in Richard T.  Silberman's money-laundering trial said Tuesday that he simply did not believe  the San Diego financier had the intent to launder drug money.  </P> <P> In his first published comments since the complex case concluded last week with  Silberman's conviction on one count, juror Mark E. Powers, 38, a San Diego  machinist, said he stuck to his decision even after it was apparent he had  deadlocked the jury on several other charges.  </P> <P> Other jurors "weren't dealing with the law" but wanted desperately to convict  Silberman, a one-time governor's aide, and were ready to ignore jury  instructions to do it, Powers said. "They were dealing with their moral  indignation with what had happened," he said.  </P> <P> But, Powers said, "the law is emotionless." And, he added, "I do not do things  illogically."  </P> <P> He said he was not convinced that Silberman had the necessary intent to launder  cash at any time before he was approached in 1988 by an undercover FBI agent  posing as a front man for Colombian drug lords.  </P> <P> If only a tape recorder that agent Peter Ahearn wore to his first meeting with  Silberman had worked, "that would have clinched it," Powers said.  </P> <P> Powers also disclosed that he was convicted about 20 years ago for possession  of a controlled substance and received four years' probation. He said the  lawyers in the case knew about his record but left him in the jury pool.  </P> <P> "There were like 30 or 40 people around, and I was the one that got nailed" for  possessing an amphetamine, Powers said. He said he made a plea bargain but  declined to provide other details.  </P> <P> Powers said the 2-month-long trial, as well as having to discuss his own  conviction, have already caused him grief.  </P> <P> "You've read the papers: I'm the holdout," he said. "There's no way I was the  holdout. I was just trying to do my job the way the judge told me to do it."  </P> <P> Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown  Jr., was convicted last Thursday of one count in the complex case. He was found  guilty of violating a federal currency law and was sent immediately to jail  without bail by U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving.  </P> <P> On Friday, the jury announced it was deadlocked on the remaining counts. Irving  declared a mistrial, but sent Silberman back to jail to await formal sentencing  Sept. 25.  </P> <P> Silberman, who is married to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, could  draw as much as 10 years in federal prison, but new sentencing guidelines  suggest that a term of one to five years is likely.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder has already announced that he intends to  retry Silberman on the unresolved charges. Lead defense lawyer James J.  Brosnahan has said he will appeal the conviction.  </P> <P> Silberman was arrested in April, 1989, in a San Diego hotel room. By then,  prosecutors contend, he already had made two money-laundering deals, using cash  supplied by undercover FBI agent Ahearn, and was negotiating with Ahearn for a  third.  </P> <P> The first deal was a November, 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock in a  Silberman gold-mining company. The second was a February, 1989, swap of  $200,000 for untraceable U.S. Treasury bonds.  </P> <P> The jury deadlocked, 11 to 1 for conviction, on the three central counts in the  case: two counts of money laundering and a single count of conspiring to  launder cash. Powers left the federal courthouse after jurors were dismissed  last Friday without talking to reporters.  </P> <P> But he said Tuesday that the law required the jury to find not only that  Silberman believed that the cash Ahearn supplied was from unlawful funds but  also, specifically, that it was drug money, Powers said.  </P> <P> Powers said all the jurors agreed that Silberman believed the cash was tainted.  But, he said, "It was very unclear in the very beginning of the investigation  whether Silberman actually knew it was drug money."  </P> <P> When Ahearn met Silberman on Nov. 9, 1988, the financier had committed no  crimes, Powers said. Without clear proof that Silberman knew from the very  start that Ahearn's money purportedly came from Colombian drug proceeds, the  government had not proved, as it had to do, that Silberman had not been  entrapped, Powers said.  </P> <P> Silberman asserted as a defense that he was entrapped -- that is, that he was  induced into crimes, if they occurred, by the FBI.  </P> <P> Ahearn testified that, at the Nov. 9 meeting, he made it clear that his money  came from Colombian drug trafficking. Silberman testified that Ahearn led him  to believe that the money was from Mexican investors who sought confidentiality  in their financial dealings.  </P> <P> "Your word against my word," Powers said. "You need more than that to me for  proof beyond a reasonable doubt."  </P> <P> Ahearn also testified that he hid a tape recorder in his left sock for the Nov.  9 meeting but that the recorder malfunctioned. And Powers said he found  Ahearn's credibility lacking because the agent was a "mysterious, evasive  person."  </P> <P> Powers also said that, only after Ahearn and Silberman met Feb. 7, 1989, and  the agent explicitly said that the cash came from a "bunch of . . . Colombian  drug lords," was it clear that Silberman had to have understood that the funds  supposedly were drug money.  </P> <P> "So they had him," Powers said. "What's he going to do? Go to the cops?"  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Powers said, what Silberman knew at that point was not relevant  to proving he had the intent to launder cash even before he met Ahearn.  </P> <P> "Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't intending to do something," but even if he was,  that was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, Powers said.  </P> <P> Powers said his views caused "some pretty strong sentiment" in the jury room.  </P> <P> "People were telling me over and over again, 'Don't pay any attention to that,  " he said, referring to the instruction that the cash had to be drug money.  "But, I said, 'Why did they put it here if they didn't want us to read it?' "  </P> <P> At one point, Powers said, jury foreman John T. Uliasz, 38, a Santee nurse,  told him: " 'Mark, we are the law. We interpret the law.' I got real upset  about that. That's the judge's responsibility. The law is the law. That's the  only thing that's black and white in this case, and that's the law.  </P> <P> "I blew up a couple times," Powers said. "How would you feel about it if you  were told, 'Don't read that'? You're talking about trying to find out. The  foreman says, 'I don't want to look stupid to people by asking questions.' I  got no problem asking questions."  </P> <P> Testimony from Jack Norman Myers, a longtime associate of Silberman's who said  he knew throughout that the two deals were illegal, proved that Silberman had  the necessary intent all along to evade the requirement of reporting all cash  transactions of more than $10,000, Powers said. That led to the sole  conviction, he said.  </P> <P> "Myers was the case," he said. "If they didn't have Myers, they wouldn't have  anything."  </P> <P> He said he had no particular feelings about Gorder's decision to retry  Silberman. "That's a very difficult question for me to answer," he said,  "because I have a much dimmer view of the ability of people to separate their  emotions from the law."  </P></p>

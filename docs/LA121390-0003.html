			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Gianni, 3333 Bear St., Costa Mesa. The bar is open 10 a.m to 10 p.m. Monday  through Saturday and 11 a.m to 7 p.m. Sunday. (714) 540-3365.  </P> <P> A mall bar that offers sightseeing as a chaser. Perched a few feet above the  slipperly main drag of Crystal Court, and tucked inside an Italian restaurant,  this bar offers a Kodak view of bustling shoppers and a peaceful respite from  the masses. It may be the next best thing to a Sharper Image store for killing  time.  </P> <P> Tia Juana's Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe Deluxe, 14988 Sand Canyon Ave., Irvine.  The bar is open 11 a.m to midnight Sunday through Thursday, till 1:30 a.m.  Friday and Saturday. (714) 551-2998. Housed inside a restored 95-year-old lima  bean warehouse, this is the kind of cavernous bar where you might actually have  room to breathe. Order a cerveza (they claim to serve any Mexican beer you can  name) or a hand-shaken margarita, and pretend you're inside some upscale,  south-of-the-border restaurant that actually has napkins.

The file must be identified. If a 30 second point data file is used, the elevation data must be processed for intermediate points using interpolation techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. In cases of dispute, average terrain elevation determinations can also be done manually, if the results differ significantly from the computer derived averages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers (2 and 10 miles) extending radially from the antenna site. If a portion of the radial path extends over foreign territory or water, such portion must not be included in the computation of average elevation unless the radial path again passes over United States land between 16 and 134 kilometers (10 and 83 miles) away from the station. At least 50 evenly spaced data points for each radial should be used in the computation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For locations in Dade and Broward Counties, Florida, the method prescribed above may be used or average terrain elevation may be assumed to be 3 meters (10 feet). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.161 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Application requirements for ASSB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for base stations employing amplitude compandored single sideband modulation (ASSB) must contain the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The application must describe fully the modulation characteristics, emission and occupied bandwidth, and specify the center frequency of the emission for each channel, carrier frequency, and pilot channels, if any. The emission must fall completely within a channel assignable for two-way operation in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, Rural Radiotelephone Service or Offshore Radiotelephone Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The application must contain interference studies between stations within an authorized bandwidth, whether FM-to-ASSB, ASSB-to-FM, or ASSB-to-ASSB in accordance with the following: For ASSB stations, the transmitter nearest to the protected station must be used. The effective radiated power in the direction of the protected station must be the sum of the peak effective radiated power of all transmitters in the group, in the direction of the protected station. The antenna center of radiation height above average terrain must be the highest antenna center of radiation height of any transmitter in the group in the direction of the protected station. The channel of the group is assumed to be the same as that of the protected station (co-channel), and studies must be made in accordance with &sect;22.567. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.163 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Minor modifications to existing stations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Licensees may make modifications to existing stations without obtaining prior Commission approval provided: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classification as minor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

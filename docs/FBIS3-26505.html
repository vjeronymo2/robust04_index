A council task force formed to evaluate the impact of GATT  on  the local economy said, though, that the rice-growing sector  won't be as negatively affected as at first thought. Taiwan is  expected to become a signatory to GATT by the end of the year.    Council Vice Chairman Hsue Chih said stock breeders and  fruit  farmers will be most affected by GATT membership, as the  international trade body will require Taiwan to slash tariffs on  farm products and abolish its quota system and import  limitations.    Taiwan's gradual opening of its rice market, along with  subsidiary payments to rice farmers, should keep the impact of  GATT on those farmers to a minimum Hsue said.</p>

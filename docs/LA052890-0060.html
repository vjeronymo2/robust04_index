			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT  </P> <P> A summary of Southern California-related business litigation developments  during the past week.  </P> <P> Visitors Bureau Sued Over Firing: The former president of the Los Angeles  Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau filed a breach-of-contract suit Tuesday,  claiming that the organization defrauded him when he was fired in September,  1989. The Los Angeles Superior Court case by Bill F. Miller says the bureau and  its chairman, John F. Llewellyn, did not point out that his employment contract  was automatically renewed on a yearly basis when he signed an amendment that  turned out to waive that right. Miller seeks damages of more than $200,000 plus  punitives and seven months of his $130,000-per-year salary as severance. (Filed  May 22, 1990. Case No. BC001729)  </P></p>

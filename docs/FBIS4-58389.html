			<p>BFN     [Text] The leaders of the opposition have submitted a draft  bill to disband the Knesset and to hold new elections. The  argument attached to the motion states that the prime minister  has been grossly violating specific commitments he made on the  eve of the elections to the 13th Knesset. According to the  opposition, a minority government, whose performance has been  gradually deteriorating, cannot possibly stay in office and  endanger Israel's security. Consequently, the leaders of the  opposition argue, the 13th Knesset must disband so that the  people may have their say in new elections and decide who  deserves to lead it.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 4 May adds:  "The Likud says that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has once again  proven his inability to protect Israel's basic interests. The  Likud's spokesman says that the man who until a few months ago  promised a Palestinian tiny spot in the town of Jericho has  given away more than 60 square km of Palestinian sovereignty in  the Jordan Valley on a silver platter, and he is not yet done."]</p>

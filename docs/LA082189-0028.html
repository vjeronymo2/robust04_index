			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Don Henley has a gripe against his ex-band mate, Joe Walsh, who is touring with  Ringo Starr and performing what Henley describes as "the phony version of 'Life  in the Fast Lane.' " "I don't know why he feels compelled to do that song,"  Henley told the Baltimore Sun. "Nobody else is doing that kind of thing. I'm  sort of puzzled as to why he doesn't do one of his own songs. But I never could  figure the guy out, so why start now?" Henley said he not only sang that Eagles  classic on the original record, but also wrote "about half of it." Walsh, on  the other hand, "really didn't have hardly anything to do with it. He wrote the  little guitar riff that's in the introduction of the song, and that's basically  all."

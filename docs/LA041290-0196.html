			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OUT AND ABOUT;  </P> <P> VINTAGE LOOK WON'T WAIT FOR HALLOWEEN  </P> <P> Connie Victoria is always hearing about her clothes. She's used to it, as you  have to be if you don't wear anything less than 40 years old.  </P> <P> "I don't care what people think," she says. "I wear what I like."  </P> <P> Dressed in a decidedly offbeat ensemble -- a long denim skirt paired with a  lacy T-shirt and denim fringes -- Victoria shows off her vintage clothing store  in Ventura, Street Scene Classics.  </P> <P> A sleeveless black chiffon number with wine-colored lace and matching costume  jewelry from the 1930s is displayed outside the door. A 1940s wedding dress and  a white veil hang on the wall. A silk afternoon dress from the 1920s hangs in  one corner.  </P> <P> Clothing comes in lace, brocade and velvet, and with gloves, hats, shoes and  costume jewelry, dating from the 1920s to the present. Both sexes are  represented. None of it is in any sort of order.  </P> <P> Victoria haunts estate sales, swap meets and garage sales. Treasures usually  get a cleaning, but only one-fourth need repair, she said. "They're made so  well," she said. "Everything is lined."  </P> <P> Ballroom dancing allows her to show off her wardrobe, Victoria said, but most  customers don't generally wait for a costume ball or Halloween to dress up.  They tend to be "weird people, just like me, who want to have fun." PEGGY Y.

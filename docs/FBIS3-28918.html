			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, feb. 13 KYODO -- Japan's major dailies  urged Japan and the United States Sunday to find a breakthrough  in the collapsed bilateral trade negotiations by making the best  use of a cooling off period.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN said, "If the world's two economic  superpowers...retaliate against each other by taking protective  trade steps, damage to the global economy would be great," and  urged the two countries to handle the situation with a long-term  perspective. Commenting on Friday's summit talks between  Japanese prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton in Washington over bilateral framework trade talks,  the leading daily said, "the summit sessions made people feel  Japan-U.S. relations entered into a new stage."    Hosokawa and Clinton could not reach an accord on the  framework talks to slash Japan's trade surplus and open its  markets. "In many of the previous Japan-U.S. summit talks, the  Japanese side gave in considerably to (U.S. demands) to keep the  alliance, thus causing anti-U.S. feelings to spread in Japan,  and coating the surface with vague agreements, leaving seeds of  dispute."    "Hosokawa and Clinton frankly said `no' to each other on the  economic issues and (such a way) is better than the practice in  previous summit talks, in which success was an imperative goal,"  the ASAHI said in its editorial. In order to make use of the  establishment of "a mature adult relationship," the daily,  however, urged the two countries not to let economic  confrontation spill over into overall bilateral ties, and it  asked Japan to act on opening its markets and reducing the trade  surplus.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN also urged the two countries to set up  a  cooling off period and probe a strategy for mutual prosperity  and existence, saying, "the development of the U.S. economy  hinges on the extent it takes hold in Asia and (for that reason)  cooperation between Japan and the U.S. is indispensable."    The daily said, "the bickering between Japanese and U.S.  Administrations did not reflect the competence of or cooperation  among private sectors."    Noting views that the U.S. electronics and auto industries  have regained competitive strength with the improved U.S.  economy, that Japan is no longer a threat to the U.S. economy,  and that Japan's current account surplus is shrinking sharply,  the daily said "(we) should not react excessively to the  disagreement (on the trade negotiations)." There are many  factors that time would solve even if (the two countries) do not  do anything," it said.    The largest circulation daily the YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "we  believe the summit meeting reflected a post-Cold War  relationship between Japan and the United States that is  reaching a new, mature stage."    The daily expressed hope that both Japan and the U.S. would  resume talks by making good use of a cooling off period, saying,  "the maintenance of positive bilateral relations between Japan  and the United States is important for the security of Asia as  well as the rest of the world."    "As Japan-U.S. relations mature, both nations must fulfill  their responsibilities as mature nations. In this respect,  Japan must implement what it can do as quickly as it can," the  YOMIURI said. "Above all, Japan must deregulate its economy and  improve government procurement, which the government can do on  its own," the daily added.    The daily also urged Japan to pursue the further realization  of opening its markets by getting the stagnating economy on  track through stimulating domestic demand with flexible fiscal  and financial measures, as well as more strictly applying the  antimonopoly law. It asked the U.S. to reconsider ways to  promote foreign access to Japanese markets, saying "we can never  agree with the idea of setting unilateral numerical targets and  threatening to impose trade sanctions against Japan."    The leading economic daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said, "Japan  and the U.S. are in a state of economic war in the wake of the  breakdown of the framework trade talks." Expressing concern  that emotional confrontation could spread between the two  countries, the daily said, "it is important that Japan and the  U.S. try to strengthen bilateral relations by all means."    "Numerical targets demanded by the U.S. would surely lead to  managed trade...but the Japanese side also made a mistake by  saying only `no' to the matter and did not act on opening  markets, delaying pump-priming measures," it said.    "The biggest mistake was that both Japan and the U.S. faced  off without taking into account the chaotic post-Cold War  world," the NIHON KEIZAI said.</p>

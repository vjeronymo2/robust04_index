			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report in the "Crisis" column under general </F> headline: "Stop Any Negotiations With the Bosnian Serbs. This  Has Been Urged by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation  President's Special Envoy"]    [Text] It seems that the latest negotiations by Kozyrev in  Belgrade and Churkin in Pale were used by Milosevic and Karadzic  in their purely egoistic interests. In this event it appears  that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who accused the  Serbs of spinning a web of lies and deceptive statements about  their intentions in Gorazde, is right. According to him, "the  Serbs are lying to the United Nations and even to their  traditional ally, Russia."    This probably accounts for the sharpness of Vitaliy  Churkin's  statement. Incidentally, the West missed no chance of noting  that the Serbs' tactics in Gorazde annoy the Russian leadership.  This led to the conclusion that Moscow may not after all have  so many levers to influence them. And even that relations  between it and Belgrade are not as friendly as was thought  earlier. In this context it is supposed that President Yeltsin,  whose statement on the Bosnian crisis was expected yesterday,  will take all this into account and start cooperating with the  West more closely. It is unlikely, however, that the  presidential statement will coincide in tone with Churkin's  pronouncements.    The latter, if facing far from easy explanations to the  parliament, the unmistakably pro-Serbian mood of the majority of  whose deputies is well known. Apparently Churkin will also have  a dialogue with the military who up until now have had certain  disagreements with the Foreign Ministry's position on a number  of issues. It would be premature in these conditions to talk  about a radical change of line in Russia's policy in the  Balkans. It is clear, however, that it can be essentially  adjusted, which does not bode any comfort to the "cheats" from  the Serb leadership both in Pale and Belgrade. But in any  event, it is hard to expect that on the question of a Balkan  settlement Russia will resort to the children's formula, "the  cat has left her kittens...." ["koshka brosila kotyat"]</p>

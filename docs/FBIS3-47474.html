The meeting, scheduled in Moscow as the first talks on the  territorial row between the two sides since Russian President  Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last October, is being postponed at  Russia's request, the official said on condition of anonymity.    The official quoted Russian officials as citing as an  obstacle mobility of personnel in the wake of Russia's  parliamentary elections in December.    Japan claims four Russian-held islands off the northernmost  main island of Hokkaido. The islands -- Shikotan, Kunashiri,  Etorofu and the Habomai islets -- were seized by the former  Soviet Union at the end of World War II.</p>

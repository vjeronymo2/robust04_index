			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Mixed results at Marriott and Hilton MARRIOTT and Hilton Hotels, two of the largest quoted US hotel groups, unveiled first-quarter results yesterday which reflected mixed experiences in the lodging market. Marriott's lodging operations saw a 17 per cent rise in operating profits in the quarter, although revenues were up by only 3 per cent. In the full-service hotel sector, the group saw a gain of 3 percentage points in occupancy levels, while room-rates were generally static. But, in the mid-price and economy segment, Marriott reported higher room-rates. Occupancy at the Courtyard and Residence Inn chains improved, while Fairfield Inn, the economy chain, saw a one percentage point drop in occupancy levels. The profits advances in the lodging division helped Marriott to a net profit before accounting-related changes of Dollars 19m, up from Dollars 11m last time. Sales were Dollars 2.08bn compared with Dollars 1.95bn. Contract services, the group's other large division, saw a 25 per cent gain in operating profits. Hilton said its hotels division saw a 3 per cent decline in operating profits in the first quarter. Occupancy rose by 4 percentage points, but room rates remained flat and dipped in some important markets. In Hilton's gaming division, business was more encouraging, leading to an 18 per cent advance in operating profits. That left the group overall posting a 4 per cent increase in after-tax profits, at Dollars 23.1m, before accounting-related changes. Total revenues were up by one-fifth at Dollars 331.6m.</p>

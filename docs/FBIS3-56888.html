Satellite "Gals", designed at the scientific production  amalgam of applied mechanics (Krasnoyarsk-26 city), is the new  generation of tv relay satellites. This launch will pave the  way to the creation of a new television satellite system of five  similar space apparatuses.    The satellite is equipped with a three-mast onboard relay-  transmitter, ensuring retransmission of regional television  programmes through small dimension 90 cm. diameter individual  receiving antennas. The space apparatus will be put into a near  geo-stationary orbit of 90 degrees eastern longitude  approximately seven hours after the blast off (scheduled for  12:53 hours Moscow time). Later it will be manouvered to a  stationary position of 44 degrees eastern longitude, where it  will be used for the main purpose it is meant for.    "Gals" will be the first automatic satellite to be launched  by the military space forces of Russia from the Baykonur  cosmodrome in 1994.</p>

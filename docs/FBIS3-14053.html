Speaking from the Foreign Ministry's regular  forum today, Dr. Abu-Salih said the success of the current round  of negotiations in Nairobi between the government and the  rebellion basically depended on starting it from the point at  which the earlier talks had ended.    His excellency referred to Sudan's participation in the Arab  League meeting to be held at foreign minister level in Cairo on  26 March, saying that the participants would discuss Arab  security and, for the first time, southern Sudan in the context  of foreign interference there and attempts to exploit the issue  for personal interests. Dr. Abu-Salih stressed that there were  quarters striving to perpetuate the war in the south in the  service of their interests. His excellency denied reports to  the effect that Sudan lacked seriousness in solving the southern  issue.    The foreign minister also referred to the visit of an envoy  of the American President and a U.S. representative to Sudan  expected by the end of March with the aim of studying the  efforts being made to establish peace in the country.    Ambassador Mahdi Ibrahim, director of the Political  Department at the Foreign Ministry, also speaking from the  forum, reported that a Romanian delegation would be visiting the  country with a view to developing bilateral relations.    Ambassador 'Abd-al-Hadi Siddiq, director of the Horn of  Africa Department at the Foreign Ministry, reported that a  Sudanese delegation would participate in the seventh African  conference to be held in Kampala in April.</p>

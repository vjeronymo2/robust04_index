			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The largest transactions of the week were recorded at two of the giants of the City. SG Warburg has a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 1.6bn, but its share price has been hit over the past year. Board members have sold stock at various times, the most recent being Oscar Lewisohn, an executive director, who disposed of 70,000 shares - more than a third of his holding - at 758.5p. Smith New Court is another large financial house where directors have been sellers. Michael Marks, the chief executive, and Brian Mackley have sold a total of 90,000 shares at 405p. Both retain large stakes in the company. Neil Chisman has been finance director at Stakis, the hotel and casino operator, since 1989 and his holding is now the second largest after Sir Reo Stakis, the founder and president. Over the past 12 months, the shares have had a period of considerable outperformance, although this has tailed off over the summer. The sale of nearly 22,500 by Chisman leaves him with more than 127,000.

During the same period, a total of  1,976 terrorists were captured. Of these 865 terrorists were  caught in the state of emergency region. Mentese added that 88  terrorists surrendered to the security forces in the same period.    In a statement he issued today, the interior minister  reported that a group of militants -- comprised of approximately  4,500 persons -- was neutralized as a result of intelligence  work and weakening within the organization.

In northern Iraq, Mentese reported, 79 terrorists  were killed and two were captured.    Pointing out that nothing can be achieved through terrorism,  Mentese reiterated his call on the youth, who are deceived by  the PKK, to surrender as soon as possible and benefit from the  repentance law.</p>

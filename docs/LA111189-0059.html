			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Protea species  </P> <P> Protea  </P> <P> Evergreen shrubs with spectacular flowers  </P> <P> Thousands of protea flowers are flown in from Hawaii every day, displayed in  fancy florist shops and eagerly purchased by patrons of beauty willing to shell  out $6 to $18 per stem.  </P> <P> Proteas last for two weeks in a vase if the water is changed and a bit of stem  cut off daily. If you want them to last even longer, hang them upside down for  several days until they dry out completely; dried proteas can be used in  bouquets or holiday wreaths; no one will be blase about such a gift.  </P> <P> The most popular is Protea cynaroides, the king protea, which has wide-open  petals, often pink and white, around a center mound. Other varieties in  assorted colors have petals that fold in tightly. Pink Mink (P. neriifolia),  another favorite with the floral trade, doesn't open up but keeps a cylindrical  shape; it comes in green and a dark, moody pink with black petal tips.  </P> <P> Related species, all members of the Proteaceae family, include Banksia,  Leucodendron and Leucospermum, all with eye-popping flowers. And these are just  a few of the color and shape variations. Proteas, native to South Africa and  Australia, have been compared to thistles, artichoke flowers, even bird  feathers, but this is a futile exercise; proteas are uniquely beautiful. And,  if you can find them in nurseries, they are in bloom right now.  </P> <P> Protea growers in Southern California recommend planting the shrubs in sandy or  gravelly soil (preferably on a slope) in a sunny location where they won't get  much water or attention -- or nutrients. Smaller proteas (some of the larger  ones can reach 12 feet in height) can be grown in large tubs with a very acid  soil mix similar to that for azaleas.  </P> <P> Proteas in the ground should be watered once a week during the first year and  thereafter during hot summers, and every two weeks (or not at all) during  winter and spring. (The general rule: Never water a protea unless it's dry.)  Plants in containers, of course, dry out faster. And while most proteas are  frost-tender, several species can survive temperatures as low as 25 degrees.  </P> <P> Proteas are difficult to grow from seed and almost as difficult to find as  plants, although their popularity is growing. Seeds are available from Thompson  &amp; Morgan, P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J. 08527; five seeds cost $4.45.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Nursery &amp; Florist in San Gabriel stocks proteas in five-gallon  cans for $29. Walter Anderson Nursery in San Diego sells two-gallon sleeves for  $7.99 and up, and Turk Hessellund Nursery in Montecito carries proteas in  4-inch pots, 2-gallon sleeves, 5-gallon pots and 15-gallon containers. Prices  range from $7.50 to $100. JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

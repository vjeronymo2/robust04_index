			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Mobile phone companies win in Pakistan crisis Pakistani businessmen are traditionally inclined to blame political turmoil for their sufferings and commercial difficulties. But political infighting and uncertainty bring the reverse results for the country's two mobile telephone companies. Mobile phones, previously an important status symbol for Pakistani politicians, have become invaluable political tools for times of crisis when politicians have to outsmart their rivals. Next Wednesday's vote of no confidence against Mr Sabir Shah, Chief Minister of the North West Frontier Province, has put politicians at loggerheads. However, the phone companies are expecting a 15 to 20 per cent increase in revenues. The move to oust Mr Shah has the support of Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister, and may end with the chief minister's downfall. Mr Shah is backed by the Moslem League party of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader. Tempers have been running high. Mr Sharif's supporters have warned of an armed confrontation and some have urged their followers to physically resist any move to replace the Shah government. Both sides have accused each other of 'horse-trading' and efforts to bribe MPs to make them change sides. 'Mobile phones help to minimise horse-trading. Members of the house can be taken away to safe places. They can still keep in touch with friends, but its much harder for anyone to approach them and offer money,' says an opposition MP in Islamabad. 'Every political being wants a mobile phone. They feel that it can't be tapped. They feel secure about it,' says Mr Iftikhar Gillani, another opposition MP. However, mobile phones remain beyond the reach of ordinary Pakistanis. The two companies - Paktel and Instaphone provide a service to only 25,000 clients - a tiny proportion in a population of 120m. Charging between Rs1,000 (Pounds 22.50) and Rs2,000 in a flat fee allowing up to 450 minutes of free airtime per month, the mobile companies are almost three times as expensive as the conventional phone network. But costs are not deterring new investors from entering the market - a third phone company is expected soon.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PLOTS THICKEN  </P> <P> I was shocked to learn that the "Buena Park Community" is the only one of its  kind in Orange County (June 5).  </P> <P> Since February, my daughter and I have weeded, dug, planted and harvested two  plots in the "Community Organic Garden" at Golden West College in Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> The peas, broccoli, red and green cabbage, strawberries, lettuce, cucumbers,  zucchini, onions, carrots, etc., are now so abundant that we are able to not  only enjoy a very healthy and tasty diet ourselves but also share our harvests  with our neighbors and friends.  </P> <P> More experienced gardeners have been wonderful about sharing their "tips" on  composting, mulching, gopher control, etc. In addition to our individual plots,  we have community areas with fruit trees, herbs, flowers and berries.  </P> <P> I am extremely grateful to Golden West College for providing the opportunity to  the community to participate in this ecologically sound as well as healthy  activity.  </P> <P> DAWN C.

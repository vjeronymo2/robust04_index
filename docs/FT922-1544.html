			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (7): At the tip of an iceberg - The Fixings AT 10.30 am and 3.00 pm every working day N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons hosts one of the City of London's most select parties - the London gold fixing. It is select but far from exclusive. The five members of the fixing committee constitute the tip of an iceberg that incorporates virtually the whole of the world gold market. The five - representatives of Rothschild (traditionally chairman of the fixing committee), Samuel Montagu, Mocatta and Goldsmid, Sharps Pixley and Mase Westpac - are in constant contact with their dealing rooms, which are in turn in touch with traders around the globe. The fix begins with the chairman naming a price that he has chosen on the basis of pre-fix trading activity. That is relayed through the dealers to their customers, who respond with pledges to buy or sell at that price certain quantities of good delivery bars of about 12.5 kg (worth about Dollars 135,000 each). These pledges are netted by the individual fix members who then announce if they are sellers, in which case they specify the amount, or buyers, in which case they do not state the size of their bids. If there are no sellers the price is raised; if no buyers, it is lowered. When both buyers and sellers are declared, the chairman asks for 'figures please' and the volume of bids is announced. If the bids outweigh the offers the price is raised, if the sellers are in the majority it is lowered. The process continues until the price is found that achieves equilibrium between bids and offers. This is indicated by the miniature Union Jacks that are placed in front of each committee member being laid on their sides, following which the chairman cries 'fixed'. However, there is no rush. Market conditions can change by the minute and buyers and sellers can change their minds. Any committee member can halt the proceedings by calling 'flag up' and raising his little Union Jack while he consults with his trading room. The whole process can sometimes be completed in minutes, but it has been known to take two hours when the market is in a particularly excitable mood. The fixing ritual, though venerable, is far from ancient. It dates from Britain's abandonment of the gold standard during the First World War. Until then the Bank of England stood ready to buy any amount of gold at Pounds 3.17.9d a troy ounce and to sell at Pounds 3.17.10 1/2 d. During the war the bank bought all South Africa's gold output at Pounds 4.4.11d, but when sterling was devalued against the US dollar in 1919 it was persuaded to allow all South African gold, about half the world's output, to be sold by N. M. Rothschild 'at the best price obtainable, giving the London market and the bullion brokers a chance to bid'. The first fixing took place, by telephone, on September 12 of that year and the price was Pounds 4.18.9d, reflecting the higher grade being offered and a premium on account of sterling's depreciation against the dollar. For nearly 50 years - except during the attempt to reimpose a gold standard for sterling in the period 1925-31 and from the start of the Second World War till 1954 - the fixing thrived, principally as the outlet for South African gold, with the Reserve Bank of South Africa using the Bank of England as its selling agent. The Bank of England operated on the re-opened market, as did other central banks, to hold the price at Dollars 35 an ounce for reasons of monetary policy. This was in accordance with President Roosevelt's 1934 decision, confirmed by the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. As upward price pressure built up the London Gold Pool was formed in 1961, with the Bank of England acting on behalf of Britain, the US, Belgium, France, Italy the Netherlands, Switzerland and West Germany to maintain that price. However, pressure continued to build up, with Soviet gold sales drying up, sterling under pressure and the US suffering from balance of payments difficulties as well as the Vietnam War. Despairing attempts to hold the line after sterling's 1967 devaluation were finally abandoned on March 15, 1968 when Mr Roy Jenkins, the Labour chancellor of the exchequer, announced that the gold market had been closed 'at the request of the US'. When the London gold market opened its doors again two weeks later it was on a world that was scarcely recognisable, and the role of the fixing had changed for ever. South Africa had switched much of its business to a new pool of Swiss banks operating through the Zurich market and a two-tier market had been established. Central banks traded among themselves at the official Dollars 35 price and other business - for speculators, hoarders, jewellery and other industrial users - was conducted in a free market. 'That year really was the watershed in London's history,' said Timothy Green in his book The New World of Gold. 'The story really does divide before and after 1968. As one dealer put it, 'We used to be a distribution centre for South African and other people's gold; now it is a market place, a trading forum'.' Throwing complacency to the wind, the London market introduced the second fixing at 3 pm and started to fix the price in dollars; both moves being designed to attract US market operators. Since then the London fixing has become as important an institution in the new, investor-based market as it was when central banks ruled the roost. The price levels it sets apply to a relatively small amount of the business done in a round-the-clock market. But they are valuable snapshots (sometimes time-exposures) of the state of the market and investors know that the fixing price results from the matching of a substantial volume of business. For this reason producer sales are often tied to the fixing price and many central banks use a fixing average in revaluing their gold holdings. The actual amount of business done at the fixings remains a secret, though some traders feel that, in the interest of market transparency, daily volume figures should be published. Prominent among these is Mr Robert Guy, who recently stepped down as chairman of the London Bullion Market Association. But others argue that such information would be meaningless as fixing volume represents only the sum of the unmatched business of myriad individual traders and would give little idea of the true extent of the business covered by the fixing price. For the time being, therefore, it seems likely that the market will retain some of its mystery and that the stock response to a query on the level of turnover will continue to be 'oh, several tons'.</p>

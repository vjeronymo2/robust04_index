			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: US groups renew attack on BA deal THE BEHAVIOUR of British Airways towards Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is being cited by the 'big three' US carriers as a reason why the US Department of Transportation should hold a full inquiry into BA's proposed tie-up with USAir. The Virgin affair surfaces in the latest letter from the chief executives of American, United and Delta Air Lines to Mr Federico Pena, the new US transportation secretary. It resulted in British Airways settling a 'dirty tricks' libel action last month, and paying damages to Virgin. 'Given BA's campaign last year to gain control of USAir, the timing of last month's transaction, BA's reference to potential additional investments in USAir of up to Dollars 450m, and BA management's recent admissions of anti-competitive behaviour against its largest UK competitor, the Department cannot accept BA's claim of non-control without a full and public inquiry,' they maintain. The missive is the latest in a war of words which followed BA's announcement last month that it had invested Dollars 300m in USAir in return for potential 19.9 per cent voting interest. This new agreement between BA and USAir also allows the UK carrier to invest a further Dollars 450m over a five-year period if foreign control provisions permit, and is accompanied by plans for code-sharing by the two airlines, which they are seeking to implement from May 1. BA and USAir have argued that the code-sharing arrangement, which would lead to some integration of their operations, is authorised by the UK-US aviation bilateral, following a revision in 1991 which allowed American and United into Heathrow. However, the US carriers complained to Mr Pena that the Heathrow agreement did not address 'the issue of code-sharing with a US carrier in which a British carrier holds a substantial equity interest'. 'Furthermore, BA's equity stake in USAir constitutes precisely the kind of 'changed circumstances' that the UK government invoked as a basis for extracting significant concessions as a prerequisite to permitting United's and American's entry into Heathrow. 'Since BA's proposal will have an 'undue effect' on US air carriers, US denial of code-sharing authority is justified within the framework of the existing bilateral agreement.' The DoT, which is responsible for authorising the code-sharing agreement, has yet to decide how to proceed on the new BA-USAir tie-up. It said last year that it would not have BA's earlier Dollars 750m investment plan for USAir.</p>

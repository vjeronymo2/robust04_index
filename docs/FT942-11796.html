			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Back to the pork barrel When is a manufacturing subsidy not a subsidy? The answer is when it is a 'focused research and development incentives programme'. This is the Clinton administration's euphemism for its decision to underwrite the development of a commercial industry to make flat panel displays, such as those used in portable computers or aircraft cockpit displays. And it raises troubling questions about a developing trend in US industrial policy. Two themes are emerging. Government research money is being redirected away from specific military projects towards more general commercial ventures. Old fashioned industrial intervention is being glossed up and justified under the heading of technology policy. But the familiar shape of the pork barrel is already discernible. The defence department acknowledges that its requirements for flat panel displays will never amount to much more than about 5 per cent of the rapidly growing US market. It also concedes that established foreign suppliers - all from Japan - are already in a position to provide affordable products. But it is worried about assured and early access to leading edge technology in what will be the essential interface for the battleground of the future. Research grants So it is prepared to offer substantial research grants to those private sector companies which are willing to commit themselves to build production facilities. It envisages providing support for four world-scale manufacturing facilities over the next five years, which will have the capacity to take some 15 per cent of the world market for flat panel displays. The initiative will cost the US taxpayer around Dollars 110m to Dollars 120m a year over that period. This development is worrying for several reasons. First, it suggests that R&amp;D subsidies - which the Clinton fought to preserve during the Uruguay round - are being abused in order to help domestic manufacturing industry. Next, there is a long history in the US and elsewhere of government funds being wasted under the heading of strategic technology policy. The attempt to build a commercial synthetic fuels industry and the supersonic transport project are only two of the more egregious examples. All the evidence is that the net impact on productivity of US government R&amp;D spending is lower than the return on privately funded spending, and may even be negative. It is highly uncertain whether the latest initiative will be any more successful, given that the Japanese are already several years ahead in terms of technology. Innovative designs Moreover, these initiatives invariably favour older, established companies at the expense of innovators. A case in point is Sematech, the government-backed consortium for semiconductor manufacturing technology. It is true that the US chip industry has recovered well in recent years, but this has been based as much on innovative designs as on the manufacturing technology which Sematech was designed to enhance. Finally, the arguments being used to justify the flat panel display project could easily be extended to cover a host of other industries where the Japanese have a big commercial lead - from ceramics to machining. The defence department has an enormous shopping list: where is the line to be drawn? All this is not to say that the US administration is powerless to help. It could mount an assault on the Pentagon's extraordinarily cumbersome and bureaucratic procurement procedures, in order to speed up the transfer of advanced technology and reduce development costs. It could simplify the patent system, and revise anti-trust procedures in order to make it easier for companies to come together in joint ventures to develop new technologies. It could consider putting temporary tax incentives for private sector research on to a permanent footing. A policy of doling out money to companies to help them get back into an industry which they have abandoned is not likely to succeed. What is worse is that it will encourage other governments, notably in the European Union, down the same slippery path.</p>

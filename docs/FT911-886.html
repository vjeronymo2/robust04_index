			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Poaching seen as big obstacle to training TRAINING and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) should promote practical measures to tackle skills shortages, according to a report by the Business Strategies research group, published yesterday. Reviewing the role of Tecs, the group says the threat of poaching is the most serious obstacle to skill training. As training levies are 'unlikely to be implemented in the near future', Tecs should concentrate on removing other barriers that contribute to skill shortages. Those include practical child-care issues, which preclude women from working, and lack of information for companies about local skills training and the mobility of labour. 'Most of these functions are performed already by specialist companies or individuals, but not comprehensively and certainly not in an integrated fashion,' the report says. Mr Richard Holt, senior economist at Business Strategies, said: 'This is not just a problem for Tecs to deal with, it is also up to major employers to help improve labour supply mismatches. There is a major business opportunity for the Employment Service companies to provide a far more integrated recruitment, relocation and retraining service.' Figures published by the Department of Employment yesterday show that more than half of all unemployed people of working age - 57 per cent last year - have some academic qualifications. That is a slight increase on 1989, when 55 per cent of unemployed people had qualifications, the 1990 labour force survey says.

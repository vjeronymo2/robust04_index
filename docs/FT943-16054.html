			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cellnet lifts Securicor to Pounds 37m Securicor Group, the communications, security and parcels business, yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 37m, following a sharply improved performance by Cellnet, its 40 per cent owned mobile phone network. The telephone company saw profits rise from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 26.9m as its subscriber base expanded by 55 per cent to 1.15m customers. Its contribution lifted profits at Security Services, the Securicor subsidiary where most of the group's operating companies are held, by 33 per cent to Pounds 26.8m in the six months to March 31. While hailing the contribution of Cellnet and predicting rising demand by customers, the company yesterday hinted at a shift in strategy to reduce its dependence on the phone network. Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said likely initiatives could include head-on competition with Parcelforce and service contracts with Royal Mail Letters if the Post Office was privatised. 'The privatisation offers the prospect of enhancing profits of our parcels business,' he said. Profits in the parcels division increased 37 per cent to Pounds 4.9m on increased turnover of Pounds 152.7m (Pounds 123.7m). The security division, meanwhile, has placed tenders to build and operate two new prisons and is seeking further custodial contracts. Such measures follow Securicor's success last year in winning a Pounds 96m contract to escort 250,000 prisoners a year for London's Metropolitan Court Escort and Custody Service. It saw profits increase from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 5.02m on turnover ahead at Pounds 147.4m (Pounds 143.6m). The business services division saw profits increase from Pounds 164,000 to Pounds 893,000, although the finance and insurance business saw profits decline from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 1.7m. Nevertheless, the strong contribution from Cellnet enabled the company to declare an increased interim dividend of 0.805p (0.732p) for the group and 1.686p (1.533p) for Security Services. Earnings per share rose to 18.6p (14p) and 17.4p (12.2p) respectively. The result prompted a 30p rise in Securicor Group shares to 1210p, while Securicor A shares - the most heavily traded - closed up 5p at 825p. COMMENT Securicor may be keen to reduce its reliance on Cellnet, but it is by no means ready to sever its lucrative relationship with the high-earning network. Mr Wiggs yesterday admitted that its holding remained an investment and serious offers would be considered. But likely bidders have so far been deterred by the high price Securicor would demand for a business which is the engine room of its own profitability. So although the group is giving greater attention to its managed businesses, its reluctance to relinquish its grasp on Cellnet has reassured analysts and persuaded them to increase year end profit forecasts to up to Pounds 84m, which on a forward multiple of 20 makes the group an attractive long-term, if expensive, option.</p>

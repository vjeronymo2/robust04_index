			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / US warns China on HK deals US commerce secretary Barbara Franklin told China yesterday not to invalidate contracts in Hong Kong as part of Beijing's war-of-words on wider democracy in the British colony's final five years, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Washington would protect US companies if Beijing's promised voiding of contracts stood to harm US interests after Hong Kong's transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Ms Franklin said. 'Recent statements by the Chinese have placed in doubt the continuity of certain Hong Kong contracts signed prior to 1997,' she told the local American Chamber of Commerce after a three-day visit to China. China sparked a 17 per cent plunge in the Hong Kong stock market with threats to disavow the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's handover and to tear up Hong Kong contracts not to its liking after 1997.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / A clear case of confusion: The UK economy is emitting hard-to-decipher signals Over the past few days, the British economy has flaunted an increasingly familiar mix of the good, the bad and the crazy. Evidence of a strengthening recovery where price pressures are not an immediate problem is impressive: unemployment dropping below 10 per cent in December; a welcome quickening of manufacturing output growth in November; headline inflation below 2 per cent last year; and yesterday's news that the economy grew by a real, seasonally adjusted 2.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year, compared with the same period of 1992. On the other hand, a slight decline in retail sales between November and December and a warning from the British Chambers of Commerce that growth might be hitting a 'glass ceiling' prompted some to forecast an early worsening of economic conditions. Financial markets have this month reacted crazily in response to conflicting signals. Ten days ago, news that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had ruled out an early cut in bank base rates from 5.5 per cent triggered a 41.8-point drop in the FT-SE Index. On Wednesday, that decision apparently forgotten, share prices soared as December's mildly disappointing retail sales and a lower-than-expected jump in inflation last month revived hopes of easier money. Mr Clarke has done his best to calm the mood swings. The recovery, he has said, is steady and strengthening. He has condemned as 'absolutely silly' the hailing of good figures one day and bad the next. He has sought to dampen interest rate speculation by stressing the need for a sustainable recovery with growth that is 'really going to happen for some years ahead'. But the chancellor is the man ultimately responsible for the radical changes of mood. The tax increases announced in November's Budget, on top of those still to take effect from his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget, have made all conventional forecasts and projections subject to grave uncertainty. Nobody knows how the British public will react to April's cocktail of a 1 percentage point jump in employees' national insurance contributions, reduced mortgage interest relief, the lower tax allowance for married couples and the introduction of value-added tax on domestic fuel and power. The tax increases planned for the financial year starting in April amount to Pounds 8.4bn, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Add those planned for 1996-97, and the cumulative effect will be 2.3 per cent of GDP, according to this week's report on the Budget from the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee. Officials in both the Treasury and Bank of England agonised considerably about the merits of a further interest rate cut before the chancellor met Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, for the first of their monthly discussions of monetary conditions this year. But by the time the two met on January 12, the reports of strong consumer demand over Christmas coupled with figures pointing to accelerating monetary growth and falling dole queues had persuaded both the Treasury and the Bank to put further monetary easing on hold. Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Today programme, Mr Clarke admitted on Thursday that the increased taxation would 'check' the recovery. But he said the upturn was strong enough 'to take it in its stride' and 'not to be stopped'. He also said that more spending power would be going into the economy 'just about now' as a result of mortgage interest rate cuts for the 8m borrowers whose rates are changed annually. The chancellor's claim was a reminder that the tax increases cannot be viewed in isolation from the sharp fall in interest rates from 10 per cent just before the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 to 5.5 per cent last November. Much will depend upon how savers react to lower rates: and as the accompanying article makes clear, they are a diverse group. The Treasury is banking on a further decline in the savings ratio from 10.6 per cent in the last year's third quarter, as low inflation, recovery in the housing market, falling unemployment and a reduced burden of household debt strengthen consumer confidence. The latest Gallup survey, published yesterday and carried out between January 6 and 18, indicates a sharp increase in optimism about the UK's economic outlook and less pessimism over household finances. The volatile reactions of financial markets to the past month's economic statistics show that Mr Clarke's goals remain imponderable. He is a ubiquitous politician, but his explanations of policy can sound like saloon bar verities, and it is clear that the markets do not yet know how to read him. Is he itching to cut interest rates as might befit a son of the industrial Midlands? Or is he, like many others in the Tory party, so scarred by the experience of the late 1980s, when rising inflation forced the government to raise base rates to 15 per cent, that he will do his utmost to avoid putting them up again? Does his present reluctance to cut rates therefore reflect a fear of having to raise them nearer to the general election that must be fought by the spring of 1997? Or, with the government facing local government elections in May and European elections in June, is Mr Clarke saving the next rate cut for a month or two? He could then hope to hit two birds with one stone by offsetting the contractionary effects of the tax increases, if these have become apparent, while enhancing the feel-good factor among homeowners just before the polls. Another possibility is that the chancellor, like Mr George, with whom he has established a good working relationship, is genuinely serious about the need to get inflation in the UK firmly under control, and believes that there is some way to go before this has been achieved. There are plenty of signs that inflation in the UK is tamed rather than defeated. The government's stated goal is to bring the underlying rate of inflation, as measured by the retail prices index less mortgage interest payments, into the lower part of the 1-4 per cent target range by the end of this parliament. To achieve this, policy will have to keep bearing down on inflation. Although this week's news on prices was better than expected, underlying inflation has yet to fall below the 2.5 per cent mid-point of the range. In resisting pressure for rate cuts in recent days, Mr Clarke made clear he is not a man to be blown off-course. The only problem is that it remains unclear where that course is leading.</p>

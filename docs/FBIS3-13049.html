During a meeting with a delegation of Eastern Catholic  patriarchs, Ramadan said that the continued blockade against  Iraq and the starving of its people is considered an aggression  against humanity because it is immoral and illegal. He said  that the world public is now aware of the methods of falsehood  and allegations used by the United States and its allies to  realize their evil intentions.    Taha Yasin Ramadan stressed that the methods of injustice  and  aggression will not continue and that the principles of justice,  right, and humanity will triumph. He stressed that, through  their reconstruction drive and determination, the Iraqis have  set an example of steadfastness and determination in their  defense of their sovereignty and existence.    He praised the visit of the Eastern Catholic patriarchs,  which they made under the circumstances of the unjust blockade.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Pacific Lumber -- The California &amp; Co. column published Aug. 28 left the  impression that, as a result of its doubling of the redwood harvest, Pacific  Lumber Co. was exporting logs and had not significantly increased lumber mill  employment. A spokesman said the company does not export logs. Although  industrywide mill employment in Humboldt County has not changed much as a  result of increased harvest, the spokesman said Pacific Lumber has increased  its employment by 300 to about 1,250 over the last four years.  </P></p>

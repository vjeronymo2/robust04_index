			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 7 (ANTARA) -- Dutch Foreign Minister  P.H. Kooijmans during his visit in Indonesia gained the  impression that much progress has been made in the country's  political development, particularly where political openness is  concerned, an Indonesian human rights official said.    Marzuki Darusman, member of the National Commission on Human  Rights, said Kooijmans spoke about Indonesia's political  development at an informal meeting with representatives of a  number of Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in  Jakarta Thursday.    "There has been a wind of change in Indonesia which could be  clearly observed. It is certainly a good sign for the country's  future," Darusman quoted Kooijmans as saying.    According to Kooijmans a change for the better was  noticeable  in the country's political atmosphere compared to the time when  he visited Indonesia a few years ago as a representative of the  UN secretary general, Darusman said.    Kooijmans arrived in Jakarta on Monday as a member of Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' party for a four-day state visit.    Lubbers had meanwhile suddenly cut short his visit by one  day  and left Jakarta on Wednesday.    Referring to Lubbers' shortened visit, Kooijmans said at the  meeting with the Indonesian NGOs, the Dutch prime minister had  to return home sooner than planned because of an emergency  stemming from a conflict in the Dutch Parliament.    Kooijmans expressed the hope Indonesian NGOs would be able  to  see to it that the wind of change in Indonesia's political life  would benefit the efforts to create better human rights  conditions, Darusman said.    The Dutch minister had concluded there was more political  openness in Indonesia among other things from the "more  democratic" way in which the Indonesian press was reporting  events, according to Darusman.</p>

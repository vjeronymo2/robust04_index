			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Zvornik, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- General Manojlo  Milovanovic, the chief of the general staff of the republic of  Srpska army, told TANJUG's correspondent this evening that  General Michael Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, had violated the Belgrade agreement in  the most blatant way. The UNPROFOR abused the agreed procedure  regarding flights to Gorazde and sent to this enclave four  helicopters that did not land in Sokolac. At the same time,  taking advantage of the permission obtained from the Serb side  for two helicopters that were checked in Sokolac, another four  helicopters with unidentified cargo took off for Gorazde in  their radar shadow using the same corridor. [passage omitted]    At 1000 today, Gen. Milovanovic was told over the telephone  that the UNPROFOR did not want a check in Sokolac on its way to  Gorazde. The chief of the general staff of the republic of  Srpska army disputed this, stressing that it would be a serious  departure from the negotiated agreement. At about 1230, General  Rose announced his departure for Gorazde, on condition that the  helicopter did not stop in Sokolac. However, UNPROFOR's  (?helicopter) squadron commander arrived in Sokolac with a  Serbian inspection team to allegedly clarify the disagreement.  When the Serbian side rejected the squadron commander's  explanation he agreed to send two helicopters to be checked in  Sokolac.    Taking advantage of the permission granted by the Serbian  side to allow the two helicopters through, four other  helicopters took off for Gorazde in their [radar] shadow using  the same corridor and time slot, bypassing Sokolac. The same  happened on their way back.</p>

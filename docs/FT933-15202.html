			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard calls for action on fish stocks INTERNATIONAL action is needed to conserve world fish stocks, the House of Commons Agriculture Committee was told yesterday. 'Unless that common action is taken there will be no fish for anyone to fish, no jobs for any fishermen and there will be no security for any fishermen's families,' said Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister. Late on Wednesday night Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, announced that the government was postponing the introduction of limits on the number of days that could be spent at sea by fishing vessels from October until January 1 next year. This will allow further time for consultations with the fishing industry, which has fiercely opposed restrictions on days at sea. Mr Jack also confirmed that Pounds 25m would be available for a decommissioning scheme to reduce the size of the British fleet over the next three years. The closing date for applications has been put back to the end of this month. Yesterday Mr Jack told the committee that the ministry had already received more than 100 applications for decommissioning, which had the potential to reduce the UK catch by 5 per cent or more. He also told the committee that there had been much misunderstanding throughout the industry on the plans to restrict the number of days at sea. It would not mean that some vessels would get only 80 days at sea, as some fishermen claimed. 'We have a task to explain our policy better,' he said. Mrs Shephard said that the government would be spending Pounds 50m a year on decommissioning, policing and research in the fishing industry when the total value of the UK catch was Pounds 400m. By any standards, she said, that had to be regarded as generous.</p>

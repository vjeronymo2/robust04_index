			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Populous countries learn education lesson The governments of the nine most populous developing countries yesterday pledged to provide their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest possible moment'. Their promises, delivered in New Delhi at an international education summit sponsored by the United Nations, were in themselves little more than statements of good intent. However, reports presented to the summit showed that in most of the nine states the past few years have seen marked improvements in literacy rates and in the numbers of children going to school. The nine nations - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - together account for half the global population and 70 per cent of all adult illiterates. If the experience of more developed nations is any guide, the progress made in education will help cut population expansion and boost economic growth. The Education for All Summit was robbed of some of its political impact by last-minute cancellations by leaders who had planned to attend. President Suharto of Indonesia was the only guest government head who signed the summit declaration alongside his host, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister. China was represented by a vice-premier and other nations by education ministers. Many of the nine countries' problems are similar, especially shortages of money, teachers, schools and materials. All face difficulties reaching children in remote rural districts and in persuading parents to send daughters to school as well as sons, and all have many adult illiterates. In the past three years, in every country education budgets have been increased, though in some the gains have been limited by subsequent cuts or by inflation. Mr James Grant, the executive director of Unicef, says this renewed commitment is due partly to the world-wide Education for All campaign launched by UN organisations in 1990 and partly to the growing realisation that economic growth and population control can best be achieved by promoting education. 'Everyone is learning from east Asia,' he says. However, the differences between individual countries are as important as the similarities. The summit reports describe some glaring gaps in achievement which are likely to get bigger before they get smaller, and may not shrink at all without radical policy changes in the laggard states. As a principal summit document says: 'To present the choice as now or never may over-dramatise it, but not by much.' Statistics are gathered from education ministries which often tend to exaggerate achievements. Nevertheless, the overall trends are clear. Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and China have seen adult literacy rates soar in the past decade to 70 per cent and above. The same countries already have 85 per cent or more of the children of primary school age enrolled. Enrolment rates in Egypt are also creditable, though few experts believe the official figure of 91 per cent and estimate the true figure is nearer 70 per cent. Brazil's high enrolment rate, which indicates how many youngsters start school, needs to be qualified by the fact that only 47 per cent complete three years. Unicef commends India for raising adult literacy above the 50 per cent mark. Despite having one of the world's best-educated elites, India for long neglected mass education, partly out of a lack of concern for promoting the interests of the lowest castes. But the sight of east Asian countries forging ahead in economic development prodded India into action. Unicef is also satisfied that Bangladesh, despite its poor literacy rating and its endemic poverty, has in the last two years under the premiership of Mrs Khaleda Zia shown determination to get children, especially girls, into school. The percentage of girls of primary school age enrolled at school has risen in the past decade from 45 to 64. The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, the largest non-government organisation, has won international renown as a pioneer in out-of-hours education for children who work or cannot attend regular school. The two countries that arouse the greatest concern are Pakistan and Nigeria, where a decade of political turmoil and financial pressures have left schools under-funded and demoralised. In Pakistan only 29 per cent of children are even enrolled in primary schools, and less than 20 per cent of girls. The diversion of funds from social to military spending, political upheaval, and moves to cut so-called 'western' influences in education and promote Islamic ones have all played their part in disrupting Pakistan's schooling. The summit papers show the contrast between Nigeria and another oil-rich country, Indonesia, which invested its revenues more wisely. Even though Indonesia lacked deep-rooted educational traditions, its post-colonial rulers have made mass education a priority and 'transformed education from the privilege of a tiny minority into a right enjoyed by nearly all', says the report. Ms Fay Chung, Unicef's chief education officer and a former education minister of Zimbabwe, says the most important determinant of success is not money but 'long-term political commitment'. The great enemy is political instability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                        THE EDUCATION CHALLENGE  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                         Net enrolment  Children                GNP Dollars    Literacy  for primary    reaching                per capita         %     schooling %    4th year %  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Brazil           2,680           81         88            47 Mexico           2,490           87         98            81 Egypt              600           48         91            99 Indonesia          560           77         97            89 Pakistan           380           35         29            59 China              370           73         99            86 India              350           52         66            61 Nigeria            270           51         59            67 Bangladesh         200           35         63            52  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Unesco and Unicef, based on national reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

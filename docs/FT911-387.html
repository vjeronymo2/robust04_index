			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; the Family (Briefcase): A lost account MY MOTHER died in 1970 (nine days before my father) aged 80 and I cleared her small estate of around Pounds 2,500. A National Provincial Bank Deposit account book has now been found by my sister showing a balance of Pounds 61 in December 1967. I did not know of the existence of the account when I cleared the estate - the book was with my sister and my mother was a semi-invalid and had probably not been in the bank for many years. Bank records should show that the account was dormant for upwards of 20 years. The book states 'Personal application must be made, and this book produced at the bank when any money is withdrawn'. NatWest state that they cannot find any trace of the account. Surely, as the book clearly shows the balance, the onus is on the bank to produce evidence that the account had been closed. If you are in agreement, then could I pursue the matter through the small claims court? The amount is small, but I consider that as executor or administrator it is my responsibility to see that the matter is resolved. You may care to write to the Bank's area manager pointing out that there is no reason to think that the account can have been validly closed, and that the amount involved, even with an accumulated interest, is so small that the Bank could and should honour its obligation. If you do not receive satisfaction try the Banking Ombudsman before resorting to the County Court. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. (Sumitomo Metal),  has developed a boride-dispersed, titanium-based composite alloy  with improvements of more than 30 percent over the previous  values in both rigidity and fatigue strength. Sumitomo Metal was  able to eradicate the weaknesses of titanium alloys, i.e., poor  wear resistance and low rigidity, by adding approximately one  percent boron. The new alloys can be mass-produced on the same  vacuum-arc-resolution (VAR) method-based production line as  before, and they can be sold at approximately the same price as  that for the 6-aluminum-4-vanadium alloy, the most common  titanium alloy. Sumitomo Metal has already begun sample shipment  to some aircraft manufacturers. The company plans to continue  application development for the new alloy with the emphasis on  automotive and aircraft components.    Titanium alloys, despite their high strength and corrosion  resistance, have had limited applications because of their poor  rigidity, roughly half that of steel. Sumitomo Metal did not use  the typical, sintering method-based alloy production process to  develop the new alloy, but rather used the grain dispersion  composite alloy formation method, called the in-situ method, to  melt, solidify and disperse titanium and Al-boron. Instead of  using chrome and vanadium, which tended to decrease rigidity,  aluminum and boron were used and crystallized on the alloy  surface. Thus, microfine titanium boride single crystals were  dispersed uniformly to show excellent conformity between grains  and the matrix in the new alloy.    The boron content of the new alloy was optimized at  approximately one weight percent to maintain excellent ductility  and machinability for the new alloy, because these properties  declined when the boron content was higher.    The newly developed high-rigidity alloy showed a Young's  modulus value, an index for rigidity, of 15,000  kgf/mm[.sup]2[/], which was 30 percent higher than 11,550  kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] for the 6-aluminum-4-vanadium alloy.  Moreover, the new alloy's fatigue strength was 63  kgf/mm[.sup]2[/], surpassing 45 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] for the  previous material. Thus, the new alloy is suitable for use in  components that require strength.    Specific applications being considered for the new alloy  include automotive components, including exhaust system parts,  such as valves, crankshafts, connecting rods and piston  wristpins. Sumitomo Metal is all set to distribute samples of  the new alloy and is hoping for its early commercialization.</p>

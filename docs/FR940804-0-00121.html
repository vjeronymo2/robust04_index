Communications with that individual are subject to the limitations set forth in this part. Although this paragraph provides the general rule for such communications, paragraph (d) addresses the specific situation in which a controlling individual of a represented organization retains separate counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This paragraph also provides that the government will not accept, for purposes of this rule, blanket claims by counsel that he or she represents all or a large number of employees of the organization. It is important to note that this provision is only relevant when the attorney for the government would be prohibited by some other provision of this regulation from contacting an individual falling under the broad claims of representation under question. For example, an attorney for the government may contact a low-level employee of a corporation, without consent of that employee's counsel or the corporation's counsel, regarding a matter for which the corporation has already been indicted as part of an undercover or overt factual investigation, if that individual has not been arrested or named as a defendant in a related criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. Therefore, the fact that an attorney has stated that he or she represents that individual will have no bearing on whether the communication is proper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if a particular communication with an individual employee included in such a claim of representation would be improper under these rules if he or she were in fact represented by counsel (for example, communications to negotiate a plea agreement), then this paragraph provides that a government attorney must first inquire whether the employee is in fact represented before undertaking substantive communications with the employee. As part of this inquiry, the government attorney is not required to disclose to the employee the fact that counsel has asserted that he or she represents the employee. If the employee indicates that he or she is not represented by counsel, it is proper for the government attorney to treat the employee as unrepresented. If the employee indicates that he or she is represented by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, the attorney for the government shall treat that employee as a represented person or represented party, and any further communications with that individual shall be governed by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No specific comments were received regarding this paragraph, and it has not been changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

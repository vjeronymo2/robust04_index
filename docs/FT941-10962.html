Mr Alan Katz and Mr Kevin Mawer, both partners in Arthur Andersen's Leeds office, were appointed joint administrative receivers to the Humberside-based group late on Friday. Earlier in the day shares in IMF, which was floated on the stock market just 14 months ago at 51p a share, had been suspended at 14p pending clarification of its financial position.

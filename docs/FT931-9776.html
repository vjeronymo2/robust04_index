			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blue chips drive the market forward THE UK stock market yest-erday regained some of the confidence so badly bruised over the two previous trading days and share prices closed very firmly after a well-traded session. The latest fund-raising moves, a well-heralded Pounds 204m rights issue from Trafalgar House and Pounds 200m in debentures from Forte, were taken calmly and there was relief that British Petroleum, reporting satisfactory trading news, made no call on shareholders. Traders pointed out that the two-week equity trading account ends tonight with share profits still in place; further demand for stock to meet selling commitments taken on Tuesday and Wednesday could help the market this morning. Heavy buying from across the Atlantic for the pharmaceutical stocks which have been badly hit in recent sessions provided the driving force behind the blue chip sectors. A large buy programme by a UK house was identified. Oil shares, too, made good progress following the BP statement; although UK funds remain cautious towards BP shares, they are wary of selling while US investors show increasing confidence in the stock. An early gain of 13 points on the Footsie proved more than the market would allow, and the advance was trimmed briefly as the rights issue from Trafalgar was absorbed. The stock index futures sector provided a lacklustre guide in early deals. However, the market began to move forward as the drug stocks responded to demand for the sector in New York overnight. The Footsie was quickly ahead by more than 24 points at 2,840.7. The market remained firm for the rest of the day. But in spite of a firm start to the new Wall Street session, when the Dow Average added 22 points in early trading, London closed just below the day's best levels. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,834.3 for a gain of 17.9 on the day. Investors were waiting cautiously for reports of the speech in Germany by Mr Eddie George, governor-designate of the Bank of England. But his warning that there is little room for further adjustment on domestic interest rates came after the London equity market had closed for the day. The focus on the blue chip pharmaceuticals, where Glaxo stood out strongly, took some interest away from the second liners. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index firmed only 4.6 to 3,006.5. However, dealing in second-line issues made up about 63 per cent of the day's total Seaq business of 889.4m shares. Retail, or customer, business has remained high this week and on Wednesday returned a value figure of Pounds 1.27bn. The strength of the pharmaceutical and oil issues also outweighed, in index terms, the continued setback in several domestically orientated sectors. Food retailers continued to signal concern over suggestions of adverse tax developments ahead in next month's Budget speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer. The market's chief preoccupation, however, remained the heavy flow of company news now looming over investors. The game of 'spot the rights issue' has been joined by the game of 'spot the bid story', and the market was buzzing last night with hints that a large corporate dev-elopment will shortly be announced in the banking and financial sector.</p>

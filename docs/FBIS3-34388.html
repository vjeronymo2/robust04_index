			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--The Islamic Action Front (IAF) is being  targeted for criticism for remaining "uninvolved" in the food  and drug case which was raised by Minister of Health Abd  al-Rahim Malhas two weeks ago. And while its representatives  have responded to critics in the press and among IAF  constituency, the front has yet to outline its position towards  the affairs.    Some analysts believe that the IAF has been unable to make  up  its mind over support of Dr. Malhas if only because a large  percentage of its constituency is pharmacists and food traders  whose interests have been targeted by Dr. Malhas's criticism.    On the other hand, the IAF does not want to appear to be  siding with the government especially since it was Dr. 'Abd  al-Salam al- Majali's government that was perceived to be  targeting the Islamists by the change in the Election Law to a  one-person, one- vote system.    Other analysts believe that the IAF cannot be called upon to  have a unified party line on this issue because the issue is  "non-partisan" and is not political in nature.    These analysts believe that the IAF has within its ranks the  same split in opinion over the minister's statements as the one  that has appeared in society at large.    The IAF's position may become clearer when its spokesperson  in parliament, Hamzah Mansur, takes the floor today. But in the  meantime, the front has attempted to ward off criticism by other  deputies and political forces in the country.    It has, nevertheless, worded its response carefully to avoid  committing itself to any particular position.    In fact, on Wednesday, the first day of parliamentary  discussion of the Malhas allegations, the IAF deputies who are  usually at the fore of those signing up to speak against the  government did not take the podium and left it instead to the  deputies who lashed out at the minister.    Critics of the powerful Islamic party maintain that the  movement failed to give adequate attention to Dr. Malhas'  charges of corruption among businessmen and importers and within  the bureaucracy of the ministry itself.    Two weeks ago, a weekly Arabic newspaper quoted Dr. Malhas  as  saying that a good quantity of food and medicine that reaches  the market does not meet international standards and  specifications.    He pointed the finger at what he described as "whales" in  the  business sector who, he maintained, have exercised pressure and  intimidated food and drug control employees in his ministry.    The minister's statements created panic in the Kingdom,  especially since Dr. Malhas directly connected the increased  percentage of cancer cases in the country with the quality of  imported food and drugs.    The Lower House of Parliament immediately called for a  session to discuss the charges of the minister and initiate  investigations into the minister's claims. The House gave the  government three days to present a report substantiating the  minister's statements. But in what appeared to be an isolated  incident, the IAF's deputies in the Lower House were seen as the  only organised bloc in the House which accepted the government's  request to delay discussion of what has been titled by the local  press as "Malhas gate."    Other "opposition" deputies had demanded that the government  stick to the deadline of last Sunday but they failed to gain the  support of the IAF deputies except al-Zarqa' Deputy Bassam  al-'Moush, who seconded the government' motion for delay saying  that they also needed time to "collect information."    Criticism of the IAF's position grew when the president of  the Pharmacists Association, Husam Musmar, who was elected on an  Islamist platform, published a letter dismissing Dr. Malhas'  call for upgrading and enforcing legislation which would provide  for tighter control over the quality of food and medicine in the  Kingdom.    At the same time Mr. Musmar published his letter in local  Arabic papers, AL-SABIL, an Islamist weekly believed to be the  mouthpiece of the IAF which also marginalised the importance of  Dr. Malhas's statements much to the chagrin of its Islamist  readers.    In this week's edition, AL-SABIL's editor in chief, Hilmi  al-Asmar, sought to ward off criticism that the Islamists were  in support of business interests at the expense of the health of  the people.    In a long column he also sought to dispel charges that the  Islamists' dismissal of the charges made by Dr. Malhas was  because he was a well-known critic of Islamist calls for  stricter social laws, especially in regard to segregation of men  and women. Before assuming his post as minister of health, Dr.  Malhas wrote a weekly column in AL-RA'Y Arabic daily in which he  often lashed out at fundamentalist social demands and called for  progressive and liberal policies.    "We understand the criticism of our brothers who love us and  are loved by us, because we did not give the food and medicine  case its due in our earlier edition of AL-SABIL," Mr. al-Asmar  said in his column.    "But it was not because we do not want to point to the cases  of corruption in our society and not because we are enemies of  any particular individual," he added.    Mr. al-Asmar asserted since other Arabic language papers had  dedicated enough space to the case "AL-SABIL did not feel the  need to repeat what was already published."    He was responding to a letter the weekly received from  al-Tafilah and which was signed by 23 IAF supporters.    In that letter, which AL-SABIL published on the inside page,  the signatories said: "There was great disappointment among the  youth of the Islamic movement when your paper was published  without investigating or saying a word of support for this  important national issue."    The signatories were especially critical of a column by Mr.  al-Asmar which the letter said "was weak and denied the  existence of corruption but instead took the opposite view."    "If there is animosity towards some newspapers, then this  should not stop you as Muslims, as a movement and newspaper, to  say that is right," the letter added.    The signatories also pointed out that "Islamists were the  first to open the files of corruption in the last Parliament,  and the Islamists have based on their election campaign on  putting an end to financial and administrative corruption."    AL-SABIL also carried two items signed by the "editorial  staff" in which it said that they were happy to receive "an  unending number of telephone calls" and that they were not above  criticism.    "We stress that we are completely on the side of the  citizen... and by deduction in support of the minister of health  against the whales of corruption," one of the pieces said.    The criticism of the IAF movement's position was also  apparent in other papers, including the evening daily AKHIR  KHABAR, which accused the movement of siding with the rich  against the poor.    "We were hoping that the IAF would take this opportunity to  stand by the minister at this crucial moment because it is the  poor people who give the Islamic movement its political base and  its parliamentary seats, and not the large businesses even if  they cloak themselves in Islam," it said in an article signed by  Nahid Hattar.    "I worry about the movement, which appears torn between the  power of the people and the force of those with interests,  tilting towards the side that we cannot accept," Mr. Hattar  added.    Mr. Hattar's column appeared side by side with a letter from  the official spokesperson of the IAF deputies, Hamzah Mansur,  who was replying to a similar charge made by Mr. Hattar a day  earlier.    "I was surprised, as were my brothers the IAF deputies, by  what appeared in Mr. Nahid Hattar's article in which he  categorised the deputies into two groups: one with the poor  people and the other which stands with the whales," Mr. Mansur  said.    "We reject the notion that our society should be divided  into  rich and poor for wealth is not a crime... Citizens, both rich  and poor, are our brothers and family," Dr. Mansur added.</p>

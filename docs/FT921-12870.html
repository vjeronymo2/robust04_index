			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: News of charge wipes 8% off Norsk Hydro shares NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest company, is to take a NKr2.4bn (Dollars 387m) special charge against its 1991 fourth-quarter accounts. The announcement wiped 8 per cent off the company's stock market capitalisation yesterday. The charge will cover the costs of restructuring and asset write-downs associated with the agriculture and magnesium divisions. Norsk Hydro's shares plunged NKr12.50, nearly 8 per cent, to NKr144.50 on the news. The company said NKr1bn of the charge related to the agriculture division and NKr1.4bn to the magnesium division. Of the total, some NKr800m will cover costs for the restructuring, while around NKr1.6bn represents write-downs. For the first nine months of 1991, group net income was NKr1.04bn, down from NKr1.89bn a year earlier. Agriculture had an operating profit of NKr433m, on sales of NKr20.03bn, while light metals - which includes the magnesium division - achieved an operating income of NKr460m on sales of NKr13.10bn. One Oslo-based analyst forecast that the final-quarter charges would push Hydro into a net loss of between NKr800m and NKr1bn for 1991. The results are due to be published on February 20. Hydro made a net profit of NKr2.9bn in 1990. Norsk Hydro said a big part of the charge against the magnesium division earnings represented a write-down of the book value of the plant in Becancour, Canada. Last October Hydro charged NKr500m in its third-quarter accounts to cover costs associated with the restructuring of the agriculture and magnesium divisions, which it said was meant to lead to annual cost reductions of about NKr260m. Hydro said a strong deterioration of the magnesium market, combined with increased exports from eastern Europe, created a need for adjustments in marketing and production activities. To this end, Hydro said plans for restructuring would be completed during the first half of 1991. However, this would depend to a large extent on the outcome of the US trade policy cases. Hydro said although there was over-capacity in the European fertiliser industry, demand was expected to grow outside Europe. To contend with these market conditions, the company intends to reduce European capacity.</p>

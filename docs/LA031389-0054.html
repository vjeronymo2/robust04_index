			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANARCHY IN A CAN;  </P> <P> TRUE, ONLY A FRACTION OF THE SPRAY PAINT MADE EACH YEAR ENDS UP AS GRAFFITI.  BUT THE NEVER- ENDING CLEANUP OF THE DAMAGE COSTS MILLIONS.  </P> <P> Miguel Angel Gonzales, a home boy from San Pedro, says he favors Korbel brandy,  small caliber revolvers and almost any brand of spray paint, so long as it is  blue.  </P> <P> The 18-year-old member of the West Side Wilmas, a gang whose color is blue, is  better known on the streets as "dopey," a signature adorning walls in the  harbor area for the past five years.  </P> <P> Dopey would often go through several cans of spray paint a night, "kicking back  with the home boys," he recalled in a recent interview at the county jail. He  was busted on vandalism charges when he was caught scrawling over a rival  gang's graffiti and sentenced earlier this month to 130 days.  </P> <P> Such stiff penalties are rare, however, in society's losing battle against  graffiti. As gang activity has soared in Southern California, graffiti has  become a social scourge. At the same time, it has fueled multimillion-dollar  sales in spray paint, as well as a rapidly growing industry to clean up the  mess.  </P> <P> Spray paint sales in the United States exceed half a billion dollars, although  experts disagree over how much spray paint is used for graffiti, as opposed to  painting back yard grills, sprucing up children's bicycles and other household  tasks.  </P> <P> The spray paint industry is composed of about a dozen U.S. producers that  annually turn out 300 million cans, according to the National Paint &amp;  Coatings Assn. That's more than one can for every man, woman and child in the  nation every year.  </P> <P> "I don't think one one-hundredth of 1% of spray paint is used for graffiti,"  said Hugh Young, the paint association's director of state and public affairs.  </P> <P> But graffiti experts such has Jay Beswick, a consultant and adviser to a number  of gang counseling service groups, sharply disputes that assessment. "I think a  substantial amount is used (for graffiti)," he said.  </P> <P> For example, Beswick observed, 153 cans of spray paint were used to paint just  a single graffiti mural on a sound barrier wall on the San Bernardino Freeway.  "You can count them at the bottom of the wall, because they don't haul them  away when they're finished," he said wryly.  </P> <P> "Graffiti is an industry," he added. "We are talking big bucks."  </P> <P> In the Southland, 150 companies are in the business of removing graffiti. And  75 paint manufacturers around the country make anti-graffiti coatings.  </P> <P> The public cost of removing graffiti is staggering. Government agencies in Los  Angeles County alone spend $50 million annually in graffiti removal. By  comparison, the nonprofit Braille Institute spends about $12 million annually  in Southern California.  </P> <P> Much of the money that government spends to combat graffiti is contracted out  to private graffiti removal firms, utilizing such heavy equipment as  sandblasters and water blasters. Technology is also helping as new coatings are  created that allow graffiti to be washed off.  </P> <P> Peter Bilinski, owner of Allied Cleaning Systems in Northridge, said the  graffiti-removal industry has grown in recent years, but competition has become  fierce. "I gross $45,000 per year, but it isn't easy," he said.  </P> <P> Despite massive government spending, many experts consider the fight a losing  battle. The Rapid Transit District, for example, completely cleans graffiti off  its buses each day, and each day fresh graffiti is painted on virtually every  RTD bus. The annual cost of removal is $8.4 million.  </P> <P> "It is tyranny," said Gordana Swanson, president of the RTD board.  </P> <P> Anti-gang crusaders also worry that gang activity and graffiti occasionally  take on an aura of social respectability.  </P> <P> Target, a discount store chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp., published a  nationally distributed advertisement on Jan. 15 that depicted children in front  of graffiti-colored walls. The kids, wearing fashionable pastel clothes on sale  at Target that week, were posed holding cans of spray paint and marking pens.  </P> <P> "It was a regrettable incident," said Ann Barkelew, a Dayton Hudson  spokeswoman. "We heard from a lot of people . . . who said, 'What kind of  company is this?' "  </P> <P> Spray paint manufacturers plead that they are not at fault. "To do away with  graffiti would do nothing but good for the industry," said Rick Birle,  president of Carson-based Zynolyte Products, a major spray paint producer owned  by Standard Brands. "If graffiti stopped nationally tomorrow, I don't thing I  would notice any change in my sales."  </P> <P> Zynolyte Vice President of sales Craig Gioia and Birle are both active in  community organizations opposed to gangs. In addition, they note, Zynolyte  contributes paint to groups that clean up graffiti.  </P> <P> On a recent morning, the Zynolyte production line was humming, turning out  thousands of cans of spray paint. A huge warehouse was filling up, in  preparation for the heavy summer demand.  </P> <P> As he looked on, Birle acknowledged: "You are almost afraid to tell people you  are in this business. The first thing they think is gangs, graffiti, ozone  depletion. PR-wise, the industry hasn't done a good job of stressing the  positive aspects of the product."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, motorists traveling through Los Angeles are struck by the  proliferation of graffiti. In some cases, Graffiti has entirely covered walls  hundreds of feet long. After the graffiti has been removed, it quickly  reappears.  </P> <P> "A single can of black paint can go a long way," Birle asserted.  </P> <P> Birle estimated that no more than 1% of spray paint sales go to graffiti use.  Even at that estimate, about 3 million cans would be used annually to deface  property, more than 8,000 cans daily.  </P> <P> Of course, most spray paint is purchased for legitimate purposes. Birle said  the product is easy to use and avoids the mess of a dirty paint brush.  </P> <P> Despite such good intentions, some of the spray paint reaches juvenile vandals.  Under California law, retailers are prohibited from selling spray paint to  minors, but the law is not well-enforced.  </P> <P> "They say you have to be 18, but nobody cares," said Gonzales, the gang member  who is in jail. "When I was younger, I would just go into any store and buy  it."  </P> <P> Indeed, retailers say they are hard-pressed to enforce the law.  </P> <P> "A lot of the projects and legitimate uses for spray paint are for minors,"  said Jack Edwards, president of home improvement chain Builders Emporium. "It  is not practical to ask everybody buying a can of paint, 'What are you going to  do with it?'  </P></p>

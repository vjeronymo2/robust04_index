			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (9): State of the art showcase is the city's new landmark - Opera de Lyon A set of billboards appeared in France's big cities last summer to trumpet the opening of 'Un Nouvel Opera' - a new opera house, in Lyon. The description had a double meaning. Lyon did indeed gain a brand new opera house last May with the opening of a FFr490m theatre on place de la Comedie opposite the Hotel de Ville. But the slogan was also a pun on the name of Jean Nouvel, its architect. Nouvel is one of the new breed of modernists who emerged in French architecture during the 1980s. He made his name through a series of ambitious projects culminating in the futuristic Arab Cultural Centre which opened in 1989 beside the river Seine in Paris, but the Opera de Lyon is his largest and most complex project to date. The old Lyon opera house was built on the same site in 1831; by the mid-1980s it had fallen into disrepair. In 1986 the city council decided to replace the building with a state-of-the-art complex as a showpiece for the city. 'It is absolutely essential that a city like Lyon should have a cultural life in keeping with its economic stature,' says Jacques Moulinier, deputy mayor. 'One of our main projects over the past decade has been to establish Lyon on the European arts scene and to raise the standard of the architecture in the city centre. That is why it was important to commission a landmark building from an architect of Jean Nouvel's calibre.' What Nouvel has done is to retain the 19th century neo-classical facade of the old opera house and its opulent foyer but to rebuild everything else: from the huge crystalline vault he has put on top of the old facade, to the huge 1,280 seat Salle Italienne, to the airy dance studios tucked under the vaulted roof. The result is a compelling combination of the old and the new. The opera house has always been a focal point of the city centre skyline but now has the added attraction of being twice as high, thanks to the addition of Nouvel's glazed top floors peeping out over the top of the old sandstone facade. The public areas are all in black, with piercing flashlights on gleaming granite floors. (Walking through the main entrance feels like a sci-fi version of Jonah's journey inside the whale.) Opera goers are whisked up to the Salle Italienne on escalators and can peep down the 22 metre drop to the ground floor from the metal walkways that connect to the Salle. They then pass through red satin padded ante-chambers before entering the auditorium - all in black with a golden roof, golden doors and tiny fibre optic lights which cast a golden glow on the face of each spectator, so that they too form part of the spectacle. During intervals you can pop out to the foyer, which has been lovingly restored to its original splendour with gilded walls, splendid chandeliers, a frescoed ceiling and a picture window looking out to the towers and turrets of the ancient Hotel de Ville. In its first year the Opera de Lyon has been plagued by technical hiccoughs. But its problems have been nothing to those of the accident-prone Opera Bastille in Paris - and so far, every performance has had a full house.</p>

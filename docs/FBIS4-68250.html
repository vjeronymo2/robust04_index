			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, a leader of the </F> LDPR and deputy chairman of the State Duma, by Leonard Nikishin:  "The Red Horse Is Swimming in `Dead Water': Zhirinovskiy's Team  Is Raising the Stakes"]    [Text] In speaking of the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Russia [LDPR], hardly anyone has in mind anything bigger than  the figure of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Meanwhile, the party of  many millions that was successful in the elections for the State  Duma has its own elite and its own "politburo," in a manner of  speaking. True, this is almost unnoticeable in the shadow of the  loquacious leader. What kind of people are they? Who is behind  them? What do they want and do they fully share the views of  Vladimir Volfovich? In part one can obtain answers to these  questions from the conversation of the reviewer of OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA, Leonard Nikishin, with Aleksandr Vengerosvksiy, one of  the leaders of the LDPR and deputy chairman of the State  Duma.    A regular officer and colonel in the Soviet Army, until  recently he worked in one of the analytical centers of the  Ministry of Defense. They also knew him in the GRU and in the  Military-Industrial Commission. This predetermined the basic  theme of the conversation: The fate of the domestic  military-industrial complex and questions with respect to  conversion of the defense industry. And although the  conversation seemingly touched only on economic and production  themes, one could not fail to notice that the statements of Mr.  Vengerovskiy involved quite definite political approaches  showing that the economy always serves politics.    [Nikishin] In the past, you dealt with defense....    [Vengerovskiy] At present as well. As long as there is  something to defend.    [Nikishin] You probably have your own approach to the  problems in the conversion of defense branches. Do your views  coincide with Zhirinovskiy's approach? After all, he declares  that it is not necessary to carry out any conversion, that our  military-industrial complex must work at full capacity. And  where, if you please, will its output go?    [Vengerovskiy] We presently have about 5 million people  employed in the military-industrial sphere. If you take them  along with their families and the infrastructures that in one  way or another are working for the military-industrial complex,  then it is 15 million people. On the other hand, if you look at  Russia's export sphere, then 1 kilogram of a military aircraft  is worth $3,000, whereas for a civilian aircraft it is worth  $1,000. And raw materials now being exported are worth about 20  cents per kilogram. It is worthwhile to think about these 15  million people: Will they be full-value citizens and live  normally or will they form an explosive social medium?    The process that we call conversion was originally  incorrect,  because it was based on the illusion that Russia is surrounded  only by allies and friends and that they are waiting for her  with open arms as a beloved member of the world community.    [Nikishin] But there are calculations and forecasts on how  much military output can be absorbed by the external market. We  will simply be choked by exports of this kind and we will not  ensure any prosperity for the people.    [Vengerovskiy] I want to remind you that just six years ago  the USSR was second in the world in the export of arms.    [Nikishin] Of which a large share was given to various  friends of ours on credit.    [Vengerovskiy] It seems that your information is not very  correct. To meet the state budget, it was necessary to have not  only petrodollars, which by that time were already drying up,  but also other sources of revenue. And I, who worked for many  years in state structures, know that the revenue came from the  sale of arms. I know to which markets it went--it was the same  ones that are prepared even now to take our arms if the state  will assume a protectionistic position instead of pursuing false  economic, military, and other doctrines, to which I also include  "Partnership for Peace."    [Nikishin] And do you think that we should do this  permanently? This is an abnormal structure of the economy.    [Vengerovskiy] Then I will come back with this question to  you: Can the United States permanently produce arms? Despite the  conversion carried out in the USSR and in Russia, it not only  has not reduced its own military production but has even  increased it. They are investing in new military technologies.  Russia must have a geopolitical task that also includes the  concept of the production and sale of arms. It must answer the  question of what comes after this.    [Nikishin] Why is the United States not carrying out  conversion? What, in your opinion, is the closing of the nuclear  test range in Nevada all about? The weapons that have been  stockpiled in the world led to just one thing: At some time they  began to be used.    [Vengerovskiy] Yes, I also read Chekhov attentively. The gun  that was hanging in the first act will certainly be fired in the  last act. But the present local wars began not because of the  accumulation of arms but because of the disruption of polarity  in the world, when the second pole--the USSR--was liquidated.  You see that the new world order is being established by no  means with the laurels and doves of peace. Force is always used  to resolve political questions. Are you trying to say that  Russia should disarm? And as for Nevada, this is not serious.  The Americans have already performed all the tests that they  need.    [Nikishin] I am not talking about disarmament at all. But  why  should we return to the days of the Cold War, of blocs armed to  the teeth? Do you see this as a guarantee of our future happy  life?    [Vengerovskiy] No one intends to produce as much armament as  there was before. We must, in the first place, produce enough  military-industrial output for today's needs. Secondly, we must  make weapons that correspond to contemporary warfare. Thirdly,  we must supply absolutely new army structures with these arms.    [Nikishin] At the same time, just as before, other  structures  are just as sickly....    [Vengerovskiy] Nothing of the sort. Over the last 30 years,  the military-industrial complex also produced what we call  consumer goods. Everything decent that we now have in the area  of household equipment was, as a rule, a development and product  of the enterprises of the military-industrial complex. We do not  have anything better.    [Nikishin] One might think that the military-industrial  complex has inundated us with first-class household appliances.  Somehow I do not recall seeing such an abundance in our stores.  But let us return to the basic output of the military-industrial  complex--weapons. How do you propose that we drive our  competitors from the arms market?    [Vengerovskiy] This requires a policy of state  protectionism.  As you know, Japan and America are savage enemies when it comes  to trade and markets. One has to search for another state like  ours that freely admits foreign competitors into internal  markets and abandons its niches in foreign markets. The  corruption that first completely ate away the structures of the  Soviet Union and now of Russia led to our departure from the  traditional arms markets. All of this must now be put back on a  normal course.    In general, if we now take the so-called psychology of "new  thinking," then it is more advantageous to import all industrial  products from abroad, drive American cars, and use French  perfume. And what remains as Russia's share if we are not even  supposed to build missiles? We consider what happened in Russia  to be a mistake. We will definitely give back to our state the  majesty of being a world power and its scientific-technical  level.    [Nikishin] But if this scientific-technical level does not  lead to an increase in the well-being of the people....    [Vengerovskiy] And you think that the standard of living of  the people has improved in recent years?    [Nikishin] No, but was it really high during the Breshnev  years, when everything was subjected exclusively to the  interests of the military-industrial complex?    [Vengerovskiy] Can you now afford to buy an apartment, an  automobile, or even a refrigerator?    [Nikishin] No. But this, with the possible exception of the  refrigerator, is something that I could never afford.    [Vengerovskiy] I am very grateful to my country for the fact  that I received a free education, that I have the chance to live  in the apartment that they gave me at that time, and that I also  made all the main purchases in my life at that time. At the  present time, with my salary of 350,000 rubles as deputy  chairman of the Duma, I cannot afford such purchases. This is  possible for people who in the years of perestroyka were able to  rob the state by destroying it, establish their own private  capital, and go abroad. It is quite clear who lives well in  Russia now.    But let us return to the problem of the military-industrial  complex. It is above all the defensive possibility of the state  to hold back the onslaught of external enemies. As soon as we  were deprived of it, "the enemies burned down our own hut." And  you and I are standing on the burned-out site.    Gigantic investments are required to convert military  production. No one will ever provide them. If the state becomes  delirious and thinks that we are surrounded by nothing but  friends, then what happens is what happened with the USSR and  now with Russia. There are no conversion programs in America. I  have information to support this assertion. On account of my  activities in the party, I head an intelligence service. With  the help of plenty of Russian patriots abroad, we have complete  information about what it happening and where.    [Nikishin] You spoke of the new technological level of the  military-industrial complex. How do you see this?    [Vengerovskiy] It is not just the production of arms. Above  all we must preserve basic science. Brains are always expensive.  But there will not be any conversion until there is money for  it. Otherwise this is debauchery. The state order does not exist  in its previous volume but the state has not insured defense  enterprises and has not provided any money for their  reorientation. Give me capital investments for the renewal of  equipment and machinery and I will be pleased to produce tape  recorders like Sony does, to make refrigerators like those of  General Motors, and to build cars better than those of Mercedes.  But without working capital the plants began to simplify their  production programs and to make titanium shovels and stoves,  etc. In the past, we were essentially able to compete with the  West in all areas of scientific-technical progress. But the  CPSU, which became completely rotten from the top, let someone  like Gorbachev come to power who destroyed everything as a  consequence of his incompetence, to put it mildly. After him  came an obkom secretary with his thinking. What else can we say?  Our country deserves intelligent leaders. Professionals came to  the Liberal-Democratic Party, not theoreticians in playing the  accordion and not political scientists, who yesterday were  asserting that communism was not far off. We are practical  self-made people. And there is no reason to chuckle over  Zhirinovskiy's book "Last Push to the South."    [Nikishin] No, we were not able to stand up to competition  with the West. The second scientific-technical revolution  by-passed us. And it did not happen in Gorbachev's time at all  but much earlier. I do not want to chuckle over "Last Push," for  this book evokes other feelings. For me there is a great deal  there that is unacceptable.    [Vengerovskiy] Overall I am also not very pleased with it as  an example of literary creativity. I was educated with other  literature. But there has not been any fascism in our party,  there is none, and there will be none. Fascism will appear in  the country when the petty storekeepers, the so-called  merchants, who have become accustomed to having a good standard  of living through speculation, begin to fall into ruin. And this  will certainly happen. Then they will demand the restoration of  the status-quo. It is clear what idea is best for this. But this  time they will not point to the Jews. They have all left.    P.S. After the conversation, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy--an  absolute pragmatist and, in his own words, a practical  person--gave to the correspondent of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA several  brochures that apparently are among the favorite reading  material of the leaders of the LDPR and their flock. One work  made up of several sections is entitled "Mertvaya voda" [Dead  Water]. Its authorship belongs to some center or group of  persons called the "internal predictor." The first part is  called "Depressurization" and the second part "Inscription." I  am not going to assess this "catechism" but I will just quote a  few revelations in it that evoked a sense of dark humor in me.    "Reasoning according to AUTHORITY--INTELLECTUAL  PARASITISM--is the primary quality of the crowd; in it one can  see the striving of the crowd to live according to prepared  formulas that are provided by the authorities to which it is  subject.... The destruction of the AUTHORITY TRADITION  prevailing in the crowd turns the crowd into rabble.... The  crowd or rabble may be organized into structures: parliamentary,  trade-union, party, etc."    "Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount: `Until heaven and  earth pass not one jot or one tittle will in any way pass from  the law (of Moses) until all shall be fulfilled.' As is clear  from the quote from the `Old Testament,' this `all' means the  global Zionist-Nazi dictatorship, which in terms of Christianity  is called the `kingdom of God on earth.'"    "The revolution was a manifestation of the depletion of the  reserve of stability in terms of the depth of identity of goal  vectors as a result of an unstructured closed state through the  Masonry of the post-Peter `elite' on the supra-Jewish global  predictor."    "I.V. Stalin is the only one of the party `chiefs' about  whom  it can be said that his education allowed him to develop his own  conceptual activity."    "I.V. Stalin and some part of the group supporting him that  came from the people rose in their world view above the broad  popular masses and the `elite' and attained the quality of  priesthood [zhRECHEstvo] (life expression [zhizneRECHEniye)."    "The leaders of the Third Reich were originally under the  control of the highest suprastate Zionist Masonry."    "It is illegitimate to transfer the parliamentary experience  of the West to Russia, because parliamentarianism is simply a  screen over the directive-address system of Masonic mafia  control."    "It is useful to reissue the work of I.V. Stalin,  `Ekonomischeskiye problemy sotsialisma v SSSR' [Economic  Problems of Socialism in the USSR] and those who have the  opportunity should read it and think about it now."</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Goldman Sachs takes main stake in cable consortium Goldman Sachs, the international investment bank, has demonstrated its faith in the future of the British cable industry by taking a significant stake in a large cable operation in the Nottingham area. The US group has taken the largest financial stake in a consortium that has acquired control of Diamond Cable, which owns seven franchises covering more than 530,000 homes in the east Midlands. Goldman has been interested in UK cable for some time and is one of the financial houses involved in the flotation of Telewest, the largest cable operator in the UK. But this is its first direct stake in the industry. Values of Pounds 200 or more are now being quoted for each home in a cable franchise area so the Diamond deal could easily be worth more than Pounds 100m overall, although no price has been disclosed. It could cost a further Pounds 200m to complete the franchises. Goldman Sachs is in partnership with two US cable investors, Mr Bob Goad and Mr Ralph Booth, through their company European Cable Capital Partners. The group of franchises came on the market because of the death of their founder, Mr Alan McDonald, whose family will retain a 20 per cent interest. Work on the Nottingham network was badly hit by Mr McDonald's death. Now the intention is to take several hundred people on during the next few weeks to speed up construction of the network. The Nottingham franchises offer both television and telephone services - at the moment there are more telephone subscribers than television subscribers. Goldman has no present plans to take further cable industry stakes but regards the Diamond deal as providing valuable information about the realities of the industry as well as 'putting our money where our mouth is.' The sale of Diamond was handled by the NatWest Bank.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTLE &amp; COOKE TO SPIN OFF DOLE FOOD TO SHAREHOLDERS  </P> <P> Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said Thursday that it will spin off to shareholders its  Dole Food Co., one of the nation's largest food concerns, and become solely a  real estate firm.  </P> <P> Under the deal, due to close in May or June, Dole will become a separate  publicly traded company.  </P> <P> Shareholders will receive one share of Dole for each share of Castle &amp;  Cooke.  </P> <P> The move was not unexpected since David H. Murdoch, Castle &amp; Cooke's  chairman and chief executive, announced at the company's annual meeting last  May that management was considering splitting the company in two.  </P> <P> Murdoch said at the time that growth in earnings and assets led to  consideration of the action.  </P> <P> Castle &amp; Cooke said Thursday that the spinoff will provide a tax-efficient  method of implementing such a separation.  </P> <P> "By separating into two companies, the management of each will be able to adopt  strategies and pursue objectives appropriate to its specific business," Murdoch  said in the announcement.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Castle &amp; Cooke will retain its real estate holdings in  Hawaii, including 98% ownership of the island of Lanai, and developments in  California and Arizona. It will be headquartered in Honolulu and lease its  Hawaiian agricultural properties to Dole.  </P> <P> Dole will have headquarters in Los Angeles and Honolulu.  </P> <P> The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $23.8 million, up from  $19.4 million for the 1988 fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $700.1 million, up from $588.8 million a year  earlier.  </P> <P> The improved earnings stemmed primarily from gains in the company's real estate  operations.  </P> <P> For 1989, earnings were $94.9 million, off from earnings of $112.3 million for  1988.  </P> <P> The 1988 earnings included a $17.9-million pretax gain from the sale of the  company's investment in Amfac Inc.  </P> <P> Revenue for all of 1989 was $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion for 1988.  </P></p>

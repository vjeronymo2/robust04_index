			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Labour raises stakes on constitutional reform LABOUR will today seek to broaden its constitutional debate and will include in it proportional representation, which will be crucial in the event of a hung parliament. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, will spell out the need for a new constitutional settlement between the individual, the community and the government. As proportional representation is again highlighted as a way in which Labour could attract support away from the Liberal Democrats, Mr Brown will make the case for a broader constitutional agenda. This would include freedom of information, devolution, moves towards a written constitution and the concept of economic rights. In the first of a series of lectures organised by Charter 88, the constitutional reform movement, Mr Brown is expected to argue that the post-war settlement did not take account of government itself as a vested interest from which the citizen might need protection. While Mrs Thatcher in 1979 represented some attempt to redress the balance, she did so by denying the existence of community altogether. Mr Brown will say that constitutional change 'is not incidental but integral to our future as a country. It is not a sideshow at the election but centre stage'. Labour yesterday played down the prospect of a potentially divisive manifesto commitment to proportional representation for parliamentary elections. Party officials said the manifesto would not offer a royal commission or Speaker's conference, but would promise the enhancement of the work of the committee on electoral reform chaired by Professor Raymond Plant. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary and a supporter of electoral reform, said yesterday: 'The Plant committee's work will continue in government and of course it will be a much more powerful and influential body then because it will not be a sub-committee of an opposition, it will be a committee, a strengthened committee, reporting to a government with power to act.' Labour, which is slightly ahead of the Tories according to the opinion polls, is confident that the Budget, which will dominate this week, will have little effect on voting. The party believes that its 'borrowing to bribe' campaign during the past few weeks has neutralised the effect of any tax cuts, while a package of measures intended to bring about recovery will, it argues, enable it to claim that it has won the argument. Three of Labour's senior performers will lead the attack in the first few days after the election is expected to have been called. Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, will speak at the Scottish Labour conference on Friday. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Roy Hattersley, the party's deputy leader, will speak at the party's London conference next weekend. Today Mr Cook will highlight the clear choice between the 'bribe' of tax cuts and more spending on health care. In an interview on TV-am yesterday he sought to keep up the pressure on the government over the health service, with renewed claims that it was harder for doctors to use clinical judgment because they were being pressed to use commercial judgment.</p>

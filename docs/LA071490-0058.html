			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PANEL SEARCHES FOR WASP RELEASE SITES  </P> <P> The Ventura County Agricultural Commission is looking for potential sites to  release biological enemies of the ash whitefly, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Deputy Agricultural Commissioner Ann McClure said the agency is compiling a  list of areas in the county that meet the state Department of Food and  Agriculture's requirements for breeding the predator, a stingless wasp that is  harmless to humans, but that attacks the whitefly.  </P> <P> Potential sites must have more than one tree present to ensure that the wasps  can live there year-round, McClure said. Homeowners must agree not to spray the  tree or cut it down.  </P> <P> State agricultural officials have said they plan to release 250 wasps at each  of four as yet unidentified sites.

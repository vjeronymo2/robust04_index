			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Fabius call to stem 'tidal wave' vote THE campaign for France's two rounds of parliamentary elections on March 21 and 28 officially opened yesterday, with more than 5,000 candidates contesting 577 seats, reflecting the rise of fringe parties and incomplete electoral pacts between certain mainstream parties, writes David Buchan in Paris. Seeking to minimise impending defeat, Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the ruling Socialists, said it was high time for the left 'to wake up' and for the Socialists and environmentalists to get together to stem the 'tidal wave' forecast for the centre-right opposition. A CSA poll published yesterday predicted that the RPR-UDF opposition parties would get 38.5 per cent of the popular vote, translating into an enormous majority of 424-436 seats out of the total of 555 for mainland France. It put support for the Socialists and their minor allies at 20 per cent, giving them 91-98 seats, and backing for the two environmentalist parties at 17 per cent, translating into only 2-8 seats.</p>

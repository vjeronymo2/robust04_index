Yoshio Utsumi, director general of the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry's International Affairs Department,  made the comment while briefing foreign reporters on Japan's  position on the matter.    An official at the department confirmed the content of  Utsumi's remarks at the briefing but said they were not as  strong as had been reported.    AP-DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE reported that Utsumi warned that  Motorola Inc.'s business in Japan could suffer if the company  and the U.S. Government picked an "unnecessary" fight about the  need for immediate results.    The ministry official said the tone of the U.S. wire  service's report was too strong. "He (Utsumi) did not make such  a warning. That story seems a little strong," the official said.    The U.S. Government said earlier this week it plans to  impose sanctions against Japan for violating a 1989 bilateral  cellular telephone agreement.    The agreement paved the way for Motorola to offer cellular  telephones in the densely populated corridor between Tokyo and  Nagoya on the basis of its own system.    Japanese officials say Tokyo has fulfilled its  responsibilities to abide by the agreement, but the U.S. side  complains that implementation of the agreement has effectively  discriminated against Motorola.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Equities: approach with caution . . . - Serious Money WHATEVER else you might say about the UK equity market, it cannot be described as looking particularly cheap. The price-earnings ratio is over 20 and the dividend yield is 4.19 per cent. If you allow for the Budget tax change, the yield is under 4 per cent. So, should the small investor be buying UK shares now? M&amp;G figures, which I quoted two weeks ago, show that when the market yields below 4 per cent, it is normally a bad time to buy shares. But M&amp;G's Richard Hughes argues that there is a large comfort factor in the rate of inflation - now 1.8 per cent. It is rare for the stock market to yield more than inflation and, when it does, it is usually a sign that shares are good value. Nevertheless, in my view, it is not the ideal time to be placing a large lump sum in the UK market. Nor do the US and Japanese markets look massively attractive on present ratings. Europe should benefit from falling interest rates but could well be headed for deep recession. That is a more convincing case for European bonds, than it is for equities. There are, however, some very good arguments for the so-called emerging markets. Higher rates of economic growth and more liberal regulatory regimes offer the prospect that areas such as south-east Asia or Latin America might provide exceptional long-term returns. Although Fund Research has produced one of its excellent studies of single-country emerging market funds this week, the best vehicle for the private investor is a broadly-spread fund. Diversification protects investors from the enormous volatility of individual emerging markets. This week, Templeton Emerging Markets launched a savings scheme with a minimum of Pounds 30 a month or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. Although the trust has more than doubled investors' money over the past three years, new investors should not expect such a heady rate of growth; despite its spread, it is very much a long term investment. While on the subject of equities, I want to return to the vexed issue of Pep charges. The Budget change reduced the dividend income on a Pep by restricting the tax credit from 25 to 20 per cent. Many people have said complacently that the change is only marginal and does not matter. Of course, the change is marginal. But the benefits of a Pep to a basic-rate taxpayer are marginal; on many plans, the tax change can tip the balance. Take TR City of London, a trust with an excellent record which many private investors might wish to select. It makes an additional annual charge of 1 per cent plus VAT (1.175 per cent in total) on Peps. Let us assume that a basic-rate taxpayer wants to invest Pounds 3,000 in TR City. Until April 5, with the trust yielding 4.8 per cent, he can look forward to a tax saving of Pounds 36 a year. This is marginally more than the annual charge which, on Pounds 3,000, works out at Pounds 35.25. After April 5, though, the advance corporation tax (ACT) change will reduce this yield to 4.5 per cent. The investor's tax saving will fall to Pounds 27, Pounds 8.25 less than it costs to hold the Pep. He will be losing money; and even if the dividends grow, so will the annual charge. Now, the Pep investor also benefits from the capital gains tax exemption. But very few people actually pay CGT in the UK - fewer than 100,000 this year. If the investor's holding grew at 10 per cent, and inflation was 5 per cent, it would take 15 years before the indexed gain exceeded the present Pounds 5,800 CGT threshold. Even then, the problem could be easily avoided by selling the holding in two tax years. So, it might well be that, if you are a small investor and a basic rate-payer, you are better off in the TR City savings scheme than in the Pep. TR City is trying to remedy that problem by lowering to 0.5 per cent the charge on those Peps worth more than Pounds 6,000 (the reduction applies only to that element of the plan above that level). But since it would take eight years for a Pounds 3,000 investment to grow to Pounds 6,000 (assuming a 10 per cent growth rate), this is of limited benefit to our hypothetical small investor. Thus, I repeat my advice to basic rate-payers: analyse the charges of a Pep very carefully. There might even be a case for saying that, for small sums, an investment trust savings scheme, with low charges, is better than a conventional unit trust Pep. I analysed two hypothetical trusts with identical portfolio yields of 4.4 per cent. After management charges of 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, and allowing for the ACT change, the yield to the basic rate-payer is 3 per cent on the investment trust and 3.1875 per cent on the unit trust Pep. But that marginal advantage in yield must be set against initial costs; probably 6 per cent for the unit trust against 1.5 per cent on the investment trust savings scheme. Growing a sum of Pounds 1,200 (to reflect someone saving Pounds 100 a month) by 5 per cent a year, the investment trust savings scheme is still ahead after 10 years. Higher rate-payers should still find Peps attractive after the change but it is difficult to see how it can be claimed that the advantages of Peps have been enhanced for higher-rate taxpayers. Top rate-payers saved 40 per cent in tax in a Pep before the Budget; they save 40 per cent after it. Their income inside and outside a Pep has dropped 6.25 per cent. That is not an enhancement.</p>

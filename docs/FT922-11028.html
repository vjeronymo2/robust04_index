			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Germans get on their bikes to beat strike ANYONE unable to postpone a visit to western Germany this week would be well advised to take along a folding bicycle, strong walking shoes and plenty of deodorant. Natives in most areas hit yesterday, on the first day of Germany's first public services strikes in 18 years, arrived at work sweaty after pedalling or walking in through temperatures rising to more than 20`C. Despite widespread disruption of local transport services in many areas, the early effects were felt mainly by drivers trapped in traffic jams on roads and motorways. Air traffic was little affected, although the oTV union said it would be 'crippled' later. The first significant disruption is expected this week, when support service workers may be called out. Post deliveries were continuing in many areas, although they, too, are expected to slow down as walk-outs of sorting staff and drivers have their effect. Directory inquiries was the only telephone service discernibly affected. Berlin was one of the cities to fare worst. Although public transport in the east was unaffected, movement in the west was hard-hit by bus and underground stoppages after 15,000 transport depot workers had walked out. Two-hour queues for taxis were reported at east Berlin's Friedrichstrasse local rail and underground station, the terminus in the days when the city was divided. Rain added to the discomfort. Frankfurt's main railway station, which handles 300,000 passengers a day, reported traffic flowing but subject to delays. Pre-strike preparations by the rail authorities, including running trains with only four or five carriages, and allowing only mainline trains in and out, had so far foiled the strikers' immediate aim of paralysing traffic. Most rail links around Munich kept running - local drivers are civil servants and not allowed to strike - although action by ancillary staff led to delays during the day. Union officials stressed that worse was to come. 'Almost all' public transport workers in North-Rhine Westphalia, the most densely populated and heavily industrialised state, are to join the strike today. Mercedes Benz, one of Germany's leading car and lorry makers, is to cut its workforce by 20,000 over the next two years, according to Mr Werner Niefer, chairman. 'Introducing such a short-term programme is urgently necessary if we are to remain competitive, most notably with the Japanese,' he added. Job cuts were only part of a wide-ranging programme, he said. The model range had to be extended and production methods adapted. The aim was to cut costs by 10-12 per cent. Other objectives were to increase research and development links with components suppliers, reduce the range of parts used in Mercedes cars and lorries, and improve plant working times. Reductions in the payroll would come from redundancies, early retirement and natural wastage, Mr Niefer said.</p>

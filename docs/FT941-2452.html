			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Gravy train Hoteliers in Corfu are trying to profit from the European Union summit which will take place there in June, Greek minister for European affairs Mr Theodoros Pangalos said on Friday. Mr Pangalos said owners of the three largest hotels on the island wanted payment for six days from those attending the June 23-25 summit. 'They were trying to profiteer when they should have thought more seriously about their customers,' he said. The hoteliers demanded the Greek state pay for the extra two days when embassies in Athens refused. 'I had no problem with the people of Corfu. I had a problem with the three big hotel owners, none of whom is from Corfu,' Mr Pangalos said.</p>

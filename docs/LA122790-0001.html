			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY  </P> <P> Tartuffles, 2145 W. Chapman Ave., Orange. Open daily, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. (714)  541-0053. Two words: cinnamon rolls. Hot out of the oven and smothered in  butter.  </P> <P> Plus full breakfast plates, an outdoor patio and great service. Need we say  more?  </P> <P> Casa Franco, 24395 Alicia Parkway, Mission Viejo. Open Monday through Friday,  11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. (Note: sometimes closes  between 2:30 and 4:30 p.m.) (714) 380-9693. A little family-owned Mexican  restaurant where even the owners wait tables. Try the nachos a la Franco, carne  asada and chimiflautas, then, if you still have room, go for a slice of mud  pie.  </P> <P> Zubie's Pizza, 1714 Placentia Ave., Costa Mesa. Open 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Monday through Saturday and Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. (No phone.) The pizzas  here come in one size only -- large -- and one price only -- $6.50 plus tax.  That's whether you order plain, the works or any range of toppings in between.  Expect picnic tables, a varied crowd and lots of noise, but you want decorum or  you want good, cheap pizza?

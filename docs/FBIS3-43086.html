			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr A. Migdal and Roald Khoffmann: </F> ``Russian Scientists Departing for the United States in Response  to the Smell of Hamburgers''; the first paragraph is an  introduction]    [Text] The article by Sergey Leskov, entitled ``Soviet  Scientists in America,'' published in the NEW YORK TIMES, is  long and wordy. It gave rise to lively discussion in the United  States. We did not deem it reasonable to reproduce this article  here even in part: from the objections expressed by newspaper  readers in the Letters to the Editor section in the NEW YORK  TIMES it is entirely clear what it is all about. We express  appreciation to those PRAVDA subscribers in the United States  who brought our attention to this discussion. (The letter from  Professor R. Khoffmann is published with insignificant  abridgements).    Letter to the Editor:  ``Like many of my colleagues, I am disturbed by the  irresponsible and presumptuous statements made by Aleksey  Abrikosov, who Sergey Leskov quotes in the article ``Soviet  Scientists in America.''    I am one of those who luckily survived the collapse of  Soviet  science. I received my post at Princeton University in 1989, at  the very same time when Doctor Abrikosov became director of the  High Pressures Institute at Troitsk. Like him, I am the son of  an academician. Although I detested the privilege which I had, I  left the Soviet Union in search for freedom and independence,  and not the ``good food,'' which Abrikosov puts so high on the  scale.    I worked with Doctor Abrikosov at the Theoretical Physics  Institute imeni Landau at Moscow for about 20 years. I know well  the ``food lines'' which he discusses. The specialized elite  distributor (exclusively for academicians) was located on  Leninskiy Prospekt, several blocks from our apartment. There  Abrikosov could have met with Doctor Roald Sagdeyev, although  such a type of meeting occurred extremely rarely. The people  reaching the corresponding level in the bureaucratic hierarchy  had the habit of sending their personal drivers and secretaries  for food products and not wasting their own time on this.    The phrase ``he went hungry while working for science'' is a  bad translation from the Russian (I read the original of this  interview in one Russian newspaper). In actuality, he said ``he  hungered for science,'' in the sense that he wanted to work in  science more than he was able to do in Russia. In actuality, I  understand this beautifully. After his early success in the  1950's, when Abrikosov made several surprising discoveries, he  later produced nothing significant -- neither in Russia nor in  this country.    Such things happen with creatively thinking scientists,  especially with those who began early, like he. In my case I had  a similar sort of experience and in actuality, over the course  of the last years of my stay in the Soviet Union I encountered  problems similar to those which he describes. However, we cannot  blame this on the system or on our former colleagues.    When I arrived here (in the United States -- S. S.) my  productivity increased. But I know that most of the ideas which  I am developing here were formed there in the ``food lines.''  Everything which we theoreticians need is a fountain pen and a  little paper, plus the possibility of discussing our ideas with  colleagues. All this we had at the Landau Institute: truly I  never encountered a better place for work than our institute in  the early 1970's.    I want to say: Russia is sick, but by no means dead. It  survived a far worse crisis after the Revolution when the best  brains fled from the country and Stalin dealt with whoever  remained. It's like there's something in the air which generates  new scientific talents and despite all obstacles induces them to  develop. All these ``elite'' scientists about whom Doctor  Abrikosov speaks are products of Russian culture, including he  himself.    Doctor Abrikosov proposes that the West ``assist all  talented  scientists to leave Russia and to ignore the others.'' This  smacks a little of Stalinism! That amused Stalin, moving entire  nations through the expanses of the empire. But what about those  who love Russia, those who prefer to share the alarm of their  country than to leave it, those who feel responsibility for the  laboratories and institutes which they head, and those who  simply are still too young to have an international reputation?    He, of course, knows all this, so why does he say such  cynical things? I have an answer for that. I already earlier had  heard something similar to this from emigrants, to be sure,  primarily from uneducated people. This is subconscious. It  bothers us that ``we are eating good food,'' at the same time  that our colleagues are suffering there in Russia. There are two  ways to overcome this subconscious split personality: either  assist them (our colleagues in Russia -- S. S.) or convince  ourselves that they do not require our assistance.    Aleksandr A. Migdal, Professor of Physics, Princeton  University, Princeton, New Jersey    Letter to the Editor:    ``The article entitled ``Soviet Scientists in America,'' by  Sergey Leskov, presents the contrasting points of view of  Aleksey Abrikosov and Roald Sagdeyev on ways to rescue Russian  science, obviously giving preference to the opinion of Doctor  Abrikosov, namely that ``it is useless to assist science in  Russia'' and that the only path to take is to help talented  scientists to leave.    This is a strange and defeatist logic. I respect the right  to  emigration (I myself immigrated to these shores). But the  superpessimistic, egoistic reasonings about emigration make me  protest. Russian science in the long run will flourish because  for this it has the talent and inclination and prehistory.''

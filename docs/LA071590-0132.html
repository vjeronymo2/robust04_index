			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S PICK: DIRTY ROTTON SCOUNDRELS  </P> <P> This 1988 comedy is a pleasant enough way to tour the south of France; it's  blithe and witty, with as many twists as a Riviera roadway. Michael Caine,  left, stars as a con man extraordinaire challenged by a seemingly klutzy  American con man (Steve Martin).  </P> <P> TMC Monday at 10 p.m., early Tuesday at 3:35 a.m. Sheila Benson  </P></p>

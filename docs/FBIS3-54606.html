An authoritative DFLP source has said that the central  leadership of the alliance decided to begin immediately to hold  popular conferences inside [the occupied territories] and in the  diaspora as an important step toward stripping the bureaucratic  PLO leadership of legitimacy and in preparation for holding the  general people's national conference, which will elect a new  political leadership for the Palestinian leadership and rebuild  PLO institutions on democratic foundations.    The source believes that beginning to implement this  decision  will be considered a practical measure of the extent of the  alliance's seriousness in its new form.    The source also pointed out that the central leadership of  the alliance had stressed the decision to form the Islamic  National Leadership of the Intifadah in the occupied Palestinian  territories -- which requires that all parties concerned hasten  to implement it immediately. This is in the knowledge that the  present leadership of the intifadah is formed from the DFLP and  the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine], as the  forces involved in the Oslo-Washington agreement have abandoned  it.    On the central leadership's other decisions concerning  organizational and administrative aspects, the source said that  these decisions become valuable when they help to effect the  alliance's political role, specifically in two main spheres:  holding popular conferences and expanding the intifadah  leadership so as to include the other parties of the alliance  operating in the occupied homeland which are still outside this  unionist framework.</p>

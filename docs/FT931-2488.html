			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Management: On the shelf at 45 - Many employers appear opposed to recruiting older staff Anyone born much before 1950 is battling against stiff odds in the UK jobs market. In some sectors even those born in the early 1960s are running into trouble. Evidence of widespread opposition by employers to recruiting older staff came this week, with the publication of a survey of job advertisements by the independent research group Industrial Relations Services. It found that almost a third of advertisers specified an age bar, an increase from a quarter four years ago. Of those that stated a preference, four out of five wanted someone under the age of 45. A newspaper advertisement by financial services company Laurentian Milldon this week is not untypical. Advertising a sales job, it begins: 'Are you aged 24-36, ambitious, energetic, a good communicator?' It finishes a touch unconvincingly: 'We are an equal opportunity employer.' Ageism is against the law in the US - but unlike racism and sexism it is not outlawed in job selection in the UK. Inquiries by the FT this week confirm the cult of youth is on the rise in most sectors and at most levels within UK companies. Cost is the most obvious incentive for hiring younger employees, although Marc Thompson, research fellow at Sussex University's Institute of Manpower Studies, sees pay as less of a reason these days for going for the under 45s. Performance-based pay systems are taking over from age-based ones in many companies, he says. Thompson's research shows many objections to older workers - such as the fear that any pay-back period on training will be too short for older recruits - are not grounded in fact. Older employees may be better timekeepers, take less time off and stay longer in their jobs. Clearly not everyone is convinced. Jerry Turner from Laurentian Milldon says: 'By and large, 24-36 is the client base age range they'll be selling to - there's generally an affinity between people of a common age. Also, I hate to say this, but people above that age don't have the bottle for the job.' Older middle managers are also liable to be cold-shouldered. The publishing company Cornhill Publications believes that in general older managers do not fit in with its young culture. Cornhill employs about 130 staff, mainly in telesales. Most managers are in their mid-20s to early 30s. Simone Kesseler, aged 30, Cornhill's business development director, said: 'It really isn't a conscious rule, it's not really set in stone. It just happens that this is the kind of business that attracts young people and they perform better in this environment.' Not surprisingly, the same attitude is prevalent in the computer industry and in City dealing rooms. 'It is de rigueur that people recruited in the derivatives industry are not only sub-45, but sub-35,' said Roger Steare, a director of Jonathan Wren, the city recruitment consultancy. Given that the derivatives market only got going in the last 10 years, the oldest of them are in their mid-30s. In banking, too, there may have even been a slight decrease in the average age of staff. 'Firms are prepared to buy a little less experience to save a little money,' says Steare. He knows of cases where staff in their early 40s had been 'made redundant' and replaced by people five years younger and cheaper. IT companies and recruitment agencies deny they are discriminating against age per se. Russell Clements, director of the IT recruitment consultants Computer Futures, admits that advertisements often carry age specifications. However, he stresses this only occurs when the company actually demands it. He adds: 'When it's specified it reflects a degree of honesty.' In the case of a maximum age limit, he adds, what is at stake is technical know-how. The older ex-managers who fail to get basic computing jobs they apply for are, he says, unreasonable to assume that age requirements were the only factor. 'Age gets used as an excuse. It is very difficult to separate the fact that those people who are older often don't have the right experience.' Age bars are often explicit in secretarial jobs. Debra Allcock, head of the Industrial Society's secretarial development programme, is a former secretary and has seen 'time and time again, those who are 40-plus having a lot more difficulty getting jobs, even if they are highly skilled'. The very senior secretaries working for chairmen and chief executives, may be older, she says: 'But middle managers will often go for very young, glamorous secretaries, particularly if they are recruiting themselves. It happens less often if personnel departments are appointing.' In a recent issue of the London Evening Standard, Centre Point Bureau had three advertisements for secretarial staff, one specifying an age of 20-24, the second for a 20-23-year-old, and the third for someone aged 24-28. The reason for stating the age required, said the agency, is that: 'Age depicts salary and the style of the department you're going in to.' On another occasion they could equally have been looking for older secretaries, says the bureau. Reed employment agencies offers a 50 per cent discount on their fee to employers taking on workers aged over 50. 'It's not that we think older workers are worth less. But we had been coming up against companies who were saying they didn't want to consider the CVs of anyone over 50,' says the company. It is not all bad news, however. Occasionally, the tables will be turned and the older employee will find herself positively sought after. Wine merchants Corney and Barrow recently advertising for 'a paragon to fill the enormous gap which will arise when our telephonist/receptionist/clerical assistant retires in May'. The advertisement added: 'Preference will be given to mature applicants.' Chris Trott, aged 58, a senior executive at Chusid Lander, the career consultancy, believes employers are becoming more sympathetic to the idea of the middle-aged manager. 'On the whole 'management' is becoming younger and younger. My impression is, however, that a lot of employers have found they have discarded a lot of experience as they discarded older people.'

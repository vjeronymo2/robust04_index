			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Performance pay plan for teachers PERFORMANCE-related pay is to be introduced for teachers under plans announced by the government yesterday. Fourteen schools are to test ways of relating pay to performance - judged, for example, by appraisal interviews. The tests will be monitored by the School Teachers' Review Body, the independent group which advises on pay, and by the Department for Education. The department said there were few teaching posts left unfilled and recruitment to training courses was healthy. It said: 'The aim must now be to ensure pay is used in the most effective way to raise standards. Schools should now respond by identifying good performance in their teachers and rewarding it.' The National Union of Teachers is boycotting appraisal interviews where they could be used for performance-related pay. The Professional Association of Teachers said: 'We had been willing to consider performance-related pay in principle, but see no evidence that its adoption in schools would benefit either the profession or students.' The 14 pioneer schools are: Ashton-on-Mersey School and Audenshaw High School in Manchester; Blatchington Mills School, E Sussex; Campsmount School, S Yorks; the Cecil Jones High School, Essex; The Chase High School, Hereford &amp; Worcester; Crofton School, Stubbington, Hampshire; Deers Wood School, Avon; Eight Ash Green C of E Primary School, Essex; Furze Platt School, Berks; Hazelwich School, W Sussex; Lamphey County Primary School, Dyfed; St Martin's School, Essex; and Westlands School, Kent.</p>

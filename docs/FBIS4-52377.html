			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that China will exercise its  veto power should the UN Security Council [UNSC] decide on  sanctions regarding North Korea's nuclear problem.    In a meeting with Beijing-based ROK correspondents today [10  May], a high-ranking official in the Chinese Government said  that China is making diplomatic efforts, including  behind-the-scenes contacts, so that dialogue between North Korea  and the United States is realized before 15 May, the deadline  for allowing inspections of the International Atomic Energy  Agency.    This official, however, stressed that the Chinese Government  position is that it opposes the use of pressure on North Korea  as a method of solving the problem. Thus, he strongly suggested  that China will exercise its veto power when the North Korean  nuclear problem is referred to the UN Security Council.</p>

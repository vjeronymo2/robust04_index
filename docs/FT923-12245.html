			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television Secret History, the documentary series investigating modern mysteries, is tackling a Big One tonight (Channel 4 at 9 pm)-- The Last Days of Aldo Moro. The Italian Prime Minister was missing for fifty five days in 1978 before his body was found dumped in a Rome street. He was killed by the Red Brigade but of course the programme manages to suggest that his colleagues in Government were just as anxious to get rid of him. Simon Brett's genteel comedy After Henry, featuring Prunella Scales as a middle aged, middle class widow, seems somehow too genteel for ITV. It betrays its BBC Radio 4 origins. But this new series, going out at 8.00, deserves a mild welcome back even if it is sometimes too cosy for its own good. AIDS get a double airing tonight. Panorama (BBC 1) examines new fears of AIDS spreading among heterosexuals while on The Dazzling Image (Channel 4 10.55) film director Derek Jarman, who has the HIV virus, introduces the award winning film Relax by Chris Newby about a man awaiting the results of his AIDS test.</p>

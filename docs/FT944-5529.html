			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Lott becomes Republican whip Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming was yesterday voted out of his position as the Republican whip in the US Senate, in favour of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. The whip is second in command to Senator Bob Dole, who was duly elected yesterday to lead the Republican majority in the new Congress. The acid-tongued Mr Simpson would have been expected to hold the fort loyally for Mr Dole if he should leave Washington to campaign for the presidency, while Mr Lott, an articulate believer in supply-side economics, is viewed as an ally of Mr Dole's old enemy Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is also seeking the presidency. On the Democratic side, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota was elected to succeed retiring Senator George Mitchell as the Democratic leader in the Senate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Bociurkiw] </F>   [Text] Canada is threatening to use deportations and  tougher visa conditions in a crackdown on entrepreneur  immigrants who violate their visa terms. According to  confidential documents from the Canadian Department of  Citizenship and Immigration, a new "control strategy" hopes to  cut down on the number of immigrants who come to Canada and fail  to set up promised businesses. Once the changes are in place,  it could become much harder to qualify as a business immigrant.  Those who do will be subject to far stricter monitoring.    Entrepreneurs in British Columbia will soon be asked to  allow  immigration officers to review their tax files. "For deterrence  to be effective, participants must believe that the chance of  detection is high," the documents say, with "severe  consequences".    The move is in response to widespread abuse of the  entrepreneur programme, which allows experienced business  persons to obtain Canadian citizenship in exchange for setting  up a small business that employs at least one Canadian. In most  cases, the business must be established within two years.    To cut down on abuse, Canada started issuing conditional  visas in early 1993, but there has been little improvement. In  fact, abuse has been so bad that in some parts of Canada  immigration officers cannot locate many of the participants.  Many of the abusers are Hong Kong immigrants. A few years ago,  an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found 149  Hong Kong residents who were setting up fake businesses in  Canada.    In order to drive home the point that Ottawa is serious in  encouraging entrepreneurs to stick to their plans, it is to  deport several immigrants who have violated their visas. There  is no indication of how many entrepreneurs might be targeted for  removal from Canada, but one source said 34 cases in the  Montreal area are facing charges.    "In our view even a small number of successful removals of  entrepreneurs...would provide a strong deterrent effect," the  documents say.    Other proposed measures are: to take action against  immigration lawyers, consultants and agents who "misrepresent"  the entrepreneur programme, often by falsely claiming government  approval or watering-down the programme's requirements; better  overseas selection of entreprenuer immigrants-creating an  "electronic file" on each entrepreneur immigrant; requiring them  to submit progress reports every six months; requiring  entrepreneurs to post a performance bond upon landing; and  information exchanges with other organisations to locate missing  entrepreneurs.    Most Hong Kong people applying as business immigrants go to  Canada as entrepreneurs.    According to the immigration section at the Commission for  Canada in Hong Kong, most of the business visas issued to Hong  Kong immigrants are given to entrepreneurs. Of the 28,217 total  landings from Hong Kong in the first nine months of last year,  6,011 were in the entrepreneur category.    Even before the plan has been implemented, it is already the  subject of controversy. A Toronto immigration lawyer, Mendel  Green, who has been asked by Ottawa to help assess the business  immigration programme, branded the plans "infantile".    "They should perhaps put their efforts to showing the great  successes of Hong Kong immigrants in Canada as an example to  others since the abuse is in such a low level," he said. Green  said the Immigration Department had exaggerated the problem.</p>

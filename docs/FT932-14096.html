			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Babcock loses chief in strategy disagreement BABCOCK International yesterday said that Mr Oliver Whitehead is to leave his post as chief executive of the engineering group after disagreeing with the board over strategy. Alfred McAlpine, the construction group, declined to confirm that Mr Whitehead would become its next chief executive, but said a statement would be made later in the week. Babcock cut its interim dividend in October and warned that difficult trading conditions in all the group's markets would depress future profits. Babcock shares yesterday closed  1/4 p lower at 37 1/2 p, well below last year's peak of 69p. Mr Whitehead, who was appointed chief executive in 1989, at the time of the demerger of Babcock from FKI Babcock, earned Pounds 322,434 in the year to March 31 1992. The group said terms had been agreed for the early termination of his contract, which entitled him to three years' notice. Babcock said: 'Mr Whitehead has made a valuable contribution to Babcock since its listing as a separate company, but in considering the future strategy of the group the board has recently concluded that the Babcock Group requires new direction.' The group said it was currently in talks with a potential successor and an announcement would be made as soon as the appointment was confirmed. Until then, Mr Jeff Whalley, Babcock's deputy chairman, who is also chairman of FKI, will be acting chief executive. Mr Whalley denied there had been a row between Mr Whitehead and Lord King, Babcock's chairman, and the rest of the board. He said: 'There was no row - I hope we're fairly civilised fellows. Oliver wanted to go one way, but there were a number of projects which the board had difficulty with.' Although Mr Whitehead was responsible for moving Babcock into areas such as water treatment and materials handling, the disagreement is not believed to have concerned the diversification moves made to date. There was, however, considerable concern when Babcock Energy, the group's power plant division, revealed a Pounds 5m provision for costs arising from difficulties at a combined-cycle power station at Killingholme in Humberside. The delay before these problems were identified is likely to lead to further changes at middle-management level. A new chief executive will also be charged with giving greater priority to finding a strategic partner for Babcock in the power plant area, where the group competes with some of the world's biggest contract engineering groups. Mr Whalley, who was asked by Lord King to strengthen the board, said he hoped to name a new non-executive director, who was a knowledgeable industrial contractor, within four or five weeks. In January the group appointed as a non-executive director Mr Alan Wheatley, who resigned recently as chairman of 3i, the venture capital group. Babcock will report is results for the year to March 31 in May. The board said it expected trading to be broadly in line with the indications given at the time of the October profit warning. Panmure Gordon, the house broker, is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m, compared with Pounds 50.1m last time.</p>

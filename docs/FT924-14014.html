			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Lamont defends his actions on Black Wednesday: Peter Marsh outlines the main points that emerged from the chancellor's appearance yesterday before members of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee EVENTS leading up to Black Wednesday, September 16: Mr Lamont said he had heard nothing since September 16 that pointed to any alternative to the forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism due to the intense currency pressures. He said sterling's former central rate in the mechanism of DM2.95 was not too onerous for Britain. To have raised interest rates before Black Wednesday would have 'undermined, not strengthened' Britain's position. 'Frankly, the game was up by Wednesday and we had no option but to withdraw (as a result of the extreme strains on the pound),' he said. ERM realignment: Mr Lamont wanted to make 'absolutely clear' that the government had received no request from the German authorities in the weekend before Black Wednesday for the pound to realign, along with the lira. During the week in which the pound left the ERM, the possibility of a unilateral devaluation of sterling, while staying within the ERM, had not been under discussion. The chancellor said he had seen what happened to Italy, which devalued only to see the lira under further intense pressure, eventually requiring it to leave the system. Benefits from ERM membership: The government had succeeded in bringing down inflation from nearly 11 per cent to less than 4 per cent, measured by the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index. The difference between UK and German interest rates had narrowed substantially since October 1990, when the UK joined the ERM. Future membership of the ERM: Britain would re-enter 'in due course' when various conditions were met, including monetary conditions in the UK and Germany being closer to alignment. It was 'quite impractical' to talk of a return until those conditions were met. It would be possible for Britain to ratify the Maastricht treaty without having agreed to re-enter the ERM. Exchange rate: Outside the ERM, Mr Lamont attached 'a lot of importance to the exchange rate', but ruled out any explicit target for the pound against other main currencies. He would take the exchange rate into account when framing monetary policy. 'The exchange rate is a very important part of policy; we can't let the exchange rate go,' he said. Inflation: The inflation target announced by Mr Lamont last week set 'demanding' challenges for Britain. Inflation had to be kept at between 1 per cent and 4 per cent, measured by the year-on-year rate in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments. The Treasury would attempt to monitor inflationary conditions by studying a range of monetary indicators. Future inflation performance: Inflation must come down further. 'The current rate is still not nearly good enough for this country,' Mr Lamont said, bearing in mind the better inflation performance of many of the UK's competitors. 'I have brought down inflation (under ERM membership) and I don't want to see it moved up again.' Effects of intervention to support sterling: Mr Lamont acknowledged that the large purchases of sterling by the Bank of England on Black Wednesday - which some estimates put at up to Pounds 15bn - had a contractionary effect on the economy by reducing the amount of money in the banking system. Some aspects of that, however, were counter-acted by Bank money market operations. He refused to put a figure on the intervention as the sum was 'market-sensitive'. Monetary policy since Black Wednesday: Base rates had come down by 1 percentage point to 9 per cent, while there had been an effective devaluation of roughly 10 per cent as measured by sterling's trade-weighted index. The combination of those developments added up to a significant loosening of monetary policy. Britain would not, however, have a 'growth target'. The government's main economic efforts would be concentrated on bringing down inflation. Interest rates: Mr Lamont gave no firm comment about the direction of interest rates, but in response to questioning from MPs about the continuing recession said he would not 'kickstart the economy by giving it an artificial stimulus'. Public spending: It would not be right to increase public spending because 'such increases cannot be afforded'. However, the Treasury would attempt to exclude capital spending projects as far as possible from the effects of any cuts. ERM fault lines: Those had arisen in recent months largely because of the 'unique' circumstances of German re-unification, which had pushed up German credit rates, and the lack of symmetry between the economies of Germany and the US. That had led to a strong D-Mark at the expense of the dollar, straining a number of ERM currencies, among them sterling. It was 'not inevitable', however, that fixed exchange-rate systems broke down. The ERM had performed a useful function for more than a decade in helping currency stability and adding to disinflationary pressures. However, there were technical aspects of ERM membership that could be usefully addressed, such as the rules related to when central banks should intervene to support currencies. Mr Lamont's future: Mr Lamont said it was 'complete nonsense' that he should stand down as chancellor. He had presided over a 'remarkable' reduction in inflation which was 'not an inconsiderable achievement'. Forecasting: It was fallacious to say whether the Treasury model of how the economy worked was good or bad; everything in forecasts depended on what numbers and judgments were fed to the models. 'I repeat what I have always said, which is that all forecasts should be treated with caution and scepticism,' he said. As for the future, Mr Lamont said 'no one would like to see an (economic) recovery more than me'. But there was a limit as to what governments could do to promote one.</p>

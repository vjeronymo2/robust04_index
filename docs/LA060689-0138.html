			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANG'S STROKE OF GENIUS HAD A BIT OF MAGIC  </P> <P> Paris is a veritable ocean. Throw in the plumb line and you will never know the  depth of it . . . -- HONORE DE BALZAC  </P> <P> Changmania?  </P> <P> Whatever it was, it gripped the heart of the city on the Seine, where on a  sunny, breezy, Monday afternoon, Michael Chang won a match that will live on  for . . . what, ages?  </P> <P> "You have to do more than knock off a player in a Grand Slam to be a genius,"  Ivan Lendl said. "You have to win one of them."  </P> <P> Of course. What Chang did to Lendl was not merely the work of a genius, it was  also the act of a magician.  </P> <P> From the upper stands at center court, you can see the Eiffel Tower, and  Chang's 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Lendl, the world's No. 1 player,  looked very big. It was not simply a routine fourth-round victory in the French  Open. No, this one was different.  </P> <P> The crowd at Roland Garros knew it, too, as they watched Chang defeat Lendl in  five sets despite painful muscle cramps in his legs that made every move  painful.  </P> <P> From a seat in a baseline box, Betty Chang clapped her hands in encouragement  as her son's will prevailed.  </P> <P> Chang did not move from his chair for several minutes after the match, but he  received a huge ovation as he walked off the court.  </P> <P> "When I started to cramp, I knew that the longer the points went, the harder it  would be for me to win," Chang said. "When I would go for it, I did.  </P> <P> "It was hard for Ivan to play because you have this mental thing in your head:  'OK, he's cramping, try to move him around.' You go for winners, but you don't  want to miss because if you miss, you give him a free point."  </P> <P> Chang, 17 years 3 1/2 months, became the youngest male to reach the  quarterfinals of the French championships.

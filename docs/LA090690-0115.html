			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODIGY TO HIKE ITS RATES, OFFER MORE SERVICES  </P> <P> The Prodigy electronic information service today will announce price increases  and a host of new features. The moves are meant to draw more computer users to  the fast-growing service while providing much-needed financial help.  </P> <P> Prodigy, introduced nearly two years ago, also will trumpet its "nationwide  rollout." Starting today, more than 90% of U.S. households will have access to  Prodigy with a local, toll-free phone call, company officials say. Previously,  Prodigy was available toll free to 65% of the nation's homes, including most of  Southern California.  </P> <P> Backed by IBM and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Prodigy is the nation's No. 2  "on-line" service for home computer users. It claims 465,000 subscribers in  267,000 households, second only to Compuserve, which serves 580,000 households.  </P> <P> Prodigy has made an unprecedented effort to hook a broad cross-section of  consumers on computerized shopping, stock trading and other electronic  publishing features.  </P> <P> But the venture has yet to turn a profit and by one account has produced $750  million in losses -- a figure called a "gross overestimate" by Prodigy. Critics  have questioned whether Prodigy charges subscribers enough and also fault it  for limited features and technical shortcomings.  </P> <P> In response, Prodigy officials confirm that today they will announce new  features including an encyclopedia and an expanded Consumer Reports library.  </P> <P> The price for Prodigy services, however, will rise for some subscribers. Until  now, subscribers have paid $9.95 a month. Now, if they continue to pay on a  monthly basis, the charge will rise to $12.95.  </P> <P> But subscribers now also can buy a one- or two-year subscription: a one-year  subscription would cost $119, the equivalent of $9.95 a month, and the two-year  deal is $200, which equals $8.33 a month.  </P> <P> Also, Prodigy will scrap its policy of unlimited free electronic mail  messaging. Instead, it will let users send, free of charge, up to 30 messages a  month that go directly to other subscribers. Beyond that, it will charge 25  cents a message.  </P></p>

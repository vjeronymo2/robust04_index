			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Money Markets: France trims overnight FRENCH money market interest rates rose yesterday, in spite of the Bank of France's decision to trim the cost of lending funds through its overnight window, writes James Blitz. The French authorities cut their overnight money market interest rate by 1/2 percentage point from 9.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent. This was the third reduction in the cost of funds lent through this window since the widening of the currency bands in the European exchange rate mechanism. However, dealers continued to think that the speed with which French rates are coming down is too slow to improve the country's economic performance, and those doubts were expressed in a weakening in the value of the French franc on Monday. The French domestic money markets were shut on Monday, but the cost of three-month money rose sharply yesterday, reflecting the franc's poorer performance the previous day. Three-month domestic cash rose from Friday's 8.30 per cent to 8.45 per cent yesterday. Offshore lending rates in the euromarket softened, having risen sharply on Monday. They closed at 8.38 per cent, having been at 8.55 per cent earlier this week. French franc futures also reflected the upturn in cash rates, with the September Pibor contract dropping 21 basis points to close at 92.82. The Bundesbank, as expected, left its repo rate unchanged at 6.80 per cent for 14-day funds in the run-up to today's money market tender. German call money edged slightly higher yesterday, being quoted between 6.70 per cent and 6.80 per cent compared to 6.65 per cent to 6.75 per cent on Monday. This was partly due to more tax payments being received. Call money is still at the soft end of the Bundesbank's desired range. There are few expectations of a reduc-tion in the Bundesbank's dis-count rate when the central bank's council meets again on August 26. Sterling markets remained quiet. Three-month money was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent, although the yield curve sloped sharply downwards to 5 5/8 per cent for six-month rates and 5 9/16 per cent for one-year cash. The December short sterling contract was 2 basis points firmer at 94.73. A shortage of Pounds 450m was removed in the afternoon with late assistance of Pounds 55m.</p>

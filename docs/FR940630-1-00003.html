			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has in the past worked with the state regulators when approving mergers and consolidations of federally-insured state chartered credit unions with other credit unions. It will do so as well when reviewing mergers and consolidations of federally-insured state chartered credit unions with other financial institutions. The Board values its positive working relationship with state credit union supervisors. This action is not intended to supplant that relationship, but to ensure the means exist to prevent losses to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and protect the rights of members. The Board will continue to cooperate with state regulators in cases involving federally insured state chartered credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current rule requires credit unions considering the merger/conversion route to submit modifications or additions to the member notices to the NCUA Regional Director and the appropriate state authority for approval before the information is sent to the members. 12 CFR 708.303. The Board is proposing to modify the requirement for Regional Director approval and require all credit unions to obtain institution merger/conversion notice modification approvals from the Board. As under the current rule, the Board will not approve proposed notices that do not fully apprise members of the negative consequences of the action as well as any windfall benefits to officials. The rule states that approval of the modifications may be withheld if it ``is determined that the credit union, by inclusion or omission of information, would materially mislead or misinform its membership.'' The Board wants to be very clear that approval of a proposed notice to members is not an approval of the proposed merger/conversion. Since part 708 does not provide an approved notice to members for credit union to institution merger/conversions, the Board expects all federally insured credit unions proposing such a merger/conversion to request its approval of proposed notices. The Board is requesting comment on whether part 708 should include a uniform member notice for institution merger/conversions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar uncertainty weakens share prices again - Market report An attempt to rally from Monday's setback in the UK equity market was thwarted yesterday afternoon when renewed selling of the dollar undermined both shares and government bonds in London. Trading volume increased sharply from the low level of the previous session. At the day's low, the FT-SE 100 Index was barely 5 points above the closing low for the year of 2,931.9, recorded at the beginning of this month. A very modest rally left the index finally at 2,940.2 yesterday, a loss of 30.9 on the session. Once again, domestic factors took a back seat in a market now thoroughly unnerved by the focus on the US currency and bond markets. There was little response to the announcement of an unexpectedly high deficit of Pounds 767m on UK non-European Union trade in May. UK stocks opened higher behind a better tone at the close of the New York bond market. Some modest bargain hunting was reported but share prices soon drifted off as London awaited the opening of the new Wall Street session in bonds and equities. The blow to confidence was delivered by the gilt-edged sector, which followed other European bonds in reacting sharply to news that the US current account deficit for the first quarter was the worst figure for five years. As long-dated gilts, steady in early trade, plunged by around a full point, the equity market turned off. An early premium on the September future on the Footsie futures contract quickly turned to a discount, and the Footsie fell away steadily to show a net loss of 34.4. The broader market followed the blue chip sector downwards, although the focus on futures-related stocks took some of the pressure off the second liners. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 16.8 off at 3,461.9. Trading volume was very slow to gather speed, and Seaq volume was still under 300m shares at midday. But increased selling in the afternoon took the final Seaq figure to 544.5m shares. On Monday, Seaq volume of 460.1m shares reflected genuine retail, or customer, business worth only Pounds 856.5m. This placed Monday's turnover among the lowest daily totals for the year and bore out indications that fund managers had simply stayed out of the market as the Footsie Index crumbled by nearly 52 points. Several leading commentators on the UK stock market repeated earlier advice that shares are cheap and should be bought at these levels. Clear signs of bargain hunting brought a few share gains but the buyers were highly selective and soon vanished when the market came under pressure again. There were widespread falls across the leading sectors of the London market. Weakness on Wall Street overnight, carried through into a fall of 13 points on the Dow during London hours yesterday, brought further losses in the blue chip oil stocks whose strength sustained the market last week. Nervousness over the dollar was heightened by reports that the US press had quoted an unnamed Federal Reserve official as confirming the Fed's worries over the dollar and readiness to raise interest rates to protect it. UK strategists could see no reason why the bearish mood in European bond markets should change overnight. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will today address US House Budget Committee.</p>

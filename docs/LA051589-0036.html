			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS PLAN VARIED ROLES IN STRIKE;  </P> <P> SOME TAKING SIDES, PITCHING IN OR TRYING TO PLAY WATCHDOG IN CONFLICT  </P> <P> Westchester parent Sherry Otsap says she'll be walking the picket line with her  son's teachers today. Barbara Bronson Gray, a Van Nuys parent, says she's going  to teach. Pam Bruns of Pacific Palisades says she's going to watch.  </P> <P> As strike conditions take hold in schools all across the Los Angeles Unified  School District today, parents will be taking sides, pitching in or trying to  play the watchdog in a conflict that threatens to turn many schools, bereft of  regular teachers, upside down.  </P> <P> No matter what side they're on, most say they're worried about whether the  schools will be safe, whether their children will be properly supervised,  whether they will get any meaningful education -- or whether school will just  turn into a big baby-sitting operation.  </P> <P> About 20 parents and children held a rally Sunday outside United Teachers-Los  Angeles headquarters near downtown to protest the planned walkout.  </P> <P> Even district officials admit that it's going to be tough out there. About half  of the district's 32,000 teachers voted to go on strike, and the district  estimates that it will have about 1,000 substitutes and administrators  available to cover classes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Monitoring Project  </P> <P> "We're hoping that we're going to see conditions that will satisfy our parental  anxieties," said Bruns, who is the co-founder of a Palisades parent-teacher  group that is sending observation teams onto several campuses today. "But we  just don't know what's going to happen."  </P> <P> Bruns spent Mother's Day in feverish preparation for today. Early Sunday  morning, about 20 Palisades parents gathered at her home to make final plans  for an ambitious monitoring project that will cover the coastal community's  seven public schools, which together enroll about 6,000 students.  </P> <P> Teams of two to four parents armed with checklists and badges identifying them  as "Parent Observers" will visit each school at three times during the day,  Bruns said. They will look to see whether students are receiving instruction,  whether they are in their regular classrooms or herded together in gyms or  auditoriums, what kind of personnel -- regular teachers, substitutes or  volunteers -- is manning the school, and whether safe conditions prevail.  </P> <P> Bruns said that although the parent observers all have strong opinions on both  sides of the teacher dispute, they have agreed to keep their views in check as  they visit schools.  </P> <P> "We will only be there to observe. We are not going to teach or supervise. Our  main concern is the safety of students during this tension-ridden strike  period, and we hope teachers on the picket line will understand our mission and  not be obstructive," she said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Gray, the Van Nuys parent, said she plans to be anything but  neutral.  </P> <P> "I'm frustrated with teachers," said Gray, whose child attends kindergarten at  Kester Avenue School. "A lot of parents out there will be happy to cross the  picket line and do whatever they can."  </P> <P> Gray said her principal expects that most of the school's 28 teachers will  honor the strike. About 20 parents plan to show up today to help operate the  school.  </P> <P> One mother who is an artist plans to set up an "art station" that groups of  students will rotate through, every hour or so. Other parents will tell stories  in the library and supervise the lunch hour. One parent who works in alcohol  rehabilitation will give a lesson about alcoholism.  </P> <P> Gray, who is a nurse, said she plans to bring her stethoscope to class and give  a lesson about cardiac physiology.  </P> <P> "So there will be some enrichment going on," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Far Too Dangerous'  </P> <P> Otsap, the Westchester parent who plans to walk the picket line, said she  believes the teachers have legitimate gripes. But she will not let her son, who  is in the eighth grade at Palms Junior High School's gifted magnet program,  attend his classes during the strike. She's heard rumors of a gang fight today  and is afraid that the school will be unsafe.  </P> <P> "How in the world can we possibly put our kids in school when in the best of  times there is violence?" she said. "Now they're going to be berserk. I don't  dare put my child in school. It's far too dangerous."  </P> <P> Another Westside parent said she, too, is keeping her child at home during the  strike. But, unlike Otsap, she said she feels no sympathy for the teachers and  plans to cross the picket line.  </P> <P> "I promised I'd volunteer," she said. "But I might get cold feet. If we go up  to the picket line, is it going to be like the Continental (Airlines)  machinists? Are they going to leap up and drag us to the ground? I think a lot  of parents are going to take their children to see what it's like, but if they  see their child's teacher on the picket line and she snarls at them, they'll go  home."  </P></p>

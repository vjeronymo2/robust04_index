			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: UK manufacturers must be given motive to invest Sir, The government's declared intention of 'enabling' industry in its expansion and contribution to the economy would seem to be seriously in question. Such a view is illustrated by the continued run down of manufacturing through the recession and the lack of confidence industry has in the government's industrial policy. Our association represents some 300 machine tool manufacturers and suppliers in the UK in an industry which is at the very heart of the UK's manufacturing base. Our point is that if the UK is to continue to have a viable manufacturing industry we must provide the best possible environment for industry to invest in the latest machine tool technology. This is particularly necessary during a recession. Without investment we have little hope of competing in world markets or of sustained economic recovery, and the proposals we have outlined to the government would only ensure a level playing field and would not constitute subsidy or the picking of winners. We note that last week the Japanese government proposed a package of support measures for small businesses and tax breaks for investment as a result of the economy failing to reach its 3.5 per cent growth rate. In spite of orders for machine tools in the UK having fallen by 50 per cent in the past two years, and the OECD forecasting that in 1992 the UK economy will grow at less than one third the rate of other G7 nations, there seems to be little attempt to boost the confidence in UK industry or consumers. We welcome lower interest rates and lower inflation but these on their own are not enough. Manufacturing industry needs the motivation to invest and the confidence to be able to take long term views and decisions. We call upon this government to act immediately to create the right environment that will enable UK manufacturing to play its essential role in the recovery of the economy as a whole. R P Bull, president, Machine Tool Technologies Association, Mr A P Balding, managing director, Beaver Engineering; Mr J L Bloxham, managing director, Cincinnati Milacron UK; Mr M Bright, chairman, Flexible Manufacturing Technology; Mr M J Legg, managing director, Hitachi Seiki (UK); Mr M Taylor, managing director, Bridgeport Machines</p>

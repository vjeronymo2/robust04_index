			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: Draft EC legislation may lead to payment of performance bond calls being prevented Sir, Mr John Featherstone's review (Business Law, February 13) of the risks of performance bonds following the Gulf war omitted an important point. There was no reference to current developments which are significant for companies having funds held by UK banks by way of security for possible calls under performance or similar bonds issued to Iraq. The fact - confirmed this week by the Department of Trade and Industry  - is that draft EC legislation will have the effect of preventing payment of bond calls where the UK supplier's failure to perform was solely attributable to United Nations sanctions. The legislation is likely to be adopted during the first half of this year. Although the interests of UK banks which have issued bonds on behalf of UK suppliers differ from the interests of the suppliers themselves, it is understood that the position of the UK government is to expect UK banks to defend the line. In these circumstances, UK suppliers face the prospect of not only having bond calls blocked after the lifting of UN sanctions, but also having funds held by UK banks by way of security eventually released.

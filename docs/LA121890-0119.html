			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> THE AIDS TOLL IS GROWING TOO LARGE TO IGNORE  </P> <P> It was the epidemic an entire country tried to ignore.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Zimbabwe's minister of health appeared before Parliament to  announce that infection with the human immunodeficiency virus did not  necessarily lead to AIDS. He already had declared that the strain of AIDS  prevalent in Zimbabwe was non-lethal.  </P> <P> The government of Zimbabwe discouraged national testing for AIDS. Blood donors  were not told if they were HIV-positive unless they asked. Ignorance was so  prevalent that a rumor circulated in Harare this year that the cure for AIDS  was raping a white woman.  </P> <P> Finally, the evidence became irrefutable. The number of confirmed AIDS cases in  Zimbabwe jumped from 119 three years ago to 9,000 in September, with another  12,500 people known to be HIV-positive. Even more chilling, an unpublished  analysis by Zimbabwe's Central Statistical Office estimates that the nation's  future population eventually will be halved by the epidemic, from a potential  18 million in the year 2017 to only 8 million -- fewer than live in the country  today.  </P> <P> Zimbabwe is symptomatic of the terrible toll that AIDS is expected to inflict  in Africa and in other developing areas, ranging from Haiti to the Philippines.  The impact, however, will not be limited to deaths. The crippling side effects  could end up shaping the future of many nations far more than traditional  social and political events will. In some hard-hit nations, AIDS could become  the central issue of the next decade.  </P> <P> "Today, AIDS is an issue of living or dying, of individual survival. Tomorrow,  it may be an issue of nations surviving," said a European envoy in Harare.  </P> <P> Since the most mobile segments of society tend to be the most vulnerable,  groups pivotal to national security -- most notably the military -- could be  ravaged. Officials in Zimbabwe acknowledge that up to 50% of the 46,000-man  army is HIV-positive.  </P> <P> "At some point down the road, this country may not be able to protect itself  from an external threat," the European diplomat said. "More than half the army  will have died off, and there won't be the manpower to replace them. That is  going to be a big problem throughout this region among unstable or insecure  countries that have tribal or other disputes, either at home or with neighbors.  It opens up some hideous possibilities."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the epidemic will wreak havoc with already troubled economies in  developing nations. Because AIDS is most widespread among the 20-to-45 age  group, the most productive strata of societies will be decimated in the 1990s.  </P> <P> "The economic and social impact of a disease that kills people in their most  productive years will be immense," said Dr. Michael H. Merson, director of the  World Health Organization's AIDS program. "The selective impact on young and  middle-aged adults, who include business and government workers as well as  members of social, economic and political elites, could lead to economic and  even political destabilization in some developing countries."  </P> <P> The dying generation will in turn leave behind a generation of orphans,  creating an enormous welfare strain.  </P> <P> Since the cost of caring for AIDS patients in poor nations is prohibitive, any  serious effort to take care of them will further drain national economies and  set back development. In effect, African and other Third World countries are  trapped in a no-win dilemma. If they use limited resources to treat people  already condemned to die, they will have less for the education and development  that are vital to both slowing the growth of AIDS and enabling countries to  enter the 21st Century.  </P> <P> But as Zimbabwe eventually acknowledged -- it replaced its health minister and  launched its first anti-AIDS program -- it is a dilemma that can no longer be  ignored.  </P></p>

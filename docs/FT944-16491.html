			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Bonuses to be stopped Fresh measures to clamp down on the City practice of paying employees bonuses in kind to avoid taxation were announced yesterday by Mr Lilley, James Blitz writes. In his speech to the conference, Mr Lilley said the government would make all payments in kind assessable for National Insurance contributions by the employer. 'I am fed up with spivvy schemes to avoid National Insurance contributions by paying yuppies their bonuses in gold bars, diamonds or vintage wines,' he told the conference. 'I'll put an end to them once and for all.' In recent years, the Department of Social Security has gradually clamped down on the payment of City bonuses in the form of goods. Three months ago, Mr Lilley announced that gemstones and a range of alcoholic drinks would be treated as payments of earnings. However, amid signs that Labour is committed to closing a number of tax loopholes enjoyed by high salary earners, Mr Lilley told the Tory conference he was extending the scheme. The government will make most goods in kind assessable, specifying those few which are outside the tax net. Mr Lilley said, for example, that luncheon vouchers would be regarded as a form of payment outside the National Insurance net. In the last Budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, claimed to have saved about Pounds 70m a year by preventing gold bars and other tradeable commodities being used to avoid contributions. One of the main reasons why companies have exploited the loophole is that while there is an upper salary limit (now Pounds 430 a week) above which no further employee contributions are due, there is no limit for employers.</p>

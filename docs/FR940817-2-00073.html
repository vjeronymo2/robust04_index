			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. 1993 Revised RfC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The original RfC for Mn was revised, in part, because newer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information supplied in conjunction with the resubmittal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT waiver application by Ethyl indicated that the workers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure levels in the principal study had probably not increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over time, and thus the modifying factor could be ``eliminated''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., set equal to 1). Another reason for revising the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RfC was that more recent studies (Roels et al., 1992; Mergler et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> al., 1994) provided additional evidence of health effects in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers at relatively low airborne concentrations of Mn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Independently of their earlier study of Mn-exposed workers (Roels et al., 1987), Roels et al. (1992) conducted a cross-sectional study of neurobehavioral and other endpoints in another group of workers from a different factory-namely, 92 male alkaline-battery plant workers exposed to manganese dioxide (MnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) dust_who were compared to a matched control group of 101 male workers without industrial Mn exposure. The geometric mean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational-lifetime integrated respirable dust concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was 793  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g Mn/m3 &times; years (range: 40 to 4,433). The equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value for total dust was 3,505  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g Mn/m3 &times; years (range: 191 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27,465). The authors noted that the monitored concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were representative of the usual exposures of the workers because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work practices had not changed during the last 15 years of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant's operation. No data on particle size or chemical purity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were provided in the report by Roels et al. (1992), but based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information provided by Roels et al. (1992) and Roels (1993), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> median cut point for the respirable dust fraction was 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> m  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerodynamic diameter. The respirable fraction is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of the toxicologically significant particles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., the smaller particles that are inhaled and deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predominantly in the lower respiratory tract). Total dust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements comprised the respirable dust as well as larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particles that deposit predominantly in the nose and throat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region (via nasal breathing) and would be cleared more rapidly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the respiratory tract than the smaller particles retained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lower regions. Therefore, the respirable dust measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were considered to be a more accurate indicator of exposure in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relation to the observed health effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manganese-exposed workers in the 1992 study by Roels et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed significantly worse than matched controls on several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures of neurobehavioral function, particularly visual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaction time, eye-hand coordination, and hand steadiness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar neurobehavioral impairments were also found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier study by Roels et al. (1987) of a different occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population exposed to mixed Mn oxides and salts at approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same levels of total dust (respirable dust was not measured).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a recent study in Canada by Mergler et al. (1994)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that, among other effects, performance on tests of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to make rapid alternating hand movements, to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand steadiness, and to perform other aspects of fine motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control was significantly worse, compared to matched controls, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers who were exposed to even lower concentrations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respirable dust (35  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g Mn/m3 at the time of the study). If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mergler et al. had included information on integrated past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure levels (which they have since provided to ORD in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preliminary form not yet submitted for publication), their study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have provided a fivefold lower LOAEL for the derivation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the RfC. In addition, reports of a Swedish study of Mn-exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steel workers (Iregren, 1990; Wennberg et al., 1991, 1992)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided compelling evidence of comparable neurobehavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairments, including slower reaction time and finger-tapping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed. The median total dust concentration in the Swedish study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was 140  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g Mn/m3, with respirable dust reported as constituting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 to 80% of individual workers' total dust exposures. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOAEL from this study would be somewhat lower than that from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Roels et al. (1992), but the less fully characterized exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histories in the Swedish study made it more appropriate as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting (rather than principal) study for deriving the Mn RfC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taken together, the above epidemiological studies provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent pattern of evidence indicating that neurotoxicity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with low-level occupational Mn exposure. The fact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that speed and coordination of motor function are especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impaired is particularly noteworthy, given its consistency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other epidemiological, clinical, and experimental animal evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of higher concentration Mn intoxication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Differences among these studies in the duration of workers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to Mn raise another issue of relevance to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion. In the Roels et al. (1992) study, the mean period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure was 5.3 years (range: 0.2 to 17.7 years). In the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies, the mean durations of exposure were longer: 7.1 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Roels et al. (1987), 9.9 years in Iregren (1990), and 16.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years in Mergler et al. (1994). The indications of lower LOAELs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Canadian and Swedish studies suggest that neurobehavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects might occur at lower concentrations of Mn if the exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods were longer. In addition, the age of the workers may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an important factor in interpreting these findings. The oldest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worker in the Roels et al. (1992) study was less than 50 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> old; also, the average age in that study was only 31.3 years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versus 34.3 years in Roels et al. (1987), 43.4 years in Mergler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> et al. (1994), and 46.4 years in Iregren (1990). These points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggest that longer exposure and/or testing later in life might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the detection of effects at lower concentrations than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible after shorter periods of exposure and/or in younger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers. On the other hand, it is also evident from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies that a much shorter period than a full lifetime of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational Mn exposure may be sufficient to induce Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> France confirmed that it has received technical help from the United States in  its nuclear weapons program but stressed that its nuclear deterrent remains  totally independent. The Defense Ministry was reacting to an article in the  U.S. magazine Foreign Policy claiming that Washington has secretly helped the  French nuclear weapons program for the last 15 years in violation of U.S. law.  U.S. officials, in an earlier statement confirming the exchange, said it did  not violate any U.S. laws. French officials said there was no dependence of  French nuclear forces on "foreign technologies" and no effect on "the  independence of French decision-making."  </P></p>

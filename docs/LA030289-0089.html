			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURDY'S HALF-BROTHER HELD ON ILLEGAL EXPLOSIVES COUNT  </P> <P> The half-brother of Patrick Edward Purdy -- the man who killed five children  and wounded 30 others here in a schoolyard rampage with an assault rifle -- was  arrested after he allegedly told Stockton investigators that he and Purdy had  plotted to randomly kill a police officer in nearby Modesto, authorities said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Albert E. Gulart Jr., 20, was being held in Modesto -- with bail set at  $500,000 -- after his arrest Tuesday on charges of possessing illegal  explosives, said Capt. David J. Scott, head of investigations for the Modesto  Police Department.  </P> <P> Gulart also possessed a Mac-10 semiautomatic assault pistol -- registered to  Purdy, who killed himself after the Jan. 17 attack on the children -- and a  semiautomatic M-1 military-style carbine, Scott said.  </P> <P> Stockton police, who interviewed Gulart as part of their investigation into  Purdy's background after the killings, said that Gulart told them that he and  Purdy had plotted to kill a Modesto police officer.  </P> <P> Authorities said the plans included ambushing a policeman, possibly a  motorcycle officer, at a Modesto bridge. Police said Gulart told them that  Purdy had suggested that the pair wait until summer when officers would not be  wearing their bulletproof vests because of the San Joaquin Valley heat.  </P> <P> Modesto authorities became concerned about the safety of their own  schoolchildren last Friday after Stockton police relayed a cryptic quote  attributed to Gulart.  </P> <P> Scott quoted Gulart as telling Stockton police, "Patrick was successful in what  he did, and I have a hard time driving by any school."  </P> <P> "I don't know what that means," Scott said, "but we weren't going to wait to  find out."  </P> <P> Scott said Gulart was kept under surveillance full time until he was arrested  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gulart has been described as Purdy's closest friend. The two were together two  years ago when Purdy, enraged at their mother, Kathleen Toscano, smashed the  windshield of the woman's car, police said. Gulart, a juvenile at the time, was  also with Purdy when his half-brother was arrested in El Dorado County for  firing a gun in a restricted area.  </P> <P> The two were also together, police said, three or four days before Purdy opened  fire with an AK-47 assault rife on the children at Cleveland Elementary School  and then killed himself with a handgun. Police say, however, that Gulart is not  suspected of any complicity in the attack.  </P> <P> Scott said the explosives discovered in Gulart's trailer outside Modesto  included blasting caps and a box of high-powered cylindrical fireworks, 2 1/2  inches long by 2 inches wide. He said the rifle and assault pistol were sent to  California Department of Justice officials to determine whether they had been  altered to fire automatically.  </P> <P> When Modesto police took Gulart into custody, they also arrested his uncle,  Tommy Gulart, 29, for a parole violation. He had been relased from prison on  Jan. 29 after serving time for assault with a deadly weapon and was charged  with being in a place where firearms are present.  </P> <P> Gulart's arraignment is scheduled for today in Modesto.  </P></p>

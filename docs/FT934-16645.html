			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mexican cornflour producer sold THE Mexican government has sold Maiz Industrializado Conasupo (Miconsa), the country's second-largest cornflour producer, for Dollars 140.1m to an investor group headed by Mr Raymundo Gomez Flores, a prominent Guadalajara businessman. Miconsa has about 26 per cent of the cornflour market, behind Maseca, the market leader. Mexicans make about a third of their tortillas, part of the country's staple diet, with processed cornflour and the remainder using traditional methods. Analysts estimate the majority of tortillas will soon be made with processed cornflour, which is cheaper than traditional methods. The winning group bid about 7 per cent more than its nearest rival, an investor group led by Mexico's biggest bread producer, Bimbo. Mr Gomez Flores recently failed in a bid for Asemex, the Mexican state insurance company privatised last month. He controls Banca Cremi, a bank that is to merge with Banco Union, and Dina, the truck company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Gomez Flores also has a significant stake in the fruit company Del Monte Fresh Produce.</p>

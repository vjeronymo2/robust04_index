			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Filipchuk report: "The Road Has Been Chosen. How </F> To Cover It?" -- first paragraph published in boldface]    [Text] On 7 and 8 April, the conference "The Road Toward a  Nonnuclear Future; Ecological Problems of Ukraine's Nonnuclear  Status and Human Psychology" was held in Kiev in the Ukrainian  Building for Economic and Scientific and Technological Knowledge.    The conference was largely sponsored by the Global and  Regional Security Institute. The Ministry of Defense and the  Ministry of Machine Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and  Conversion organized it. Vice prime minister Valeriy Shmarov,  who opened the conference, made the following comment upon the  fact: "The Ministry of Defense is interested in new scientific  developments as a consumer. The Ministry of Machine Building --  as a contractor...." Regarding scientists, they also tried to  specify their role in the future nuclear conversion and asked  how long the information (partially published in the foreign  press) that is essential for their elaborations, will be  withheld from them. To this Shmarov replied: Foreign  journalists know how to work and they always obtain the  necessary information.    However, this strictly practical question sounded very  routine against the background of the issues that were discussed  at the esteemed academic gathering. Namely: political and  legal aspects of nuclear disarmament; the development of  programs for destroying nuclear missile weapons and ecological  and economic problems of their implementation; how to prevent  the spread of radiation through subsurface water; the safety of  the population residing near potentially hazardous facilities;  the psychological syndrome that may afflict the liquidators of  the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant in the  future; social guarantees for servicemen from those military  formations that will be disbanded. With regard to the latter,  vice premier Shmarov said this: Seventy-five percent of all the  capital allocated for the disarmament program (according to some  tentative estimates, it is $2.5 billion -- N. F.), will, in all  probability, be spent on the social protection of servicemen  dismissed from military service, on finding new working places  for unique specialists, and on reprofiling. Incidentally, on  this particular issue, no common language was found with the  U.S. side.    A considerable sum is also allocated for ensuring ecological  aspects of nuclear disarmament. In the opinion of the majority  of speakers, Ukraine must abandon the idea of accumulating  nuclear waste on its territory and utilizing (which is extremely  expensive) the radioactive fuel in the hope to later emerge onto  the international market with newly produced uranium, something  upon which some specialists insist. All the more so since this  will be difficult to accomplish in the near future. In the next  15 years, Russia will supply uranium to the United States (500  tonnes, in accordance with an agreement). The conference, which  was prepared at the highest level and at which interesting and,  the main thing, realistic reports were delivered, proved that  Ukraine has a chance to cover that road toward a nonnuclear  future, but there will be many problems and shocks on that road.</p>

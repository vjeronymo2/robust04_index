			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Danish minister hopes for French 'yes' DENMARK'S determination to keep control of social security policy and fears that the Maastricht treaty would undermine Nato are concerns that would have to be addressed at the Edinburgh EC summit, the Danish foreign minister said at the conference yesterday. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said he hoped for a Yes vote in the French referendum on Sunday, but that the Maastricht agreement would have to be modified in some way - 'Maastricht-plus' - before the Danish government would consider putting it to a second referendum for ratification. A white paper from the Danish government is expected within the next few weeks, and the Danes hope that the summit in early December will provide the basis for an agreement, perhaps through new declarations or protocols, so they will be able to hold a further referendum in the spring. 'There is a common interest in finding solutions. We're interested in finding a solution that does as little harm as possible to European integration,' he said at a press conference after his speech. Mr Ellemann-Jensen refused to be drawn on whether it would be helpful for the British to press ahead with ratification before a second Danish referendum, but at the same time made clear that there was no prospect of the Danish government trying to rush a referendum through to suit the convenience of other member states or to meet the original timetable of ratification by the end of this year. Opposition to the treaty had come from across the political spectrum, he added: some on the left had not wanted to give up control of the Danes' generous social security arrangements, while others had been concerned that the role envisaged for the Western European Union would cut across transatlantic co-operation, or had not liked the idea of European citizenship. He said that the Danish result had shown how EC governments had been running ahead of public opinion, and that it had given them a chance to put that right before it was too late. The Community must become more open and accountable and less bureaucratic; critically through developing subsidiarity as a counter to centralising tendencies. 'Unless the Community is able to convince the European populations that we mean what we say when we talk about subsidiarity, the European integration will be brought to an abrupt halt,' he warned.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Bush facing pressure over taxes and economic outlook PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday responded to fresh evidence of US economic weakness and to pressure from Republican conservatives by saying he would focus on measures to encourage jobs, investment and savings in his State of the Union address next week. Mr Bush said he would avoid purely political measures that would hurt the economy by putting upward pressure on interest rates - a reference to calls for tax cuts for middle-income Americans. Conservative Republicans in Congress are trying to steer Mr Bush away from across-the-board income tax cuts championed by leading Congressional Democrats. The Republicans have threatened to unveil competing proposals if the president fails to announce bold cuts in capital gains taxes as part of his bid to stimulate growth. The Federal Reserve's latest 'Beige Book' assessment of US regional economic trends, released yesterday, offered no evidence of economic recovery. Manufacturers reported steady or declining output in most districts and weakening domestic order books. There was no sign of a revival in consumer or business loan demand. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 15 per cent last year, making 1991 the worst year for the housing industry since 1945. Building activity declined in every region of the economy. Analysts, however, drew some comfort from a mild recovery of starts towards the end of last year. Starts rose 2.6 per cent between November and December. Mr Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, an independent adviser to Congress, said he expected lower interest rates to spur a mild economic recovery in the second half of this year. The CBO's semi-annual economic forecast predicts 1.6 per cent growth this year, rising to 3.6 per cent next year. It cautions against a fiscal stimulus, arguing that 'policies that would aid the economy's short-term recovery are all too likely to undercut its long-run performance'. Mr Bush's growth package is expected to include tax relief for first-time homebuyers, tax incentives for personal savings, faster depreciation allowances, lower capital gains taxes, tax relief for medical insurance and a rise in the personal exemption, possibly restricted to taxpayers with children. Some conservative Republicans, however, fear Mr Bush will not strike the right balance between short-term relief for hard-pressed individuals and longer-term measures to stimulate business investment.

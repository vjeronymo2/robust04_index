			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tatyana Shumilina report, followed by PRAVDA commentary, </F> under the rubric "`Democracy' In Action" and the general heading  "Entertaining Arithmetic For City Duma"]    [Text] How often do we hear it said that we have finally  been through the most democratic elections in our country's  history. Is this the case?    For instance, in the elections to the Moscow City Duma,  people were entitled to vote either for one of the candidates or  against all of them. It turned out that if voters supported one  candidate, their votes against the other candidates seemingly  did not exist. And that is not all.    Those voters who were opposed to all the candidates were  deprived of their votes. Their ballot papers were not taken  into account. Do you not believe me? You want to see it for  yourself? Be my guest! Let's look at the voting returns:    Electoral District No. 1. M.I. Moskvin-Tarkhanov elected.  He won the votes of 29,180 Muscovites. Votes against all  candidates -- and, consequently, against him too -- came to  37,681.    Electoral District No. 2. N.M. Moskovchenko elected.    "For" -- 18,017. "Against" -- 30,379.    Electoral District No. 3. S.A. Goncharov elected.    "For" -- 16,881. "Against" -- 19,561.    Electoral District No. 4. V.G. Makarov elected.    "For" -- 23,440. "Against" -- 26,367.    And so on in all the districts bar four. And in nine of the  35 districts the number of those who voted against all  candidates was more than 10,000 greater than the number of votes  gained by the candidate who became deputy. Particularly  noteworthy was District No. 18. There the elected deputy won  27,091 votes, but there were 42,153 votes against all candidates  -- some 15,000 more.    In the four districts where the balance was positive, the  situation was as follows:    District No. 4. -- S.Yu. Osadchiy: "for" 24,471, "against  all" 23,662;    District No. 21 -- S.Yu. Zhuravlev: "for" -- 35,393,  "against" 30,433;    District No. 26 -- S.O. Shokhin: "for" 32,531, "against"  31,427;    District No. 28 -- V.K. Plotnikov: "for" 30,540,  "against" 26,429.    I repeat that this was even though voters had the chance to  vote not against any specific candidate but against the whole  pack.    Why was this possible? The State Duma elections were  regulated by three legal acts -- the appendix to presidential  edict No. 1400 of 21 September, presidential edict No. 1557 of 1  October, and presidential edict No. 1846 of 6 November. Under  this last edict the "Statute on State Duma Elections" lost the  requirement that the number of votes cast "for" a candidate  should be greater than the number of votes cast "against." But  it said nothing about the city duma. It is not known who  removed the similar requirement from the Statute on City Duma  Elections, when it was done, or on what grounds.    So it transpires that in Moscow -- a city of many millions  --  only four deputies won a majority. [Shumilina ends]  <H5>  From the PRAVDA Editorial Office: </H5>   We do not want to offend anyone or -- God forbid! -- suspect  anyone of impropriety.    But several questions have arisen, and the answers to them  would allow us and our readers to have no doubts that we have  moved from the Year of Democracy into the Year of Great  Democracy. If the answers are forthcoming from the numerous  delegations of foreign observers, we will be very grateful.  Thus:    1. Is the form of the single-seat ballot paper for  individual elections of deputies fair and democratic when it is  proposed that the duly elected person be determined not by  crossing out the names of the others but merely by placing a  mark against the name of the favored person? And, if it is  democratic, then how do those who voted "against everyone"  differ from those who did not vote?    2. Were any foreign observers constantly present at Central  Electoral Commission information bureaus during the two-week  computation of the overall election results? And what is the  explanation for the fact that the information on the voting  results in the regions on a Russia-wide scale varied so markedly  during different times -- in the first three days, after a week,  and finally?    3. Do the esteemed foreign observers think it logical that  Russians should have heard a great deal about their official  presence in our country, but should never have seen their  official views of the results?    We hope that our Russia-wide issues will not overshadow the  main city-level question put to the relevant authorities by the  writer of the above note. In any event, we would like some  clarification -- were deputies elected to the city duma like  this or?...    Happy New Year, esteemed readers!</p>

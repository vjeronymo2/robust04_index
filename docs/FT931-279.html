			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / France wants G7 review of Gatt: New government seeks to cool rising passions in international trade talks FRANCE'S new government would like a high-level review of the Gatt negotiations to underline western Europe's difficulties in liberalising trade with the rest of the world, given the EC's recent commitments to open up commercially to east Europe, an adviser to Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, said yesterday. The incoming conservatives see trade negotiations becoming increasingly bad-tempered on both sides of the Atlantic. The answer they believe is to use the July summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries to elevate trade discussion above the level of the European Commission and the US trade office. 'We need a pause for reflection,' said the adviser to Mr Balladur whose neo-Gaullist wing of the new conservative coalition has strongly denounced at least the agricultural aspects of the Gatt negotiations. 'But we think the US administration wants time to reflect, because it has the same problem we now have of passing from campaign rhetoric to the reality of government.' France still wants a positive outcome to more than six years of Gatt negotiations, and the recent switch of the French employers' federation to a more publicly pro-Gatt stance will have some impact on the incoming conservative rulers, the adviser said. But the G7 summit could 'relaunch Gatt' in a better climate by persuading the US of the greater burden which the EC is now shouldering in opening its single market progressively to eastern Europe and Russia. 'When the Uruguay Round started in 1986, the Berlin wall was still in existence, and all that was being mainly asked of (western) Europe was to open up to developing countries,' the adviser noted. Another change since 1986 is the drop in the dollar's value. France continues to want the issue of monetary stability to figure in the world trade talks, and questions why the US considers currency parities a legitimate cause for concern in its bilateral trade with Japan, but not with the EC.</p>

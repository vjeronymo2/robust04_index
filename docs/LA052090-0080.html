			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SQUALL REIGNS SUPREME;  </P> <P> PREAKNESS: HE DEFEATS KENTUCKY DERBY WINNER UNBRIDLED BY 2 1/4 LENGTHS. MISTER  FRISKY FINISHES FAR BACK IN THIRD.  </P> <P> A year ago, Pat Day was on the fence, aboard Easy Goer and pinned in tight by  Sunday Silence and Pat Valenzuela in the Preakness. Easy Goer and Day reached  the wire a nose short of their more aggressive opponents, and it was a hollow  consolation to be second best in one of the most thrilling races ever.  </P> <P> Saturday, in the 115th Preakness, Day had the rail again, but this time he also  had the horse.  </P> <P> Summer Squall, the same little colt who came up empty in the stretch of the  Kentucky Derby two weeks ago, won by 2 1/4 lengths, ending the Triple Crown bid  of Unbridled in a reversal of the way they finished at Churchill Downs.  </P> <P> In last year's Preakness, Day's problem persisted through Pimlico's stretch.  This time, crunch time lasted only a second or two, when Summer Squall needed  room to go inside at the head of the stretch. Fighting Notion, who had led from  the start under Alberto Delgado, came off the fence, enabling Summer Squall to  slip through.  </P> <P> On Summer Squall's right at the time, gathering steam as he had in the stretch  run of the Derby, was Unbridled and his jockey, Craig Perret, who would have  been able to keep Summer Squall behind Fighting Notion if Day attempted to  swing to the outside.  </P> <P> Both Perret and Carl Nafzger, the Derby winner's trainer, said that the  Preakness turned on this point.  </P> <P> "If Pat doesn't get through (on the rail), he would have had to check before he  came around (Unbridled)," Nafzger said. "I don't think he would have gotten  (the victory). If Pat doesn't get through, then it's a good horse race. He  beats us a nose, or we beat him a neck, something like that."  </P> <P> Perret was astonished that Delgado, the champion apprentice in 1982 who was  riding in his first Preakness, allowed Summer Squall and Day to get by.  </P> <P> "You would think," Perret said, "that riders riding for this kind of money  would not give an inch. We're pros, and we want to ride safely, but the reason  we're here is to win the horse race. I had Pat in a good spot if he doesn't get  through. But he showed a lot of patience, and waited for the hole to open."  </P> <P> Fighting Notion, sent off at 35-1 by the crowd of 86,531, finished fifth in the  nine-horse field.  </P> <P> "I saw Pat inside me," Delgado said. "I had closed the fence (on Day) once. But  then my horse came out a little at that point. My horse was tired, and there  was no sense stopping Pat and costing him the race."  </P> <P> Some jockeys would have deposited Summer Squall and Day in the infield and then  gone on about the business of finishing fifth.  </P> <P> "That was a fortunate break we had in the stretch when the hole opened," Day  said. "This time my horse stayed in the game and kept his concentration, not  like he'd done in the Derby. He finished the way he was capable of finishing  and was not at the bottom of the barrel at the end.  </P> <P> "If the other horse keeps the fence, then Craig keeps me locked in and I have  to wait until he gets out of there."  </P> <P> With a Triple Crown sweep no longer a possibility, the only extra money  available in the series is a $1-million bonus that goes to the horse that runs  in all three races and totals the most points on a 5-3-1 basis for finishing  first, second and third.  </P> <P> Summer Squall and Unbridled are tied with eight points apiece, but Summer  Squall will not run in the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the series, June 9.  Cot Campbell, head of the 28-member syndicate that owns Summer Squall, repeated  Saturday that the colt would skip the Belmont because New York prohibits the  use of Lasix, which Summer Squall is given to prevent respiratory bleeding.  </P> <P> "That decision is etched in stone," Campbell said.  </P> <P> Unbridled, the 17-10 Preakness favorite, finished nine lengths ahead of Mister  Frisky, who saved third by a half-length over Music Prospector, a 61-1 shot who  had trouble most of the way. The others, in order, were Fighting Notion, Land  Rush, Kentucky Jazz, Baron de Vaux and J.R.'s Horizon.  </P> <P> Summer Squall, earning $445,900 of the $686,000 purse -- both Preakness records  -- was barely the second choice over Mister Frisky in the betting and paid  $6.80, $3 and $2.60. The other payoffs were $3 and $2.80 on Unbridled and $3.40  for Mister Frisky.  </P> <P> After a slow early pace, the time for 1 3/16 miles was 1:53 3/5, one-fifth of a  second slower than the Preakness record and three-fifths of a second off the  track record that Criminal Type set in winning the Pimlico Special a week ago.  Summer Squall ran the last three-sixteenths of a mile in 18 seconds, the  fastest finishing time since Pleasant Colony won the race in 1981.  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, who won the Santa Anita Derby aboard Mister Frisky for the Puerto  Rican import's 16th consecutive victory, was unable to explain the colt's  defeats in the Derby and Preakness. Saturday, Mister Frisky was within a length  or two of Fighting Notion, whose early fractions -- 23 1/5 seconds for a  quarter-mile and 47 seconds for the half mile -- were especially slow for a  track that had been producing fast times. From the quarter pole to the wire,  Mister Frisky had nothing left.  </P> <P> "The first two (Summer Squall and Unbridled) ran by me like my horse was tied  down," Stevens said. "The last two starts have not been up to par, but why, I  don't know. At the five-sixteenths pole, I asked my horse to run pretty good,  and after two or three strides, he didn't pick it up like I anticipated."  </P> <P> Laz Barrera took the blame for Mister Frisky's early position, saying that his  instructions to Stevens were too rigid.  </P> <P> "I told Gary to lay second behind the speed," Barrera said. "But that was only  cheap speed. Gary did what I told him, but we should have gone to the lead  because the pace was so slow. The horse was fighting him early."  </P> <P> In other words, the fast pace in the Derby hurt Mister Frisky because he was  too close, and the slow pace was his undoing in the Preakness because he wasn't  close enough.  </P> <P> Summer Squall was fourth going down the backstretch, behind Fighting Notion,  Mister Frisky and Kentucky Jazz. Unbridled was ahead of only one horse, about  eighth lengths off the lead.  </P> <P> Perret moved with Unbridled on the outside about the time Day was gunning  Summer Squall along the fence. When the hole opened for Summer Squall at the  top of the stretch, Unbridled appeared to nose ahead of him for a moment.  </P> <P> Day had no qualms about taking Summer Squall through the gap. "Easy Goer is the  best horse I've ever ridden, and this horse is the most courageous," Day said.  "He showed me that in the Hopeful last year at Saratoga, when he got knocked  around in the stretch and still won. He likes the competition, he even relishes  it. Today he wanted it, and he was hunting for it."  </P> <P> Summer Squall, who had bled twice before in the morning, during a workout at  Gulfstream Park in February and after a gallop at Keeneland last month, caused  a stir Friday when blood trickled from his nostrils for about four or five  minutes after a 1 1/2-mile gallop. Before the Preakness, Summer Squall was  treated with Lasix.  </P> <P> "I know this is hard to believe," Campbell said, "but we know the horse, and  his bleeding on Friday didn't worry us. What worried us more is that some  reporters saw the bleeding, and then we had to answer all the questions about  it.  </P> <P> "It would be irresponsible to run the horse in three weeks (in the Belmont)  with no Lasix, going a mile and a half."  </P> <P> Unbridled races on Lasix, too, but Nafzger said that the horse can run one race  without it. Running without Summer Squall can't hurt, either.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> REDS MIGHT HAVE SPEED TO TEST THE A'S;  </P> <P> BASEBALL PLAYOFFS: TWO SCOUTS FROM THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES SAY CINCINNATI MATCHES  UP WITH OAKLAND BETTER THAN SOME PEOPLE THINK.  </P> <P> The prevailing sentiment in baseball is that no team can beat the Oakland  Athletics. But according to two top Baltimore Oriole scouts, the Cincinnati  Reds might stand a chance.  </P> <P> "The Reds are the one club that has the closest ingredients," said Goldsberry,  the special assistant to Oriole General Manager Roland Hemond who served as  Chicago Cub farm director from 1981 to '87.  </P> <P> "I'm referring to speed, forcing the game, using the hit-and-run. You've got to  force the game with Oakland. You can't sit back and let things happen.  </P> <P> "Boston didn't have those kinds of attributes. They play fairly solid defense,  but they don't have the speed. I think Cincinnati matches up pretty well with  Oakland, as far as talent at positions."  </P> <P> Goldsberry, a high-level major-league scout, has seen both the Reds and A's on  several occasions this season. Cox, the Orioles' West Coast supervisor, was  Cincinnati scouting director in 1988-89.  </P> <P> "I don't think you're going to out-ability Oakland, but for me Cincinnati has  an interesting ballclub," Cox said. "I think if they get in this, they've got  as good a chance as anybody to do some damage."  </P> <P> Goldsberry and Cox envision a Series in which Oakland's opponent will try  desperately to gain the lead in the early innings in order to neutralize the  A's vaunted bullpen, led by Dennis Eckersley.  </P> <P> Such a scenario can work only if a team has enough speed to create runs on  sheer aggression, and only if a team has a bullpen deep enough to thwart  Oakland once its lead is secured.  </P> <P> Cincinnati has both, to a greater extent than the Pittsburgh Pirates.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds stole 52 bases for the Pirates, but Andy Van Slyke was next on the  club with 14. The Reds had four players finish with 20 or more steals -- Barry  Larkin, Billy Hatcher, Eric Davis and Chris Sabo.  </P> <P> As far as bullpens, Goldsberry believes the Nasty Boys -- Norm Charlton, Rob  Dibble, Randy Myers -- give the Reds even more depth than Oakland.  </P> <P> Boston relievers allowed 11 earned runs in their first 6 1-3 innings against  Oakland. That matches the total allowed the active members of the Cincinnati  bullpen since Sept. 9 -- a span of 63 2-3 innings.  </P> <P> But first things first: Taking the lead.  </P> <P> It wouldn't be easy for the Reds, Cox said.  </P> <P> "Every once in a while they can go toe-to-toe," Cox said. "Eric (Davis) can hit  the ball as far as (Jose) Canseco when he gets the bat head out. (Paul) O'Neill  is capable of hitting balls out. Sabo is capable of hitting balls out.  </P> <P> "The key is, they can't play dumb and beat these guys. Oakland has shown  they're capable of playing a couple of different brands of baseball. You've got  to pull out all the stops and don't stand toe-to-toe.  </P> <P> "That's a sound way of playing the game anyway. I think they have to be as  aggressive as they can be without being dumb. There is a difference. But you  really have to go get 'em. If you sit back and try to do it with a three-run  homer, you're going to get killed."  </P> <P> Goldsberry said bunting could be a key -- the Reds have several players who  possess that skill, and "that might take away from some of Oakland's game" by  distracting its pitchers. Hit-and-runs also would be critical, as would moving  runners over.  </P> <P> Anything, in other words, to push a run across.  </P> <P> The flaw in the theory, of course, is the A's starting pitching, which posted a  1.23 ERA in the four-game sweep of Boston. Dave Stewart and Bob Welch probably  could pitch five of the seven games, with Mike Moore and Scott Sanderson  working the other two.  </P> <P> The Reds' top two starters, Tom Browning and Jose Rijo, combined for 29 wins --  just two more than Welch. But both are highly regarded by Goldsberry and Cox,  as is Friday night's Game 6 pitcher, left-hander Danny Jackson.  </P> <P> "All of those guys (on Oakland) are low-ball hitters," Goldsberry said. "Rijo's  a fastball pitcher, and he pitches up quite a bit. He would give them a good  run for their money. I feel the same way about Jackson -- hard sliders and  fastballs in on right-handed hitters.  </P> <P> "Watch the Oakland club hit," Goldsberry said. "Almost all of them stand on top  of the plate. People try to pitch them away. I think you have to pitch them  hard inside, and use any soft stuff down in the strike zone."  </P> <P> The problem, as Cox said, is that the A's find so many ways to win. They  outscored Boston, 20-4, without a home run or major contributions from three of  their most dangerous offensive players -- Canseco, Rickey Henderson and Mark  McGwire.  </P> <P> On top of all that, they play suffocating defense, though Goldsberry said they  are vulnerable up the middle without shortstop Walt Weiss, who is doubtful  because of a strained left knee. Catcher, Goldsberry added, is their weakest  overall position. Yet Terry Steinbach led the club with a .455 batting average  against Boston.  </P> <P> Cox said: "Oakland has an aura about them that they can't be beat." The Reds  indeed match up well, he said, and they also play sterling defense. Yet Cox  remembered, "What they did not do real well when I was over there was play  quality fundamental baseball day in, day out."  </P> <P> That appears to have changed, especially in these playoffs. But even if the  Reds beat Pittsburgh, they will enter the World Series a decided underdog. It  would take a mammoth effort to defeat Oakland, an inspired effort, a flawless  effort.  </P> <P> No question, it can be done.  </P> <P> "But man," Goldsberry said, "it's tough."  </P></p>

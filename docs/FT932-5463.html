			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Nomura cuts domestic bond issue commissions NOMURA Securities, the leading Japanese securities house, will cut its underwriting commissions for domestic straight bond issues starting this month. The move comes ahead of the entry of banks' securities subsidiaries into the underwriting business after a partial easing of barriers between the country's banking and securities industries last April. Until now, underwriting of domestic corporate bond issues has been dominated by the Big Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi. Nomura will cut its commissions by Y0.05 per Y100 face value. The move is the first cut in commissions since the fixed price reoffering method was introduced into the Japanese market in December 1991. Bond market analysts welcomed the move, saying that market competition in pricing had finally started to appear. Nomura has cut the commission for Tokyo Electric Power's Y150bn three-year straight bond, to be issued later this month, from Y0.45 to Y0.40. The reduction in underwriting commissions comes as Japan's primary corporate bond market is changing its pricing and fee structures to entice Japanese issuers away from European bond markets. Nomura Securities International, a subsidiary of Nomura, has appointed Mr Raymond Carli as treasurer and senior vice-president, replacing Mr Kevin Farrell, Reuter reports from New York. Mr Carli joins Nomura from CS Holding's First Boston Pacific affiliate. Profits at Japan's Big Four brokerages' overseas units fell sharply in the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The profits were hit hard by the sluggish Tokyo stock market, which prevented Japanese companies from issuing new bonds and shares abroad, spokesmen for Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa and Yamaichi said. Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, announced yesterday that it had formally applied to the Bank of England to set up as a gilt-edged market maker.</p>

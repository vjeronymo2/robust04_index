			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / This Week: Sport Rugby League. October 22, Great Britain v Australia, first John Smith's Test, Wembley. It was a shock, in 1982, when the fitness and technical ability of Australia's touring side took British rugby league by surprise. This year their style of play has been a shock too, for the Kangaroos' machine-like qualities - grinding down opposition attacks and ruthlessly punishing mistakes - have played second fiddle to fluent attacking rugby. So far they have moved the ball so often and at such speed that, despite an uncharacteristic number of handling errors, they have swept aside the strongest club sides in Britain. The question is: will they continue this swashbuckling approach at Wembley or revert to error-free football. Great Britain, who proved their strength last year with victory over New Zealand, have brought in Wigan's Shaun Edwards as captain - a blow for Garry Schofield of Leeds who lost the job just two Tests short of equalling Mick Sullivan's record of 46 appearances for his country. Football. Uefa Cup, October 18, Trabzonspor v Aston Villa. European Cup, October 19, Manchester United v Barcelona. European Cup Winners' Cup, October 20, Brondby v Arsenal and Chelsea v Austria Vienna. Johan Cruyff threatens 'all-out attack' by Barcelona when they visit Manchester United in the European Champions' League. In truth they have little choice: Barcelona, initially the bookmakers' favourites to win United's qualifying group, surprisingly lost their previous game to Gothenburg and now lie third in the table. As for United, manager Alex Ferguson is not taking the threat lightly. 'Their names, that's the mental thing we've got to conquer,' he says. 'We've all got a thing about names. Romario, Stoichkov, Hagi - you are more frightened of the names than what they actually do.' In the Cup Winners' Cup, Arsenal are away to Brondby, of Denmark, while Chelsea are at home to FK Austria Vienna. Arsenal swapped home and away dates to avoid their fans travelling to Europe at the same time and on almost an identical route to Chelsea's. After their memorable victory over holders Internazionale Milan in the last round of the Uefa Cup, Aston Villa travel to Trabzonspor of Turkey. Boxing. October 23, WBO heavyweight title, Herbie Hide v Tommy Morrison; WBO middleweight title, Steve Collins v Lonny Besley; IBF lightweight title, Rafael Ruelas v Billy Schwer; non-title fight, Frank Bruno v Ray Mercer. Hong Kong. When Oliver McCall took Lennox Lewis's WBC world title last month, McCall's promoter, Don King, once again gained virtual control of the profitable world heavyweight title business. King's first move against the Lewis camp was to announce that McCall may defend his crown against Lewis's old British rival, Frank Bruno. It would be Bruno's fourth attempt at winning a world crown. But he must first beat Ray Mercer, who once stopped Tommy Morrison, the challenger for Herbie Hide's WBO title on the same Hong Kong bill.</p>

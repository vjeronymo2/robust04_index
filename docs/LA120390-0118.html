			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SNOW HITS MIDWEST, GREAT LAKES  </P> <P> Much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region received an early jolt of wintry  weather today, as snowfalls of up to 10 inches closed schools, toppled power  lines and snarled travel. A blizzard warning was posted in parts of Wisconsin.  </P> <P> In hard-hit Iowa, Iowa State and Drake universities were among scores of  schools and businesses that closed their doors or delayed opening today as high  winds and heavy snows brought much of Iowa to a standstill. The Dubuque  Regional Airport was closed, with snowdrifts of 2 to 3 feet.  </P> <P> Forecasters said that the storm was caused by an intense low-pressure system  that was moving across central Illinois into northern Indiana this morning, and  that the East would begin to feel its effects later in the day.  </P> <P> National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Ferry in Des Moines said the  combination of snow and wind was the most severe in central Iowa in five years.  </P></p>

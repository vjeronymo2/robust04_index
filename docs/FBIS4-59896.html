			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Hamas Demands Its Founder's </F> Release"]    [Text] Damascus -- The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)  has demanded the "immediate" release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the  movement's leader, who has been in the occupation's jails for  five years. It renewed its rejection of the "undertaking  statement" which the occupation forces want the detainees to  sign before they can be released from detention centers.    A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's  Damascus bureau has received, says: "We demand the immediate  release of Shaykh Yasin and his detained brothers. We condemn  discrimination between detainees on the basis of their political  and ideological positions. Yasin has rejected all the enemies'  bargaining over his release. He has also turned down the offers  made by (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin and (Foreign  Minister Shim'on) Peres to release him immediately in return for  supporting the so-called peace agreement."    The movement warned of "the deterioration of Yasin's health.  We condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment  and undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's  persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise  Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government  responsible for anything that may happen to him."    The movement renewed its absolute rejection of "the  humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy  authorities" say must be signed. The movement said that "while  Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his  brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that  their detention will lead only to further escalation and  resistance against the occupation. All sincere people and  mujahidin will continue their efforts to secure the release of  Shaykh Yasin and his heroic brothers."    Meanwhile, a statement issued by the "Palestinian Forces  Alliance" opposed to the Oslo accord has urged governments of  the Arab and Islamic states and international organizations to  work to secure Yasin's release. It said: "It is meaningless to  release some detainees and continue to hold others. Human  rights are indivisible."    Abu-Hamad Mustafa, Hamas' representative in Damascus, told  AL-HAYAH that the alliance yesterday staged a sit-in outside the  International Red Cross offices. Alliance representatives  demanded Yasin's release. Hamas' representative added that the  representatives submitted a memorandum to the UN office for  delivery to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali.</p>

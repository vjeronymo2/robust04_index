			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN TO PUT BRAKES ON MILITARY BUILDUP;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE SLOWDOWN RECOGNIZES THAT COLD WAR TENSIONS HAVE FADED. HOST NATION  SUPPORT FOR U.S. TROOPS WILL GROW.  </P> <P> In its strongest acknowledgment to date that Cold War tensions are fading in  Asia as well as Europe, the Japanese government Thursday announced a five-year  defense spending plan that will put the brakes on a longstanding policy of  steady military buildup.  </P> <P> The plan, approved by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Cabinet, would also boost  Japan's host nation support for U.S. troops stationed here by about $1.7  billion over the next five years.  </P> <P> Tokyo has been under pressure from U.S. officials and congressional critics to  increase its contribution to the upkeep of about 50,000 U.S. servicemen and  women in Japan, especially since the crisis in the Middle East erupted in  August. Japan is offering to gradually raise its share of yen-denominated  expenses, such as civilian wages and utilities at installations, from the  present 40% to 50% by 1995.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Kaifu administration decided to cap the growth in defense  spending at 3% a year and to sharply curtail a program of front-line military  hardware procurement that has, since the mid-1970s, made the so-called  Self-Defense Forces into a formidable military with state-of-the-art weaponry.  </P> <P> The new "Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program," as the five-year plan is called,  also cuts the authorized number of ground troops from 180,000 to 153,000. That  is the number under arms in the Ground Self-Defense Force, owing to recruitment  difficulties. Further cuts in all branches will be studied.  </P> <P> "The Asia-Pacific region, although more complicated than Europe, has been  affected by the changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, and there are positive moves  toward a decrease in tension," Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said.  </P> <P> The Cabinet decision follows an explosive debate in Parliament over a ruling  party proposal to dispatch personnel to the Persian Gulf, theoretically to  support the U.S.-led military intervention there in a vaguely specified  noncombat role.  </P> <P> Asian neighbors victimized by imperial Japan during World War II raised  objections, however, and the pacifist domestic opposition bitterly attacked the  plan as opening the door to future revanchism. A humiliated Kaifu shelved his  "U.N. Peace Cooperation" legislation early last month.  </P> <P> Rather than seeking an expanded role for the Japanese military -- as the  conservative wing of the Liberal Democrats envisioned in the aborted gulf bill  -- the new five-year plan appears to signal coming retrenchment for a military  establishment that many postwar Japanese have despised, ignored, or at the very  least, felt acute discomfort toward.  </P> <P> Spurred on by U.S. officials, the Defense Agency's budget has been increased by  5% to 6% annually for more than a decade, despite tight fiscal constraints.  Only the foreign aid budget has consistently had greater increases. The  government set a nominal defense spending ceiling of 1% of gross national  product in 1976, but a booming economy has ensured steady growth for the  military.  </P> <P> Japan now has the world's third-largest defense budget, when military pensions  are counted.  </P> <P> Total defense outlays for the fiscal years 1991 through 1995 will be an  estimated $172 billion at current exchange rates, Sakamoto said.  </P> <P> Yet the plan limits spending growth in real terms to 3%, a figure roughly in  line with normal fiscal expansion for other government agencies. Sakamoto said  this target would be subject to revision only after three years -- and only  downward.  </P> <P> More emphasis than in the past will be placed on logistic support and troop  welfare in lieu of weaponry, a Foreign Ministry official said.  </P></p>

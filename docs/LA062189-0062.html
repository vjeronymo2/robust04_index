			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> FLORIDA LAWMAKERS PASS GUN SAFETY BILL  </P> <P> The Florida Legislature passed a bill making it illegal for gun owners to  carelessly leave weapons around children. The gun-safety measure was sent to  Gov. Bob Martinez after passing the Senate by a 26-6 margin and the House by 71  to 39. Under the bill, adults who fail to secure a loaded weapon that is used  by a minor in an accidental shooting could be charged with a felony and  sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000. It would be a misdemeanor,  punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine, if a minor displayed the  gun or threatened someone with it. The legislation became the focus of national  attention after three Florida young people were killed and four wounded in  seven accidents earlier this month.  </P></p>

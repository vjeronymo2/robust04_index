			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Bottom marks for Topsi One of the most popular investment theories has come unstuck in the last two years. Many analysts look at the yield on a share as a vital determinant of whether it is worth buying - the argument is that a high yield means that a company is undervalued and due for a sharp rise in price. Kleinwort Benson constructs the TOPSI-100 index from the 100 highest-yielding shares within the FT-All Share index. Rebasing both to the end of 1990, Kleinwort Benson finds that the TOPSI has risen by only 0.7 per cent, while the All-Share as a whole has managed growth of 21.7 per cent. The FTSE-100 index, which includes the largest companies by market capitalisation has increased by 24.3 per cent, suggesting that 'blue chips' have done much better than more speculative stocks.</p>

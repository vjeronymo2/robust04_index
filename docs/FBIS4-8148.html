			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, April 12 (TANJUG) -- No one at the United  Nations headquarters could confirm or deny on Tuesday reports  that a NATO aircraft bringing special troops and war equipment  had landed at Tuzla airport in eastern Bosnia.    The report surprised even U.N. peace missions spokesman Fred  Eckhard. He told TANJUG that he did not know anything about it,  but that it was possible that the report was correct and that  the troops and equipment involved could be those intended for  securing the airport.    The Bosnian Serb army general staff accused NATO on Monday  of  having used its aircraft for a synchronized action with Bosnian  Moslem infantry against Serb positions at Gorazde and of having  brought its rapid deployment force units to Tuzla airport.    The Bosnian Serb army general staff also said a NATO C-130  transport aircraft landed at Tuzla's Dubrava airport at 16:50  hrs local time on Monday, bringing members of the NATO Rapid  Deployment Force and a considerable quantity of ammunition,  weapons and military equipment for a coordinated action with  Bosnian Moslem units against Bosnian Serb units.    The synchronized attack in the Gorazde area and the use of  the Tuzla airport for military purposes (the airport has not  been reopened for relief aid deliveries yet) indicates that the  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has overstepped its mandate and  that it will be fully responsible if the conflicts in former  Bosnia- Herzegovina escalate, the general staff said.    Bosnian Serbs have opposed the reopening of Tuzla airport,  justly fearing that it might be used as a conduit for supplying  Moslem units with military equipment. They have demanded that  Serb observers and Russian peacekeepers be deployed at the  airport.</p>

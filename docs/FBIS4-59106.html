			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the World Islamic </F> Popular Command in Tripoli on 7 May--recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God: First, I welcome you warmly  in your country, among your kinfolk, given that Islamic homes  are homes for all Muslims. [passage omitted]    We know that the reason behind the founding of the World  Islamic Popular Command [WIPC] is the bad situation of the  Islamic nation due to the infringements of the enemy of this  nation, its greed, and its interference. This command was  established to face up to this bad situation, to try to save the  nation from the situation in which it finds itself. The real  reason that brought us together and made us found the WIPC was,  in fact, what happened to Libya. This is just an example that  justifies the correctness of our theories, the fact that the  nation is facing danger, infringement, and aggression. [passage  omitted]    Western interventions and attempts to impose negotiations  and  various deals are meant to secure and entrench a platform for  the realization of the plan against the Islamic nation. The  effort made by America, for instance, in what is called a peace  process, ensuring the success of negotiations, removing  obstacles between Palestinians and Israelis and the Arabs and  Israelis do not represent American eagerness to bring about  peace. America is not keen to save the lives of the Arabs and  Muslims. America is keen to ensure the success of its  imperialist scheme, and it is paving the way for this scheme by  its interventions. We know that this is the reality. If the  rulers of the Islamic-Arab nation are trying to fool the masses  and tell them the lie that this is a peace process, we are not  taken in by this lie. America is not eager for peace in the  Middle East. Since when has America been keen about peace?  America is the real enemy of peace. Since when has America been  eager about the right or liberties of peoples? America is the  real enemy of peoples, the real enemy of freedom. [passage  omitted]    Against whom is America continuing to arm itself? Against  Hungary, against Lithuania? Against which small state still  existing? Never. America made a statement through its  ambassador in Italy. He said: The confrontation is now finished  with communism, and the front line was Berlin. Now starts  confrontation with the Islamic world, so that the latter will  have the same fate as the communist world. The front line is  now Rome. We return to this official statement made by the  American ambassador in Rome. This is a grave warning that will  turn into a military, economic, and political action. America  is the one that enabled the Jews to occupy Jerusalem and turn it  into an eternal capital for the Jewish state. America will  enable them--and these words are for history-- to occupy Mecca  and Medina. It will enable them to reach the oil wells in the  Gulf. America cannot leave the income from Mecca and Medina,  the annual material income from the pilgrims, a large tourism  income, thousands of billions every year, it cannot leave it for  the Arabs, and the oil fields cannot be left for the Arabs or  Muslims. [passage omitted]    We want to embarrass them, to embarrass this false diplomacy  in the Islamic world, this submission, this shameful  prostration. We say frankly: We are facing a Christian-Jewish  alliance. We did not create it, they did. We just talk about  it. They have now launched a religious war. No Arab or Islamic  ruler in all the Islamic world would dare say that we are facing  a religious war because they are hypocrites, showing the  opposite of what they think. [passage omitted]    Regrettably, with the exception of just a few, the Arab and  Islamic states generally are paving the way for the victory of  the Christians and Jews over Muslims. We spoke about the reason  that made Islamic groups resort to violence. These groups say  they are terrorists, and they do not see terrorism with the same  eyes as others because this term appeared in the Koran: Against  them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power,  including steeds of war, to strike terror into the enemies of  God and your enemies. We are applying, practicing terror. God  said to have the strength to instill terror into all these  enemies. What is the reason behind the Islamic groups  practicing terrorism? We have found a justification in  prostration, the shameful submission of the official regimes in  the Arab and Islamic world before the enemies of the nation.  [passage omitted]    I personally do not support any Islamic movement seeking  power. The question is controlling the streets, not securing  power. When we control the streets and mobilize the streets,  then the veto will be in the hands of the Islamic masses in the  streets. When the American secretary of state comes to visit  us, we make people in the streets move. Roads will be closed  down, airports will be shut, and no one will offer him even a  glass of water. He will then return home ashamed. If you are  rulers, then you would welcome him and offer him all the signs  of honor and hospitality. [passage omitted]    Once, I stopped over in Paris when coming from Yugoslavia.  [words indistinct] in Paris, and I was due to meet the French  president. I arrived at the Elysee from the hotel where I was  residing with difficulties because of the Jews. They tried to  prevent me from reaching the French president. They closed all  the streets and put up barricades. [passage omitted]    They sprinkled metal spikes that puncture car tires in the  street in front of my motorcade. Have you ever seen a Muslim  doing this to an Israeli? An Arab doing it to an Israeli? This  has happened to me. I, myself, am a witness. They tried to  destroy my car. There was a violent clash with the police.  They brought a large number of police to enable me to arrive at  the Elysee with difficulty. [passage omitted]    If we direct our attention to power, I am against the  Islamic  movements that contend with the rulers for power, because they  would be compelled to become agents. As we said in this place  years ago, however, we do not want power. We want the Islamic  street. We want the Islamic street to rise. It would be wrong  to rise in the violence that we have seen, because this is blind  violence that, in fact, is out of place.    It is illogical when Egyptian Muslim terrorists fight some  Egyptians in the street and leave 'Um Rashrash under occupation.  It would have been more appropriate for them to liberate 'Um  Rashrash, which separated the Arab and Islamic worlds, broke the  back of the nation, and severed the pilgrimage route. Who can  cross from Egypt to Jordan or from Jordan to Egypt? They have  'Um Rashrash, which the Israelis call Eilat, in front of them.  The Egyptian jihad should be directed toward liberating 'Um  Rashrash and not for killing innocent people. What happened  when they killed the speaker of the Egyptian People's Assembly?  A new People's Assembly speaker was elected. When they killed  the president of Egypt himself, another president was elected.  [passage omitted]    In fact, this is a blind orientation. We only benefit from  it to express anger in the Islamic street against the surrender  of the official Islamic regime before the crusaders and against  abandoning the nation. This is the only benefit from it. This  is a suicidal act that brings no results. It is a suicidal act  that is similar to a person who protests against something and  openly sets fire to himself in the street in front of the  people, throws himself from a high place, throws himself in the  sea, or shoots himself to publicize his protest against  something. I have done this in protest against so-and-so issue,  as Buddhists and Hindus do. We interpret this in the following  way: It is a suicidal act that leads to no results, because the  person who commits suicide would be the only person to commit  suicide.    This is a suicide attack, expressing dissatisfaction with  what is going on. Islam would never succeed with the suicide  attacks we witness in Egypt and Algeria. These would not lead  to the success of Islam and will not awaken the Muslim nation.  On the contrary, these suicide attacks will lead to sedition,  civil war, and to the fall of Islam and national unity. Islam  itself will be finished. Not all the people who would like to  embrace Islam would like to embrace terrorism at the same time.  The vast majority embrace Islam because it is Islam.    If embracing Islam becomes linked to the bomb, the gun, and  underground action, people will turn away from Islam. It is a  serious matter. Islam is becoming associated with suicide. It  is either: You join me within this suicide group, or you are  not a Muslim and are an infidel and we will kill you. This is  what propaganda is making of Islam. Islam is said to consist of  terrorist acts, for instance, accepting suicide attacks, and  killing those who do not belong to the suicide groups. All this  will keep people away from Islam. The majority will say: We do  not want Islam with a bomb and a gun.    The battle is not one of bombs and guns; if only it was so.  If the battle with the United States was a battle of guns, we  would definitely defeat the United States. The United States is  a terrorist power and not an occupation power. We would then  defeat it when we became fearless of terrorism. The United  States is only a terrorist power, and it could not win with  other means. The United States was defeated in Vietnam by the  rifle. Its planes were defeated and destroyed when it attacked  Libya, a small country. It could not occupy Iraq. Its soldiers  were worried to enter al-Ahwaz, al-Ahwar, and the marshes.  [sentence as heard] The United States was defeated in Somalia's  forests by Somali gun and stones. It fears revolutionary Korea.  If only the battle was one of guns, the United States would  definitely be defeated. The United States is a winner, not  because of the bomb or the machine gun. No, it is because it  feels it is psychologically strong. It feels strong on another  plane: on an economic, social, and political plane.    Therefore, we need a movement to motivate the nation  politically, socially, and economically. We need to restore  ethics and authenticity.    We can close our streets without a gun, and not a single  Israeli would be allowed to enter Arab land. Even the countries  who recognize Israel could not have diplomatic ties with us,  because if we are in control of our streets, the ambassador  would not be able to walk in our streets. There would be no  room for him. He would not come in the first place if he knew  the streets were closed, even if the governments would recognize  him.    We want a full mobilization of the nation before thinking of  guns. We will not call for the killing of the Israelis who have  been touring and trampling down Arab soil these last days and  weeks.    We do not call for their killing. We call for their  rejection and the closure of our streets to them so that  governments are forced not to receive Jews again or assume the  responsibility for their safety, food, and drink, which are no  longer guaranteed.    For your information, in Libya there is legislation issued  by  the Libyan people within the Basic People's Congresses on the  implementation of the Islamic law. All the laws in Libya are  compatible now with Islamic law. This is a step forward. Yes,  we should put pressure throughout other Islamic and Arab  countries to implement Islamic law. You all know about the air  embargo against Libya and the attempts to freeze Libyan assets  abroad and to force countries to reduce their diplomatic  representation in Libya, but the majority of countries did not  respond to these attempts because they had interests in Libya.    A group of Libyan pilgrims have gone to Mecca by a Libyan  plane in the past, maybe last year or the year before, to  perform pilgrimage, but they were intercepted in the air and  forbidden to land in accordance with the air embargo issued by  the United States, Britain, and France. The pilgrims found that  this decision, issued by these Christian countries, applied to  Mecca and Medina. They were shocked and extremely outraged and  swore by God to go to occupied Jerusalem--as Mecca has become  like Jerusalem--in order to announce to the Muslim nation that  Mecca has become subjected to the will of the United States,  France, and Britain.    They then returned and travelled by rented cars to Egypt  from  an airport near the artificial Egyptian-Libyan borders. From  Egypt they hired the services of a travel agency in the occupied  territories to take them to Jerusalem. The Israeli tourism  minister and his entourage tried to consider this as an  initiative from the Libyans to hold contacts with the Israelis,  but they were shocked and disappointed when the Libyan pilgrims  announced that they had come to announce that Jerusalem is  occupied and should be liberated and that they had come to  Muslim Jerusalem in response to our rejection from Mecca .    The Israelis demanded a speedy departure of the Libyan  pilgrims from the Aqsa Mosque because their presence constituted  a threat. Their statements were inciting to the Muslims in the  occupied territory and outside and had also exposed the  difficult situation of holy Mecca. Consequently, all the  parties that sought to cover themselves exerted pressure on the  Libyan pilgrims in order to make them depart quickly. They  actually asked them to leave.    This year we were expecting the Arab countries responsible  for Mecca and Medina and the countries that lie between Libya  and Mecca to disregard the embargo on the route that leads to  Mecca. We were expecting them to say: The Libyans are free if  they can fly from their country. We open the skies before them  and open Mecca before them and would not ask them to have  permission from the Security Council before entering Mecca nor  deny them permission to fly through our skies to Mecca without  permission from the Security Council.    The entire world knows what the Security Council is; the  Security Council is America, Britain, and France. How can we  ask permission for pilgrimage from Christians? This is  blasphemy that is not allowed and is rejected.    The Libyan pilgrims were obliged this year to travel to  Mecca  on the backs of camels. I beg you to inform all peoples of the  Islamic nation of this and to disseminate the news through all  of the Muslim information media so that the Islamic world will  know the difficult situation in Mecca and the deteriorated  conditions in which the Islamic and Arab peoples are living.  [passage omitted]    You have to think of freeing your will so that Mecca is  subjected to Christian domination before thinking of pilgrimage.  I believe and I am convinced that this pilgrimage will not be  accepted by God ever. It is blind imitation and tourism, and it  helps improve Saudi Arabia's income only. This is a pilgrimage  I attack, and I consider it as a pre-Islamic ritual, [words  indistinct] [passage omitted]    I believe that the aim of the Libyan pilgrims, who have  left on camel back and whose caravan set off yesterday or today,  is to expose the shameful situation in which we and those in  God's house and the tomb of God's messenger are in. We want to  show for example that Sudan banned aircraft because it  implements the resolutions of Christian states. Egypt, for  instance, banned aircraft because it implements the resolutions  of Christian states, and Saudi Arabia banned pilgrims because it  implements the resolutions of Christian states. Even Libya, if  it does not have the courage to launch its aircraft, is cowardly  and implements the resolutions of the Christian states. The  aim, then, is to show them the trouble imposed by America,  Britain, and France on Muslims, on a Muslim people. Let the  Islamic nation watch women, children, men, and old people who  want to perform real pilgrimage and who cannot go by air and  sea. Their private cars cannot get them to Mecca, and they  cannot hire cars to go to Mecca. So they went by camels, which  was the means available. [passage omitted]    We challenge Egyptian Islamic extremist groups to only open  up the land route to pilgrimage via 'Um Rashrash. Those groups  are, of course, fighting the Egyptian Government, so if they  were to carry out this act, it would definitely not be blamed on  the Egyptian Government because the latter itself is at war with  those groups.    So, if these groups go and fight to liberate 'Um Rashrash,  which is Eilat, do you think it would affect the peace process  between Egypt and Israel, or will it be blamed on the Egyptian  Government? Never, ever, because as I said, the Egyptian  Government itself is in a state of war with these groups.    Yes, we challenge the Afghan mojahedin, the Algerian Islamic  Salvation Front militants, the Islamic movement in Sudan. We  challenge them all to go and open up the land route to the  pilgrimage so that the nation can be territorially united again.  The nation's back is broken. The Israelis have stretched their  power from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, so no crossing  is allowed.    Of course, this meeting is an emergency meeting. It  coincides with the pilgrimage season, because pilgrimage is in a  critical situation.    I wish our brother and friend Fahd was not a political  leader  of a political state. Saudi Arabia should become like the  Vatican, especially after he declared himself the custodian of  the two holy mosques and not a king. He is officially called  Fahd Bin-'Abd-al- 'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques.  When he gets this religious status, he will then become  absolved from the UN Security Council and U.S. domination and so  on. If Saudi Arabia wants to serve God's house, it should  change into a state like the Vatican. It should withdraw from  the political arena and remain a respected religious state. We  then would respect our Saudi brothers and hold great esteem for  them as the sponsors, servants, and guardians of God's  house--provided they cancelled the army, the police, their  political identity, and their diplomatic passports and remained  a state concerned only with the holy places and living off  pilgrimage income.    This is the right status, which should, as of now, be raised  to the Muslim nation and in the Muslim world. We are saying so  because we were very affected by the nonexistence of such a  status. We might have news today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow  on some of our women or men pilgrims dying on their way to Mecca  on camels. We do not know how many of those pilgrims, who went  in their hundreds, will come back.    Thus, we have been and will continue to be affected as long  as the pilgrimage is in such a condition. This is not an attack  on Saudi Arabia at all. It is to help our brothers in Saudi  Arabia because they are incapable of resisting America. The  Islamic nation should stand by the Saudis to enable them to  resist America.    Once, after Iraq entered Kuwait, I telephoned King Fahd and  asked him if it was true that America was entering Saudi Arabia.  I said that we could--on the Arab and Islamic level--interfere  and get Iraq's army out and regain Kuwait. Fahd told me that  America was a superpower, and who would stop it if it entered  Saudi Arabia. If the situation is like that, therefore,  America's resolutions will be applicable even in Mecca, because  America is a superpower. Therefore, the Islamic world should  embrace, support, and strengthen Saudi Arabia so it can say no  to America. These are reasonable statements.    Our brothers in Saudi Arabia might not be able to oppose  America, because America is a superpower. Not every one of us  can oppose America. However, we, at least, say no, even if we  die. If our brothers in Saudi Arabia are unable to stand up  against America's resolution, which is currently applicable in  Mecca, barring Libyan or even Iraqi pilgrims from the town, in  this case, we should stand by our brothers in Saudi Arabia to  strengthen their position in order to say no to America and to  give the Americans a sore eye.    Brothers, Mecca should never be part of a political state  because this political state might go to war with another  country. How would this other country's president travel to  Mecca to perform pilgrimage? Iraq was in a state of war with  Saudi Arabia. Could the Iraqi president travel to Mecca to  perform pilgrimage? They would have arrested him because his  country was in a state of war. He would be respected and would  not be arrested if Mecca did not have a political status.  [passage omitted]    We know that American troops are present in Saudi Arabia,  and  the reason is a fear of Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia  following its occupation of Kuwait. Undoubtedly, Mecca is under  American protection.    This talk should not be misinterpreted, saying that  al-Qadhdhafi has attacked Al Sa'ud and Saudi Arabia. Not at  all; we are not attacking Saudi Arabia. I do not believe in  media attacks or similar nonsense because it does not lead to  anything. On the contrary, I do sympathize with the Saudis and  see them in a situation not to be envied. We urge the Islamic  nation to stand by them in order to give the Americans a sore  eye, and we urge Saudi Arabia, if it wants to be responsible for  Mecca, to become a religious state only. [passage omitted]    If Saudi Arabia wants to remain a political state, it has to  relinquish Mecca and Medina to the Islamic Conference  Organization to run them. Actually, this is what we have been  demanding constantly.    Due to Mecca's bad and difficult condition, this emergency  meeting of the general secretariat of the WIPC has been held.  Now, we can try and make Libyan pilgrims request Sudan's  permission to let a Libyan airplane cross Sudan's airspace and  head for Mecca. Let us see what Sudan would say. If it said to  get permission from the Security Council, then Sudan and the way  to Mecca would be controlled by Christian countries. Or if  Egypt did.    If Sudan gave permission and said that this plane could go  to  Mecca and said: I am not interested in how the plane gets out of  Libya. That is Libya's responsibility. If you want to cross  our airspace, then do so, as long as you are going to Hajj.  After arriving in Saudi Arabia, let us see what Saudi Arabia  would say. Would they say: Get permission from the Security  Council in order to enter Mecca?    Do we enter Mecca with America's permission? Never! [passage  omitted]    Even international communism and all communists throughout  the world thought that communism was invincible and that planet  Earth would be red. We said: No, there is something wrong with  this theory. We said that these peoples would not continue to  be subjected to the communist parties--though we have a common  denominator, which is the struggle against imperialism.  Communism was a deterrent to America. America has no morals.  It fears. It was afraid of Brezhnev and Khrushchev. When  America's masters went way, it appeared naked and without morals  before the world--roaring, sending its troops everywhere,  interfering in everything, deciding whatever it wished,  stumbling over human rights and sovereignty-- because it used to  be afraid. America has no morals. The present U.S. President  Clinton--though he is a man of peace, young, etc. and has no bad  past record and was against the Vietnam war--he himself is a  victim of American imperialism and the CIA. He is afraid for  himself. Morals make a head of state. American intelligence  has no morals and is an arch enemy of all the world and wants to  give itself a licence to violate the whole world. [passage  omitted]    Clinton is afraid of the CIA. He is a victim of the CIA. He  is afraid because U.S. establishments have no morals. They are  hellish, as are the big multinational syndicates. The CIA and  the White House are all bugged. Clinton is living in hell. The  head of state has no morals. America has no morals. The West  has no morals and hates the Islamic world. The West said: We  do not recognize Mohammad. We Muslims recognize Jesus.  Westerners consider Mohammad a liar and a crook. [passage  omitted]    America has abandoned, when its interests were at stake, its  best agents. Not its friends, because America has no friends.  It has either an enemy or an agent. America has no friend at  all. You will either be its agent or its enemy. America  abandoned its best agents when its interests were at stake.    The West has decided on the nonexistence of an Islamic state  in Europe, and they are going to eliminate Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and then Albania. Any Islamic pocket will be eliminated in your  time, and you will still be alive, God willing. You will be  alive, God willing, and you will regrettably see the achievement  of this bad thing.    We, in return, will not accept a Jewish state in the Islamic  world. They eliminate pockets, and we eliminate pockets. Let  it be so. What is taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina--and what  will happen to Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, Bulgaria, and  others--will take place in Palestine. We eliminate pockets, and  they eliminate pockets. We will accept this. They decided  that. They decided to eliminate Islamic pockets in Europe. All  Christian states from Moscow to Washington decided not to allow  Muslims to have a foot of land in Europe. Europe is Christian.  From Moscow to Washington it is all Christian. As for you, the  Arabs and Muslims, however, they want you to accept a racist  Jewish state that is armed with nuclear weapons--with support  from the crusading West--inside your land, and they want you to  bow before it.    Regrettably, even Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] said yesterday,  when he spoke during the farce that took place in Cairo: We  wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the  land. You make them leaders and make them heirs. This  [Koranic] verse was said about Jews. He is stressing that we  have surrendered to Jews, and they have become leaders and  heirs. This is the meaning. It means: I have come to you to  share and to surrender, and this is a whole Arab column present  with me. This is an emphasis of this verse: God was gracious  to Jews and made them our leaders and heirs of Palestine and  other places, and all we got was the cursed city that is called  Jericho and the miserable Gaza.    The fact that Abu-'Ammar opened his speech with this verse  means that the latter was achieved. Jews have become leaders,  and God made them heirs.    What link do the Arab states that attended this ceremony in  Cairo have with the ceremony and Palestine? I challenge them.  The states that did not fight and that have no borders with  Palestine, why do they put their nose in this dust and sand.  Who has blamed them? They are weak states and should stay  within their borders. They are not asked to liberate the  occupied territories or participate in a liberation. Why then  do they participate in this scandal?    This is also a recognition of Israel. All those who  attended the ceremony in Cairo have recognized Israel. Who are  they kidding? This is an official recognition of Israel. Any  state that attended the ceremony shook hands with Peres. What  is the name of the prime minister of the enemy? Yitzhaq Rabin.  They all shook hands with him, and it is an announcement of the  recognition of the Jewish state by the Arab states. [passage  omitted]    Some people have not attended these meetings. Ghannouchi,  for instance, is a member of the WIPC, which is not the Libyan  leadership. He is not present now, however, and has not been  able to attend. He was not even invited. The reason for this  is that he fell into a dispute with the Tunisian Government.  Consequently, Tunisia tells us: Brothers, it is not acceptable  for somebody who is wanted over a political matter and is wanted  for trial in Tunisia to come and visit Libya because, in return,  it is not acceptable that somebody who is wanted in Libya is  treated with deference or (?visits) Tunisia.    This is logical. Consequently, he was not invited. We  wished that there would not be a difference between Ghannouchi  and the Tunisian Government and that he would not let himself  get into a dispute to the point where he is banned from staying  in Tunisia or Libya. We wish that the action would remain  peaceful, democratic, and political, and hope to make people  aware, which is a permitted action. Now there is an accusation  that there is a coup action, however, violence that is outside  legality, constitutionality, and laws.    What is striking in this context is that Britain gave  Ghannouchi political asylum. I have watched the development of  ties between Tunisia and Britain since the latter gave  Ghannouchi political asylum. Ties have improved, and recently  there were delegations, aid, loans, and a development in ties  between Tunisia and Britain. That is wonderful.    Let us assume, however, that Libya gave Ghannouchi political  asylum. What would the Tunisian Government's position be toward  Libya. It would be different. It could sever ties. We did not  allow him to come in peace to a session of the WIPC out of  consideration for the position of our brothers in Tunisia who  want to put him on trial. Why did Tunisia not cut ties with  Britain? That is the problem, the problem of Arabs, of Muslims.  They overlook the wrongdoing of the enemy, their interference,  and humiliations.    When Algeria was under Ali Kafi's rule, I said this from  this  position--or maybe somewhere else--that I could bring  reconciliation between the Islamic Salvation Front and the  Algerian Government because they were my friends. I prayed with  them, knew them, and had debates with them. They could accept  some talk from me on opening dialogue with the Algerian  Government and setting aside the fighting.    The Algerian Government under Ali Kafi issued a statement  against al-Qadhdhafi. It spoke about interference and so on,  whereas delegations from European countries were going to  Algeria to check up on prisoners and human rights. There were  no objections about them because they were coming from  colonialist Christian countries. See what a system we have!    How could Britain give political asylum to Ghannouchi.  Ghannouchi was more entitled to being given asylum by Arab  states and not Britain. Britain, in that case, took a position  in opposition to the Tunisian regime. Tunisia should have  severed ties with Britain and not have had ties improve. If  Ghannouchi's presence in the country where he is now is not  considered wrong, then the WIPC has not done its duty. It did  not issue an invitation to Ghannouchi--if only to attend one day  of this session of which he is a member.    Britain gave him permanent residence and political asylum,  and its ties with Tunisia have improved! What we are saying is  in Tunisia's defense. We are saying this for Tunisia against  Britain because it is clear that our brothers in Tunisia cannot  tell Britain these things. We can say it on their behalf and in  defense of Saudi Arabia because it cannot say these things to  the Islamic world or to America. I can say them on its behalf  because of my position, as head of the WIPC. If I were  president of the Libyan state, I would not say them.    The BBC is known to be part of the British Government. The  Arabic service there is part of British intelligence. It is  known that it was established during World War II to counter  Berlin. [passage omitted]    This radio, for example, had an interview with a Saudi named  Binladin, who fled Saudi Arabia. He said his son had been  detained in Saudi Arabia to pressure him to return to the  kingdom. He gave an interview to this radio to attack our  brothers in Saudi Arabia. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Britain  were not cut.    Let us assume that Binladin went to a Libyan broadcast and  gave the interview. Ties between Libya and Saudi Arabia would  inevitably be cut the following day. Look at our situation.  Those who come from the West are as though they have come from  God. We accept them. Our brothers, however, are lying in wait.  During Ali Kafi's reign, no objections were raised at  interference by France and the West in Algeria's internal  affairs or at the sending of inspection committees. They  objected to one word I said here in Algeria's interest.    Binladin made statements to the BBC and nothing happened to  ties. [passage omitted]    We must work to ensure the presence of the WIPC at  international events at the United Nations.    We must make our voice heard to the whole world, and we  must work for, call for, the convening of an urgent Islamic  summit to tackle the Mecca situation and the road to Mecca. It  does not matter that the Libyan people are being besieged,  starved, even fought, and if it dies on its feet, or [this is  happening to] the Iraqi people or any other people, the issue in  question is that of Mecca.    We are not asking our Arab brothers, whether in Egypt,  Sudan,  Saudi Arabia, or Jordan, to stand on our side against America so  that the Libyan assets may be unfrozen, or the air embargo, the  boycott, and the siege lifted. No, not at all. We are not  asking them for this. We want to argue with them about the road  to Mecca and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Mecca itself. The Libyan  people has the right to address itself to the Islamic nation and  show that it has set off on foot and by camel from Libya to  Mecca.    Mecca and the road to Mecca are in an intolerable situation.  They allow camels in but they do not allow [Libyan] airliners  because the resolution [on the embargo] made by America,  Britain, and France does not mention camels and donkeys, and  therefore, Libyan pilgrimages have set off by camel and donkey  because the latter are not mentioned in the resolution. If they  were mentioned in the resolution then the Arabs would have  opposed the passage of donkeys and camels from Libya to Mecca.  I am sure of this. There is on the part of Arab rulers a blind  obedience to America and Britain and disobedience to God. I  wish only part of the rulers' obedience to America was obedience  to Almighty God! They are literally bound by America's orders,  and they are not bound by a single word from the Koran.    To conclude, if we want to undertake an historic deed for  the  Islamic nation in confronting the enemy, we should not begin  with the rifle, the gun, and the bomb as they are now doing in  Egypt and Algeria. This is wrong. No. We must first engage in  a cultural revolution. we must return to our authenticity, our  origin, our roots. So long as they do not recognize Muhammad as  a prophet, then why should we use the calendar based on the  history of Jesus? There is no need for Jesus. This has been  abolished, dropped definitively in Libya [where a calendar based  on the birth and death of the prophet is in use]. If you want a  calendar based on birth, then it is Muhammad's birthday; if you  want a calendar based on death, then it is the passing of  Muhammad. Muhammad is more important than Jesus because he is  the last prophet who, after his birth and death the direct link  between heaven and earth was severed. We have not heard a  single word from heaven since. [passage omitted] May God never  bring about understanding between us, the Christians and the  Jews until doomsday! Why should we come to an understanding?  Who said that we must? Who said this? Barricades separate us  from them until doomsday. This is eternal enmity. God has  decided so. It is they who do not recognize our prophet, our  religion, language, and existence, and it is they who said that  confrontation has ended with communism and that it will begin  with Islam.    They have started this. Why this eagerness to have relations  with them in the West, as if they were a ladder to God? If lack  of relations with the West means no survival for us, then may  God take away our lives; may we die in 24 hours if our life  under the sun and on earth depends on relations with the West.  May we die immediately, rather than have relations with the  West in this shameful manner. [applause] [passage omitted]    God willing, we have set off, step by step on the 1,000 mile  journey toward the objective; unspecified, and the first giant  step is the founding of this WIPC. Our struggle and jihad  continue, and we pray for God's help. Peace and mercy of God be  upon you. [applause]</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taxed one way or another Sir, While I do not seek to justify tax evasion in any form ('The temptations of forbidden fruit', August 26), I am surprised that your contributor did not mention the substantial benefits which accrue to the Revenue from undisclosed earnings. If those involved live up to their supposed means (buying extra bottles of highly taxed whisky, for example), the net loss may be modest. An argument for an increase in excise duties perhaps?

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Participant signatures on the ISS may be requested, but are not required to indicate the joint development of the document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department encourages communication with participants and reminds program operators, especially program monitors and auditors, that the intent of the ISS is to be a program tool and not a compliance document that forms the basis for cost disallowance. The Department does not doubt that participant records, including the ISS, will be reviewed to determine whether SDA's and others have adhered to certain requirements of the Act. This is unavoidable. However, for the ISS to have the anticipated value as a program tool, it must not be developed and used with compliance in mind, but rather with the needs of the customer as its focus. One commenter suggested that if documentation is required,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to document a payment decision, that it be recorded elsewhere in the participant record so that the ISS and compliance documentation can be kept separate. While somewhat artificial, if this concept helps, the Department has no objection to using it. Ultimately, however, the decision on how much detailed information to record on the ISS is one for States and SDA's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule is revised by adding a new paragraph (h) in &sect;628.520 to emphasize that the ISS is a working record of progress and references to ``documentation'' are revised to read ``record.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ISS, to be effective, must be regularly reviewed and adjusted to reflect the progress and to meet the continuing needs of each participant. The ISS will serve as the basis for the entire case management strategy. Case management is an allowable direct training activity and the Department encourages its use as an effective strategy for providing quality services to the participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters indicated confusion over the application of case management to the JTPA program. The Department encourages application of case management principles to participant services. In section 4(32) of the Act, the term case management is defined to mean the provision of a customer-centered approach in the delivery of services, designed to prepare and coordinate comprehensive employment plans to ensure access to the necessary training and supportive services, and to provide job and career counseling during program participation and after job placement. The Department expects SDA's to make every reasonable effort to provide the services and training indicated by the assessment and ISS and, where possible, to apply standard case management principles. The Department recognizes, however, that JTPA is not an entitlement program and that not all services and training will be available regardless of the level of coordination in an area. Case management is an administrative management tool, not an individual service to be delivered to participants. There is no change in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters expressed concern over the ability to provide all services indicated by the objective assessment and the ISS. Section 628.520(e) recognizes that an SDA may not always be able to provide the full array of services indicated by the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS. In arranging for the mix and sequence of appropriate services, it is fully expected that SDA's will refer participants to other programs for certain specified activities as part of the JTPA service strategy. In those cases, particularly in rural areas, where services required are indicated on the ISS and not available from any source in the SDA, such information is to be recorded in the ISS and an alternate plan developed which may include referral to another program. SDA's are expected to make every reasonable effort to make available the recommended training or services to each participant; however, consistent with &sect;628.525, it is understood that the objective assessment and ISS do not give legal or entitlement rights to participants for services. JTPA is not an entitlement program and available resources are limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters thought that language in the preamble to the interim final regulations authorized States and SDA's not to serve the disabled or other hard-to-serve persons, if they needed substantial supportive services. The Department acknowledges that it may have inadvertently suggested that an individual, with excessive supportive service needs, such as a person with a disability, could automatically be referred out of the program to other sources. This is not the case. Such decisions must be made on the basis of the individual's and the program's circumstances. While JTPA is not required to directly serve every person, including every person with a disability, it is intended to focus more on the hard-to-serve. The fact that an individual may be difficult or costly to serve should not, in itself, preclude serving that person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with &sect;628.520(f), service providers and contractors may conduct the objective assessment and develop the ISS. It is the responsibility of the SDA administrative entity to ensure that the objective assessment and the development of the ISS reflect the customer-centered approach required by law are provided to each participant whether they are provided in-house or by service providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to comments on the provisions of &sect;628.510 and &sect;628.530, &sect;628.525 is also revised for further clarity to indicate that neither eligibility nor participation create a right to JTPA services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

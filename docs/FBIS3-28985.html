			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said  in an interview with newsmen that the Lao Government had asked  Thailand for a special reduction on duties collected on imports  from Laos. Laos said it is a poor landlocked country which has  good brotherly relations with Thailand. The tariff reduction  would help promote Laos' exports through Thailand. Suphachai  said the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy  considered that Thailand should comply with Laos' request.  Thailand has already granted special tariff reductions for  several categories of goods from Laos. The committee had put  the Foreign Trade Department of the Commerce Ministry in charge  of negotiations with Laos. Thailand also wants Laos to reduce  transit fees on trucks from Thailand -- now collected at the  rate of 2,000 U.S. dollars, or about 50,000 baht, per trip.    The deputy prime minister reported that at yesterday's  meeting the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy  endorsed the U.S. Government's proposal to set up a joint  advisory committee on economic affairs, with full power in  decision making regarding negotiations on trade and economic  cooperation. Asked about the U.S. Government's decision on  Thailand's status as a country on its Priority Watch List, or  PWL, facing retaliation under the U.S. trade law, the deputy  prime minister said it was very likely that the United States  would remove Thailand from the list, but it is still not known  when. This is because of Thailand's good record in cracking  down on violations of U.S. copyrights, including the pirating of  copyrighted video tapes and discs.</p>

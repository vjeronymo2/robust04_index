			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / US real estate loans and S&amp;L rules eased THE White House yesterday issued new regulations to ease lending conditions for real estate and to let 'well-capitalised' savings and loan institutions open branches in any US state. The Bush administration acted after both Democrats and Republicans in Congress had defied their leaders late on Wednesday by failing to approve Dollars 17bn in funding to liquidate bankrupt savings and loans bodies (known as thrifts) and pay off their depositors. The White House said the country 'can no longer afford to wait for Congress to act' on proposed legislation to allow inter-state branches. It claimed the authority to act unilaterally and said its moves would 'enhance the ability of banks and thrifts to make loans.' Under the new rules, the amount of capital that banks and thrifts must hold 'against conservatively underwritten loans for construction of pre-sold homes' is reduced. Also, the threshold for requiring licensed appraisals on loans secured by real estate is raised from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000. Mr Michael Waldman, director of Mr Ralph Nader's Congress Watch, a citizens' group, said the White House was repeating its tactics of 1988, when it loosened rules and standards for S&amp;Ls: 'The White House is using the regulatory apparatus as an arm of the campaign committee and the result will be huge tax-payer costs. It's a little injection of extra debt and looseness which makes you feel great at first, then there is a huge hangover.' The administration's action contrasted with the paralysis in Congress, where a majority of each party contributed to a 298:125 vote against a White House-backed measure to fund continued S&amp;L rescues with Dollars 17m. Democrats, concerned that the bill did not contain regulatory reforms, joined many Republicans who had argued that many of the thrifts still can be saved. Members of both parties are worried about the S&amp;L issue in the Congressional and presidential election campaigns this year. But they are also fully aware that, the thrift crisis having been ignored four years ago, before the last presidential election, the estimated cost of the rescue ballooned to hundreds of billions of dollars. Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, complained that the White House had made only 'minimal' effort to lobby for its own bill.</p>

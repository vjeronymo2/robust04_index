			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Listeners as well as Radio Free Europe [RFE] editors  themselves were really surprised this morning to find that the  RFE broadcasts to Slovakia had gone silent. It was only after  some time that they found out that the program was not being  broadcast because the transmitters in Velke Kostolany and Poprad  had been switched off.    Slovak Telecommunications issued a statement explaining the  reason for the cutoff. Vladimir Ondrovic, director general of  Slovak Telecommunications, gave more details at a news  conference this afternoon.    [Begin Ondrovic recording] I was invited this Monday, 14  March, to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public  Works, where I was presented with a document that said that  Slovak Telecommunications was suspending transmission of RFE  broadcasts via transmitters in Velke Kostolany and Poprad. The  document was entitled "Cessation of a Contract or Cancellation  of a Contract." This cannot be a cancellation of an agreement  because there is one more transmitter, the one in Presov  transmitting at 14 kilowatts. This transmitter is continuing  transmissions and has not been switched off.    [Vladimir] Zeman, director of [the ministry's  communications]  section, asked me to sign this document and send it to RFE. He  did so verbally, I received no written instruction. Director  Kuban, who is in charge of all transmitters, be they for radio,  TV, or RFE transmissions, was also present. I have to admit  that both of us signed the document at that very moment. Mr.  Zeman then told me that he would consult Minister Hofbauer on 14  March over the matter and that the document would then be  presented to the government, where he would want to have it  approved.    On Monday afternoon at about 1400 GMT, Mr. Zeman came with  other documents or, rather, with the same documents, which had  not been signed but had been printed anew. He wanted us to sign  these documents. I personally told him that I would not sign  this document and that I would not send the fax to RFE. And  that was what happened.    I called the executive [of Slovak Telecommunications] at  1600  GMT. The executive discussed the matter, and we decided that  this would harm Slovakia and that we would not issue an order to  switch off RFE.    Yesterday--that is, on 15 March--I was summoned to the  Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works.  Director Kuban was summoned as well. I was showed a document  on recalling the director of Slovak Telecommunications from his  post. [as heard] Exactly at the same time, Kuban, who is the  director of a branch of the telecommunications directorate, was  shown a letter of appointment authorizing him to direct Slovak  Telecommunications. After having received this document, Mr.  Kuban began to take steps, and, without any instruction to do  so, of his own will, he had the transmission of RFE broadcasts  switched off last night.    I recalled Mr. Kuban from his post as director of a branch  of  the telecommunications directorate at 0720 GMT this morning in  this very room. Subsequently, I issued an instruction to switch  the transmission of RFE broadcasts on again.</p>

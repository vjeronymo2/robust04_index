			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hirohito Watanabe and Koichi Ando, VLSI Device </F> Development Research Laboratories, NEC Corp.]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The development of DRAMs, the leading vehicle of the  semiconductor industry, has become more active, and 64M DRAMs  have already been commercialized. Currently, active R&amp;D is  being  conducted into 256M DRAMs featuring a higher scale of  integration.    Manufacturing such ultra-large-scale integration silicon  devices requires highly reliable manufacturing process  technology with controlled surface, interface, and film quality.  Oxidation, diffusion, and LP-CVD technologies are no exception  and are being subjected to various requirements for improvement.    Figure 1 shows the design rule, junction depth, gate-oxide  film thickness, and capacitance insulation film thickness of  each generation of DRAM. The design rule values of 0.25 m,  junction depth of 0.075 m, and gate insulation film  thickness  of 80 angstroms almost satisfy the actual trend. On the other  hand, the thickness reduction of capacitance insulation film has  been made less demanding by combining it with a  three-dimensional electrode with increased electrode surface  area. It is now possible to use silicon nitride capacitance film  with a film thickness (when converted to oxide film thickness)  of about 40 angstroms as the capacitance insulation film of 256M  DRAMs, provided that the film has a good coating characteristic.  On the other hand, highly dielectric film appears to be a  promising technology for reducing the number of manufacturing  processes, hence its development is presently being studied.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-13A>           Figure 1. Trend of Microminiaturization of DRAMs </FIG>       The necessary conditions for equipment used in manufacturing  256M DRAMs are: First, high-reliability technology compatible  with the fabrication of ultra-large-scale integrated devices  should be established and mass-producible equipment should be  developed to implement them. Second, equipment compatible with  an increased wafer size accompanying the increase in chip size  and cost reduction should be developed. Nevertheless, if the  wafer size increase leads to a rise in equipment cost or a drop  in throughput, the purpose of equipment development itself would  be lost. Third, the equipment cost and failure rate should be  decreased by simplifying the equipment and promoting  standardization. Presently, manufacturing equipment is getting  more complicated by an increased number of components. This is  the result of the implementation of accumulated equipment  experience. But, in the future, it is necessary to promote the  simplification of equipment by identifying the essence of each  process and emphasizing only the required functions. As well as  reducing the number of components, it is also important to  standardize equipment and components. By making such efforts it  will be possible to reduce failure rate and the maintenance time  even when the throughput is increased and clustering, which is  effective in interface and surface control, is used.    There are many problems to be solved in the development of  equipment as seen above, and this report discusses the required  measures to solve them by enumerating some of the concepts and  topics related to the technology for the fabrication of thin  films and shallow junctions required to manufacture 256M DRAMs.  <H5>  Annealing Equipment </H5>   Following the reduction of device size, the formation of  shallow junctions and the reduction of the redistribution of  impurities are required more urgently than before. Presently,  impurities are mainly introduced by ion implantation. However,  because activation processing and damage recovery after ion  implantation require highly accurate control of temperature,  time, and atmosphere, resistance-heating-type electric furnaces  currently used are approaching their technical limits. This is  because the individual wafers have different thermal hysteresis  if they are transported in batches to the electric furnace, and  reduction of thermal hysteresis is difficult.    RTP (rapid thermal processing) is utilized as the technology  for compensating for this limitation of electric furnaces. RTP  provides good throughput because it can activate impurities in a  short period and it causes little diffusion of impurities as  shown in Figure 2.[.sup]1[/] In addition, because of the  advantages in its ability to handle wafers with increased size,  this technology will be indispensable for manufacturing 256M  DRAMs. However, its cold-wall design tends to radiate a great  deal of heat from the wafer edges during heating, and uniformity  in the wafer plane is difficult to achieve, sometimes causing  crystal defects during heating. In addition, while the  temperature is in general controlled by observing the infrared  rays from the back of the wafer using a pyrometer, the infrared  ray emission rate is often variable depending on the condition  of the back of the wafer. Although RTP has already been put to  practical use in some areas, there are many problems yet to be  solved.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-13B>           Figure 2. Results of Experiments and Calculations on Depth </FIG>       RTP equipment has better properties than conventional  electric furnaces as described above but, when considering  throughput and other factors, the electric furnace is still  superior in many processes and it is expected that the use of  electric furnaces will continue in the fabrication of wells. The  batch-type rapid thermal processing furnace which has been  gathering interest[.sup]2[/] has the potential for providing  the advantages of both RTP equipment and batch processing  equipment and could be an effective method for fabricating 256M  DRAMs in the future.  <H5>  LP-CVD Equipment </H5>   Among the LP-CVD technologies to be used with 256M DRAMs,  those which especially need improvements in the process  equipment are the fabrication of ultrathin insulation film with  excellent coating such as capacitance film, and the fabrication  of silicon film used in wiring and electrode manufacture. The  discussion that follows will focus on these technologies.  <H5>  1. Capacitance Insulation Film Fabrication Equipment </H5>   Devices such as 256M DRAMs require thin film with a  thickness  of less than 40 angstroms, which is close to the physical limit,  even if three-dimensional electrodes are combined as was  described earlier. Control of natural-oxide film on the  electrode surfaces is critical for the fabrication of such thin  films.    Natural-oxide film is formed in the cleaning process, during  exposure to the atmosphere between processes, and when the wafer  is put into the nitride film deposition furnace. Active attempts  have been made to reduce natural-oxide film growth during the  furnace input operation through improvements in the equipment  and pre-processing methods.    Development of LP-CVD equipment with a load-lock mechanism  has also been undertaken to prevent atmospheric penetration  during the furnace input operation.[.sup]3[/] This method  replaces the wafer atmosphere in the leak-tight load-lock  chamber with a high vacuum or high-purity inert gas atmosphere  before transporting the wafer into the furnace.    From the viewpoint of process improvement, a method for  reducing the natural-oxide film growth by applying RTN (rapid  thermal nitridation) before input to the LP-CVD furnace has also  been reported.[.sup]4[/]    These measures have been very effective in reducing  natural-oxide film growth in the furnace, but could not remove  natural-oxide film completely. Complete removal requires an  in-situ oxide film-removal process and atmospheric-control  technology with the oxygen partial pressure reduced below  10[.sup]-6[/] Torr.    To make this possible, equipment is being developed which  provides high-vacuum modules and combines several process  modules called cluster tools. Also under development is  equipment performing several processes in a single-process  module.    With the general structure used by cluster tools, the  natural-oxide film is removed in the pre-processing module  installed inside the equipment and the wafers are transported  into the film-fabrication module in a controlled atmosphere for  deposition of the designed film. It has been reported that  batch-type clustered equipment using fluoride vapor etching for  post-processing can fabricate high-quality capacitance film with  a thickness of around 40 angstroms.[.sup]5[/]    Figure 3 shows the process flow when capacitance nitride  film  is fabricated by performing several processes continuously in  the same module.[.sup]6[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-14A>           Figure 3. Flow of Continuous Multiple Processing in a </FIG>       Figure 4 shows the result of oxygen analysis in the  capacitance film and interface in the depth direction (SIMS).  The figure shows that a natural-oxide film layer is observed at  the interface between nitride film and silicon in the case where  a nitride film is fabricated by stand-alone equipment. Further,  the use of continuous, multiple processing using hydrogen baking  in pre-processing allows complete removal of the natural-oxide  film. This has reduced the leakage current of nitride  film-stacked capacitors, and produced a remarkable improvement  in long-term reliability (Figure 5).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-14B>           Figure 4. Oxygen Profile on Nitride Film/Silicon Interface </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-15A>           Figure 5. Long-Term Reliability of Nitride Film-Stacked </FIG>       As described above, continuous, multiple processing in  cluster tools or in a single module is a very effective method  for fabricating high-quality capacitance film, and an  improvement in throughput can also be expected from continuous  processing within the same equipment. Further, development of  mass-production equipment is desirable as soon as possible.  Moreover, since the quality of CVD film varies depending on the  purity of the process gas, it is also important to develop gas  purification technology along with the equipment improvements.    LP-CVD technology using organic source gas for the  deposition  of tantalum-oxide film as a highly dielectric film to replace  capacitance-insulation nitride film is being developed for 256M  DRAMs. The importance of reducing natural-oxide film on the  electrode surface of tantalum-oxide film is similar to the  nitride film described above.[.sup]7[/] With  SrTiO[.sup]3[/] and PZT, which are expected to be used as  highly dielectric materials, techniques for film fabrication  such as the sol-gel, sputtering, and CVD methods are being  studied. Expectations are that development of manufacturing  methods and equipment suitable for mass production will be  available in the near future.  <H5>  2. Silicon Film Fabrication Equipment </H5>   It is expected that the applications of in-situ doped  silicon  films in devices will expand greatly in the mass-production  stage of 256M DRAMs. This expectation is based on the following  points: Since decreasing the temperature is a must in the 256M  DRAM manufacturing process, the previous technology for thermal  diffusion of impurities is of limited use. In addition, it is  difficult for current technology to deal with contact poly-Si  embedding with a large aspect ratio, and the fabrication of  high-quality thin doped silicon film which are required by the  progress of integration. In-situ doped silicon film fabrication  is promising technology for solving this problem but there are  still many technological problems to be overcome for the  present. The most important problem is to develop a film with  excellent coating which can be used for three-dimensional  cylinder capacitor electrodes and microfine contacts. The  problem of increased resistance in doped silicon film when  fabricating it as thin film has also been pointed  out.[.sup]8[/] Furthermore, since the control of  natural-oxide film at the interface is necessary when embedding  a contact in the same way as when fabricating a capacitance  film, cluster tools or multiple processes in the same chamber  will also be required.    Recently, fabrication of a special silicon film containing  hemispherical grains on the surface (HSG-Si: hemispherical  grained Si) has been studied.[.sup]9[/] The HSG-Si film has  about twice the surface area of ordinary silicon film and is  expected to be applied in capacitor electrodes. Figure 6 [photo  not reproduced] shows an example of the use of HSG-Si as an  electrode.    To form these hemispherical grains, a clean surface should  be  maintained so that silicon atoms can migrate freely on the  amorphous silicon-film surface. If a natural-oxide film layer is  formed on the amorphous silicon-film surface, the migration of  silicon atoms would be reduced and HSG-Si would not be formed.  Therefore, equipment with low-oxygen partial pressure is also  required to prevent natural-oxide film in HSG-Si fabrication.  <H5>  Oxidation Technology </H5>   It is theorized that 256M DRAMs may use gate-oxide films  with  a thickness of around 80 angstroms. Film thickness at this level  is already being developed for use in the gate-oxide films of  CMOS and the practical level has already been reached. However,  it is still undoubtedly important to advance the improvement of  gate-oxide film quality in the future. Consequently, the  following discussion deals with the oxidation technology  required to promote film quality improvement.    At present, reduction of the interface level, development of  oxide film containing nitrogen, reduction of particles, and  reduction of metal contamination are being attempted to improve  oxide film quality. For these technical subjects, it is  necessary to study them from the process side, including  cleaning, as well as from the equipment side.    Problems related to the atmosphere when wafers are input to  the oxidation furnace have been dealt with often in recent  years. Figure 7 shows the difference in oxide-film reliabilities  when the oxygen concentration in the nitrogen gas in the furnace  is varied.[.sup]10[/] As shown in the figure, the oxide-film  quality and reliability vary extensively depending on the oxygen  concentration in the furnace.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-16A>           Figure 7. In-Furnace Atmospheric Dependence of Gate-Oxide </FIG>       On the other hand, it has also been reported that, if a  wafer  with its Si surface exposed experiences a temperature rise or  furnace input operation in high-purity nitrogen gas or inert  gas, the irregularities on the silicon surface increase and  cause deterioration of the electric properties.[.sup]11[/]  Such a problem will not occur if a thin-oxide film is formed by  irradiating the silicon surface with UV-O[.sup]3[/] before  the wafer is input to the furnace.[.sup]11[/] This indicates  that the thin-oxide film protects the surface layer.    As described above, the electrical properties of oxide film  are largely variable depending on furnace input conditions. If  core tube-type equipment is used in the mass production of 256M  DRAMs, it would be advantageous to solve the problems in furnace  input without making the equipment more complicated.    It is highly probable that RTP equipment will be applied in  the fabrication of gate-oxide film. This is because its cold  wall-type structure is expected to be capable of solving the  above problems and that problems in throughput may not occur  thanks to the gate-oxide film becoming thinner. RTP may also be  effective for use in nitrogen-oxide film fabrication because the  process gas and temperature can be switched instantaneously.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   In the above, the process technologies required for  oxidation, diffusion, and LP-CVD equipment in the 256M DRAM  generation, and the problems in the equipment have been  described. The process technologies for this generation feature  the following five points: 1) interface and surface control; 2)  continuous processing; 3) lower temperatures; 4) cleaning  technology; and 5) complete control of process parameters. To  improve the accuracy of such process technologies, it is  important to improve control technology based on the  understanding of natural phenomena in the manufacturing  equipment. Presently, improvement of process accuracy is being  attempted by clustering the manufacturing equipment, as this can  remove unstable factors originating from outside the equipment.  Clustering of equipment is also expected to improve the  throughput due to the omission of processes such as cleaning.  Conversely, a major source of worry in clustering is a possible  increase in equipment failures due to increased complexity. The  need here is evident: simplify or standardize the equipment.    In this generation, the selection between batch equipment  using core tubes and wafer-level equipment using lamps may be  important. Selection according to the processes used may be  required. Regardless of the selection, all types of equipment  are required to provide low price and high throughput,  compatibility with large diameter wafers, and highly accurate  control of the atmosphere inside each module.

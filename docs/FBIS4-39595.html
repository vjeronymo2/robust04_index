			<p>BFN     [Text] To begin our news bulletin, we have a report by our  parliamentary correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov.    [Zherebenkov] The State Duma has passed at a second reading  the draft law on the federal budget for the current year,  submitted by the government, with account taken of amendments  added by the Duma's budget committee and the creation of special  extrabudgetary funds for defense. The draft law was passed by a  very narrow margin. A number of factions, including Russia's  Choice and Yabloko, abstained from the vote. This is how  Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar explained his faction's  position.    [Begin Gaydar recording] Russia's Choice believes that many  of the budget committee's amendments make sense. Happily they  included a number of Russia's Choice amendments. At the same  time, the version submitted still contains a number of items  that we find categorically unacceptable.    We draw attention to the very idea of creating an  extrabudgetary fund to finance defense at the expense of  privatization, which is obviously a fraud, because any person  with common sense knows very well that Russia will not be able  to obtain this money earmarked for defense out of privatization  in 1994.    We are categorically opposed to the fact that a system of  transfers that continues to subsidize the south at the expense  of the north has been retained in the budget. We believe that  the agreement on managerial expenditure was inadequate. We draw  attention to the fact that our amendments to cut outlay on  agriculture, in particular on subsidies and central investments  and to redistribute expenditure on the needs of education,  science, and culture were not accepted.    That is why the faction decided to abstain. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Price-based tax aims to end market distortion - Company Cars This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. TAXING company cars on the basis of their list price would provide a 'fairer measure of the benefit people receive, eliminate a cause of distortions in the new car market, and reduce incentives to drive less fuel-efficient cars,' the Treasury said yesterday. It said that company car drivers with relatively cheap cars will be better off compared with the present system; those with relatively expensive cars for the band will have a higher tax charge; and those with cars around the average price for the band will remain in much the same position. The Treasury said: 'The new system will also deal more neutrally with diesel cars which often have larger engines than the equivalent petrol car. 'The present broad-scale charges will be replaced by a new measure of the benefit of a car for private use: the full cost of the car - 35 per cent of the list price of the car from April 6 1994; with a discount of one-third if the employee drives more than 2,500 business miles in a year, or two-thirds if the employee drives 18,000 or more business miles; all reduced by a third for cars four or more years old at the end of the tax year. 'The effect is that on average the charge will be the same as under the present system, but some individuals will pay more and others less. 'The chancellor announced in his Budget in 1992 his intention to introduce price-based measures of the value of company cars. These proposals take account of views expressed in response to the Inland Revenue's consultative document issued in July 1992 on the details and timing of the change. The chancellor proposes to base the new tax charge on the full cost of a car for a year. Full cost includes not only running costs but also large fixed costs (such as depreciation and financing costs). The measure of full costs for the income tax charge will be 35 per cent of the price of the car. Free fuel for private use will continue to be taxed separately. 'The price of the car will be defined to be its list price at the time it was first registered, plus the price of 'extras' provided with the car. The consultative document discussed the operational attractions of some form of banding of cars by price. After taking into account the views expressed during the consultative exercise the new system now proposed will not be banded. Each company car will be dealt with on the basis of its price. 'There will be special rules to arrive at a price for a car if, exceptionally, no list price is published. In addition cars over 15 years old, with an open market value of more than Pounds 15,000, will be taxed by reference to their value if that is higher than their list price. 'The value of the benefit will be reduced to take account of the business use. The full cost will be reduced by: one third for 2,500 to 17,999 business miles a year; two-thirds for 18,000 or more business miles a year. 'This reproduces the present broad apportionment of the costs of a car between employer and employee which the government indicated last year it had no plans to change. 'There will also continue to be a further reduction of one third for cars that are four or more years old at the end of the tax year. Second cars will also be taxed on their full cost. As at present, there will be no reduction for business use unless the second car is used for more than 18,000 business miles a year. The full cost will then be reduced by a third. 'Payments by employees for the private use of the car will continue to reduce pound for pound the value of the benefit. 'The new system will start on April 6 1994. It will apply in 1994-95 and subsequent years to all company cars. This timetable will allow the Inland Revenue to seek, during 1993, details from employers of the prices of the cars they make available to their employees. The new charges will then be taken into account at the end of 1993 when setting employees' PAYE codes for 1994-95. 'Neither employees nor employers need contact their tax office about these changes. The Inland Revenue will get in touch with employers to seek information about the list prices of their company cars. 'The consultative document proposed new arrangements for employers to notify the tax office at the end of each month of details of cars newly provided to employees. It is now proposed that employers should be required to give tax offices this information only quarterly. This will meet their requests for less onerous arrangements while still allowing the Inland Revenue to adjust employees' PAYE codes, and so avoid large underpayments of tax. 'The Inland Revenue will also, with ministers' approval, continue discussions with employers and other interested parties about the collection of tax on company cars and possible further ways to simplify administration.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    CAR FUEL SCALE CHARGES FOR 1993-94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PETROL - New scale charges  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Engine size cc              Pounds             0-1400                    600          1401-2000                    760              2001+                  1,130  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Increased weekly tax (basic rate taxpayer  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Engine           High business         Average or               size                mileage          low business  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              0-1400                 1.68               0.48           1401-2000                 2.14               0.63               2001+                 3.17               0.91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- DIESEL - New scale charges  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Engine size cc               Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      0-2000                     550                       2001+                     710  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Increased weekly tax (basic rate taxpayer)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Engine           High business         Average or               size                mileage          low business                cc                 Pounds              Pounds              0-2000                1.54                0.43               2001+                2.00                0.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

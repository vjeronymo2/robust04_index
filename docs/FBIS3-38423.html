			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial signed "Evvoulos": "What We Expect From Mr. </F> Lamb"]    [Excerpts] The arrival of the State Department's special  Cyprus coordinator is expected to dispel the clouds of confusion  caused by the two letters of Rauf Denktas. This is because Mr.  Robert Lamb, who earlier served as U.S. ambassador in Nicosia,  is very well aware of the Cyprus issue and because he himself  had declared unequivocally that the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] "must be accepted as they are because they are fair."  The same declaration was also made by President Clinton, thus  emphasizing the U.S. stand in the most official manner.    President Glavkos Kliridhis demanded the rejection of  Denktas' first letter, which contained obviously and even  presumptively unacceptable terms. He also demanded that  Denktas' second letter not be accepted; it bears the letterhead  of the pseudostate and Denktas' signature in his illegal  capacity as its "president." Kliridhis' demands are in full  harmony with the U.S. stand, as well as with the UN secretary  general's recommendations that neither side benefits at the  other's expense from the implementation of the measures.    Security Council Resolution 541 does not recognize the  pseudostate and calls upon all states not to recognize it.  Thus, the attempt through Denktas' letters to receive a direct  or indirect recognition proves that the measures are not  accepted by the occupation leader as they are, except on the  condition that the illegal invasion is legalized first. In  other words, the key phrase "as they are" is provocatively and  contemptuously trampled underfoot by Denktas.    This is why we attach great importance to the role and  mission of Mr. Lamb because, as the representative of the sole  superpower, it is expected that for reasons of prestige,  consistency, and political order he will honor his declaration.    Besides, our side is expected to pay most of the economic  cost for the implementation of the CBM's. However, for the  "building" of the measures to be safe they cannot be founded on  the shifting sands that are created by Denktas' retrogressions  and demands for the consolidation and legalization of the  occupation regime. [passage omitted]    In the meantime, we expect the U.S. envoy's prestige and  influence will prove to be the determining catalysts and put an  end to the unreasonable Turkish demands and distortions of the  basis for a substantive dialogue. Mr. Lamb can and should make  the truth shine and dispel the clouds of confusion.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record copper demand forecast COPPER CONSUMPTION is likely to rise by 4.5 per cent next year to reach a record 9.35m tonnes, according to the Metal Bulletin Research consultancy organisation. This should support a sharp increase in the average copper price from about Dollars 1.03 a lb this year to Dollars 1.20 and 'set the scene for a major bull market in the middle of the decade'. In a special report, analysts Mr Neil Buxton and Ms Rosalind Stewart suggest that copper supply will not be able to keep pace with demand next year. Stocks should therefore fall by about 200,000 tonnes to 700,000 tonnes, representing only four weeks of average consumption - the same level as during the 1987-89 bull market for copper. They say that beyond 1993 mine capacity should meet the likely need for copper concentrate (an intermediate material) in the mid-1990s. But there is concern about the level of smelting capacity. The only new copper smelter likely to be in production in the next two years is the 100,000 tonnes-a-year Luilu refinery in Zaire, scheduled to open in July this year.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F> Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given: "Who Is Worried About Macedonia?"]    [Text] In the memoirs of those who, several years ago,  negotiated on behalf of Europe about the future of the former  Yugoslavia, one can perceive that a general conviction was that  Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov was the only reasonable and  tolerant negotiator of all the former Yugoslav leaders.    Because of the stubborn resolve that Macedonia ought to  observe the interests of other countries as well, Gligorov has  often been accused by certain circles in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] of subservience and of  having an insufficiently patriotic policy. His Balkan neighbors  also dislike many things about him. Several days ago Athens  officially accused him of living outside reality, other  neighbors claim that nothing has been definite and certain about  Macedonia, certain areas of Macedonian territory are being more  or less openly claimed, whereas certain scientific symposiums  are being announced at which the Macedonian issue is supposed to  be definitely solved.    Quite logically, our conversation started with President  Gligorov commenting on U.S. recognition of Macedonia.    [Gligorov] This recognition is undoubtedly very important  for us, because the United States is the only superpower in the  world today, and the dominant member of the UN Security Council  and other international organizations -- both civil and  military. Until now, all recognitions by the European Union,  the United Nations, and China were subject to speculation that  they carry no real weight until the United States recognizes  Macedonia, that is, that the events in the Balkans might  possibly evolve in a different direction. This recognition is a  precondition for us to take part in all future negotiations as a  subject, given the international recognition of the Macedonian  entity. You will understand what this means if you look back in  history, starting from the Balkan wars to the two world wars,  and see that in all those events the Macedonians were too  impotent to influence negotiations about the status of  Macedonia. Now that practice of others making decisions about  our destiny has ceased.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that what follows is only a  technical part of the recognition of the new position of  Macedonia?    [Gligorov] Now, the admission of Macedonia into the CSCE is  a very important step. There are no obstacles to this in terms  of our meeting the conditions for membership. All the reports  by the relevant bodies, including the CSCE itself, are quite  positive that Macedonia fulfills all the conditions, and that it  should be admitted as a full member. Albania opposed the  proposal for a while, but now it is only Greece that opposes it.  The essential meaning of admission into the CSCE is entry into  the system of collective security, whose character is  predominantly political. CSCE membership would create the  possibility for us to join the the "Partnership for Peace"  project.    [Correspondent] What does the presence of foreign troops in  Macedonia mean, not only for Macedonia, but also for the entire  region? For instance, Milovan Djilas [Serbian dissident]  recently said in an interview that Macedonia has remained  Macedonian thanks solely to the arrival of foreign troops.    [Gligorov] The history of this issue is as follows: First,  the arrival of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force]in  Macedonia was a result of our own initiative. We considered  that it would be good, with regard to the entire situation in  the southern Balkans, if preventive, rather than classical,  peacekeeping forces were deployed in Macedonia. Until they came  to Macedonia, peacekeeping troops had never prevented armed  clashes, or contributed to the prevention of such clashes.  Moreover, until then, the United States had not taken part in  such actions at all. The UN secretary general became interested  in that idea, and later on deployed a small contingent of 1,000  soldiers, without U.S. troops. Troops from the Scandinavian  countries came first, which we welcomed as a good choice. U.S.  troops were only deployed later, which means that their presence  here is not an arbitrary act on the part of the U.S. Government,  but rather the result of the mandate that was given to them by  the United Nations. Still, I have to repeat, the novelty is  only that, until now, the United States has never taken part in  peacekeeping actions in the region, nor put their troops under  another command, as in the Macedonian case. In the U.S. Congress  the issue was seriously discussed and there were many arguments,  but eventually it was agreed that 300 soldiers in Macedonia  should be put under the command of the officers appointed by the  United Nations, serving within UNPROFOR.    [Gligorov] I am saying all this just because there are  frequent remarks and claims that the U.S. forces in Macedonia  are quite independent and have been deployed in compliance with  a special agreement. The deeper and more profound reason for  their presence here, even if it involves only a symbolic 300  troops, is undoubtedly an expression of the U.S. desire to  prevent the spreading of the Balkan conflict further south.  From their point of view, the involvement of Macedonia in the  conflict would mean a war on the borders of a NATO member  country, namely Greece.    That would entail the danger of involving all Macedonia's  neighbors in the conflict, that is, other NATO member countries.  That would have far-reaching consequences for the United States,  even for its strategic interests. It would be far more  dangerous than the war in Bosnia, which is still a confined war,  although it has shaken Europe and influenced many events in the  world. At least for the time being, provided that the war does  not spread south, the war in Bosnia has not yet brought about  the consequences that a conflict on the southern wing of the  NATO Alliance might cause.    The second reason for such a dedicated U.S. engagement lies,  I think, in the fact that Macedonia shows by its own example  that it is possible to solve inter-ethnic problems without arms.  I am not idealizing anything, but we are living proof that  inter-ethnic tolerance and cooperation is possible. To cut a  long story short, I think that, although the number of troops  stationed here is relatively small, their presence carries a  clear message to anybody that it may concern should the conflict  spread to Macedonia. It is much more a political than a  military warning.    [Correspondent] At the beginning, the demilitarization of  Macedonia was quite frequently considered. Why was it abandoned?    [Gligorov] Yes, this idea was present, but in the meantime  we had to do what is necessary, that is, to place our army on  the borders. After that, it was logical that we demanded  assistance from the international community, particularly since  at the time Macedonia was not internationally recognized to the  extent that it is now.    [Correspondent] International observers have been deployed  along Macedonia's northern and western borders. Recently you  have stated that one should base one's judgment about Belgrade's  intentions toward Macedonia on whether Macedonia is recognized  or not. In that context, how do you view various scenarios for  the future of Macedonia?    [Gligorov] The fact is that war is being waged to the north  of Macedonia, and that the danger of it spreading exists. There  is also the problem of Kosovo. Still, regardless of all that, I  do not think that Macedonia is directly endangered by Serbia.  However, as long as the war goes on, and as long as the problem  of Kosovo is unsettled, potential danger will always exist.    Precisely because of all this, I am convinced that such  dangers would be diminished, or removed, by the mutual  recognition of the FRY and Macedonia.    [Correspondent] Has there been any initiative in that  respect on your part?    [Gligorov] I encouraged that idea in an interview, and I  particularly discussed it with President Milosevic during our  meeting in Ohrid last year. I pointed out that mutual  recognition is necessary for many reasons, and since there is no  conflict between Macedonia and Serbia or any territorial claims  on either side -- at least none has ever been officially stated  -- there are no major obstacles for our two countries to  recognize each other, while it is a completely different matter  what ideas and forces exist. Finally, the fact is that the  former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] agreed to withdraw, and  there were no incidents while it was withdrawing.    In view of all this, and in view of the general mood in  Macedonia, and I believe in Serbia as well, I think that mutual  recognition would be welcomed. I underlined even earlier that  two things are very important for relations between Macedonia  and Serbia: Serbia's recognition of Macedonia and the  Macedonian people in 1944, and the agreed withdrawal of the JNA  from Macedonia. Both imply mutual recognition as a logical  consequence, and the beginning of the development of mutual  relations in all fields. On the other hand, I think that  recognizing Macedonia would be very advantageous for the FRY,  because it would eliminate any suspicion that the conflict might  spread to the south, that is, that the FRY has some hidden  interests, which are now mentioned only in certain speculation  about the future course of events in the Balkans. Then the  problem of Kosovo would show itself in a completely different  light, as a problem that is an affair of the FRY in the first  place. Because, as long as there are fears that the war might  spread to the south, speculations about some pan-Albanian  settlement for the region will exist. In fact, that settlement  sustains the forces in other former Yugoslav republics that  support the establishment of greater nation states. In that  respect, Macedonia has been an exception, because since the very  beginning we have publicly maintained that the Macedonian state  is possible only within its current borders. Everything else is  an adventure and a disaster.    [Correspondent] The reaction of Greek Prime Minister  Papandreou to the news of U.S. recognition of Macedonia was to  accuse you of living out of reality, or rather, of being unable  to comprehend all the possible consequences. How do you see  your future relations with Greece?    [Gligorov] I view them only in terms of negotiations,  regardless of whether those negotiations deal with our relations  in general, or with what has been happening these days, while it  is precisely such daily platforms that we have been witnessing  that reveal where a different attitude on our part would lead.  We have plenty of good will, we are ready to discuss any  subject, and I think that the initial mistake was made precisely  because we failed to follow this course. Our attitude will  prove that many things that appear to be complex are, in fact,  easy to solve. For instance, it is ridiculous to maintain that  Macedonia has any pretensions to any Greek territory. The  Greeks are constantly demanding guarantees from us on the  unchangeability of the borders, while we are constantly  repeating, parrot fashion, to them that the borders are  definite. We have proposed a bilateral agreement on this, and  if necessary we are even ready to sign it at any time, even with  guarantees by the European Community [EC], or the United Nations.    The Greek path to Europe leads through Macedonia, while our  path to the rest of the world leads through Greece, not to  mention other mutual interests. Why should we disregard our  mutual interests, and keep up the current conflicts that are in  many ways imaginary, emotional, and encumbered with certain  interpretations of the historical heritage on both sides?    In our approach I see the reality of Macedonian policy.  Besides, I think that the character of that policy can also be  seen in the fact that the Macedonian people have never  instigated hatred toward any people. Since the very beginning  we have emphasized that we want good relations with all our  neighbors, and also an improvement rather than a breakup of  those relations in all fields. As for Greece, just remember  that it is not the Macedonians who introduced the embargo or  closed the borders.    [Correspondent] Macedonia was an underdeveloped country, the  least viable of all the former Yugoslav republics, but still you  have paid off all your debts to the international creditors,  which has opened the door to your full membership of the IMF and  to new loans. What is the current policy here, and what is the  strategic policy of Macedonia?    [Gligorov] I am convinced that Macedonia must base its  position on a final orientation to the market economy. All  small countries, of which we are one, as well as all the Balkan  states, must opt for open national economies if they want to  prosper.    It is difficult to stick to that course without foreign  financial aid, and therefore all our forces have been  concentrated on how to eliminate the obstacles that had resulted  from the unsettled international status of Macedonia. We  managed to bring missions from international financial  institutions to Macedonia even before we settled our status in  those institutions. Thanks to this, a whole series of  preparatory measures were completed, while certain projects were  not taken into full consideration for formal reasons. Finally,  we were not able to pay off the debts that we inherited from  former Yugoslavia, as the regular method of indemnification  would have delayed some other economic steps that we were  planning, so we asked the creditors for understanding, and we  did meet with understanding in terms of how to pay off our $100  million debt: The governments of certain countries first helped  us, then the International Development Agency helped us with a  loan under very favorable conditions, while the remaining $25  million was indemnified by the Soros Foundation, which also gave  us a short-term loan under favorable conditions.    [Correspondent] We presume that you held the same attitude  even at the time of the talks between the six presidents of the  republics of former Yugoslavia. What was the reason for your  failure to bring the other participants to their senses?    [Gligorov] That depended also on the will of all the  participants, and no solution could possibly have been imposed.  I think that a very important opportunity was missed at that  time, one that some people underestimated, while others saw it  as a trap. I am referring to the offer by the EC that  Yugoslavia would be admitted to the EC as an associate member,  if a peaceful solution to the crisis was found. The offer also  anticipated $4.5 billion for a positive answer. However, there  was either no readiness to accept the offer, or there was a lack  of trust in it, or the choice had already been made in favor of  the solutions that later brought about clashes. I still believe  that a great opportunity was missed, one that would have enabled  all of us to avoid everything that followed thereafter in the  region.    [Correspondent] A Russian political delegation and a U.S.  military delegation were in Skopje yesterday. Do you feel that  you have been under pressure by both sides?    [Gligorov] Neither of those visits was intended to exert  pressure on me. We talked with President Yeltsin's envoy  Churkin primarily about future diplomatic and other relations,  and particularly about economic cooperation between our two  countries, something in which we are very interested. Second,  Moscow is very much involved in finding a solution to the  Bosnian crisis, and that was an opportunity to brief us on  everything that has to do with the direct Russian involvement.  We also wanted to learn more about some broader elements of  Russian policy, its main principles, and what we can expect from  it. Which is to say, it was a meeting of the representatives of  two friendly countries, and it was a good opportunity for both  delegations to become better informed and to make agreements on  more dynamic cooperation, particularly in the field of economics.    The arrival of the U.S. Army delegation had to do primarily  with a visit to the U.S. contingent. There were absolutely no  pressures or demands to increase the number of their soldiers  here, which is the subject of a lot of public speculation. It  is always forgotten that the U.S. troops are part of UNPROFOR,  while neither earlier nor now have there been bilateral demands  that their troops be stationed in Macedonia. The story about  Macedonia being a U.S. aircraft carrier on the ground is not  realistic for serious reasons and also for banal ones, since our  airport is hardly able to respond to the needs of civilian air  traffic. Still, in view of the times that we are living in, I  can understand all sorts of exaggerations and combinations,  although they have nothing to do with reality; I understand all  those who are constantly discovering what lies behind this or  that.    [Correspondent] The reason for such calculations is that the  retailoring of the political map of the Balkans is in progress.    [Gligorov] Macedonia has undoubtedly chosen the European  option, but at the same time the presence of Russia is quite  legitimate in the region. That is the reality, but in my  opinion, the reality is also the ever greater interest of Russia  in cooperation with Europe, the United States, and the entire  world. There is no reason for such a partnership not to be  present in the Balkans. There is no justification for sticking  to the old formula that it is either Russia or the United States  that dominates the region. All countries are interested in  their own presence in the Balkans, and you can see that Japan is  also setting its foot here -- not only because it wants to  confirm its economic power in global diplomacy as well, but also  because there are increasingly fewer regions in the world that  are attractive for international capital. In that respect the  Balkans is attractive for anybody. I think that the time of  looking at the Balkans through the prism of the Cold War and the  division of the world into two superpowers is definitely over.  Obviously, this is not particularly clear to everybody these  days, but the sooner one understands that, the fewer traumas  there will be and the more easily eliminated.  <H5>  [Box, page 12] </H5>   [Correspondent] Because of the war and the international  blockade of the FRY, the traffic on Morava and Vardar Rivers has  almost died out. In the meantime, you have taken part in the  opening of the road and railroad link Sofia-Skopje-Tirana-Drac.  How far has the project gone, and what impact will it have on  the old route?    [Gligorov] This West-East route neither replaces nor is  supposed to diminish the importance of the old North-South  route. For Macedonia and Greece that is the shortest way to  Europe, as well as for Serbia to the south, and its value will  be fully restored when the war ends. Still, why should we not  make such a East-West link? Albania was isolated for a long  time, whereas connections with Albania are an objective economic  necessity for Macedonia. The current connections are almost  vitally important. In addition, the exchange and communications  with Bulgaria were quite limited. Macedonia is situated in the  middle of the southern Balkans, has no direct access to the sea,  while those two routes intersect in Macedonia. Hence the chance  for a more rapid development of Macedonia. You see that the  international community, in particular the European Union, is  interested in developing the possibilities of those two  connections.  <H5>  [Box, page 13] </H5>   [Correspondent] The fears that the deadline given to the  Bosnian Serbs by NATO might entangle Macedonia in some troubles  are quite widespread. What do you think?    [Gligorov] These are certainly overreactions, but I think  that the rapid deterioration of the conflict has raised the  temperature not only in Macedonia, but also throughout the  Balkans. Just look at the reactions from Albania, Bulgaria, and  other countries. One has to take these into consideration, but  let us hope that in the meantime reason will prevail, and that  the negotiations on heavy weapons will start.</p>

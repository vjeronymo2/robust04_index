			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Japan sees end to growth in trade surplus Growth in Japan's politically controversial current account surplus is near an end, the finance ministry said yesterday. Annual growth in the surplus slowed to 1.4 per cent in October to Dollars 11.25bn, after a 10.2 per cent rise the previous month, the ministry announced. That represented a 6.9 per cent decline from September's Dollars 13.3bn surplus. Exports were stagnant or slightly down - depending on the sector - while imports rose. 'It appears that the yen-based surplus is now in a shrinking trend and the dollar-based surplus is likely to hit a ceiling,' said an official. Overall, exports rose slightly from Dollars 30.1bn from October 1992 to Dollars 30.32bn in the same month this year, while imports increased more strongly from Dollars 17.16bn to Dollars 17.89bn. This could help to reduce the yen's value, given the depth of Japan's recession, so easing the pressure on the country's exporters, said economists. That would be welcome news for prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa as his government works overtime to put together another economic stimulus package. Coalition members are aiming to finalise details of such a package by early next week. However, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, yesterday cast uncertainty over the timing by saying that the government must first pass a supplementary budget, to fund the previous package. A senior official of the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday admitted that the economy could shrink this year. Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, the agency's vice minister, expected something between a slight decline and 1 per cent growth in gross national product.</p>

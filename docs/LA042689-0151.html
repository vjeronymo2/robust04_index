			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SHARES IN ANCIENT MAP TO BE SOLD  </P> <P> Investors are lining up to become shareholders in the Mappa Mundi in a plan to  keep the 13th-Century map of the world at Hereford Cathedral, organizers said  today.  </P> <P> A new company called Mappa Mundi PLC is offering the public 7,450 shares at  about $1,700 each to raise more than $12 million to keep the map at Hereford  and pay for repairs to its cathedral.  </P> <P> Hereford Cathedral caused a national uproar when it announced last year that it  would auction off its medieval treasure, possibly to foreign buyers, to pay for  the much-needed repairs.  </P> <P> It had hoped to raise $4.3 million by selling the 708-year-old map, which shows  Jerusalem at the center of the world and Hereford at the edge.  </P> <P> The Church of England subsequently joined forces with financiers to launch the  unusual privatization.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / West Europe car sales plummet NEW CAR sales in western Europe plunged by 1.3m to 6.091m in the first half of the year - a fall of 17.2 per cent. Demand declined steeply in all the main markets except Britain's. . Sales last month fell by an estimated 16.4 per cent to 950,000, the sixth steep monthly fall in succession. The situation was worst in Italy, where year-on-year registrations dropped by 29.5 per cent. Overall sales last month were lower than a year ago in 14 of 17 European markets. There were marginal rises in Denmark and Portugal, and stronger growth in Britain, where sales rose by 11.1 per cent. The UK, recovering from recession, has seen sales increase year-on-year in 12 of the past 15 months. West Europe has suffered its steepest six-monthly fall in new car sales for more than a decade, with first-half demand lower in 15 of 17 markets. The decline was led by a 19.9 per cent fall in Germany, Europe's biggest single market. Sales fell to an estimated 1.75m from 2.19m in the same period last year. First half sales in Spain were down by 29.3 per cent, in Italy by 22.5 per cent, and in France by 17.9 per cent. Only Britain made a significant gain - of 9.1 per cent, albeit from a depressed level. Volkswagen, Fiat and Ford suffered steep falls. The Fiat group, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, lost most ground in the first six months. Sales plunged by an estimated 22.1 per cent compared with the 17.2 per cent drop in the overall west European market. General Motors, which includes Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, gained market share helped by the successful launch earlier this year of its Corsa small car range. Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the only significant carmaker in Europe to have lifted sales despite the decline in the overall market. Volume rose by 10.5 per cent, increasing Rover's share to 2.8 per cent from 2.1 per cent in the same period a year ago. Japanese carmakers have increased their share significantly from 11.6 per cent to 12.5 per cent, heightening tensions between the European Community and Tokyo over the level of Japanese car exports to the EC. Nissan, Toyota and Suzuki have performed strongly this year helped by local production in Britain and Spain, which has enabled them to penetrate protected markets in southern Europe.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS January-June 1993                              Volume     Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                             (Units)   Change (%)  Jan-Jun 93  Jan-Jun 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET              6,091,000     -17.2       100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.        1,034,000     -20.7        17.0        17.7 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors              782,000     -14.4        12.8        12.4 (Opel/Vauxhall, US? &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall             750,000     -14.0        12.3        11.9  -Saab**                     21,000     -28.8         0.3         0.4 Peugeot (incl.              724,000     -17.2        11.9        11.9 Citroen) Fiat (incl.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Greenpeace, the  international organisation of environmental movement, urged the  puppet authorities of South Korea to stop the construction  project of the atomic power station now underway, according to a  radio report from Seoul.    Some 20 members of the organisation raised this demand at an  anti-nuke rally they held in Samchok on April 14 with about  1,000 members of environmental protection and anti-nuke  organisations of South Korea.    Sounding a warning against the danger of radioactive leakage  from the South Korean atomic power station, Greenpeace is  strongly demanding a stop to its construction project, said the  radio.</p>

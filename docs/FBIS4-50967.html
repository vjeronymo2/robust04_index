			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Yun (7115 5366)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Under the State  Council's arrangements, the State Economic and Trade Commission,  the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank  of China, and other relevant departments have conducted a study  on solving the problem of circulating fund shortages resulting  from defaults of goods payments and came up with a decision to  launch a clearance exercise among major industries and trades in  the northeast to gain experience needed for a nationwide  campaign.    Speaking at a work meeting on straightening out the problem  of circulating fund shortages among major industries and trades  in the northeastern region here today, Yang Changji, vice  minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission,  said: Leading comrades in both the party's Central Committee  and the State Council have been constantly attaching importance  to reform and development of state-owned enterprises. For  years, although conditions of state-owned enterprises have  improved following the introduction of various state policies  and measures, certain problems remained. Currently, due to the  problems of circulating fund shortages, sluggish products sales,  and overstocks experienced by some state-owned industrial  enterprises, defaults of goods payments among enterprises have  become relatively serious.    Yang Changji said: The causes leading to the current mutual  indebtedness among enterprises have both similarities to and  differences from those of the past. The similarities involve  investments in fixed assets, fund shortages, behind-schedule  funding, and unsuccessful local fund-raising, while one  difference is that more and more funds have been diverted to  enterprises in producing finished products this year. Wanton  price revision by some enterprises and overall rises in  production costs are new causes.    He said: The general principle for solving the problem of  mutual indebtedness among enterprises should be strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control, deepening reform, and  taking measures aimed at effecting a permanent solution to the  problem, under which enterprises themselves will be playing a  leading role in seeing that no new debts will be incurred while  exercising stricter control over fixed asset investment,  restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales.  In the meantime, we need prompt actions that may bring quick  results, including using the smallest possible amount of credit  loans to improve cash flow, solving the problem of circulating  fund shortages among major industries and trades, and  guaranteeing the normal production of state-owned enterprises as  well as social stability.    It has been learned that major industries selected for  solving the problems of circulating fund shortages are coal,  metallurgy, nonferrous metals, electric power, chemical  engineering, and forestry. Since March, the State Economic and  Trade Commission, the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of China, and the Coal Industry Ministry have  managed to help the metallurgical, electric power, and chemical  engineering industries settle goods payments due to 20 provinces  and municipalities and 75 major coal mines. The estimated  clearance of over 4 billion yuan will help alleviate the coal  industry's fund shortage problem to a certain degree.  Currently, thorough investigations into the problem of  circulating funds shortages in the five industries of  metallurgy, electric power, nonferrous metals, chemical  engineering, and forestry in the northeastern region have  completed.    Yang Changji emphasized: In settling the goods payments of  enterprises among each other, we should lend support to  enterprises whose products are in demand and marketable and  refrain from injecting funds into enterprises with slow product  sales and overstocks. In the meantime, strict checks should be  conducted to ensure that no circulating funds will go to fixed  assets, that all loss-making activities caused by fixed assets  investment will be stopped from top to bottom, and that funds  designated for settling debts will not be diverted to  engineering works and equipment under both infrastructure  construction and technical transformation programs. We should  intensify efforts to prevent new debts and, in particular,  enforce strict settlements when dealing with some enterprises  which simply refuse to pay without reason. Practices of  unreasonably holding or returning bills or refusing to pay  without grounds should be rectified conscientiously.    Addressing the meeting, Zhang Xiao, president of the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, disclosed: In a bid to  ease the conditions of enterprises' fund shortages, banks have  enlarged their margins for loans involving circulating funds  since the second quarter. Recently, the State Council also  adopted a policy of handling loans involving circulating funds  on a case-to-case basis. With all these measures, the problem of  circulating fund shortages among enterprises should be  alleviated. She also pointed out: In solving the problems of  circulating fund shortages and mutual indebtedness of goods  payments among enterprises, the only way out is to exercise  stricter control over investment in fixed assets and excessive  rises in consumption funds and the enforcement of the policy of  "restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales"  against unmarketable products -- and not to rely on relaxation  of the money market.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE HONOR BOY WHO 'CAUGHT A BIG BURGLAR'  </P> <P> As crime-busters go, Tyler Scott Gossett of Glendale is definitely an early  bloomer. He thwarted a daylight burglary at his neighbor's home -- at age 4.  </P> <P> Police say Tyler, who turned 5 last month, spotted the break-in and gave them a  description that led to an arrest and the recovery of his neighbor's jewelry.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, Glendale police visited Sunshine Nursery School in Tujunga to  pay tribute. In front of his applauding classmates, Capt. Glynn Martin gave the  boy a framed certificate of appreciation.  </P> <P> "Do you all know what he did?" Martin asked the children. "He caught a big  burglar for us."  </P> <P> After the ceremony, Martin, a 25-year department veteran, described the  achievement in adult language:  </P> <P> "This is the first instance we know of where someone this young saw a burglary  taking place and was essentially able to cause the arrest of the burglar," he  said.  </P> <P> According to police reports, Tyler was playing in his room Jan. 23 when he  heard glass break and saw a man in his neighbor's back yard. He ran to tell his  mother, who was in another room.  </P> <P> "I went and looked, and I didn't see anything," Betsy Gossett recalled  Thursday. "I went back to what I was doing, and being a kid, he kept watching  because he knew what he saw."  </P> <P> When the suspicious man returned to the yard, Tyler "came and got me, and we  both saw him climbing in the window," his mother said.  </P> <P> Because the Gossetts had just moved in, the mother and her son walked next door  and checked with another neighbor to make sure that the man they saw was not a  resident of the house. The neighbor called 911.  </P> <P> Officers arrested Joseph Anthony Piraino, 24, of Los Angeles, who they said was  carrying jewelry and rifle ammunition from the house. Police said Piraino is a  state prison parolee who has been linked to one other burglary in Glendale and  five in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In a written report, Officer Michael Walker said Tyler "provided a detailed  description of the suspect, notified his mother, Betsy, of the suspect's  actions and guided me to the point of entry. This arrest would not have been  possible without Tyler's assistance," he wrote.  </P> <P> Tyler told police that the burglar was a white man with a mustache, wearing  sunglasses.  </P> <P> The break-in occurred at the home of real estate agent Gloria Barnes, who  attended the ceremony honoring Tyler. The boy's father, Scott Gossett, brought  his video camera to proudly record the event.  </P> <P> The boy's father and teachers described Tyler as an outgoing child who enjoys  riding his bicycle and watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on television.  </P> <P> But surrounded Thursday by police officers, flashing cameras and inquisitive  reporters, the boy turned shy and declined to talk about the crime or the  award.  </P> <P> "He'll remember this," Scott Gossett assured onlookers. "This is pretty good."  </P></p>

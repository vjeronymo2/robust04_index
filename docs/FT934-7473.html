			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Storehouse A crisis of confidence has shaken the Storehouse recovery story as the market has fretted about September's warning of a slowdown in BHS's sales growth and the latest disappointments at rival Burton. But Storehouse helped soothe the doubters with its strong profits progress at the half-way stage. Unlike Sears and Burton, shackled with tired old chains, Storehouse yesterday showed there is life left in its BHS and Mothercare chains after all. Ironically, its failure to exploit these businesses in the past has left scope to expand them in future. BHS plans to open 40 more sites and now has the financial muscle to fund its ambitions. Mothercare is also growing better at peddling pushchairs to the cooing classes. Yet its operating margins languish below 1.5 per cent and can only head one way. That latent promise, though, will take longer to fulfil than previously assumed. Pricing and margin pressures are unrelenting, with the resurgent Marks and Spencer being beastly to others on the high street. Moreover, it will prove far trickier for BHS to raise profits by growing sales than by hacking at its distended cost base. The remote threat that the chancellor may extend VAT to children's clothing could further unsettle Storehouse in the short run. Yet the management appears to have the measure of the challenge with stability becoming its watchword. It would certainly help if the new finance director, once found, did not disappear out the revolving door as fast as the previous four have done.</p>

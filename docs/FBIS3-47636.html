Companies with their own communications networks, like Korea  Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) and Korea Highway Corp., will be  able to take part in exclusive circuit projects such as cable  television from next January, Yun told reporters after reporting  his communications agenda to the president earlier in the day.    The fences between general and specific communications  sectors will be torn down, paving the way for all the  telecommunications companies to jump into other communications  businesses, Yu said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Zou Xiangqun (6760 0686 5028), </F> vice secretary general of the State Planning Commission, by  staff reporter: "How To Manage Prices Under a Market Economy"]    [Text] After more than a decade of reform, the traditional  price management system is already basically shattered, and the  framework for a new price management system is gradually being  shaped. Under these circumstances, is the task of price reform  already accomplished? Can things be allowed to run their course  after freeing up prices? With these questions of general  concern in mind, our staff reporter visited Zou Xiangqun, vice  secretary general of the State Planning Commission (former  deputy bureau chief of the State Pricing Bureau).  <H5>  Freeing Up Prices Does Not Equal Accomplishment of the Task </H5> of Reform    With 15 years of price reform, the highly centralized  government pricing system in China has been shattered and the  prices of most commodities are formed by the market. By the end  of 1992, government-fixed prices only accounted for 5.9 percent  of the gross retail volume of commodities in society; of the  gross volume of agricultural produce sold by farmers,  government-fixed prices accounted for 12.5 percent; and of the  gross volume of capital goods sold by industrial enterprises,  government-fixed prices accounted for 18.7 percent. The price  relationship between many important commodities has been  fundamentally improved, and the pricing structure is  continuously becoming more rational. The price scissors between  industrial and agricultural products has been greatly reduced,  the situation where the prices of basic industrial products were  too low has clearly improved, and 95 percent of the domestic  sale-prices of imported goods have been directly linked with  international market prices by means of the agency system. These  have all created important preconditions for the formation of a  socialist market pricing mechanism.    However, is the task of price reform accomplished? Zou  Xiangqun believes there is still quite a distance to go. He  said: According to the goal of economic structural reform  defined by the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the fundamental task  of price reform is to establish a socialist market pricing  mechanism. This pricing mechanism is one which relies mainly on  market price formation and which includes government  macroregulation and control. Its basic requirements are: In  terms of price formation, it should enable the majority of  commodities to enter the market, with enterprises determining  prices according to market supply and demand. In terms of price  operations, it should be able to regulate prices through supply  and demand, and guide the rational allocation of resources by  means of prices in a unified, open market environment with  orderly competition. In terms of pricing control, a perfect and  effective government regulatory system of prices should be  established in order to control the pricing bodies in adopting  pricing actions in line with the economic and legal standards of  the market.    Comparing current achievements with these goals of reform,  what would you consider lacking? Zou Xiangqun answered:    First, the market system is not sufficiently mature.  Currently, the market structure is rather monolithic and the  development of the market of production factors has just begun.  The market is still relatively small, with imperfect  facilities, and the means of transaction are backward. Market  regulations are imperfect. Regional and market barriers still  exist. Prices formed in this kind of market cannot sensitively  reflect the situation of gross supply and demand in society, nor  the degree of shortage in resources. They cannot accurately  send out signals to guide the allocation of resources. The  price fluctuations in December 1993 occurred under a situation  in which China's grain production enjoyed bumper harvests for  years, state grain reserves were ample, and gross supply and  demand were balanced. This, to a great degree, was directly  linked to the fact that China's market system is insufficiently  developed.    Second, reform of enterprise internal operational mechanisms  has not been accomplished. As pricing entities, even though  enterprises already have the competition encouragement  mechanism, in general they still lack a risk control mechanism,  lack a perfect internal price management system, and lack the  knowledge, experience, and skills to scientifically determine  prices. During the first half of last year, some large steel  plants took the opportunity of an explosion in the scale of  investment, as well as the flourishing market in construction  materials, to compete with each other in jacking up prices, or  even cooperated in raising prices. Thus, within a short period  of time, the prices of steel products doubled, and this was then  followed by a sharp price drop and overstocking of steel, making  production and turnover difficult for the enterprises. This is a  typical example in this respect.    Third, a price regulatory and control system has yet to be  established. After the scope of direct-management of prices by  the government is largely reduced, as far as the prices of the  majority of commodities and services are concerned, an effective  pricing regulation and control system and a perfect legal system  concerning pricing have yet to be established. Although the  state has begun building a reserve for some commodities and a  few areas have established price regulation funds for a few very  important goods, on the whole, the economic means are still  weak, legislation lags behind, and control and regulation are  limp. These have become a conspicuous contradiction in the  current reform.    Fourth, the price system has not yet been completely  straightened out. The prices of energy, railway transportation,  and a few basic products and infrastructure are still relatively  low, which is harmful to the optimal allocation of resources.  The purchase price of grain is also irrational, the comparative  efficiency of agricultural production is down, the scissors  difference between industrial and farm products -- which was  already reduced after reform -- has again showed signs of  expanding in recent years. This is not good for the stable  development of agricultural production. All these indicate that  in order to accomplish the task of price reform, much hard and  practical work needs to be done, especially in the continued  development of the market system, in establishing a unified and  open market system with orderly competition, in promoting reform  of the enterprise internal operational mechanism and the  development of market entities, and in the speedy establishment  of a healthy price regulation and control system and the  continued straightening out of price relationships between  important commodities. Only thus can we build a socialist  market pricing mechanism.  <H5>  One Must Not Wash One's Hands of Prices Under a Market </H5> Economy    The main features of market economy are to use economic  interest as the basic driving force and to realize the best  allocation of resources through the market. This kind of  economy has a mechanism to encourage competition and vitality,  and is a law-oriented economy which can restrict the spontaneous  and blindly generated negative effects of the market. A  socialist market pricing mechanism must also fully embody these  main features.    After the prices of the majority of commodities and services  were freed up, manufacturers and businessmen obtained the right  to determine prices, and the enthusiasm to produce and operate  were greatly uplifted. This has obviously promoted economic  development, boosted market prosperity, and improved people's  living standards. However, at the same time, in some regions,  departments, enterprises, and organizations, certain chaotic  phenomena have occurred, such as superseding the power to fix  prices, unduly collecting fees, monopolizing prices, seeking  exorbitant profits, piggy-backing on price-hikes, raising prices  without permission, competing with others in raising prices,  asking for unlimited high prices, cheating customers, producing  and selling fake and shoddy goods, and so on. Although these  problems are expressed in different forms and different degrees  in various places and aspects, they are very harmful, and to a  certain extent they have pushed the general level of prices up.  According to estimates, in the general 13 percent rise of  retail prices during 1993, 6.8 percent were spontaneous price  rises, of which a fair proportion was caused by chaos in the  pricing order. This chaos in the pricing order was,  fundamentally speaking, a disorderly action caused by the  pursuit of self-interest by various interest groups, with  disregard to the social effects during the process of drastic  changes in the distribution of interests. It was a reflection  of the spontaneity and blindness of the market economy. In  order to prevent and overcome the damaging effects this  spontaneity and blindness may cause, the state must conduct  macromanagement over economic activities and market prices.    Western countries with market economies do not completely  let  prices go. Zou Xiangqun says all the major developed countries  have established price management organizations of different  levels and different types which adopt direct management,  indirect management, and supervision and inspection measures  over prices of commodities and services according to different  situations. Japan established a national centralized price  management organization which has the Cabinet Meeting on Pricing  as the decisionmaking organ over pricing, and the Economic  Planning Agency's Pricing Office as its central executive organ.  France has the National Competition Commission, General Bureau  for Competitive Consumption and Antifraud Inspection. Thailand  has the Commission for Fair Pricing and Antimonopoly under the  Ministry of Commerce in charge of prices nationwide. The United  States does not have a national centralized price control  organization. Supervision and control on the general level of  prices is carried out by the federal Labor Department.  Regulation and control of railway freight prices is under the  government's Interstate Commerce Commission, while the  supervision of consumer interests and enterprise prices is taken  care of by the Consumer Bureau. In Germany, commodity prices  under the management of the state are normally under the care of  economic departments of state governments. Prices that are  directly managed by the government in Japan include petroleum,  coal, railways, passenger transportation, public housing, land  prices, rice, cigarettes, and table salt. These occupy  approximately 18 percent of the commodities, calculated  according to consumer price indices. In America, these include  utilities, electricity, taxis, subways, telephones and  telecommunication, cable TV, running water, gas, public rental  housing, and museum tickets, which account for 5 to 10 percent  of citizens' consumer spending. In France, these include public  transport, post and telecommunications, medicine, alcohol,  education, military products, agricultural produce, etc.,  occupying around 20 percent of commodities and fees. In Germany  these include railways, pharmaceuticals, coal, farm produce,  fees of lawyers, architects, and notaries, and insurance as  required by law, which occupy 22 to 26 percent of commodities  and utility fees.    There are three forms of indirect management of prices: The  first is to regulate total supply and demand by using banking  and financial policies, adjusting the discount rate of capital  reserves and interest rates, using government budgets, and  adjusting government expenditures. The second is to use  industrial policies to support the development of key  industries. For instance, to protect farmers' interests, the  United States practices a supporting price and subsidies policy  on farm produce, with a total subsidy of over $15 billion. The  European Community and Japan also have substantial subsidies on  farm produce. The third is social interference measures,  namely, supervising price by means of consumer councils or  intervening by means of public opinion. Foreign countries also  attach importance to supervision and inspection of prices and  have special price inspection teams. In some countries price  inspectors have guns, and when necessary they can conduct  searches. Serious offenders are subject to legal punishment.  Looking at the world today, whether developed or developing,  not a single country takes a completely laissez-faire attitude  toward prices.    Zou Xiangqun says, based on rich practical experience  gained since China's reform and opening to the outside world and  taking into consideration some common methods used in Western  countries under a market economy, the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee made explicit stipulations  concerning the building of a macroregulatory and control system.  The "Decision Concerning Some Issues for Establishing a  Socialist Market Economic Structure" passed by the plenary  session pointed out: "To establish a perfect macroregulatory  and control system with indirect regulation and control as the  main means, to guarantee the healthy operation of the national  economy"; "to further change the operational mechanism of  state-owned enterprises"; and "to establish a national, unified  and open market system..." are an interconnected and  intercontrolling organic whole, composing the basic framework of  a socialist market economic structure. Centering on these major  points, we must establish a corresponding legal system and adopt  practical measures to actively and systematically "push forward  reform comprehensively and promote the development of the social  productive forces."  <H5>  Establishing a New Price Regulation System Is an Urgent Task </H5> of Current Price Reform    Under the new situation of intensified marketization of the  Chinese economy, to continuously push forward the reform of the  economic system, accelerate and improve macroregulation and  control, prevent market prices from drastic fluctuations,  control excessive price rises, standardize pricing actions, and  realize fair competition, fair transaction, and legal  operations, one must establish a perfect and effective  government regulation and control system over prices.    Zou Xiangqun points out, the price regulation and control  system must embody the demands of a market economy, and the  focus of regulation and control should be on maintaining the  economic overall balance, with macroregulation and control as  the main means. The objects of regulation and control should be  those deciding the prices and the market, with indirect  regulation and control as the main means. The means of  regulation and control should be mainly economic and legal,  supplemented with necessary administrative means. The  establishment of such a pricing regulation and control system is  a gradual process which, following the deepening of reform, the  strengthening of economic power, and the perfection of laws,  will continuously enrich and perfect the means of regulation and  control. This will take a fairly long time to accomplish.    Currently, Zou Xiangqun believes that, in the context of the  objectives of stabilizing market prices and standardizing  pricing actions, we should tackle the establishment of healthy  economic and legal means of price control in the following  respects:    -- Establish a reserve system for important commodities such  as grain, cotton, and oil, so that these can be dumped on the  market when fluctuations occur in production or supply.    -- Establish grain and nonstaple food price-regulation funds  to keep down prices, protect production and consumption, and  stabilize the economy when great upheavals and drops appear in  prices.    -- Perfect price laws and regulations, encourage  competition,  and oppose monopolies; protect legal gains and oppose exorbitant  profiteering; and protect proper business operations, oppose  cheating and overcharging customers, and crack down on fake and  shoddy commodities. The "Regulations on Clearly Marking the  Prices of Commodities and Services," issued for implementation  in early March of this year by the State Planning Commission  with the approval of the State Council is an important economic  legal regulation promoting open transactions in the market,  raising the visibility of pricing actions, and opposing cheating  in prices.    -- Conduct price information services. The pricing  departments at various levels should fully make use of the  government's information network, and according to the needs of  society, extensively collect, arrange, and develop price  information; provide, in a timely fashion, information to  enterprises concerning the market supply and demand of various  important commodities, the pricing situation, and predictions of  trends; and they should offer price information services by  serving as price consultants, offering consultations on specific  topics, issuing publications and other means, to guide  enterprises in organizing their production according to market  demands and adjusting their operational orientation.    -- Strengthen policy direction and professional training for  enterprises, and help enterprise managers to master marketing  strategies and decisionmaking skills in pricing.    -- Undertake appropriate administrative intervention in a  small number of important commodities. For the basic means of  production and necessities of daily life which easily suffer  from price fluctuations, necessary and appropriate intervention  should be undertaken according to different circumstances, and  price-limiting measures, such as keeping records of any price  rises or requiring applications for price rises, should be  practiced.    Zou Xiangqun says that the State Council recently decided to  practice price supervision on 20 types of commodities and  services most crucial to people's lives. This is a new measure  which makes a breakthrough in important commodities and a new  measure for stabilizing people's lives and pushing forward the  reform in the price regulation and control system. It embodies  the principle of using indirect regulation and control as the  main means and combines economic means with appropriate  administrative intervention. It is beneficial to maintaining the  relative stability of the general level of prices. We should  earnestly implement the various measures of price supervision in  coordination with the reality in order to render better service  to reform, development, and stability.</p>

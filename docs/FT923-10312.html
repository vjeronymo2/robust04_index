			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Classical architectural tradition in a contemporary situation Sir, As director of The Architecture Foundation I am writing to voice our disagreement with Colin Amery's comments (Architecture, July 20) in the last paragraph of his article. In selecting the buildings and projects featured in the 'City Changes' exhibition, the Architecture Foundation - whose trustees include two eminent architectural historians, Mark Girouard and John Harris - was anxious to choose buildings of quality. A broad range of projects with a variety of architectural styles - 21 in all - was included. One of our trustees consulted Mr Amery for suggestions and he brought to our attention an accomplished example of modern classicism which is, in fact, featured in the exhibition. Many respected historians and practising architects believe that the classical tradition, so endlessly rich and flexible, could be as relevant today as it ever has been. But it needs an intelligent and creative re-thinking to meet the contemporary situation. It seems to us that too much of the Paternoster scheme, at its last showing, is weakly derivative and lacks the quality that a site of such national importance merits. Richard Burdett, director, The Architecture Foundation, The Economist Building, 30 Bury Street, London SW1Y 6AU</p>

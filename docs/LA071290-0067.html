			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAIL DRIVE;  </P> <P> GLASSELL PARK: A RESIDENT WORKS TO PRESERVE THE AREA'S NETWORK OF INFORMAL FOOT  PATHS BEFORE HOUSES ARE BUILT ON TOP OF THEM.  </P> <P> Visitors to the Glassell Park home of Andy Montealegre dare not whisper the  word "walk" unless they really intend to take one with Rita, his 3-year-old dog  of uncertain parentage.  </P> <P> She can barely contain herself at the mere mention of a race down the dirt  paths that traverse Glassell Park's scenic hillsides. And Montealegre, 37,  admits that he has grown nearly as fond of their daily romps as Rita.  </P> <P> With an eye toward the real estate signs sprouting from Glassell Park's grassy  fields and slopes, Montealegre says he hopes to preserve forever the area's  informal walking trails before houses are built over them.  </P> <P> He has mapped the lacework pattern of dirt trails on the neighborhood's  hillsides, bordering rows of new houses at places, forging through  wildflower-covered meadows and up steep, wooded hills at others.  </P> <P> He hopes to have the map and language protecting the trails included in the  area's growth plan. Property owners would be required to dedicate easements to  the trails that cross their properties as a condition of obtaining development  permits.  </P> <P> Montealegre concedes that the odds are against him. Footings for new houses  already encroach on some of the trails. And Montealegre, who works as a Los  Angeles city planner on projects in other parts of the city, anticipates heated  opposition from landowners who may bristle at the notion of giving up property  for trail easements.  </P> <P> Yet Montealegre presses ahead, firmly believing that a well-thought-out trail  system is necessary to protect the natural ambience that attracted him to the  neighborhood two years ago.  </P> <P> "I lived in Hollywood before this, where people don't walk at all," Montealegre  said. "It was a pretty rough neighborhood. When I started looking at houses up  here, the thing that pushed it over the top was the trails. You could come home  and walk at night, even though you live in the city."  </P> <P> Evening hikes through the neighborhood introduced Montealegre to many of the  residents who shared his fondness for the foot paths. Older folks hike the  trails for exercise, he said. New parents carry babies along the paths in  backpacks. Kids blaze new trails for adventure.  </P> <P> "People on the trails know each other," Montealegre said, "especially the  dog-walkers."  </P> <P> He concluded that the neighborhood camaraderie fostered by the trails could  only be protected through some sort of permanent planning mechanism, because  many of the streets in Glassell Park are too narrow to safely accommodate  walkers and there are few sidewalks.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, a citizens advisory committee appointed by Los Angeles City  Council members Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre was already working on a  plan for future development of Mt. Washington and Glassell Park. If adopted,  the Mt. Washington/Glassell Park Neighborhood Specific Plan would establish the  rules for future development of the area. Among the issues it addresses are  house size, scenic corridors, parking and native plants.  </P> <P> Using his planning expertise, Montealegre presented the citizens advisory  committee with the proposal to require dedication of easements for existing  trails upon the issuance of tract or parcel maps or building permits.  </P> <P> Provisions would make the city responsible for drainage, slope cuts and  landscaping of the trails to protect the rights and privacy of property owners  as well as those of the people who use the trails, Montealegre said.  </P> <P> "You can't do this without being concerned about security and privacy," he  said. "I strongly believe you can do it, but when you bring it up, it scares  people because of those issues."  </P> <P> Although the citizens advisory group agreed to insert Montealegre's proposal  into the Mt. Washington/Glassell Park Neighborhood Specific Plan, the prospects  for designated walking trails still don't look good. The citizens group itself  is at bitter odds with the Los Angeles Planning Department over other subjects,  such as house sizes on hillsides, making the future of the entire plan  uncertain. Molina has expressed her opposition to forced trail dedications on  private property.  </P> <P> In any case, there is no working prototype in Los Angeles for the kind of trail  system Montealegre envisions: permanent, but maintained only enough to  guarantee its preservation, without being overly landscaped or paved.  </P> <P> A similar proposal to preserve and create walking trails along Mulholland Drive  as part of a Mulholland Scenic Parkway has proven so controversial that it is  unresolved after 17 years of debate, said Violet Moyer, former chief city  planner for the corridor. Nearby residents fear trails would bring crime, trash  and graffiti, Moyer said.  </P> <P> Montealegre considers Glassell Park residents more resolute. The walking  community already keeps an eye on security and makes sure the trails remain  free of trash, he said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Montealegre tries to be realistic.  </P> <P> "The opportunity may be lost," he said, listening as the whine of power saws  drowned out the screeches of hawks along one of the trails on a recent weekday  morning.  </P> <P> An answer could come this month, when a public hearing is held on the  neighborhood specific plan.  </P> <P> Pat Rollie, a prominent Mt. Washington realtor, predicts opposition.  </P> <P> "If you asked the community as a whole, everyone would say, 'Oh, how nice!' But  if you say, 'Will you give us two feet of your property?', no way are people  going to do that," Rollie said.  </P> <P> If nothing else, those in Montealegre's camp should prove more lyrical.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons we moved here was the fact that it was off the beaten  path," said Paul Logan, a Glassell Park resident since 1974. "There was almost  a rural sensitivity."  </P> <P> As time passed, Logan said, "Camelot got discovered."  </P> <P> Today, he said, "A lot of people are just looking for real estate values, and  they don't have the sensitivity to notice an owl sitting out there on a pole,  looking for food."  </P></p>

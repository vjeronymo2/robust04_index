			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CASE OF BEGINNER'S LUCK AFTER 53 YEARS;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: AFTER OWNING SEVERAL COLTS WHO NEARLY MADE IT TO THE KENTUCKY  DERBY, GENTER, 92, HAS A WINNER IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT.  </P> <P> Frances Genter's eyesight is so poor that the running of the 116th Kentucky  Derby Saturday was only a blur.  </P> <P> Unbridled's jockey, Craig Perret, wore a yellow cap rather than a light blue  one so that owner Genter, 92, might be able to follow her colt in the race, but  she still needed her trainer, Carl Nafzger, to stand next to her and give a  play-by-play account of the race.  </P> <P> Nafzger began: "It's a clean break, he's laying great."  </P> <P> With a half-mile to run, he said: "He's making a nice move."  </P> <P> Then: "He's fifth . . . fourth . . . third. . . . He's taking the lead!"  </P> <P> As Unbridled flashed by his owner's box, Nafzger pointed toward the track and  said: "There he is!'  </P> <P> Finally, Nafzger screamed: "Mrs. Genter, you've got a Kentucky Derby winner!"  </P> <P> Genter gasped. "Oh!" she whispered. Tears outlined her smiling face.  </P> <P> "If I ever won a Derby, I wished it was this one," Nafzger said. "Mrs. Genter  is 92 years old, 53 years in racing, and this is her first Derby horse."  </P> <P> On Sunday morning, while it rained again at Churchill Downs, horsemen reflected  on the Derby.  </P> <P> "We can thank the Man Upstairs for taking care of Mrs. Genter," said trainer  Nick Zito, whose Thirty Six Red ran ninth Saturday. "I talked all week about  paying my dues to get here. Now what do I do, reverse that? Ninety-two years  old, that's paying dues."  </P> <P> Ron McAnally, who trains Silver Ending, the fifth-place Derby finisher, was in  the box next to Genter Saturday. McAnally couldn't see the race, either. "This  was typical of the Derby," he said. "You pay $4,000 for tickets and you can't  see because of everybody in front of you."  </P> <P> When McAnally looked over at Genter, clutching Nafzger after the race was won,  he got a warm feeling. "This is a woman who's been in racing all her life,"  McAnally said.  </P> <P> The owner of Unbridled was born in Pennsylvania in 1898, the year Plaudit won  the 24th running of the Kentucky Derby. She met Harold Genter while they were  students at the University of Minnesota and they were married in 1919. Her  husband developed the pop-up toaster and started the Toastmaster company.  </P> <P> Harold Genter considered himself a good handicapper and backed his opinions  with hefty bets at the windows. In 1940, he and Frances went to the Saratoga  sales and bought their first horse.  </P> <P> That led to an involvement in breeding thoroughbreds. A broodmare band of 30  was not uncommon for the Genters.  </P> <P> In 1951, the Genters won the Santa Anita Derby with Rough'n Tumble, ridden by  Eddie Arcaro and trained by Sunshine Calvert. Rough'n Tumble later sired My  Dear Girl, who was the champion 2-year-old filly in 1959. Some other important  Genter horses have included In Reality, who won the Florida Derby 23 years  before Unbridled did, and Smile, the champion sprinter for 1986.  </P> <P> Harold Genter died in 1981, and his widow decided to remain in racing --  delegating a son-in-law, Bentley Smith, to manage the stable. Frances Genter,  whose horses still run in that name, has remarried, to Earl Knudtson, a retired  businessman who prefers golf to horses. Knudtson, 93, played 18 holes the day  before Unbridled won the Florida Derby, and on Saturday he played nine holes in  Minnesota before watching the Derby on television.  </P> <P> Genter bought Unbridled, a son of Fappiano, for $70,000 as a weanling at Tartan  Farm's dispersal auction. Genter also bought Unbridled's dam, Gana Facil. Gana  Facil means "Easy Victory."  </P> <P> Genter has raced a horse named Unbridled before. The first Unbridled was a colt  who did well in 1949 as a 2-year-old, but never made it to the Derby.  </P> <P> Smith was asked why Genter used the name again. With the original Unbridled  dead, the name was available through the Jockey Club. "We just ran out of  names," Smith said. "It was a good name, so we submitted it."  </P> <P> Frances Genter might have had a Derby starter before, but she never pushed her  trainers. Rough'n Tumble wasn't a sound horse and the breeder, who was also a  friend of the Genters, suggested that they skip the Derby. Calvert didn't think  In Reality could run 1 1/4 miles and the Genters agreed. Some other good Genter  3-year-olds -- Superbity, Dr. Carter and Smile -- had physical problems that  precluded the Derby. Saturday, however, there were no problems at all.  </P> <P> Frances Genter had the horse right here, as the lyric from "Guys and Dolls"  goes. Dressed in a pillbox hat with veil, a polka-dot blouse and a dark skirt,  the little grayhaired old lady waved and blew kisses to the crowd as she was  taken to the winner's circle.  </P> <P> "This is such a thrill," she said. "I'm really, really thrilled. We're No. 1.  The Preakness is up to Carl. We've been taking things one day at a time."  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Global warming line far too simplistic Sir, The argument that 'if saving energy made any sense everyone would already be doing so to the optimum level' had, I fondly imagined, been discredited some 20 years ago. So it was a little tiresome to see this simplistic line pedalled by Messrs Roger Bate and Julian Morris in their pamphlet, Global warming: apocalypse or hot air?. It was rather more worrying that Bronwen Maddox's review of it, 'Greenhouse faces stoning' (March 18), should apparently accept much of this at face value. For the record, here are some of the obstacles which have long been acknowledged to distort the marketplace for energy efficiency investments: lack of information; lack of finance; lack of knowhow and technical skills; separation of responsibilities for energy supply expenditure and conservation actions; landlord/tenant disincentives; energy tariffs which encourage greater energy usage; and lack of confidence in novel technology. This is the list of barriers which appears in the House of Commons energy committee's report, 'Energy policy implications of the greenhouse effect', published in 1989. It might have been helpful if at any rate some of these had been addressed in the pamphlet (or raised in the article) before such a sweepingly uninformed generalisation was made.

This product will enable semiconductor makers  to save time as it does not require molding. Moreover, it will  minimize material waste, allowing manufacturers to economize on  epoxy resins which currently are in short supply. Since  production of powdered sealing material will be reduced, the  ratio of the mini-tablet type will increase by from 40&percnt;  to over  50&percnt;.    There are three forms of semiconductor sealing materials,  viz., powder, a large square tablet measuring a few centimeters  on all sides, and a mini tablet in the size of an IC package.  Semiconductor makers who use a powdered-form sealing material  dissolve it before injecting it inside the IC package. With this  method, some sealing material remains on the injection guide. As  for the large tablet type, since its excess material must be cut  off, it produces waste. Although the molding of the mini tablet  requires an extra work, adding to cost, since it produces no  waste, demand for it appears to be rising in recent months.    Together with Hitachi's affiliate, Hitachi Chemical  Malaysia,  the Minamiyuki Plant is producing 9000 tons of semiconductor  sealing materials a year. By February 1994, the Minamiyuki Plant  plans to install additional molding machines.    The explosion which destroyed the Sumitomo Chemical Ehime  Plant (Niihama City) last July is creating concern for possible  tightening of demand and supply of epoxy resin, a main raw  material for semiconductor sealing materials. Following the  example of Hitachi, which is reducing 20&percnt; of epoxy resins  normally used, semiconductor makers will urge each sealing  material company to implement efficient use of epoxy resins more  in the future.</p>

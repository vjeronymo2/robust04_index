			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government and Unions Meet"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 21 -- The government will set up  special authorities to coordinate spending in the transport and  health sectors, union chiefs said after a meeting with ministers  here Tuesday morning [21 June].    Present for this morning's talks with leaders of the big  three unions CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL  [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian  Federation of Trade Unions] were Cabinet Undersecretary Gianni  Letta, and the industry, budget and labour ministers, Vito  Gnutti, Giancarlo Pagliarini and Clemente Mastella.    The discussions, part of a series of follow-up talks to last  July's [1993] cost of labour accord, focussed on public demand  and industrial policy, and culminated with an agreement to set  up the transport and health authorities. Another authority,  which keeps a check on spending in the computer industry, will  be beefed up.    "We stressed that by coordinating spending in two such  important sectors as health and transport you add to industrial  policy," said CISL Secretary General Sergio D'Antoni.    According to Sergio Cofferati of the CGIL, "the July accord  contained no precise indications on industrial policy. There  can be no doubt, however, that this is a decisive issue for  dealing with the employment crisis."    Cofferati had words of praise for the new government in this  first session of talks on the July accord, saying "we can only  appreciate the government's willingness to delve deeper into all  these issues."    The unionists will return to the premier's office at 1600  (1400 GMT) this afternoon to discuss renewal of the public  sector contract which expired three years ago and has not been  renegotiated due to lack of funds.    The question of the poorer southern Mezzogiorno region will  be studied at a special meeting to be held June 30. A  suggestion yesterday from Industry Minister Gnutti that southern  workers might be paid proportionally lower wages than their  central and northern colleagues prompted criticism from unions  and the opposition.</p>

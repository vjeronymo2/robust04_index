			<p>With   Asia   <F P=102> 94FE0393G Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Jan 94  p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0393G </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] In order to promote cooperation with various  countries in Asia, the Science and Technology Agency (STA) will  establish an "Information Center" (a temporary designation)  which will be in charge of gathering and making available R&amp;D  information to various countries. This is a part of STA's policy  aimed at a substantial buildup of ASCA (Asian Scientific  Cooperation Association), an organization consisting of various  countries' ministers of science. Moreover, in addition to  pursuing as a part of an ASCA project the construction of  researchers' international networks, a project which STA  launched early this year, STA will hold an ASCA seminar in March  in Japan. The seminar will be attended by experts from the  various countries involved.    The objectives of the information center are to gather and  make available data produced by research organizations and  researchers of various countries so that they may provide useful  information for those recommending international joint research  projects or those drawing up government policies. The  installation of the information center will not be officially  decided until this fall when the ASCA members will assemble in  the Philippines for the 13th ASCA meeting. In substance,  however, STA plans to start the center's activities prior to  that meeting and has begun collecting the following basic data:  (1) catalogs of various countries' research organizations; and  (2) trends of various countries' science policies.    Moreover, at the forthcoming meeting in the Philippines, STA  will propose as an ASCA undertaking the global research network  project, which was started early this year, with STA playing a  central role, as part of Japan's effort to build a network  linking research organizations both here and abroad.    The first task of this project will be to gather global  environmental fluctuation data, including precipitations,  vegetation, and oceans, in cooperation with research  organizations in Asia. After the initial data gathering has been  completed, STA's plan is to propose additional themes for the  areas of life science and materials.    In the meantime, ASCA seminars, with the participation of  experts from various Asian countries, will be held beginning  this year. The first two seminars will be held in March, in  Saitama Prefecture's Ohmiya City and in Tokyo. The themes will  be "Science and Technology and Regional Technical Innovations"  and "Use and Control of Microorganisms in Asia," respectively.    ASCA draws participants from 24 countries, including China,  Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and New Zealand. Each  year, alternately a cabinet rank officials' meeting or an  administrators' meeting is held.</p>

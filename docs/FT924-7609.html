The government is looking to expand the ownership base of all five companies and is keen to ensure they have adequate financial resources for their development. Mr Markku Tapio, deputy head of the industry department, said the government wanted to receive reports from the financial institutions involved by late spring. Finland has already earmarked Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group, for privatisation.

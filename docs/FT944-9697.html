			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Berlusconi faces huge flood aid bill The government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi is searching for ways to find some L7,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn) in additional aid to cover the damage caused by last week's catastrophic flooding in northern Italy. As an immediate response, the right-wing coalition pledged L3,000bn drawn from existing funds. But the final assessment of flood damage in Piedmont is expected this week and initial estimates of more than L10,000bn worth of damage could prove conservative. With very limited personal and corporate insurance cover, especially in the agricultural sector, individuals, companies and local authorities are looking to the government for financial help. Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister who has taken charge of the relief operation, has done nothing to dispel the impression that the government will foot the bill. Indeed, the government seems more than ready to do this to offset growing criticism over the authorities' handling of the disaster. The cost of previous disasters, such as the 1980 Irpinia earthquake in southern Italy, were financed by increasing taxes on petrol or tobacco. But this could prove inflationary and the government may well opt to issue a special bond or introduce a once-off income tax payment. More than 700 towns and villages were hit by the floods which began on November 5. Italy's right-wing coalition government last night won a vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies on a revenue-raising measure in the budget. The result of the vote, on an amnesty in the budget bill for Italians guilty of illegal building work in exchange for a one-off payment, was 321-134. Opposition filibustering delayed the vote by several hours and many opposition deputies boycotted the ballot. The government has signalled it could also seek a confidence vote on pensions reforms, an area in which the Northern League, a member of the coalition, is seeking significant changes.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Technology: Stamping out computer theft - Worth Watching Stealing personal computers is a growth business. In 1992 an estimated Pounds 60m-worth of PCs were stolen in Britain, not to mention the portable machines that were left on buses and aircraft. To help ensure that machines which are recovered are returned to their rightful owners, Firstlok, of Steyning, West Sussex, has devised a software package that gives each PC a unique serial number which is registered on a central database. The software is loaded into each Dos-based PC from a floppy disc. Every time the machine is subsequently switched on the serial number is displayed, together with the Firstlok database phone number where details of the owner can be found. The software also incorporates a password access control device. Firstlok: UK, 0903 879568.</p>

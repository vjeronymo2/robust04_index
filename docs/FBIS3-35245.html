			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, in Cairo, Egypt, by  Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio, from the "With the Midday Events"  program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Sha'th] I think this week's negotiations, which  concluded in Taba yesterday, were positive and made some measure  of progress. We would like our talks to lead to implementation  on the ground so that ordinary Palestinians may come to feel  real change. We have wrapped up discussions on a significant  portion of the issues bearing on the transfer of civilian powers  to the national Palestinian authority. The water issue remains  to be addressed. We have finished with the issues of  archaeology, regional planning, and wire and wireless  communications. An agreement on relevant papers will be worked  out next Monday here in Cairo. We also had exhaustive  discussions concerning the release of Palestinian detainees.  After the Red Cross team's visit to Taba, we now have all the  relevant papers and figures. I believe that next Monday will  see us achieve further progress. We also agreed in principle on  launching a Palestinian television station and radio station on  the medium wave. Regarding the Security Committee, it looked at  a draft report on the composition of Palestinian police and  security arrangements in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region.  I believe that progress was also made there. However, there  are numerous points that need to be cleared by the political  leaders. We will wait until next week to see progress made  there.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, have you begun drafting the points on  which agreement was reached so that they may be presented to  your respective political leaders?    [Sha'th] We are now formulating everything. There is no  time left for discussions in a vacuum. All our negotiations  address papers, item by item.    [Mu'addi] Do you see the outstanding issues being resolved  next week?    [Sha'th] As much as I would like this to happen, it is hard  for me to predict that much. As I have said, the Israeli side  looks at certain matters as being mere symbols of sovereignty,  while, in fact, they are highly significant symbols of national  Palestinian identity and the national Palestinian authority.  Things like passports, postage stamps, an international  telephone code, and other such issues are essential to the  Palestinian character and entity, even though these do not, as  yet, imply the existence of a Palestinian state, because the  Palestinian state has still to come into being.    [Mu'addi] Do you expect an agreement on all issues to be  finalized by 'Id al-Fitr [on or about 13 March]?    [Sha'th] That is what I hope will happen. It would then be  glad news for our people that will make the 'Id doubly happy.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian negotiator  in Taba, Thank you so much.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

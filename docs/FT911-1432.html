			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / An unenviable record: Allied-Lyons' foreign exchange losses Allied-Lyons Pounds 150m loss in foreign exchange dealings is the biggest incurred by a British industrial company. Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, its chairman, yesterday admitted that the loss stemmed from the use of complex instruments which the company's financial experts failed to understand. The revelations came in a letter to shareholders following an investigation by KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the group's auditors. Although the loss can be pin-pointed to a short three-week period earlier this year, the root of the problem dates from 1989. Allied-Lyons treasury team decided to start writing (or selling) call options on foreign currencies, which give the buyer the right to obtain that currency at a fixed price. The buyer stands to lose only the cost of the option; but the seller has potentially unlimited exposure if the market moves the wrong way. This initiative was set in a dangerous context. The treasury's internal controls were not strictly enforced, its computer systems were outdated, and its staff did not understand the nature of the risks they were taking on. Sir Derrick, who is to retire early, admitted yesterday that the department had been 'dealing in foreign currency instruments which were inappropriate, and in which it lacked the requisite trading skills'. The writing of options initially proved a profitable business, and, encouraged by their success, the team adopted increasingly aggressive tactics. By the second half of last year, the company's internal exposure limit - the maximum it risked losing in the market - of Pounds 500m had been breached. Although the treasury was not officially classified as a 'profit centre', it usually produced moderate annual profits of about Pounds 10m. Traditionally perceived by other corporate treasures and bankers as operating a conservative financial policy, Allied-Lyons had in fact taken trading positions in the financial markets in order to make money rather than just hedge exposure since 1978. Last year senior management received several warnings that the company's involvement in the foreign exchange markets had increased significantly. Last summer, the Bank of England brought Allied-Lyons' foreign currency activities to the attention of Sir Derrick during a routine meeting. Subsequently, the company's finance director and treasurer discussed the matter with Bank officials. But when positions were checked - using what turned out to be inadequate control systems - it was decided that the company's exposure was not excessive and that its positions were broadly balanced. Another external warning followed, this time from KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the company's auditors. That warning, to former finance director Mr Cliff Hatch, was not reported to more senior executives. Exposures were still mostly within the internal limit of Pounds 500m. But in September, a serious breach of that limit at last prompted the company to tackle the problem. The treasury began to reduce its exposure to more prudent levels, but during this process it left itself further exposed. Between February 21 and March 16 this year, the dollar strengthened strongly against the pound, from Dollars 1.96 to Dollars 1.79. Most of the losses were incurred because Allied-Lyons left itself with a large and unhedged short position by writing call options on the dollar. The market moved inexorably against Allied-Lyons, increasing profits for holders of the options, who could exercise their right to buy the dollar at a set rate against the pound, but magnifying Allied-Lyons' losses. By the time National Westminster Bank was called in to clear up the mess, exposure had reached Pounds 1.5bn (calculated on market values at that time). The systems used by Allied-Lyons to run its positions were not geared for increasingly complex products. Its computer system had been developed to handle straightforward foreign exchange trading. The system was amended in 1989 to cover options, but proved too unsophisticated to track these complex instruments accurately. This would have been picked up, though, if the nature of call options had been better understood by staff. Until late February, the trading positions were believed to be reasonably balanced. This was because positions were incorrectly assumed to have been set off against each other, so the real exposure was not known. Potentially unlimited exposure was believed to be fully hedged by cash positions, or positions in the forward market. But sometimes positions were only partially hedged; in other cases, exposure had been increased. As the treasury traders tried to recover their positions, they left themselves more and more exposed. As well as its dollar positions, Allied-Lyons had also written options on the yen and the D-mark. But the principal exposure was to the dollar/sterling rate, reflecting - though arbitrarily - the company's largest trading relationship. KPMG Peat Marwick is now helping the firm reconstitute its treasury team, which, following a reshuffle, will still consist of five staff. Mr Timothy Dalton will stay on as treasurer. A new assistant treasurer is being recruited. Other UK companies have rushed to reassure shareholders that they do not use options, even though options can safely be used to hedge exposure, rather than to create it. But when treasuries use options to take trading positions, they are stepping beyond the traditional role of corporate treasuries, which is to protect their companies from loss, rather than secure profit. Such a strategy takes the corporate treasury into the territory of investment banks, where there are, at least in theory, tight internal controls, daily trading limits sophisticated infrastructure and expertise in hedging exposure. Allied-Lyons will not be writing any more options.</p>

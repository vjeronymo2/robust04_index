No reason was given for the renewed fire, after a three day  lull, and apparent calm in the Bacongo and Makele-Kele districts.    The two areas are controlled by groups opposed to the  President Pascal Lissouba and have been at the centre of fierce  political and ethnic violence that has turned Brazzaville into a  powder keg.    Around 115 people have been killed in clashes between  supporters of Lissouba and opposition leader Bernard Kolelas.    The blockade of the Bacongo suburb, launched by the army on  January 17 after renewed violence and the kidnapping of an  officer from the president's bodyguard, continued over the  weekend in spite of fresh doubts over its chances of success.    One officer close to Lissouba said the army blockade was  "ludicrous" since the suburb could be supplied from Zaire by  ship across the river border between the two countries.    Interior Minister Martin Mberi called on official radio for  the illegal army militias to allow free movement for diplomats,  some of whom have been harassed by militias.    The recent lull in fighting was preceded by a rocket attack  Thursday which damaged a police station in the northern Ouenze  area of Brazzaville.    A second rocket attack blew out the windows of a bank in the  same district, witnesses said. No casualties were reported from  the attacks and it was unclear who was responsible.</p>

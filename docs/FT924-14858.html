			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Thatcher shatters Tory unity hope: Former prime minister denounces Maastricht treaty as the 'vision of yesterday' A VITRIOLIC attack on the Maastricht treaty by Lady Thatcher last night shattered Mr John Major's hopes that divisions over Europe had been put to rest at the Tory party conference. After a day in which Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had led a succession of cabinet ministers in backing the prime minister's stance, Lady Thatcher derided Maastricht as a 'vision of the past'. She repudiated the European exchange rate mechanism as a 'ruinous straitjacket'. Her scathing intervention on the eve of her appearance alongside her successor on the platform in Brighton drew an angrily curt response from the prime minister. He told reporters: 'It is a matter for her, not me . . . I will address government policy on Friday, the policy which has the cabinet's complete and unanimous support.' Lady Thatcher, who indicated last week that she had no intention of disrupting the conference, used an article in today's issue of The European newspaper to do just that: 'It is time to get our priorities right. The government must recognise that Maastricht, like the ERM, is part of the vision of yesterday. It is time to set out the vision for tomorrow.' Lady Thatcher also brushed aside the policy initiative, expected to be presented by Mr Major later this month at the Birmingham summit, when she insisted that enhanced language on 'subsidiarity' - the devolution of community powers to nation states - would not be sufficient to make the treaty viable. Her joint appearance with Mr Major on the platform this morning now threatens an uncomfortable test of the loyalties of party activists who earlier this week cheered a similar attack on Maastricht delivered by Lord Tebbit. It also risks overshadowing Mr Norman Lamont's efforts in a speech today to reassure financial markets that he will put in place a coherent economic strategy to replace membership of the ERM. Senior ministers said Lady Thatcher's comments had been deliberately timed to undermine Mr Major's authority. One member of the cabinet said she had become 'twisted and embittered' since her departure from Downing Street. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, echoed that sentiment with a reminder that it was Lady Thatcher who had taken sterling into the ERM: 'How can a former prime minister come along and attack her successor about a decision in which she was the senior partner?' He was joined by Mr Heseltine who reminded the former prime minister she had taken Britain further into Europe: 'She had to make the lonely decisions in power. And every time she had to make them she took us deeper and further into Europe.' Sir Edward Heath, another former Tory prime minister, spoke more bluntly: 'She hates Europe, she hates all Europeans.' Sir Edward also called for the resignation of three unnamed members of the cabinet for failing to endorse fully Mr Major's pro-Maastricht stance. Earlier Mr Heseltine had confronted critics of Maastricht at the conference in an effortlessly barnstorming speech which won him an enthusiastic ovation from grassroots activists. Insisting that membership of the Community was in Britain's 'national self-interest' he warned of the threat to inward investment and the City of London if Britain left the mainstream of Europe. 'If you want to hand that over to the Germans and the French, all you have to do is see us marginalised on the periphery of Europe.' Mr Lamont, one of the least enthusiastic Europeans in the cabinet, joined the defence of Maastricht by rejecting suggestions that it was a blueprint for a federal Europe. He emphasised that the treaty not only enshrined the principle of 'subsidiarity' or minimum interference by the European Commission, but also set out a framework of intergovernmental co-operation.

It was  attended by members of government; leaders of republican  departments, holding companies, heads of regional  administratrions, and of Almaty and Leninsk; chairmen of  territorial committees for state property; and heads of regional  missions of the National Bank. Under discussion were results of  socioeconomic development of the republic in 1993 and plans for  this year's economic policy.    Opening the session, Prime Minister Sergey Tershchenko said  that the country needs to introduce qualitatively new economic  transformations. He went on to note that the government will  pursue the policy of supressing inflation, stabilizing the  economy, and creating an institution of private ownership.  Everything will be dictated by these main tasks. The minister  of economy and the first deputy prime minister, Kazhegeldin,  presented reports. It was stressed that in 1993, stabilization  of the economy was not achieved. The situation in the economy  was characterized by a further fall of production and a decline  in the living standards of the population as well as the general  instability of economic activity. [passage omitted]    In 1993, agricultural production fell by 9.8 percent, while  construction and assembly work fell by 25 percent. The  sky-rocketing prices for consumer goods led to a decline in  people's living standards. Their annual index made up 2,265  percent. At the same time prices for food increased by 23  percent, consumer goods by 18 percent, and services provided to  the population by 41 percent. The production of the main types  of food decreased as follows: Meat by 12.6 percent, sugar by  36.1 percent, margarine by 48 percent and vegetable oil by 25.4  percent. The participants at the meeting spoke after hearing  the reports.    President Nursultan Nazarbayev summarized the results of the  discussion. He named the specific reasons for decline in  production. It depends not only on disrupted ties with  neighboring partners but also on the bad performance of economic  and management bodies.    According to the president the situation in the economy of  the republic is improving. The most noticeable change in this  improvement took place last December. We have to analyze the  reasons for this. At the same time we need to have a clear  picture of the enteprises which are lagging behind. This year  will definetely be a difficult and tough year. But we have  every reason to believe that we can organize our work so as to  stop falling into economic abyss. Such a clear-cut and precise  line of government policy should be mandatorial this year. It  should concentrate its efforts on this.    The Cabinet of Ministers adopted a relevant agreement on the  issues discussed.</p>

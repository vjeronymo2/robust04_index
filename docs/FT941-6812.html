			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Independent likely to favour all-cash MGN bid The battle for The Independent newspaper is expected to enter its final phase either today or tomorrow with the likelihood that an improved bid by the consortium which includes Mirror Group Newspapers will be recommended by the board. The improved deal, being worked on by lawyers last night, would add a full cash alternative to match or come close to MGN's existing Pounds 3.50 offer in cash and shares. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, the company that owns both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, has been determined that all institutional shareholders should have an equal chance of getting out of the company. Although Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, offered Pounds 3.50 in cash for his initial 24.9 per cent stake, last week's offer from the MGN consortium still only had a cash alternative of Pounds 2.50. If the MGN consortium comes up with a full cash alternative, the non-executive directors of Newspaper Publishing will recommend the offer. The other members of the consortium are El Pais of Spain, La Repubblica of Italy and the founders of The Independent, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith Lawyers were also working last night on the precise form of guarantees of editorial independence. MGN has already said it will not vote on hiring or firing of editors and will allow the Spanish and Italian newspaper groups together to have a voting majority in the company. Under the plan now emerging, the stake of the founders would come down from 10 per cent to 3 per cent. The shares would be sold to MGN making it the second-largest shareholder with 27 per cent. El Pais and La Repubblica would each have 20 per cent. Even if the bid is recommended, Mr O'Reilly who now controls 29.9 per cent of the company could return with a higher bid but he has always said it was unlikely he would mount a full takeover.</p>

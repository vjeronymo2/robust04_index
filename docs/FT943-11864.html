			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / SIB acts over group pensions Employers who set up group personal pension schemes would be best advised to refer their employees to an independent financial adviser rather than try to advise them on the scheme's merits themselves, regulators said yesterday. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, was responding to a request from the Association of Pension Lawyers for guidance for employers. Although employers who offer traditional final-salary and money-purchase schemes have been given clearance to inform employees about scheme benefits, the picture is more vague for those who set up schemes for groups to have personal pensions with a specific life company. SIB concluded that employers who set up a group personal pension scheme need not seek authorisation to carry out investment business because they have no commercial motive in mind. If the employer receives some commission from a life insurer for doing so, however, or receives a reduction of the premium on a general insurance contract, the company may need to be authorised by the relevant self-regulating authority. While SIB would not consider literature explaining that a group personal pension scheme had been set up to be advertising, any other literature likely to encourage individuals to take up the offer could well be. Such literature should be prepared only by an independent financial adviser or the product provider.</p>

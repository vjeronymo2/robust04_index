			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Lead role in a power play: Michael Smith asks who will blink first, government or generators Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the UK electricity generating company, never expected an easy relationship with the government following a difficult privatisation process. 'Have no doubts . . . the government will feel happy if National Power falls flat on its face,' he wrote in the leaked draft of a speech, later amended, to managers of the Central Electricity Generating Board, the predecessor of National Power and its rival generator for England and Wales, PowerGen. The implication was that in the private sector, the generators would have few friends in the government. Four years later, another leak of Mr Baker's controversial thoughts is exacerbating a degree of current tension with the government. The disclosure on Thursday of a confidential letter from Mr Baker to Mr Michael Heseltine, industry secretary, reveals an extraordinary behind-the-scenes battle between the government and National Power and PowerGen over who should pay to rescue some of Britain's threatened coal mines. The government, having rejected most of the more radical options for increasing the market for coal - such as cutting nuclear or gas-fired electricity - is looking to the generators to solve its problems by buying larger tonnages than they want over the next five years. Mr Baker's letter, and an accompanying memorandum in which he talks of a government threat to legislate if the generators do not accede, shows that Mr Heseltine has a fight on his hands. Mr Baker has refused to buy as much coal as the government wants and thrown the ball back into Mr Heseltine's court. The response is typical for the tenacious Mr Baker. At 55, he has had an unusual career for a senior manager in the electricity industry. Most have joined the sector at an early age, often straight from university, with an engineering or technological background. Mr Baker began his career in electricity in 1979, when he was 42, and his background was far from scientific. After graduating in English from Oxford, he worked in the transport and environment ministries as a civil servant from 1961 to 1974 before setting up the Housing Corporation, a state body to provide rented housing. Some of the more narrowly focused engineers at the CEGB must have looked askance at a man who delights in the opera and bridge and who, in one week's holiday, says he can read up to 15 novels. Despite his unorthodox background Mr Baker quickly integrated himself into what one former colleague describes as an engineers' closed shop. He says he found the CEGB insensitive to shifts in public mood and after joining the board in 1980 tried to make it more outward looking. He later took charge of public relations and distinguished himself in the presentation of the board's case for building the Sizewell B nuclear station. He became corporate managing director in 1986. Within the industry he is highly regarded, even by the chairmen and chief executives of the regional electricity companies who often view former CEGB managers as remote and arrogant. 'He is not really a hands-on manager like Ed Wallis at PowerGen, partly because he doesn't have the background,' says one. 'But he can delegate and his strength is knowing how to operate in the corridors of power; how to deal with the industry regulator and the politicians.' Given his reputation for toughness, there are some in the industry who believe, probably inaccurately, that Mr Baker leaked the documents to Mr Heseltine himself. Whoever did so had a sense of style and humour, since the papers were sent anonymously to Mr Arthur Scargill, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, who is no ally of the generators. The leak prompted a great deal of concern within National Power yesterday that it could have a detrimental effect on negotiations with the government. The nub of the dispute is that the government wants the generators to take 65.5m tonnes of coal at subsidised prices in the next five years over and above the 160m tonnes they have agreed to buy over the period. The generators say they will take up to 55m tonnes extra, but 15m would have to be stockpiled, with the government paying the costs. The surprising element of the documents is Mr Baker's revelation that Mr Heseltine 'said that if we (the generators) couldn't take the additional tonnages, he would be forced to legislate'. Such a threat appears inconsistent with the prospectus for the flotation three years ago of National Power and PowerGen which said that the government 'intends that the relationship between British Coal and each of (the genera-tors) . . . should be commercially determined on an arms' length basis'. The signs are that the government wants to avoid a solution to British Coal's problems that involves primary legislation. Laws which revised the terms of the privatisation would inevitably hit the shares of the generators at a time when the government is looking to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in each company. The money is needed to reduce the growing public sector borrowing requirement possibly within the next year or two. But the government's more pressing problem is to find a publicly and politically acceptable alternative to British Coal's programme for closing 31 pits. A white paper originally scheduled for this month has been delayed because of the difficulty of finding a solution. The likelihood is that a compromise with the generators will be reached, but some analysts believe National Power and PowerGen are putting their lucrative contracts for 160m tonnes of coal at risk by trying to drive a hard bargain. If Mr Heseltine decides to enact legislation to force the generators to take the extra 65m tonnes, the deals already agreed could be affected. 'John Baker has proved an accomplished negotiator and has proved adept at staring in the eye the guy on the other side of the table,' says one. 'Maybe now is the time to blink.'</p>

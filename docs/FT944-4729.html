			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Safe deposit for funds Sir, According to your report 'Stock market bar to China pension funds' (December 1), the Chinese finance ministry is banning pension funds from investing in stock markets on the grounds that they are too risky. Instead the government is stipulating that 80 per cent of pension funds should be spent on 'safe instruments', namely treasury bonds. I seem to remember a similar rule in this country after the war. Unfortunately, due to currency debasement, the real value of UK government securities fell by about 75 per cent in the 15 years between 1946 and 1961. Quoted equities, in contrast, rose in real terms. No doubt they meant well; but the fact remains that the interference of the gentlemen in Whitehall caused very large real losses to British pensioners. I do hope these pensioners fare better. I wonder if there's a lesson here? Government officials can always offer advice to people, and I'm sure it will be gratefully received. Using the age-old maxim caveat emptor we can then choose for ourselves. But some of us don't like being told what to do.

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: WHO WILL REACH 1,000 IN 1990 RAM BACKFIELD?  </P> <P> The arrival in the Tonga islands of the copra boat, bearing mail, supplies and  surprises from the outside world, is an occasion sparking excitement among the  villagers.  </P> <P> They wonder eagerly what new and heart-swelling treasures the vessel calling at  their port will bring that day.  </P> <P> Those who follow the Los Angeles Rams think in such terms, asking, with a  tingle of fire, what halfback will the boat unload this year to run 1,000 yards  or more?  </P> <P> Unfailingly, someone runs for 1,000 yards or more for the Rams -- Eric  Dickerson, Charlie White, Greg Bell. Tucked into the inventory this time are  Cleveland Gary, Curt Warner, Gaston Green. Whoever among the three is selected  to run with the football is bound to gain the standard Ram yardage, because the  system is set up to facilitate it.  </P> <P> "Why do you work up such a foam over the running game?" a visitor inquires of  John Robinson, field commander of the force that calls itself Los Angeles while  dwelling not even in the same county.  </P> <P> Parenthetically, it can be noted here that Genoa salami doesn't always come  from Genoa, either.  </P> <P> "Running is the single most important element in the game," Robinson explains.  "However you care to break down football, it is a street fight. And the running  game is the basic method for inflicting your will on the other guy. You are  delivering, in effect, body blows that will wear him down physically, leading  to wearing him down mentally."  </P> <P> Obviously, Robinson doesn't minimize the forward pass, considering the skill of  the man he commissioned to throw, Jim Everett, and the speed of those who  receive, Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson.  </P> <P> "But passing can be good some days and not so good others," Robinson says.  "Running is still your most consistent way to advance the ball. It is  uncomplicated. We don't see ourselves as scientists."  </P> <P> Enlisted to run for the Rams, Dickerson fled to Indianapolis. White entered dry  dock. And Bell arranged a trade to the Raiders, explaining that the Rams  offered love, but little money.  </P> <P> The Raiders offered Marcus Allen to the Rams for a certain defensive performer,  but the Rams passed. Whether they passed because they didn't want to give up  the defensive player or didn't want to pay Allen the $1.1 million his contract  demands isn't known.  </P> <P> But not famous for lavish spending, the Rams are a marvel of football, winning  with players complaining chronically that they are on bread and water.  </P> <P> Since Robinson has nothing to do with the payroll, but must turn out omelets  with the eggs he gets, one would have to decorate him for landing in the  playoffs six of the seven years he has served the club.  </P> <P> Now embarked on a new season with a troupe that leaves today for Berlin to  engage Kansas City next Saturday, Robinson is eager to look at those  auditioning for the No. 1 post as Ram running back this year.  </P> <P> Two of the contenders, Green and Gary, are first-round picks of earlier drafts.  Warner, 29, is recycled, having logged seven years at Seattle while sustaining  his share of wounds.  </P> <P> Whoever the principal runner is going to be, Ram supporters are assuming he  will follow the line of succession, knocking off his 1,000 or more yards.  </P> <P> OK, they are explaining their ground game to fans in Berlin, who listen  respectfully, pointing out that the system was set up for the Wehrmacht to move  on the ground, too, whether it was under Von Moltke, Von Rundstedt, or Rommel.  </P> <P> As you possibly know, the Ram exhibition will be played at Olympic Stadium in  Berlin, built for the Games of 1936, at which Jesse Owens won four gold medals.  </P> <P> It often has been reported that Jesse earned his four golds in the presence of  a lip-biting Adolf Hitler, which is only partly true.  </P> <P> Hitler bit his lips but wasn't there to do it for all of Owens' events. On  certain days, Adolf would appear in what was called the "loge of honor" but  leave early, no doubt to beat the traffic.  </P> <P> It would follow, a half-century later, that Laker fans would emulate the  chancellor, who hasn't been seen around Berlin for a long time, but maybe will  call, asking for two on the 50 to the Ram game.  </P> <P> Like most people asking for two on the 50, he will say, "Look, I want to pay  for 'em."  </P></p>

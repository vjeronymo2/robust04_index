			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Sharif offers an olive branch to the opposition MR Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, restored to power by the Supreme court last Wednesday, has intensified his efforts to establish political peace. Mr Sharif began a new campaign this week when he extended an olive branch to Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, offering to end all past rivalries. Such a gesture was inconceivable even three months ago in view of their intense, bitter and acrimonious rivalry. In a speech to a special session of parliament, Mr Sharif turned to Ms Bhutto and said, 'let us sit across the table to discuss the issues facing the country and to end confrontation between the government and the opposition.' While indirectly accusing Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the President who sacked his government, for encouraging government-opposition rifts, Mr Sharif immediately set up a three member ministerial committee to hold discussions with opposition leaders. In response Ms Bhutto said, 'I have nothing personally against you, and if you want to remove this tension and acrimony I fully support you.' She is expected to demand fresh elections, withdrawal of court cases against herself and other opposition leaders, and assurances that her supporters will not be victimised. The latest offer from the government is seen as an important sign of flexibility in the Sharif camp, which could lay the foundation for a more tolerant political environment. But Mr Sharif remains under pressure after two of the four provincial assemblies have been dissolved since last Friday, widely seen as a move from the president's camp to intensify pressure on Mr Sharif's federal government. Despite Mr Sharif's latest gesture to the opposition, it is also not clear if his latest efforts to establish a government-opposition working relationship will in fact be successful. That is especially so, because the opposition's demand for fresh elections is unlikely to be accepted by the Sharif camp. Some officials expect a final compromise to emerge on the basis of ministerial slots being given to members of Ms Benazir Bhutto's PDA (People's Democratic Alliance), in the federal government as well as the Southern province of Sindh. However, the end result of the government-opposition negotiations could be different from expectations before discussions actually begin. Mr Sharif's latest political troubles have become more complex due to the country's economic problems. Pakistan's annual budget which is likely to be announced within the next two weeks, is widely expected to close the current fiscal year with one of the largest deficits in the country's history. The political uncertainty has only made it more difficult for the government to introduce new revenue raising measures such as increase in gas and electricity tariffs, fearing public unrest, senior officials say.</p>

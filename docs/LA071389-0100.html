			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTRO SEEKS TALKS WITH U.S. TO JOIN 'COMMON BATTLE' ON DRUG SMUGGLING  </P> <P> Cuban President Fidel Castro has asked for talks with the United States to help  combat drug smuggling, but the State Department said Wednesday it is too early  to assess the overture.  </P> <P> In a speech broadcast Tuesday on Cuban television, Castro said: "We have to  arrange a form of communication between the United States and Cuba in this  common battle. The United States knows that they (the drug smugglers) simply  laugh when ordered to land. We really have to discuss how to manage such  things."  </P> <P> Washington has previously said that aircraft and seagoing vessels have eluded  U.S. agents by entering Cuba's territorial waters or airspace. The island  nation sits in the middle of some of the primary drug routes into the United  States.  </P> <P> Castro said illegal overflight of Cuban territory "is intolerable and we cannot  allow them (drug dealers) to make a mockery of our airspace."  </P> <P> "We have never fired at a plane because it could be a drug trafficker, or it  could be a journalist or a U.S. senator who has gone astray or it could be a  private individual who refuses to obey the order to land in what U.S.  propaganda has painted as hell," he added.  </P> <P> While not responding directly to Castro's proposal for talks, State Department  spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that Washington is "monitoring Cuba's  narcotics interdiction efforts carefully. But it's too early to assess the  impact of developments in Cuba on our narcotics policy."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GANG OF '65;  </P> <P> 25 YEARS LATER, QUESTIONS ON TOM WOLFE'S ACCURACY REMAIN. BUT SOME OF HIS PUMP  HOUSE BOOK HAS PROVED PROPHETIC.  </P> <P> With a smile that slid into an easy laugh, Jackie Haddad Hellingson recalled  that free-frolicking beach summer of '65 when her gang of bronze-skinned  teen-agers waged war against The Outsiders.  </P> <P> Yeah, those were the crazy times when every day seemed to last a year and the  surf-wompers, sun-lovers and rock 'n' roll kids staked out the Windansea Beach  in La Jolla like it was their own back yard -- because it was.  </P> <P> Back then, The Enemy drove huge gas-guzzlers with out-of-state plates. They  were overweight mommy-hubbies who invaded the beach like an army of clammy  white cadavers, carrying every piece of paraphernalia imaginable -- tanning  oil, folding chairs, portable grills and chicken sandwiches. And those  umbrellas.  </P> <P> In the confounding months of early Vietnam and the Watts riots, 40 lean and tan  native Southern California teens decided to draw the line against The Outside  World.  </P> <P> So they invented The Hood Check. The Hang-Out. And The Stare.  </P> <P> A dozen at a time, they would lollygag on the concrete steps near the old pump  house, their legs spraddled, setting up a Cadaver Obstacle Course to block  older people from the beach. When Outsiders went for a swim, the teens would  eat the lunches right off their beach blankets.  </P> <P> They would stop the big tourist cruisers in the middle of the street for phony  oil checks. And then walk off laughing, leaving the hood up.  </P> <P> Or they would just fix strangers with a sort of Zombie Stare -- cold enough to  turn back almost any Outsider.  </P> <P> That's when the gang met The Ice Cream Man. Mr. Outsider Himself.  </P> <P> He wore a doubled-breasted seersucker suit and a white tie looped into this  incredibly tiny knot. And he wore sneakers, along with this skyscraper top hat  and walking cane -- at the beach!  </P> <P> He was a New York writer named Tom Wolfe. And he wanted to do a story about The  Kids. And about this new and youthful social rebellion he saw taking place on  the shore at Windansea.  </P> <P> "Most of us thought he was a geek," Hellingson recalled. "Some people thought  he was a narc because of the oddball way he dressed. Some of the surfers  refused to cooperate with him. I mean, back then, nobody had ever heard of Tom  Wolfe."  </P> <P> Twenty-five years later, both the writer and his story about the kids at  Windansea Beach have achieved literary stature. "The Pump House Gang," written  in the pyrotechnic prose of his "new journalism," helped establish Wolfe as one  of the most prominent social critics of his generation.  </P> <P> As for the Pump House Gang . . . .  </P> <P> Some have responsible jobs and children of their own. Others are in jail. Or in  drug rehab clinics. Or dead. Still others just disappeared.  </P> <P> Recently, a half-dozen members of the old gang discussed how their lives have  turned since that summer of '65. Some expressed remaining doubts over the scope  and accuracy of the story that came to represent an entire generation of  Southern California youth.  </P> <P> And they talked about the new relationships each has forged with the beach,  their old stomping grounds.  </P> <P> Even as members of the Older Generation, they insist they haven't turned into  the very Outsiders they once sought to ban from their surfside paradise.  </P> <P> For Tom Wolfe, the Pump House Gang represented something new and different in  the American culture of the mid-1960s -- a youth society based on beer busts,  the rolling ocean waves and a segregated beach where being old was definitely  out.  </P> <P> Amazed at these goings-on, Wolfe produced a two-part article -- "The New Life  Out There" -- that originally appeared in New York's Sunday Herald Tribune  Magazine and later as "The Pump House Gang" in a book of his stories.  </P> <P> The way Wolfe saw it, the middle and upper-class kids who hung around the  salmon-pink La Jolla water system pump house represented the earliest version  of a rebellious surfer subculture that would grow to enormous proportions in  the years to come.  </P> <P> But there was a darker side to the story. Wolfe wrote about teen-agers afraid  to grow old. Like the young couple who decided to commit suicide at the pump  house steps rather than face, as Wolfe wrote, "the horror age of 25, the horror  dividing line."  </P> <P> And the author had a prediction for the rest of his Pump House Gang. One day,  he wrote, they would become prisoners of their own society. They would become a  graying generation of beach bums.  </P> <P> "Pretty soon," Wolfe concluded, "the California littoral will be littered with  these guys, stroked out on the beach like beached white whales, and girls, too,  who can't give up the mystique, Oh Mighty Hulking Sea, who can't conceive of  living any other life."  </P> <P> When Wolfe's piece was first published, most of the Windansea surfers say they  felt betrayed by the caricatured figures in the story. Soon afterward, someone  scrawled a graffiti message on the pump house wall: "Tom Wolfe is a dork."  </P> <P> Even today, some harsh feelings remain.  </P> <P> While they concede that some of their contemporaries have become the graying  beach bums Wolfe envisioned, those who managed to escape that youthful culture  don't feel much like beached whales. They're holding down solid jobs and are  proud of their accomplishments.  </P> <P> "Even to this day, I feel used by the way I was portrayed in that story -- Tom  Wolfe's little social experiment," said 49-year-old Gary Watkins, immortalized  in the story for his freewheeling overnight sojourn into the midst of the Watts  riots in a VW van -- a trip he and friends made for kicks.  </P> <P> "It was like he was saying, 'Watch out Gary, you're going to be old one day,  too.' Well, I'm no beached whale."  </P> <P> Today, Watkins lives in Pacific Beach with his wife and son. And he works at a  UC San Diego maintenance garage.  </P> <P> "I still go to the beach to body surf and Boogie board," he said. "But the  place doesn't rule my life. So, you see, you were wrong, Tom Wolfe."  </P> <P> At 13, Vicki Bellardo was the youngest member of Wolfe's Pump House gang. Now  she teaches Spanish and journalism at Madison High School in Clairemont. And  she can't forget, either.  </P> <P> For Bellardo, the Pump House Gang story was more fiction than fact. Like other  pump house gang members, she recalls that Wolfe spent only two or three days  hanging out with the kids to research his story.  </P> <P> Wolfe never accompanied any of them home -- they never would have let him,  Bellardo said. He just asked lots of questions. Many kids gave him made-up  answers, she added. The rest, she said, he made up himself.  </P> <P> There was a toga party described in the story. None of the members said they  could recall it. And there was made-up language such as the teens calling  tourists "Panthus," a reference to Black Panthers for the black socks and  sandals they often wore.  </P> <P> "He made us something we weren't," Bellardo said. "He embellished on things to  make our lives sound almost mythic. We were just a bunch of kids having fun."  </P> <P> Wolfe declined to be interviewed for this story. In an interview following his  first return to the pump house several years ago, however, the author described  his preoccupation with the La Jolla beach scene.  </P> <P> "The thing that fascinated me was this whole age-segregation thing," he said.  "California was the first place where I had seen communes of people segregated  by age. These kids forming their own society, some living in garages away from  their parents, fascinated me."  </P> <P> Bellardo doesn't recall any teen-agers sleeping in rented garages. In fact,  most kids -- especially her and her older sister, Liz -- often had to slip out  of the house to show up at the pump house.  </P> <P> "We had curfews. Our parents would have killed us if they knew we were hanging  out at that beach," she recalled. "It was that way for a lot of the kids. But  you wouldn't know it from reading the story. We were supposed to be out  starting some sort of revolution."  </P> <P> But, after all these years, other Pump House Gang members see the story through  more tolerant eyes.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Derks, Vicki's older sister, was the pump house teen-ager who  fascinated Wolfe with her "Liz styles": "hulking rabbit-fur vest and  black-leather boots over her Levi's, even though it is about 85 out here and  the sun is plugged in up there like God's own dentist lamp."  </P> <P> Elizabeth Derks had a short career as an actress in New York and Paris, but now  runs a rural Wisconsin saloon with her husband, and sings in a rock band.  </P> <P> "It's funny, but after all these years have made me older and wiser, I  sometimes stop and think 'Yeah, maybe we did do all those strange things.' And  I still think it's wild that some famous writer made a big deal out of our  group. Or else nobody would be even talking about us today.  </P> <P> "The way I look at it, Tom Wolfe put us all on the map."  </P> <P> All around La Jolla these days, you can still see them: T-shirts and bumper  stickers carrying the logo of the Mac Meda Destruction Co.  </P> <P> Mac Meda was a resilient image in Tom Wolfe's paean to the rebellious kids of  Windansea Beach. The very first scene of the story describes the kids sitting  on the pump house steps, jeering Outsiders with an insider's code word.  </P> <P> "Mee-dah," they said in a "real fakey deep voice." As in Mac Meda.  </P> <P> In "The Pump House Gang," Wolfe describes the Mac Meda Destruction Co. as an  "underground society . . . mainly something to bug people with and organize  huge beer orgies with."  </P> <P> A quarter-century later, Jack Macpherson still laughs at the little joke  invented by a couple of surfers nicknamed "Mac" and "Meda" that the press and  police somehow turned into an entire cult to symbolize the youth rebellion of  the 1960s.  </P> <P> Macpherson was part of the older beach crowd that hung around the parking lot  at Windansea Beach, just down the way from the kids at the pump house. But he  nonetheless had an effect on their lives, on the myth of the gang.  </P> <P> Mac's roommate, Bob Rakestraw, liked to go to the zoo on weekends and have  stare-downs with Albert the Gorilla. And he liked to break things -- doors,  park benches, anything he could get his hands on. But he never used profanity.  Instead, when angry, he would croak out the word "Meda." So, Rakestraw became  Meda.  </P> <P> One night, over beers, Mac and Meda came up with the idea for a phony  destruction company, complete with business cards and T-shirts stenciled with  red spray paint.  </P> <P> La Jolla was a pretty small beach scene back then. Word got around.  </P> <P> Pretty soon, every kid in La Jolla had to have a Mac Meda T-shirt. They adorned  their cars with Mac Meda bumper stickers showing an expanding nuclear cloud.  They flashed Mac Meda "Get Out of Jail Free" cards.  </P> <P> For members of the teen-age Pump House Gang, Mac Meda became a code word for  beer bash -- usually held in isolated canyons east of La Jolla, in the  then-undeveloped Sorrento Valley and Penasquitos Canyon.  </P> <P> Once, scores of La Jolla teen-agers gathered around a rickety barn that had  been condemned. They built a campfire and drank beer and wine coolers, Liz  Derks recalled. They listened to tapes of the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob  Dylan, the Dave Clark Five and Jimi Hendrix.  </P> <P> And then they used Jeeps, rocks and sledgehammers to tear down the barn.  </P> <P> Today, the spirit of Mac Meda is carried on by Doug Moranville, a Windansea  surfer who still prints the T-shirts -- adorned with gorilla mascot Albert  MacMeda -- in a tiny industrial garage near downtown La Jolla.  </P> <P> And the stickers have become a form of 1990s graffiti, placed not only on cars  and mailboxes and not only throughout La Jolla, but in bars and at bus stops  throughout the world. Put there by people who remember.  </P> <P> Vicki Bellardo thinks Tom Wolfe should have written an epilogue to his story  about the California teen rebellion and the kids who "float right through the  real world, but it can't touch them."  </P> <P> Wolfe's story, Bellardo says, didn't account for the burgeoning drug scene that  was just then overshadowing the Pump House Gang. "That wasn't a glamorous era,"  she said. "Actually, it was sort of sad."  </P> <P> By the time Wolfe's magazine story appeared in February, 1966, the Pump House  Gang was attending the funeral of a member felled by a heroin overdose. And  there would be more.  </P> <P> "A lot of people died, or they got strung out," Bellardo said. "There were  suicides. A lot of others ended up in jail."  </P> <P> People like Tom Coman. The 16-year-old who lived in a rented garage in Wolfe's  story has since spent his life in and out of jail. He has been tried and  acquitted of murder. He has been convicted of burglary. And, in 1979, he was  labeled a narcotics addict and sent to the California Rehabilitation Center in  Norco.  </P> <P> This fall, he was jailed for burglary in Los Angeles. Now, neither his family  nor friends know where he is. And they don't want to know.  </P> <P> Vicki Bellardo understands the gnashings of some of her old pals who never  escaped the beach. There just came a time, she said, when you had to break from  that scene. Or else it broke you.  </P> <P> "If you didn't get out young, you weren't going to get out," she said.  </P> <P> Vicki got out. Today, she lives with her infant son in a La Jolla house she  bought from her parents. She keeps that old pump house rebel style, though. A  few years ago, she built her own Harley Davidson from the ground up -- and  still occasionally drives it to her teaching job.  </P> <P> "You had to cut your ties, or you were going to get into trouble."  </P> <P> So, maybe Tom Wolfe was right after all.  </P> <P> "He was pretty sharp," said John K. Weldon, 42, now an aircraft worker near San  Luis Obispo. "I know some people still living on the beach in La Jolla. They're  guys in their late 30s, still hanging in the same parking lot, living at home,  waiting for their mothers and fathers to die.  </P> <P> "It's pretty sad, but for some people his prediction came true. They're beached  whales, that's really what they are."  </P> <P> Little Jackie Haddad became a character in Tom Wolfe's vision of the Southern  California youth rebellion, with a naive high school essay about her first  surfing experience.  </P> <P> She called it "My Ultimate Journey." And it described how she and a boyfriend  -- inspired by some classic surfer films -- went down to "the cold, wet, soggy  sand of Windansea early on a December morning."  </P> <P> Wolfe featured the entire essay in his pump house story, the tale of "two kids,  a 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, (who) go out to Windansea at dawn,  cold as hell, and take on 12-foot waves all by themselves."  </P> <P> Today, Jackie Haddad Hellingson is a real estate broker and mother of two, who  married a surfer named Ken whom she met at the pump house back then. The couple  and their 17-year-old son live in La Jolla's Muirlands area -- not far from  Windansea Beach.  </P> <P> Ken, a carpenter, still has the Mac Meda tattoo on his left arm. Jackie still  has that essay tucked away in a notebook somewhere.  </P> <P> But she gave up surfing long ago. Now she's busy with a career and a family --  especially keeping pace with Tyler, her teen-aged son who says he's the new  generation Pump House Gang.  </P> <P> These days, Jackie still goes to the beach at Windansea. But now it's just to  think, take evening walks and watch the peaceful winter sunsets. And,  sometimes, just to remember the freedom.  </P> <P> "It was the simplicity of the beach -- of not having to make decisions," she  said. "You didn't have to plan, things just came up. As an adult, it's not  quite the same."  </P> <P> Her home is still a gathering spot for teen-agers. Kids say they can talk to  her. She isn't bothered by the changes of the youth culture that come in fits  and starts -- the length of a boy's hair or the way teen-age girls dress.  </P> <P> She's not an Outsider.  </P> <P> On a recent weekday morning, sharing the old pump house steps with a defiant  sea gull, she silently surveyed the roaring surf. "Wow, good womp today!" she  said.  </P> <P> But she slips now and then. She stops thinking and acting like the young  hipster of her past and starts acting, well, like a parent.  </P> <P> Such as the other day, when she was talking with Tyler about the limited access  to a beach near their home. "And, before I caught myself, I was saying that  something permanent should be done so more people could get to the beach."  </P> <P> Tyler gave his mother The Stare.  </P> <P> "Oh no, not that," he said. "Don't you understand? We want the beach to  ourselves."  </P></p>

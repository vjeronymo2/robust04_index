			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Eastern banks back Ecu trade system THE central banks of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary yesterday pledged support for a new banking payments system for trade among east European nations. The system would use as a common currency the Ecu, the basket of the main west European currencies. It has been proposed by the Ecu Banking Association, a group of west European banks, and would be based on an existing Ecu bank-payments operation in Switzerland. Officials from the central banks of the four countries were at a meeting in Turin to discuss the concept. Three west European banks - Deutsche Bank of Germany, Credit Lyonnais of France and San Paolo Bank of Italy - have said they will help the initiative. The east European nations are to discuss the system further over the next few months. Assuming details such as legal and technical issues and problems over lines of credit can be sorted out, the venture is likely to be controlled by a group of banks from eastern Europe.</p>

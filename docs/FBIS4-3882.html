			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said today that he was optimistic about the prospects of  the country's social, political and economic situation.    In an interview with the German magazine "DER SPIEGEL",  Yeltsin voiced his confidence that the signing of a memorandum  of the civic peace accord scheduled for Thursday would provide a  basis for a civic consensus in Russia.    The civic peace accord was proposed by Yeltsin in late  February following a political amnesty, under which his main  opponents including former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and  former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov were released.    The draft accord has been "fundamentally amended" since  Yeltsin consulted with the leaders of political parties and  various republics or regions, according to the presidential  chief-of-staff Sergey Filatov.    Yeltsin said that the economy could be stabilized in 1994.  In the past two months inflation had stood at eight to 10  percent, much lower than in the same period last year, and the  decline in production slowed down and the budget deficit shrank,  he said.    Meanwhile, Yeltsin said whether he would run in the 1996  presidential election would depend on how the situation will  develop, but for now he would stick to his earlier decision not  to participate.    "If I see that the situation improves in Russia, I will be  able to leave with clear conscience and raised head..if the  difficulties are not overcome, then it will be necessary to  think everything over with regard to a new situation.  Meanwhile, I stick to my earlier decision," he said.    He said that neither Rutskoy nor "ultra-nationalist"  Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy would have a chance to become the president. But  he expressed deep concern about a possible vacuum in the top  leadership.    He said he is trying to find out who will be serious  contenders for presidency in 1996.    Yeltsin said he would not put his "presidential party" in a  special place because "the president should be responsible for  the whole nation instead of the supporters of his party".    Yeltsin also talked about the situation in Bosnia. He said  that air strikes can only make the situation worse and the war  endless. He called for peace negotiations in solving the Bosnian  conflict.    Asked about his attitude towards NATO's "partnership for  peace" plan, Yeltsin said that it is a "specific proposal",  although "some things have yet to be cleared up".    He said that Russia, which has "an army as big as NATO", was  ready to sign the document. But he would also like to sign an  additional protocol with NATO to settle "a whole range of key  issues".    There are also technical problems, including different  weapons systems which need to be unified, he added.    Yeltsin believed that Russia would always be a great power,  as demonstrated in its tradition, history and culture.</p>

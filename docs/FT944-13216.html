			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese electronics Japan's electronics industry is enjoying a good year. Yesterday's first-half results from a batch of the largest groups - NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric - were not only much improved on the first half of 1993; in most cases, they comfortably exceeded expectations. But the overall progress hides two rather different stories: profits from the 'upstream' components businesses, notably semiconductors, raced ahead; but there was continuing disappointment in the 'downstream' markets, particularly audio-visual products. The upstream business is being driven by the explosion in sales of personal computers, especially in the US. Worldwide demand for chips should continue to grow strongly next year with the shift to more memory-hungry programs and multimedia gadgetry. Because of high operational gearing, the increase in demand has a disproportionately large effect on industry profits. Downstream, the outlook is less bright. Demand for consumer electronics products inside Japan is slack, prices are depressed and the industry is suffering competition from cheap imports. The progress upstream more than compensates for the disappointment downstream. The quality of earnings from semiconductors is high: chip prices are fairly firm and the competitive advantage of Japanese industry in the memory chip market looks sustainable in the medium term. The one concern is that the industry was so keen not to repeat the 1980s mistake of over-investing in new chip capacity that it may now be unable to satisfy the soaring demand.</p>

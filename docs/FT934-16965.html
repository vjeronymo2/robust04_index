			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Tokyo plans cuts in import barriers: Proposals will be in line with Hosokawa's drive to scrap costly regulations THE JAPANESE government is expected to unveil on Thursday proposals to reduce import barriers, in response to growing pressure from foreign trade partners and domestic industry. The proposals are the work of an advisory panel which is chaired by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and which includes officials from the central bank, Japan's export-import bank and the Keidanren business federation. According to details leaked to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun business newspaper, the proposals include tax incentives to encourage more foreign companies to invest in Japan, where existing overseas investors have been big importers. A government inquiry into non-tariff barriers, such as attempts by Japanese businesses to squeeze out competition, is also expected. The newspaper said other proposals included the abolition of tariffs and import curbs where they served only to protect local industries, and a review of public procurement to make it more open to foreign competitors. This is in line with Mr Hosokawa's strategy of scrapping costly official regulations, to improve economic growth potential at a time when Japan is facing its worst recession in 20 years. The latest measures will be welcomed by business lobbies even though they would, if effective, increase competition in the short term. Big business groups like the Keidanren believe any attempt to reduce the record current account surplus will help curb the rise of the yen, which has driven most Japanese export operations into loss this year. Japan's current account surplus hit Dollars 117.55bn (Pounds 78bn), or 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product, last year and is estimated to be heading towards 4 per cent in 1993. Like Mr Hosokawa's other deregulation plans the latest proposals would, if turned into specific measures, be challenged by entrenched interests in the public administration and parts of industry that would suffer. The latest example of the strains imposed by the yen's rise came over the weekend when Mitsubishi Motors, the vehicle group, was reported to be planning increased production of small leisure trucks in Thailand, in search of lower production costs. It currently assembles 24,000 one-tonne trucks a year at a joint venture in Thailand, using imported parts. NHK public television said Mitsubishi would start to build up full production there, using locally made parts, from the middle of next year and import trucks from Thailand to Japan. That would make Mitsubishi the first of the six Japanese automotive groups with truck plants in Thailand to begin imports to Japan.</p>

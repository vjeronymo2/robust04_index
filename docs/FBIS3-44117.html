			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Newspapers in Malawi are stepping up the pressure on  the government to set up a commission of inquiry into the deaths  of three ministers and an MP 10 years ago. The campaign to  establish the exact circumstances in which the ministers died  has taken off since the referendum on multiparty democracy last  year. The government says it was a simple car accident, but  last week the issue was in the headlines again when a retired  policeman confessed that he had been involved. Today, the  opposition MALAWI DEMOCRAT newspaper also jumped onto the band  wagon, saying it has talked to a former political prisoner who  saw the four men just hours before they disappeared. On the  line to Lilongwe, Robin White asked the paper's editor Charles  Simango how far they were getting with their campaign to  establish a commission of inquiry.    [Begin recording] [Simango] We think we are making progress.  The information is there -- most of it -- but the problem now is  to get documented evidence, but the people who were actually  involved are speaking up now. Most of them have been retired,  of course, some top officials who actually gave the orders,  about two, they have died. One of them died about five years  ago, that was one of the top police officials.    [White] And he is dead?    [Simango] Yes, he is dead.    [White] And what you want to happen next?    [Simango] Well, the business can be done at the moment  [words  indistinct] just to see this commission of inquiry put into  place. I think after it has come into place, I think, you know,  evidence can start rolling out, and after that people will know  the truth. People still believe, we believe as journalists as  well, that it wasn't an ordinary accident, so what matters is  knowing the truth, but as long as there isn't that commission of  inquiry, everything we are hearing is not official.    [White] Now, the latest thing that you printed in your  newspaper is the story of a former detainee who claimed that he  saw these four dead ministers in detention the night before.    [Simango] Yes, Machipisa Munthali last week testified to  this  newspaper that he was given clothes belonging to the late Dick  Matenje. The guard who gave him the clothes told him that the  three ministers and one member of Parliament had been detained  overnight at Mikuyo prison, and at that time they had been  released. So, the late Dick Matenje had left these clothes  behind, which the guard decided to give Machipisa Munthali to  use, since he has been in prison for quite a long time, he has  served 29 years. So, Machipisa had no choice, he used the  clothes for about two years although they were oversized.    [White] So, he wore the clothes of one of the dead people?    [Simango] Yes.    [White] How far is your newspaper using all this just to try  and embarrass the government?    [Simango] Well, if it was just trying to embarrass the  goverment, I think this could be the least that we could go for,  there are worse things.    [White] How do you mean?    [Simango] Well, this is just one of the incidents. It so  happens that the people who died here were top government  officials, you know, three cabinet ministers and one member of  parliament. Well, that is bad enough, but people have  disappeared, we know of people with no names, hundreds of them,  they have just disappeared. We have letters, we receive letters  here, others newspapers too, that so and so disappeared in 1972,  so and so disappeared here, and up to this time we still find  people that have been found, say, in rivers; you know, bundled  into sack. You find a dead body in a river up to this point.    [White] But to what extent are you acting? Like a newspaper,  investigating or to what extent? Are you acting as an organ for  the opposition?    [Simango] I think the line there is very clear. We don't  politicize this, we don't. [end recording]</p>

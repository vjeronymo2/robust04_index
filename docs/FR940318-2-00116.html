These students are to be involved in a year-round program designed to expose them to the various primary care fields through on-site and community experiences, provide them with necessary prerequisite skills in mathematics, science and communication (i.e., reading, writing, and oral skills), and stimulate and reinforce their interest in their own health and in providing care in underserved communities. The students are to continue with the project each year, participating in age-appropriate activities as they advance through secondary school. It is anticipated that the level of activity will be more intense during the summer months than during the academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects are to provide activities to build participants' self-esteem; nurture the development of peer counseling skills, and the formation of a corps of peer counselors; foster the participants' interest in health care careers; impact their educational and subject choices; influence them to select a health career track;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultivate their awareness of and interest in primary care; and nurture their development into community responsive, culturally competent primary care health professionals committed to serving the underserved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

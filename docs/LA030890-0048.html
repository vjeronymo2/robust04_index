			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Hart 2, Crespi 1 -- An eighth-inning, bases-loaded walk to R. J. Simone was the  difference for the host Indians in a third-round game of the El Segundo  tournament.  </P> <P> Hart (3-0) loaded the bases against reliever Ryan Staley (0-1), who replaced  Pat Bennett after seven strong innings.  </P> <P> Bennett, a senior right-hander who was 4-8 last season, yielded only two hits  and struck out five. He tired, however, and gave way to Staley, who yielded a  bloop single to Doug Distaso, hit Lance Migita with a pitch and, after both  runners advanced on a sacrifice bunt, intentionally walked Rob Davis.  </P> <P> Staley then struck out Keith Halcovich on three pitches but walked Simone in  five.  </P> <P> Hart collected only three hits but capitalized on a costly error by left  fielder Mark Venturine on a fly ball in the fifth inning that allowed the  Indians to tie the score, 1-1.  </P> <P> "We can't hit water if we fell out of a boat," Hart Coach Bud Murray said. "But  we'll get better with the hitting."  </P> <P> Left-hander Andrew Lorraine relieved Halcovich after five innings and struck  out five en route to his second win without a loss.

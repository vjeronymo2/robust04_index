			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Letter: Merit of positive manufacturing trade balance Sir, In a detailed account just published of policy changes which have taken place since sterling's exit from the ERM, the Treasury states that, prior to this, there was a clear and unambiguous target for policy to aim at - sterling's position within its ERM bands. Now, though, the new regime is of necessity more judgmental. I have two points to make: It was not true that the unambiguous target for policy was sterling's position within its ERM bands. The unambiguous target was the reduction of inflation, and the method used was the holding of sterling's position in the ERM bands. It is not true that the new regime has to be of necessity more judgmental; indeed, it is especially important now that a new clear goal for policy is put in place. It has been heartening to see that the regeneration of manufacturing in Britain is now almost on the government's agenda, but it is too vague a goal currently stated. I suggest that what is required is a new central objective to create a positive and sustainable trade balance in manufacturing by the end of this parliament. The merit of such a target is that, as the trade balance improves, so will money market perceptions of sterling improve, in turn leading to a reduction in inflation as sterling improves.

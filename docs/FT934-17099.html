			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Good trading volume as account ends A CONFIDENT start to the final quarter of the year was restrained somewhat yesterday by the manoeuvres traditionally associated with the end of the trading account in the UK equity market. Although the stock market ended only slightly firmer on the day, stock index futures returned to a good premium against cash and a rash of corporate activity appeared to indicate underlying con-fidence. Traders identified a good volume of overseas interest. A strong opening on Wall Street, 16 Dow points up in UK hours, helped a late rally in the London market. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,039.3, a net 1.8 higher on the day. Earlier, the Footsie had struggled to hold its overnight level after early, futures-inspired, weakness had taken the Footsie down to the 3,026 area. The Footsie was also hit by a fall in BAT Industries, as London brokers on a US visit phoned their offices to downgrade the blue chip tobacco and financial services group. But oil shares continued to benefit from the Opec agreement and firmer crude prices and there were buyers for the pharmaceuticals, capital goods and financial sectors. Investors have turned away from the consumer areas, disenchanted by recent trading results from such leading names as Forte and Tesco. However, a range of brokerage re-ratings and share placings appeared to confirm that the institutions remain confident in the UK stock market outlook. At last night's close, the Footsie was just over 34 points higher on the week and also on the trading account period. Investors have been encouraged this week by the calmer news from Russia, but still seek signs that company results are reflecting economic recovery. Traders expressed confidence in market prospects for the fourth quarter. Seaq volume of 636.9m shares yesterday, of which around 56 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks, compared with 695.1m in the previous session. Retail volume of Pounds 1.61bn on Thursday was affected by end-of-quarter portfolio shuffling but also indicated a strong underlying interest from the investment institutions. Government bonds featured news of the issue of an Pounds 800m tranche of stock dated 2011. Seasoned bonds showed little change in quiet trading yesterday.</p>

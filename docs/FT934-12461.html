			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shake-up pays off at Swedish mining group TRELLEBORG, the troubled Swedish mining and metals group, said yesterday it had raised SKr900m (Dollars 111m) through the sale of its remaining shares in Svedala, the mineral processing and transport unit, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. It would raise a further SKr1.3bn through the pending sale of a 75 per cent stake in Munksjo, its paper and packaging subsidiary. The disposals are part of a restructuring to staunch a heavy flow of losses and pare its SKr10bn debt burden. The group, hit by falling world metals prices, intends to concentrate on its core mining, metals and rubber operations.</p>

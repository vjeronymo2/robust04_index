			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Miners agree wage rise South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers yesterday formally agreed on an average 9.75 per cent wage settlement for 1994-95 on behalf of 200,000 of its members , writes Mark Suzman. The agreement forestalls the possibility of a strike in the industry, the country's largest. It has been widely praised by government and business figures as an encouraging sign for renewed economic co-operation with big business in the light of the high-profile strike by 25,000 workers in the motor industry, which is now in its fourth week. The final pay settlements - which wll lead to rises of between 8 and 8.75 per cent in wages for skilled gold miners, 8 to 10 per cent for unskilled gold workers and 9.75 and 13 per cent for coal miners - are above the inflation rate, currently at 7.5 per cent. But they are well below the NUM's original demands for 12-15 per cent increases. Mr Juri Geldenhuys, president of the Chamber of Mines, said the agreement was testament to both sides' willingness to compromise.</p>

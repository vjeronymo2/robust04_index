			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Coal recommendations should not be accepted Sir, The select committee has made a brave effort to find ways of keeping miners at work when the demand for coal is falling. But when it recommends further protection for coal, it seems prepared to hurt other legitimate commercial interests. Generators which produce electricity cleanly, efficiently and at a true commercial price might expect to be competitive in the new electricity industry. Instead, if they are not beneficiaries of the new coal deal, they may well be forced out of the market. That is hardly what they expected when the government announced the electricity privatisation in its White Paper of February 1988. It promised that the new industry would be subject to competition and 'protected from fluctuating political pressures'. I hope that Mr Heseltine will take account of this when he prepares the White Paper of February 1993. David Porter, chief executive, Association of Independent Electricity Producers, Herodsfoot, Liskeard, Cornwall PL14 4QX</p>

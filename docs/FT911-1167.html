			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Improved sales in Europe lift VW turnover 10% VOLKSWAGEN, the German car group which is investing heavily in east Germany and Czechoslovakia, experienced a 10 per cent rise in turnover in the first quarter of 1991, but net profits showed only a small increase. The improved turnover of DM19bn (Dollars 11.1bn) reflected the continuing sales improvement in Germany and the rest of western Europe, though some markets such as the UK and Spain are proving difficult. At DM195m, net profits were up by 2 per cent. The pre-tax figure was 16 per cent lower at DM519m. However, Mr Dieter Ullsperger, the finance director, said income was higher before VW made heavier transfers to reserves to cover costs due later in the year. Such transfers carry tax advantages. 'The underlying business is better because of the shift in sales to the domestic market', he added. Sales in the enlarged German market were 52 per cent higher in the January-April period at 451,000 vehicles. In the whole of western Europe, they were up by 10 per cent to 858,000. Worldwide sales were also 10 per cent higher at 1.1m cars. Mr Ullsperger declined to forecast the year's profit, noting the increased strength of competition in Europe, uncertainty over currency trends - last year's D-Mark strength chipped DM700m off group sales revenues - and the fact that a new model was due later in the year. VW will introduce the next generation of the Golf, its best-selling car, this autumn, although Mr Carl Hahn, the chief executive, declined to confirm this officially. He expressed 'well-founded optimism' over the future, but said VW was worried about the 7 per cent wage settlements negotiated in the engineering industry, including cars. VW's next pay deal is due in November. Mr Hahn said a settlement of this size would speed up the rise in costs and prices. VW's overall profits in 1990 showed a 4.6 per cent rise after tax to DM1.09bn, with turnover 4 per cent higher at DM68bn. Pre-tax profits were down by 20 per cent to DM2.4bn. Unit sales passed the 3m mark, with a 3 per cent increase to 3.03m. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 18 Apr (SUNA) -- The president of the  Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, has said in a  statement to the AL-MULTAQA magazine that the government had  earlier stopped its contacts with the American ambassador  because of its indignation over his hostile statements. These  came at a time when both sides, the Government of Sudan and the  American Government, had agreed to resume their dialogue on the  basis of frankness.    It is worth, mentioning that some news agencies had quoted  the presidents statement imprecisely.</p>

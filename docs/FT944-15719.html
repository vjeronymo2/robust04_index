			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record interim profits at Kvaerner Kvaerner, Norway's second largest listed company, reported far better than expected eight-month results shortly after sounding a warning of substantial losses by the oil and gas division, which will weaken overall group performance for the full year. The group achieved record interim pre-tax profits of NKr1.02bn (Dollars 154m), up 41 per cent on last year's NKr720m, with four of Kvaerner's five business sectors showing sharp improvements, particularly shipbuilding. The eight-month result includes NKr190m in unrealised exchange gains, against NKr180m in unrealised losses last year, related to long-term financing of the group's shipping fleet. The advance came in spite of a pre-tax loss of NKr202m by the oil and gas division, reflecting cost over-runs on the North Sea Troll oil concrete floating platform construction project and provisions for future restructuring. Last year's comparative figure was a profit of NKr266m. Group sales rose 5 per cent to NKr16.73bn but operating profit slipped 8 per cent to NKr675m due to increases in operating costs and depreciation. Shipbuilding boosted operating profit by NKr251m to NKr830m as sales shot up by NKr2.01bn to NKr7.08bn. Pre-tax profit rose by NKr254m to NKr851m. Mechanical engineering posted an operating profit of NKr49m, against a loss of NKr76m, despite a NKr138m dip in sales to NKr3.22bn. Pulping saw operating profit slip by NKr15m to NKr73m, but pre-tax profit rose by NKr66m to NKr166m. Sales plunged by NKr855m to NKr1.23bn. Shipping posted an operating profit of NKr64m, against a loss of NKr40m, and returned a pre-tax profit of NKr188m compared with a loss of NKr142m as revenues rose by NKr116m to NKr833m.</p>

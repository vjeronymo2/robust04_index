			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Written Interview With ROK President Kim </F> Yong-sam by POST editor Phaisan Sicharatchanya last week ahead  of Thai Prime Minister's Chuan Likphai Visit 23 Jun]    [Text] Q: What specific issues of bilateral significance  will you raise for discussion with Thai Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai during his forthcoming visit to Seoul?    A: I will discuss with Prime Minister Chuan ways of  deepening  the ties of friendship and cooperation between the Republic of  Korea and Thailand and of promoting share prosperity in the  Asia-Pacific region.    First of all, we will focus our attention on how our two  countries should pull together to resolve the North Korean  nuclear issue, which is threatening the security of not only  this region but also of the entire world. We will also conduct  in depth discussions on ways to boost substantive bilateral  economic cooperation, especially by expanding the flow of trade,  investment and people between our two countries. Views will  also be exchanged on how to strengthen Asia-Pacific regional  cooperation, primarily through the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation forum.    Q: Where does Thailand stand in South Korea's conduct of  foreign affairs and international economic relations? How do  you envisage bilateral Korean-Thai relations to develop from now?    A: As part of its New Foreign Policy, our Government is  attaching great importance to Southeast Asia. As a key member  of ASEAN Thailand is playing a major regional role. I applaud  your countries for taking the initiative in creating the ASEAN  Free Trade Area (AFTA) and for having striven so hard to promote  stability on Indochina.    Later this year, in its capacity as the chairman of ASEAN,  Thailand will host the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional  Forum, at which a multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific security  will be conducted for the first time. I am hopeful that this  forum will greatly contribute to peace and security in this  region.    My view is that our two countries will be able to further  expand mutual ties, especially by more actively conducting  bilateral and multilateral efforts to promote regional  prosperity and security. In view of the fact that Thailand,  which occupies an important position in the ASEAN and  Indochinese economy, is continuing to grow rapidly, I believe  the importance of your country as a diplomatic and economic  partner for us is increasing faster than ever.    Just as Korea is located at the centre of Northeast Asia, so  is Thailand serving as a bridge between ASEAN and Indochina.  Accordingly, I think Thailand is an important base for Korean  businesses venturing into Indochina and Myanmar (Burma).    It is true that nowadays, our two countries are competing  against each other on the international market in a limited  range of products like garments and footwear. My view is,  however, that there is a great potential for complementary and  mutually advantageous economic interaction between our two  countries in many areas.    [Text] Furthermore, since both Korea and Thailand have  sustained a high growth rate on the strength of outward-looking  development strategies and the industriousness of their peoples,  I believe that our two countries are in a unique position to  lead economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. I hope and  expect that building on its long-standing, open-door policy for  all regardless of ideological differences Thailand will be able  to significantly contribute not only to the stability of the  Korean Peninsula but also to the stability and prosperity of  Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region in general.    Q: How do you envisage South Korea's economic relations with  ASEAN and Indochina to develop taking into account your  country's close economic ties with neighbouring countries in  Northeast Asia?    A: In the wake of the end of the Cold War, China and Vietnam  -- the major Asian socialist countries -- are rapidly emerging  as major markets for the Republic of Korea (ROK). Korean  businesses are briskly moving into those lands to combine their  technology and capital with the abundant human and natural  resources there in a complementary and mutually beneficial  fashion.    My view is that the business climate is also greatly  improving in the ASEAN countries as they continue to achieve  rapid growth, thus joining the ranks of the newly-industrialised  economies. They are also opening their markets ever wider and  intensively investing in social infrastructure. Consequently,  there now are emerging greater opportunities for the Republic of  Korea and ASEAN to develop complementary economic ties,  especially by sharing their accumulated developmental expertise  and information.    In particular, I believe it advisable for the ROK and  Thailand and other ASEAN to enter joint ventures in Vietnam and  neighbouring Indochinese countries, now that their relations  with the United States are improving and they are emerging as  attractive targets for foreign investment.    To further expand ROK-ASEAN economic cooperation, I think it  is necessary that the emerging and contemplated sub-regional  groupings, such as AFTA and EAEC (the East Asian Economic  Caucus), be open economic communities, rather than closed  trading blocs.    Q: What specific policies does South Korea intended to adopt  vis-a-vis Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos)? Does your  government intend to pursue such policies by going it alone or  in partnership with any country in ASEAN?    A: Korea normalised diplomatic relations with Vietnam in  December 1992, and will do so with Cambodia and Laos in due  course. Presently, we are contributing to the efforts of Vietnam  to rebuild its economy. We hope that we will be able to promote  economic exchanges and visits with Cambodia and Laos even prior  to the normalisation of diplomatic relations. We know that our  policies toward these countries are in line with the efforts of  ASEAN to promote the peace, stability and prosperity of the  nations in the region.    Q: Does your government have any clear-cut policy on helping  to bring about positive political and economic changes in Burma?    A: We are very interested in the development of Myanmar and  hope that it will be able to smoothly achieve democratisation as  well as economic development. It was in this context that our  Government welcomed the Myanmar Government announcement in April  1992 of the release of political prisoners along with a  timetable for democratisation.    The Korean Government has, in fact, been positively  considering offering Myanmar assistance from the Economic  Development Cooperation Fund to help promote its economic  well-being. We also plan to study ways to cooperate with other  ASEAN nations in supporting the democratic development and  economic reforms of Myanmar.    Q: What does South Korea hope to achieve from its  participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum?    A: We hope and expect that the forum will gradually build a  security regime in the Asia-Pacific region. As the forum is  comprised of nations that have had hostile relations in the  past, we believe that it should gradually build a climate of  mutual trust through free discussion of issues of mutual concern  including politics and regional security, rather than attempting  to resolve all pending issues en bloc.    We understand that the forum's initial conference will be  held in July with the participation of the foreign ministers of  18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We believe that that  meeting will be very significant as it reflects a common concern  about regional security and cooperation.    Q: What role does South Korea expect Japan to play in the  broader framework of regional security in the Asia-Pacific  region? Should Japan assume a bigger security role in areas  such as regional and international peacekeeping?    A: Now that the Cold War era is over, Japan will be able to  play a strengthened role commensurate with its economic power,  and increase its responsibility for the peace and prosperity of  the region. However, it should not be overlooked that the  unfortunate experience which the nations in the region suffered  in the past has caused Japan's neighbors to be wary about its  emergence as a major military power in the region. Therefore,  Japan should spare no effort to remove such anxiety.    Q: What specific measures do you propose to resolve the  confrontation on the Korean Peninsula? And how do you propose  to go about implementing these measures?    A: Due to increasing doubts about North Korea's nuclear  development and its withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), tension has been mounting, not only  between South and North Korea but in the international  community, which is seeking sanctions against North Korea.    There will be no easing of tension between the South and the  North as long as North Korea refuses to return to the IAEA and  settle the nuclear issue. However, if the North Korean nuclear  issue is resolved, it will be possible to promote mutual  prosperity by implementing the various South-North accords  worked out in the past. We are ready to substantially implement  all the accords by activating all those South-North joint  organisations already established or to be established by  agreement.</p>

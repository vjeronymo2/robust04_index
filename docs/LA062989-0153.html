			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EL TORO;  </P> <P> PANEL OKS BILL BARRING CIVILIAN USE OF MCAS  </P> <P> The House Armed Services Committee in Washington on Wednesday approved a  massive defense-spending plan that among other things would bar commercial  aviation at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) sponsored an amendment to the 1990  defense authorization bill that would short-circuit efforts to ease  overcrowding at John Wayne Airport by permitting commercial aviation to make  joint use of the El Toro military airfield.  </P> <P> Commercial flights from the military base have been advocated by some in Orange  County as a way to relieve overcrowding at John Wayne, and the El Toro airfield  is one of several sites under consideration by the Airport Site Coalition,  which is seeking an alternative airport in the county.  </P> <P> Passage of the authorization bill and the amendment by the full House is  virtually assured, congressional sources said. The measure would also have to  clear the Senate before it could become law.  </P></p>

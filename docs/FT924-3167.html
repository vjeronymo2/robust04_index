			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: OIS returning to market with Pounds 15m tag OIS International Inspection, the technical inspection services group, is seeking a Pounds 15m listing on the Stock Exchange because its owner, Adia - the troubled Swiss employment group - is continuing to dispose of non-core interests. The listing, scheduled for December 22 with the placing of 30m shares of 50p each, effectively marks the return of OIS to the Stock Exchange after a five-year absence. In 1988, the group was taken over by a consortium led by Mr Paul Bristol, who changed its name to Brompton Holdings, then listed it on the USM. Brompton had a chequered career and was bought by Adia for Pounds 11.7m in June 1989. Mr Malcolm Russell, managing director of OIS, said yesterday the listing was prompted by the changing focus at Adia, but the group was in a good position to go public. OIS had a wide operational base, selling its services to the construction, oil, transport and power generation industries, with customers such as Shell and British Gas. The business was driven by regulatory requirements for non-destructive testing - using ultrasonics and radiography - of installations for safety, quality and environmental purposes. Turnover improved from Pounds 27m in 1989 to more than Pounds 40m, of which 40 per cent came from the Middle East, the Far East and Africa.</p>

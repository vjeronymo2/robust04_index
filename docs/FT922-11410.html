			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Profiting from a fund for Sheps - Second-hand endowment policies A SCHEME that will enable investors, even those with small amounts of capital, to invest collectively in second-hand endowment policies (Sheps) is to be launched soon by Policy Managers Ltd, a subsidiary of Collective Investments Ltd.* Investor interest in buying existing with-profit endowments is growing apace, particularly for contracts with only a few years to maturity. And although a recent article highlighted the merits of investing in second-hand endowments, it also pointed out certain possible disadvantages, namely: Lack of flexibility in the investment. The investor has to select it from the list offered by the marketmakers. He cannot pick the exact investment period or the exact amount to be invested. Unless the investor has considerable capital, he cannot spread his investments over a period or with several life companies. The strong demand for second-hand endowments means investors have very little time to make a suitable selection. Often, they are beaten to it by others. Investments required tend to be for large amounts. There are comparatively few endowments available to small investors. Investors have to make further payments by meeting the premiums on the endowment until it matures and they get the maturity value. Stephen Jones, an executive director of Collective Investments, has designed a scheme to overcome these disadvantages and to open up the second-hand endowment market to more people. The plan is classified under the Financial Services Act as an unregulated collective investment scheme, but its structure is quite straightforward. It will operate as an open-ended fund on a unitised basis similar to an unauthorised unit trust. Investment will be via the usual method of buying and selling units. The fund will invest in second-hand endowments through the established marketmakers. Although the intention of the managers is to hold the endowments until maturity, they could be sold back to the marketmakers if conditions warrant. The managers intend to concentrate on buying endowments from around 15 selected life companies with good bonus prospects. Collective Investments will not itself be a marketmaker, thereby avoiding any conflicts of interest. Neither will it hold a box of cashed-in units. All these will be cancelled automatically and fresh units created for incoming investors. But the managers will set aside a sufficient amount of the money which has been invested to meet future premiums on the purchased endowments. In addition, the fund will hold an adequate liquidity margin in order to meet re-purchases without being forced to sell endowments. This money will be held in a separate, interest-earning account. Policy Managers is still discussing whether to operate the pricing on the usual bid/offer basis or to follow the trend in the unit trust industry and have a single pricing system. But the basic price will relate to the market value of the endowment portfolio and the cash held. Although Policy Managers will be calculating the prices itself each week, the valuation will be based on the market rates of return achieved by the Foster &amp; Cranfield auction prices. Foster &amp; Cranfield will act as adviser on the pricing and selection of endowments. The managers reserve the right to expand the margins or freeze the price if there is a very high value of redemptions within a very short period. But the managers are negotiating loan finance on the security of the underlying endowments, so that forced sales can be avoided. The operation of this fund would appear to be somewhat incestuous, with little outside monitoring. But Collective Investments, which will handle the marketing of this new scheme, is authorised by Imro (the Investment Managers Regulatory Organisation) for its mainstream business of enterprise zone trusts and limited partnerships. As such, the managers have had to submit full details of their plans to Imro for scrutiny, particularly the pricing mechanism, and discussions are continuing. Even so, as an unregulated collective investment plan, it is not covered by compensation machinery. The fund is being structured so that investors would be subject to a capital gains tax liability only on selling their holdings, against which they can offset their annual exemption - similar to the tax position on cashing-in units with unit trusts. This scheme might well be of interest to parents wishing to make gifts to their children. Normally, the income from such gifts is aggregated with the parent's income (usually that of the father) and children cannot use their tax allowances. Under this scheme, though, there is no income, so it can be gifted by parents to children. On cash-in, the child should be able to use the exemption to offset the CGT liability. Since this scheme is classified as an unregulated collective investment plan, Collective Investments can market it only through authorised intermediaries (although it can deal direct with experienced investors through customer service agreements). But, generally, potential investors applying direct to Policy Managers would be given a list of names of independent financial advisers in their locality. Being a new investment concept, it has taken considerable time to set up the scheme and obtain the necessary approval from Imro. But Collective Investments hopes to start trading within a few weeks. The intention is that people will be able to invest from Pounds 2,500 upwards. If this scheme is successful, Stephen Jones is exploring the feasibility of offering dated funds where the units would be redeemed at a certain date in the future. He has his eye on the school fee planning market. *Collective Investments, 77 London Wall, London EC2N 1BE (tel. 071-628-2828).</p>

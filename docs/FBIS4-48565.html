			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The victory of Bakili Muluzi and the United  Democratic Front [UDF] in Malawi's elections has closed the book  on 30 years of rule by Dr. Hastings Banda and the Malawi  Congress Party [MCP]. In that time, Dr. Banda ruled Malawi with  an iron grip, but he led the MCP in Tuesday's elections as their  presidential candidate. Well now, the MCP must be holding  postmortems to consider what went wrong for them at the polls.  On the line to Lilongwe, Robin White spoke to Dr. Heatherwick  Ntaba, the foreign minister of the outgoing MCP government, and  asked him if he thought they had chosen the wrong presidential  candidate.    [Begin recording] [Ntaba] No, I don't think so. That is  completely out of the question. I don't think we had the wrong  presidential candidate at all.    [White] Do you think that the truth might be that the  electorate judged you on your record and they didn't like your  record?    [Ntaba] No, I think that is speculation. I might just say at  this point that if you look at the pattern of the results, they  are completely regional. That is a matter of great concern to  us. We no longer seem to have a national political movement any  more. According to these results, the country seems to have  fragmented into regions politically and I think we need to very  carefully look at what happened and see how we can correct the  trend to regionalize the country politically. This is our major  concern, as well as being disappointed with the results at the  moment.    [White] You yourself won your seat, I understand?    [Ntaba] I won my own seat very comfortably, yes.    [White] So, you will be now sitting on the opposition seat?    [Ntaba] Well, that is the reality. This is what the result  of the elections mean. I have no serious reservations about  serving this country politically or contributing to the  political development of this country from the opposition. I  believe the country, in the new democratic dispensation, needs a  strong, solid, and very responsible opposition. I am ready and  willing to serve in that capacity because that seems to be what  the electorate wants.    [White] But it must be very hard to surrender power?    [Ntaba] As hard as naturally it can be for any human being,  but nevertheless these are the realities of democratic  elections, of political competition these days. It is not any  more difficult for me to accept that than it would be for a  politician in any other part of the world, I must assure you.  But we, in the Malawi Congress Party, have adapted ourselves to  the changed political climate. That is why we have had no  problems issuing these concession statements from our leader, a  thing which would have been completely different and has been  different in many countries of the African continent.    [White] Have discussions already started with Mr. Muluzi to  ensure that there is a smooth hand over of power?    [Ntaba] The UDF government or the UDF leadership have not  yet  approached us formally to discuss with us about the handing over  of power and I am not sure how that is normally done. This is  the first time we have had such an election in this country, as  you know. I don't know who speaks to who first, but I suppose  we all learn together on how power is handed over after a  democratic election that has been considered free and fair by  many observers.    [White] But in technical terms, are you still a minister or  is somebody else a minister?    [Ntaba] I suppose you would have to say I am still a  minister  of foreign affairs because I have not heard an announcement from  the president-elect yet of who his foreign minister is going to  be.    [White] And when will the formal hand over take place?    [Ntaba] The president-elect is being sworn-in tomorrow and I  suppose that marks the formal handing over of the power of  government and I would assume that that would mark the formal  handing over of the government.    [White] What is going to happen to President Banda?    [Ntaba] In what stance? He is simply not going to be  involved in politics any more. He is not going to be involved  in running the affairs of this country as head of state. He  will certainly be retiring at some other place that he will  choose and I can probably not tell you any more than that.    [White] Now, what about all his houses and palaces that he  has had? Do you think he will be allowed to live in one of  those?    [Ntaba] Well, he has a number of residences of his own,  personally, which are quite suitable, quite comfortable. It is  not a question of him being allowed to occupy one of those  stately residences which he owns personally.    [White] What about the Sanjika Palace? Do you think it would  be a good gesture of the government to allow him to stay there?    [Ntaba] That would indeed be a question for the  president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, to answer and not mine. I  would want you, I would you hope that you could put that  question to him when you have a chance and see how he can answer  it.    [White] But do you personally think that that would be a  good  idea?    [Ntaba] If I were in that position, I would certainly think  it would be a good idea. I think a person of that caliber, a  person who has ruled this country, politically stable for 31  years, deserves a gesture of that nature.    [White] Do you have any complaints at all about the way the  UDF, the winners, have behaved so far in victory?    [Ntaba] Yes, certainly. You recall that our leader conceded  very gracefully yesterday and appealed to Malawians to behave  like Malawians. He appealed to the winners to celebrate with  understanding and without vengeance. We are very, very  disappointed to see that the UDF supporters are committing acts  of violence against the Malawi Congress Party supporters. They  have destroyed six houses in Machinga district, in Balaka area.  This is the president's-elect home district. They have  destroyed six houses of the MCP supporters. In Blantyre, they  have destroyed a house of one of the MCP lady supporters, for no  other offense, but for being a vice district chairman for women  in that area. We are also getting chiefs in the Lower Chire  being harassed and being intimidated. All these acts are going  on and we are not hearing any appeal from the president-elect to  restrain his supporters or to have UDF supporters act in a  restrained manner. So, we are very, very disappointed at what  is happening from the UDF camp. [end recording]</p>

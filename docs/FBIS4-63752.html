			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of people's deputies from the Belarusian  Social Democratic Assembly faction in the Supreme Soviet has  addressed Matthew Kahane, UN permanent representative to the  Republic of Belarus, with a letter regarding the violation of  the Belarusian Constitution by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich.  In particular, the letter broaches the agreement on monetary  merger between Belarus and Russia, which was signed by the prime  minister. "Mr. Kebich, resting upon those forces in the Supreme  Soviet, which allow themselves to grossly violate the state  constitutional system, attempts to incorporate Belarus into the  Russian Federation by an unconstitutional means," the letter  reads. "We are also astonished by the position of the Russian  Government, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which  signed the agreement contradicting the Belarusian Constitution."  The authors of the letter express their assurance that the  international community is not interested in destabilizing the  situation and maintaining Russian nuclear weapons in the center  of Europe; therefore, the United Nations will give a legal  evaluation of the above mentioned agreement as well as the  resolution on the holding of presidential elections in May-June  1994.</p>

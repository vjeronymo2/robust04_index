			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Communist Party of Vietnam Politburo Member Vu </F> Oanh: "Job Creation: A Fundamental and Urgent Task of Mass  Mobilization Work"]    [Text] As defined under our country's socioeconomic  stabilization and development strategy until 2000, "job creation  and optimum use of the work force constitute objectives of  primary importance and serve as the criteria for economic  development orientations and technology selection..."    One of the important objectives of the research on  contemporary international development is to focus on work  safety and human resources development to ensure that all things  originate from, belong to, and serve the people. The human  factor becomes the very objective of people's employment.    Human resources development covers fundamental factors like  work safety, food safety, environmental protection, cultural  development ... The nature and objectives of job development  projects rest with each individual person's creative and chosen  work aimed at happiness for himself and the community. The work  force constitutes the most valuable factor of development; the  mainstay of knowledge, personality, and ethics; and the  essential element of happiness. In addition to the fact that  human knowledge is acquired genetically, a person may improve  his or her background to an important degree thanks to his or  her life experiences. Furthermore, in modern times, owing to  the marvelous development of science and technology, human  knowledge has played a direct role in production. Employment is  part of a citizens' rights and duties. It is also the  preliminary condition of the laboring people's subsistence, and  covers different forms of activities not prohibited by law and  that help bring about gratification and generate income for  citizens.    The settlement of the unemployment problem must be  understood  in a new context, as efforts must be made to not limit job  development projects solely within the bounds of the social  welfare program and of attempts to get rid of the ills of  unemployment, underemployment, inefficiency, and low income.  Instead, they should be regarded as part of an overall effort  to create every opportunity for citizens to enjoy educational  opportunities and make better preparations so they may become  people of virtue, earn a living, participate in creative work,  enjoy the fruit of legitimate employment, have their material  and intellectual property rights protected by law, improve their  quality of life, seek personal happiness, and contribute to the  well-being of the community.    Under the system of bureaucratic centralism and state  subsidization, the state created jobs for everyone, mainly  through the state and collective economies. Citizens were  dutybound to work, but did not have the right to create jobs  themselves or fully enjoy the fruits of their labor. Generally  speaking, personnel recruitment was banned and no incentives  were given to encourage people to bring their wisdom or business  skills into full play. This led to a situation in which  production came to a standstill, with people living in poverty  and unable to make ends meet. There were instances in which as  much as 10 percent of the population suffered from food  shortages. Absenteeism prevailed in the state apparatus. The  people were worried. The regime was plunged into a crisis  situation.    Through the renovation policy, which is aimed at releasing  the working class and production forces, a vigorous movement to  look for ways of earning a living began in the rural areas and  later spread throughout the country, thus completely shifting  our nation from unemployment and food shortages to enthusiasm  for work and dynamic business and production activities. Many  positive changes have been made in everyone's attitude and in  other aspects of the national situation. Generally speaking,  marked progress has been made in the job market and in the  improvement of material and spiritual life. Thanks to creative  work and efforts to overcome dangers, the people have become  more self-confident. The party-people relations have been  consolidated by challenges and shown indications of better  quality.    Nevertheless, our efforts to resolve the unemployment  problem  and improve living conditions in the framework of the renovation  policy are facing major shortcomings and difficulties. As a  result of the heavy impact of the population explosion (2.29  percent) coupled with a growing increase in the work force (3.5  percent per year), about 1.1 million young people reach working  age each year. There are of about 2.2 million unemployed  people in the cities, nearly 10 percent of the urban population.  This ratio is beyond the limit for public security. Urban  residents account for 20 percent of the population. This fact  constitutes the underlying cause of social vices like  prostitution, drug addiction, theft, and robbery resulting in  the death of victims ... Most of the unemployed people are  youths and 85 percent of them do not have any skills. In the  countryside, the average amount of cultivated land per capita is  0.1 hectare, which represents the lowest figure in the region.  Meanwhile, the population density is 200 people per square  kilometer, which represents the highest figure among  agricultural countries. Peasants account for 80 percent of the  population, engage chiefly in agricultural production, and  receive only about 36 percent of GDP. One wage earner can  support only three dependents. In many countries this figure is  20 to 30, and in some countries even 60 or 80. As far as the  countryside is concerned, about half of the work force is  unemployed and 30 percent of rural families are poor. Worse  still, most of those families are social welfare recipients  based on the average per capita income earning rate of less than  15 kilos of rice per month. In industry, labor productivity is  only 30 percent of the international average, while material and  fuel costs are 1.5 to two times greater.    Our latent natural resources are very great but our efforts  to exploit them are poor. We have 1 million square km of  continental shelf, which is three times larger than our inland  area; a 3,200-km long coast with hundreds of islands, large and  small; 12 million hectares of hills and mountains which are  still uncultivated; many border areas; 160 rivers and canals  leading to the sea; and a very large area which can be used for  aquaculture. Most of these natural resources, however, remain in  the form of latent potential. Of striking importance is the  fact that we have an intellectual force of over 600,000 cadres  with college and higher-education, 400,000 overseas Vietnamese  intellectuals, and 5 million war veterans and retired cadres.  The total capital of our people, both inside and outside the  country, amounts to billions of U.S. dollars. Not much effort  has been made to have them invest their money in production.  Our capital, a huge asset indeed, is being worn out because of  poor business management.    Generally speaking, the domestic market, including the labor  market, has not been motivated and exploited satisfactorily.  Information for the many "input- and output"-related services of  various economic components is still very poor. That is why we  have not been able to develop our potential to resolve the  unemployment issue.    This situation has been ascribed to the fact that the  starting point for our national development is too low: Our  per-capita annual GNP is only around $200, thus ranking Vietnam  156th among the 173 less developed countries. If based on the  HDI (Human Development Index, including GNP, and the Cultural  and Social Index), Vietnam may rank 115th among those countries.    The market economy has taken shape, bringing about tangible  results. We are encountering difficulties, however, in changing  our economic structure and restructuring economic management and  the ownership of various economic components. Political  indoctrination has not been closely linked with and has failed  to serve as a driving force for economic renovation. Cultural  development has also not been blended with economic renovation.  Now there is a striking and essential requirement for being  consistent in choosing targets and in assessing and using social  driving force and the intellectual and material properties of  the great national unity bloc for national development and  renovation. We must link ourselves with it [the economic  renovation task] and through this, develop to the fullest the  strengths of science and technology and exploit our advantage as  a practitioner who enjoys geographical, political, economic, and  cultural, military, and historical advantages as a country in  the Asia-Pacific region -- an area with the most dynamic  potential for development in the 21st century.    We need to resolve these fundamental issues if we are to  develop our capability to resolve unemployment more  satisfactorily and rapidly.    A correct target chosen by our party and people is to  realize  the socialist ideal. To attain this goal, we need a long,  multi-stage process. Therefore, it is important that we pay  constant attention to our immediate goal of "building a  peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous  Vietnam" (President Ho Chi Minh's testament) and a prosperous  people, powerful country, and equitable and civilized society,  bearing in mind a consistent strategic slogan for various stages  of development, that is, independence, freedom, and happiness.  This slogan of Uncle Ho is inscribed in our national emblem)    Our methods to achieve these objectives are: to amass  progressive wealth together, progressing from poverty to  sufficiency, from humble wealth to greater riches, and to  accumulate wealth in all material, intellectual, moral,  personality, and emotional contexts. People who becomes wealthy  earlier should help others who come later. All national  development strategies should have as their main goals the  liberalization of labor and production forces, and the use of  cultural and socioeconomic efficiencies as criteria for their  evaluation. All economic and political establishments,  including those of the party, state, and mass organizations,  should always strive to diligently do their utmost for national  development, happiness, and the prosperous and glorious future  of the nation. Henceforth, the party will never hold that it  already knows everything, especially when it is a ruling party,  but it will always value highly all initiatives from the great  national unity bloc in constructing and implementing lines and  policies to serve the people. That is also the guiding thought  in preventing officialism, coercion, and corruption, and in  implementing representative democracy through the National  Assembly and direct democracy through the Fatherland Front and  other mass organizations. Lack of democracy in combination with  improper enforcement of discipline and laws will cause our  ideals and objectives to become unclear, and damage the superior  characteristics of our regime.    These directions, objectives, and methods are the foundation  for determining concrete viewpoints and measures in planning and  implementing processes to resolve the unemployment problem.    We need to confirm the view that the labor force needs to be  liberalized, with legal guarantees for all citizens to be free  to do business, to amass wealth lawfully, and employ workers in  accordance with legal stipulations. We need to remove all  prejudices, prohibitions, and hindrances to innovation and  development of the citizens' business. We should quickly bring  to fruition laws on domestic investment, protection of private  ownership and intellectual property, and labor that oblige  employers to maintain the welfare of workers and their families.    Creation of employment should be based on the development of  a multi-sectoral merchandise economy with measures that are  diversified, interrelated, cooperative, and competitive between  themselves. We need to form a flexible labor market that  responds well to supply and demand and that could develop  opportunities to create employment in the healthy environment of  new moral values and legal codes.    Job creation is the core of the issue of ensuring social  security and equity during the development process, and is  currently the top priority for avoiding a crisis situation. We  will not be able to ensure social equity in our economic  development if we keep the model of centralized, authoritarian  socialism coupled with indiscriminate subsidization. Neither  should we pursue economic development regardless of its damage  to social equity, as proof of the chaos and degradation in many  developing countries.    Our economy is developing from a weak starting point, with  scant capital and low technology. But we have a strong labor  force, so our strategy of job creation must include measures  that aim to accelerate economic development while ensuring  social equity.    Economic sectors and professions which require more labor  and less capital such as agriculture, rural industry, light  industry, small industry, and handicrafts, should be strongly  developed to utilize our advantage of cheap labor and expand  exports. Small family and partnership enterprises in cities and  the countryside should be expanded. Traditional professions in  different villages and city urbans should be restored. Centers  for scientific production and research should be established  near education centers, universities, high schools, and urban  streets and villages to create a new image of linking education  with practice, production, and research. We should pay more  attention to the urbanization of the countryside and avoid the  negative effects of concentrating development in big cities.  Regarding industrialization and modernization, we must pay  particular attention to rural industrialization as we are  modernizing necessary industries such as telecommunications,  informatics, biology, oil and gas, renewable energy, and  materials ....    We must utilize technologies that require less capital and  more labor. They do not have to be low technologies. In fact,  they can be technologies of high intelligence when we introduce  culture into development, when we know how to link intellectuals  with workers and peasants in commodity production, and when we  know how to adapt, improve, and traditionalize the modern  science and technologies and modernize the traditional science  and technologies. If we know how to encourage and utilize our  abundant national contingent of intellectuals and our  intelligent and industrious population with 85 percent literacy,  we will able to shoulder this serious undertaking. The strategic  direction to solve the unemployment problem lies in rural areas,  coastal areas, the 1 million square km of continental shelves,  and hilly and mountainous areas comprising three-fifths of our  country and 12 million hectares of fallow land.    We should supplement and perfect our employment prospecta by  providing adequate treatment to intellectuals and artists,  retraining workers and managers, and upgrading economic sectors  and professions to meet new requirements. We must perfect  macroeconomic policies on taxation, land, natural resources, and  credit to liberate and develop our potential labor force. We  should introduce more policies to encourage citizens and  organizations to create more jobs and satisfactorily implement  the export of labor. We must consolidate and perfect our system  of employment service, our centers for the application and  transfer of technologies that provide more jobs, and the  employment consultation offices. We must closely supervise our  modest national employment fund to direct resources to  localities and people with urgent needs for services. We must  outline economic development plans to create more jobs  practically and sufficiently. Then, we must quickly carry out  the plans, avoiding the bureaucracy and formality which requires  approval from different levels. We must stop allocating  investment capital improperly. Investment capital should be  quickly, fully, and directly allocated to create more jobs and  develop the economy. In this area, we must strengthen control,  quickly correct wrongdoings, and supplement and perfect the  necessary tasks.    We should perfect our national employment program before  introducing it to our annual planning in which directions for  the creation of new regions, fields, industries, and professions  must be outlined. Our investment should be concentrated on  infrastructure to create favorable conditions and environment  for citizens and political and socioeconomic organizations to  create more jobs. We should pay more attention to the close  combination of economy with national security and the economic,  cultural, and social development of ethnic communities with  programs for the cultural and social development of border areas  and programs for the application and development of informatics,  renewable energy, new materials, and biology.    Work represents the two sources, service and pleasure, of a  citizen's happiness. Solving the employment problem is the  responsibility of all people, the party, and the political  system. It is also a central and urgent task of mass  mobilization in national stabilization, renovation,  construction, and protection.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Trawlers get protection A FISHERIES protection vessel was standing off the Scilly Isles yesterday after reports of more clashes between British and French trawlers in disputed fishing grounds. The Ministry of Defence said the fisheries protection vessel HMS Shetland sailed to the area after the reports, but found no sign of French trawlers. Falmouth Coastguards and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food both confirmed that Cornish trawlers reported yesterday that French trawlers were sailing close to the nets of British boats off the Scilly Isles. They could not confirm reports that one British trawler's nets were destroyed by the French trawler L'Arche, the same vessel involved in clashes in June. In those incidents, involving several trawlers from Newlyn and the Brittany port of Concarneau, the Cornish fishermen's nets suffered Pounds 15,000 of damage.</p>

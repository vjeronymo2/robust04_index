			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Dubinskaya, ``Name Obliges''] </F>   [Text] One of the methods of improving the well-being of  Moscow's 120 self-financed hospitals is affiliation with  commercial structures. Compared to medical service fees abroad  (75,000 dollars or higher), 500,000 rubles for two weeks in a  boarding house, an examination by one of the medical  luminaries--ophthalmologist Academician Arkadiy Nesterov--and  treatment or bloodless liver operation using Western practices  is a negligible amount. Yet it is still out of reach for  80% of  Russian citizens.    To improve free service to indigent patients in the  hospital's self-financing wards, Clinical Hospital No. 15 in  Vykhino found a reliable source of ``off-budget'' financing--the  ``Avicenna'' Russian-Syrian joint venture (SP). In 1988, the  hospital became its principal stockholder after acquiring  69%  of the shares. Here, top-notch service and treatment are offered  to the well-off, while the resulting resources ``work'' for the  entire hospital complex.    The positive impact from such interaction is indisputable.  Deputy Director of Moscow's Chief Medical Administration  Aleksandr Lukashev commented thus on the outlook for cooperation  with commercial structures:    ``No obvious disaster with medical service can be foreseen  at  the capital's hospitals since budget allocations with a 2.5-fold  ``padding'' for inflation on a quarter-to-quarter basis amounted  to 65 billion rubles during the summer (it was 15 billion at the  start of the year--A.D.). Yet despite future centralized  shipments of powerful antibiotics, anti-cancer preparations, and  equipment to the clinics under direct contracts with various  companies, there is still a shortage of anesthetic drugs and  ultrasonic and endoscopic equipment. Consequently, we are  supporting any form of property in public health--sole  proprietorship or joint-stock companies--which provide medical  assistance at a proper level and advance Moscow's health  services.''</p>

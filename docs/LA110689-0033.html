Robert Presley (R-Riverside) said. He said the staff  of his Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations will review  Folsom's operations. Guards have complained that inmates are allowed access to  ingredients to make an alcoholic home brew. They also reported that prisoners  have thrown away food, clothing and usable equipment -- including computers --  on a scrap bin.  </P></p>

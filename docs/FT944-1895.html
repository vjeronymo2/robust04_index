			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Let's drink to '94, in castor oil - It was a disappointing year overall, but at least it was healthy It was a hell of a first half, but the rest of the year has left us disappointed rather than devastated. Despite a couple of half-point rises in short-term interest rates, the FT-SE 100 index stands slightly above its end-June level of 2,919 and the long-dated gilt-edged yield has held at 8.6 per cent (although only after hitting an intermediate high point of 9 per cent late in September). Going back a year, however, the bull market enthusiasm was all-pervading. The only way for the stock market was up, most analysts said. Some talked about 4,000 on the Footsie, hardly any about 3,000. My own opinion of the FT-SE 100 index at 3,400 was cynical. We were in the late, panic-buying stage of the bull market, I said. Prices might temporarily move higher, but equities were only for the brave and the nimble. There was a chance that the dividend yield on the market as a whole would be pushed down to 3 per cent - but, by then, all the warning lights would be flashing red. In the event, it dipped no further than 3.2 per cent at the market's peak on February 2. Events unfolded a little more quickly than I had envisaged. January indeed saw a dash from cash, as small investors piled into the two European privatisation investment trusts which were launched opportunistically by Mercury and Kleinwort Benson: they raised Pounds 1,075m between them, on which original subscribers are showing an average loss of 17 1/2 per cent now. There was a smell of the notorious Royal Event: an over-hyped, sucker-gathering, unit trust launch in September 1987. But it turned out to be not quite so bad: instead of collapsing by 25 per cent in a few days, the London stock market took nearly five months to fall by 18 per cent. In fact, though, the equity shake-out was a bit of a sideshow. The real story of 1994 has been one of a global bond market crash. Fixed-interest securities finally shook off their boring image and staged a tumble as they reversed the bull market of 1993 on a rather swifter timetable. In 1993, long-dated gilt yields had fallen from 9 per cent late in January to 6.5 per cent at the year-end, generating a total investment return for 1993 of 34 per cent - which was more than on equities. That movement had been reversed entirely by September this year and, although there has been some recovery since, the negative return on long gilts has been about 12 per cent - a little worse than on equities. So much for the traditional idea that bonds are less risky than shares. The reason is partly that huge government deficits around the world have collided with a vigorous economic recovery, pushing up bond yields. But the scale of the boom and bust in global bonds has reflected the huge growth in speculation by, among others, hedge funds and the so-called proprietary trading teams of banks and securities houses. Plenty about 1994 has been positive, however. Economic growth has soared above expectations whereas inflation has under-shot. British companies as a whole have become very prosperous, recording a record financial surplus in the first half-year. Yet, the stock market can seem perverse. Last year, I remarked that the All-Share index had risen by 64 per cent in three years while dividends had increased not at all. In 1994, dividends have bounded up by an unexpectedly healthy 8 per cent but the All-Share has tumbled by 12 per cent. Such share price behaviour might seem disappointing and puzzling to many investors, but it is predictable. Remember that, in buoyant economic conditions, it is not share prices that go up but expected rates of return. Share prices fall so that equities can compete, in terms of future potential, against price-insensitive competition - such as bonds issued by free-spending governments. In a growing economy, capital is in greater demand. Fortunately, the British government - more nimbly than many others - is reducing its borrowing requirement rapidly. But the influx of speculative foreign money which flooded in during 1993 (when overseas buyers bought Pounds 16.6bn of gilts) has halted, and been reversed slightly, in recent months. Essentially, the sharp rise in bond yields between February and June reflected the necessary adjustment before domestic buyers would absorb all that the Bank of England had to sell. Equities had to move roughly in line, because a ratio between gilt-edged and equity yields of much more than 2 is unsustainable. So, the yield on the All-Share has moved up to 4.1 per cent now. Not only securities have had a disappointing year in the UK. The feel-bad factor has extended to housing, which has flattened out after a reasonably promising spring-time rally. I was right to say in January that it was a good moment to switch from the stock market into houses; but my forecast late in 1993 that house prices would rise by up to 5 per cent over the next year (which seemed cautious at the time) has been undermined by recent setbacks. By November, house prices nationally were fractionally lower, year-on-year. Such house price weakness reflects the peculiar nature of the 1994 economic recovery: a strong corporate sector has been driven by exports and healthy flows through the capital markets, but consumers are restrained by job insecurity, weak post-tax income growth, and a reluctance to increase their debts. Where, indeed, are the borrowers? The banks and building societies have been confronted with major structural challenges in 1994 - symptomised by the past year's mere 4 per cent growth in broad money. This was the recovery that passed by the banks and house prices, which depend traditionally for their strength upon voluminous injections of mortgage finance, have languished. This has been growth without a consumer spending spree and without a borrowing binge. It is, of course, all thoroughly healthy. But so, they say, is castor oil.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Congress cold on reform of healthcare The US Congress returned to Washington yesterday, after two weeks in recess, with less appetite than ever for any kind of healthcare legislation. In spite of last-minute efforts to achieve a minimal compromise that could squeeze through both chambers of Congress in the next month, there is little wind left in the sails of the reform which President Bill Clinton launched a year ago with his detailed plan to guarantee health insurance to everyone in the US. Some centrist Democrats continued to work with Senator John Chafee and a band of moderate Republicans on a compromise bill, based on reforms to the insurance market and subsidies to expand health insurance coverage. This mainstream group has also begun discussions with backers of the more ambitious reform plan, proposed by Senator George Mitchell, Democratic majority leader in the Senate, to see whether the two can come together. However, it is by no means clear that such a compromise measure can spur enough enthusiasm to pass even the Senate. Its prospects in the House of Representatives seem close to zero. Only four weeks now remain before Congress is due to rise for a month of campaigning in the election on November 8 faced by the whole House and a third of the Senate. The coalition that would prefer to do nothing at all this year now includes the bulk of the Republican members - some of whom are wary of tinkering with the healthcare industry, while others are simply determined to deny Mr Clinton and the Democrats any chance of claiming a victory - and those left-leaning Democrats who favour a national healthcare system. This group, led by Congressman Jim McDermott, appears firmly opposed to any diluted reform. So does Mr Clinton. He has appeared to back away from the theatrical threat, made in his State of the Union speech early this year to veto any bill that did not guarantee universal coverage, but the threat has not been lifted. What is more, it might have been possible to gloss over the question of whether reforms that covered 96 or 97 per cent of the population constituted universal coverage, but no measure now available would come close to that. In pure political terms, some Democrats would prefer to give up the search for healthcare reform as soon as possible, rather than face an ignominious defeat a few weeks before the congressional elections. Most members appear convinced that there is little to be gained with their constituents by pressing ahead with reform at all costs.</p>

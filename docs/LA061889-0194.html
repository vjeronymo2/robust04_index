			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP QUALIFYING;  </P> <P> U.S. BOUNCES BACK TO BEAT GUATEMALA, 2-1  </P> <P> David Vanole, the U.S. goalkeeper, was not certain afterward whether he saw the  ball coming toward him. He did know that it bounced off his knee and away from  the goal, sparing the United States the embarrassment of another tie at home in  a World Cup soccer qualifying game.  </P> <P> It is such a slim difference, that between triumph and despair.  </P> <P> Vanole felt the latter in the United States' last qualifying game at Torrance  in May, when Trinidad and Tobago scored with two minutes remaining for a 1-1  tie. He accepted blame for the goal, even though it was not entirely his fault.  </P> <P> Then, in fairness to himself, Vanole, who is from Manhattan Beach, should have  accepted credit for the crucial defensive play Saturday at Veterans Memorial  Stadium that preserved the United States' 2-1 victory over Guatemala. Instead,  he called it luck. But that did not make him any less ecstatic. By any other  name, a victory is still a victory.  </P> <P> The game was saved with less than 13 minutes remaining, when Guatemala's Edwin  Westphal right-footed a line drive toward the goal from about seven yards away.  It might have been a difficult play for Vanole even if he had seen it. Because  he did not, it probably was fortunate that his right knee got in the way.  </P> <P> The ball bounced in front of the goal to Guatemala's Adan Paniagua, who headed  it back toward Vanole. But he followed that one all the way to end Guatemala's  last serious threat.  </P> <P> "The initial save was luck," Vanole said. "But give me credit for being in the  right position. I've got to take credit for something."  </P> <P> The victory was considered necessary for the United States in its attempt to  qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1950. In a five-team  qualifying tournament of teams from North America, Central America and the  Caribbean, the two teams with the best records at the end of the year will  advance to the 1990 World Cup in Italy.  </P> <P> The United States had a 1-1-1 record before Saturday, but only two of its  remaining five games were at home. So the U.S. players must have been dismayed  to discover when they arrived here that about one-third of the 10,561 fans were  cheering for Guatemala.  </P> <P> "We had more fans, but they had louder fans," Vanole said.  </P> <P> The United States took the Guatemalan fans out of the game a little more than  two minutes into it when forward Bruce Murray of Germantown, Md., scored on a  perfect pass from the right corner by John Harkes of Kearney, N.J.  </P> <P> "John should take all the credit," said Murray, who could not capitalize on two  other scoring opportunities early in the game. "It was an impossible angle, but  he made it happen."  </P> <P> Twenty minutes later, the Guatemalan fans finally had reason to cheer when  their exciting young star, Juan Manuel Funes, passed to the right wing to Raul  Chacon, whose shot caught Vanole out of position and bounced off the left  corner post for a goal.  </P> <P> The United States scored the winning goal 22 minutes into the 45-minute second  half, when Eric Eichmann of Margate, Fla., took a header from Steve Trittschuh  of Granite City, Ill., and kicked it toward the goal from 10 yards out.  </P> <P> The ball was headed back out by Alejandro Ortiz, but it bounced off the  shoulder of teammate Felix McDonald and went back into the goal. The official  scorer ruled that Ortiz was behind the goal line when he made the defensive  play. So it was Eichmann's goal. But it would have counted for the United  States either way.  </P> <P> Guatemala probably lost its last chance to rally when Funes was sent to the  sideline for punching Harkes, forcing the visitors to play a man short for the  last five minutes.  </P></p>

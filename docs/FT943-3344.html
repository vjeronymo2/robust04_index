			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Village Roadshow in ADollars 230m fund-raising Village Roadshow, the Australian cinema and theme parks operator in which Anglia TV of the UK holds a minority stake, is raising up to ADollars 230m (USDollars 171.3m) through a three-part preference share issue. Part of the issue - ADollars 80m - will only go ahead if acquisition plans for 'strategic investment' are successful. However, the shares have been underwritten by McIntosh, the stockbroking firm, guaranteeing that the money will be available. Yesterday, Village declined to comment on what acquisition it had in mind. It ruled out any interest in the Wesgo radio station business, currently the subject of a recommended bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers. Market speculation had suggested that Village might have been the buyer of a 5 per cent block of shares. The first tranche of new money will be raised via the placement of 52.17m preference shares, at ADollars 2.30 each, yielding around ADollars 120m. This will provide additional working capital for the group, and help fund its joint venture with Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, and expansion of its cinema interests in Asia. The second tranche involves another 34.79m shares, also to be placed at ADollars 2.30, to raise ADollars 80m. These are the shares that will only be issued if the planned acquisition goes ahead.</p>

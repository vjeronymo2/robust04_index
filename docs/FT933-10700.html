			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Limit on sex bias claims is unlawful EMPLOYERS face the prospect of higher claims for compensation from victims of sex discrimination after the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that Britain's statutory Pounds 11,000 ceiling on tribunal awards was unlawful. People who have suffered sex discrimination must be compensated in full for loss and damage actually suffered even if that means exceeding the ceiling. The government will now have to legislate to remove the statutory compensation limit. The court's decision was made in the second case brought by Miss Helen Marshall, a retired senior dietician, against her former employers Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority, which had dismissed her in 1980 at the age of 62. In 1986 she won a ruling from the European Court that she could rely on an EC directive in her action against her employers for discriminatory early retirement. The industrial tribunal awarded her Pounds 18,405 in compensation which included Pounds 7,710 in interest on her financial loss from the date of her dismissal to the date of the tribunal's decision. In reaching its decision the tribunal disregarded the Pounds 6,250 limit on compensation. The health authority paid the capital sum but refused to pay the interest, and her case was eventually referred back to the European Court. Lawyers said yesterday the ruling had dramatic implications for UK employers. Mr David Pannick QC said: 'It is of very great significance for securing equality in the workplace. 'Employers will now know that there is no statutory limit on the amount of compensation. They will be making more certain not to discriminate in the first place, and they will be much more concerned to settle cases rather than have them go to tribunals. 'Claimants in industrial tribunal awards will receive significantly higher awards, if they have suffered loss that is above the statutory limit.' The ruling was welcomed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which supported Miss Marshall's case. Ms Kamlesh Bahl, commission head, said the decision would not only strengthen the UK's sex discrimination laws but also act as 'a further reminder to employers that it will be costly to discriminate on grounds of sex.' The commission said that the first to benefit from the ruling would be the 2,000 women who have filed complaints to tribunals after being sacked for being pregnant under Ministry of Defence rules which were abandoned in 1990. Mr Norman Lamb, the lawyer co-ordinating their cases, said the claims of some of the women could now be as high as Pounds 100,000 or more.</p>

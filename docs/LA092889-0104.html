			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRESERVATION VOTE FOR MEYERS HOUSE DELAYED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission last week delayed action on  designating a 93-year-old house on Eagle Rock Boulevard as a historic-cultural  monument, but several developers have stepped forward with plans to move and  renovate the deteriorated structure.  </P> <P> Jeffrey B. Samudio, chairman of an Eagle Rock citizens preservation committee,  said at least four people have expressed interest in saving the two-story  Meyers House, which stands vacant in a fenced-off field in an industrial and  commercial neighborhood at 4340 Eagle Rock Blvd.  </P> <P> Samudio said he toured the house last week and found it "to be in remarkably  good shape. All of the fixtures are original, both gas and electrical.  Structurally, it is very sound." The house has been vacant for more than 14  years.  </P> <P> A representative of the owner of the house told commission members that the  owner supports a proposal to designate the structure a monument but would like  the building moved from its boulevard site, said Nancy Fernandez, commission  executive assistant.  </P> <P> Lack of a quorum delayed action until Oct. 4.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FRIDAY'S TOP GAMES  </P> <P> MUIR VS. FONTANA  </P> <P> Friday at Fontana High, 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The Muir High football team made a favorable impression in its 38-13 victory  over Palmdale in its season opener last week, but so much for the easy portion  of the team's non-league schedule. The final four games -- Fontana, L.A.  Banning, Bishop Amat and Servite -- are the most difficult by far. The Mustangs  could face their biggest challenge against a Fontana squad that went 14-0 en  route to the Southern Section Division I title last season. Fontana opened with  a 27-13 victory over Montclair. The powerful Steelers have an imposing  offensive line that includes prep All-American tackles Robert Loya (6-foot-3,  280 pounds) and Clay Hattabaugh (6-3, 265), who provide solid blocking for  running backs Don Small and Hollerith Jones. The defense is led by All-Division  I linebacker Bobby Sylvester. The Mustangs, with quarterback Sedrick Thomas,  defensive backs Reggie Reser, Demetrice Martin and Hasan McCullough and more  than adequate size on the line with guards Hank Curtis (6-1, 251) and Fred  Sayegh (6-2, 263), might be the most talented team on Fontana's schedule.  </P> <P> BISHOP AMAT VS. CARSON  </P> <P> Friday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> When these teams met the past two seasons, the results were strikingly similar.  Carson, a perennial L.A. City Section power, entered both games as one of the  top-ranked teams in the nation, but lost 17-13 and 24-23. That should provide  plenty of incentive for the Colts, who are once again ranked among the best in  the nation in preseason polls. But Bishop Amat figures to be anything but a  pushover. The Lancers opened the season by defeating Rubidoux, 37-7. Bishop  Amat was led by running back Scott Fields, who rushed for 129 yards in only  nine carries, and quarterback Zack Zertuche, who threw for three touchdowns.  Lancer linebacker Jason Patterson, who also starts at fullback, helped hold  Rubidoux to 80 total yards. This will be the season opener for Carson, which  expects to have a solid defense that includes prep All-America defensive back  Clayvand Thomas and linebackers Marcus Long (6-2, 218) and Tarriel Hopper (6-3,  212).  </P> <P> NOGALES VS. ARROYO  </P> <P> Friday at Arroyo High, 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> It will be a matchup of similar offensive philosophies when these San Gabriel  Valley teams meet in a non-league game. Both teams prefer to run the ball with  their veer-option offenses. Nogales has dominated this series in recent seasons  and won last year's game, 28-14. The result could be similar this time. Nogales  (1-0) unveiled an outstanding one-two combination at running back in its 19-12  victory over highly regarded Claremont last week. Junior Lawrence Lanham rushed  for 128 yards and a touchdown in 14 carries and senior Tyrone Edwards, regarded  as a major-college prospect, added 88 yards in 15 carries. The Nobles, who  reached the Division IV semifinals for the first time last season, also have a  big-play defense that includes linemen Shermaine Thompson and Tony Verran and  linebacker Luis Cuevas. Arroyo (0-1) is led on offense by junior quarterback  Keith MacLellan and lineman Chris Jacobson (6-4, 220).  </P> <P> GLENDORA VS. WEST COVINA  </P> <P> Friday at West Covina, 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Entering the season, this game might not have been the most intriguing matchup,  but a week can make a big difference. Both teams shut out their opponents in  season openers. Glendora, which tied Ramona for the Southern Section Division  IV title last season, stopped South Hills, 12-0. West Covina, in its first game  under new coach Jim Wright, rolled to a surprisingly easy 32-0 victory over Don  Lugo. West Covina, which appeared considerably stronger than last year's team  that struggled to a 2-7-1 record, relied mostly on its defense that recorded  two safeties and limited Don Lugo to 46 total yards. It was business as usual  for Glendora, which had one of the top defenses in the valley last season and  held South Hills to 114 total yards. Glendora is led on offense by running back  Bill Zernickow and West Covina by quarterback Gary Nesbitt. MITCH POLIN  </P></p>

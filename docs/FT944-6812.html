			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Observer: On hold Thank goodness. The UK economy's day of reckoning has now been postponed. Bill Martin, chief economist of brokers UBS, who has long been one of the gloomiest City Cassandras about the state of the UK economy, has had second thoughts. After months of predicting that the UK economy would melt down next year, Martin's team has now officially announced it was wrong. 'Our official forecast was premature,' admits Martin in a UBS circular. He now predicts that 1995, like 1994, will 'represent the economy's best inflation and growth performance for 30 years'. However, don't get carried away by this upbeat assessment. Martin has not conceded defeat yet. If strong growth continues, the economy will still overheat, he predicts - but the shock will now come in 1997, instead of next year. If he gets that one wrong then Martin may have to consider following the example of Goldman Sachs' chief US economist Bob Giordano, and spend more time with his family.</p>

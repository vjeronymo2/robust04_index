			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Probe on council expenses THE AUDIT Commission, the government spending watchdog, yesterday announced a review of all expense claims filed at Derbyshire County Council after a former deputy council leader was jailed for fraud this week. The commission said the district auditor would be examining claims by every councillor over the past financial year. Officials said the review would take some time, although they fully expected most councillors to be cleared of any wrongdoing. The inquiry follows the conviction of Mr Sean Stafford at Birmingham Crown Court, who was jailed for 18 months after being found guilty of fraudulently claiming council expenses. Mr Stafford was jailed along with Mr Gerald Sexton, a solicitor, who allegedly helped him draw up a false contract of employment. Mr Stafford was said to have used the contract to claim Pounds 13,000 expenses for wages lost while on council duty. Mr Sexton was also jailed for 18 months. Solicitors for both men, who denied the charges, said they were considering an appeal. Mr David Bookbinder, the former council leader, said he was sure of their innocence. Derbyshire County Council said yesterday it had always scrutinised members' expenses carefully, adding that it would co-operate fully with the district auditor's examination.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 15 (CTK) -- If parliamentary  elections were to take place now, they would be won by the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS) with 30.7 percent of the vote, according  to a poll of 1,546 Czechs taken on April 1-10 by the Center for  Empirical Research (STEM).    The second strongest party would be the Czech Social  Democratic Party (CSSD) with 15.7 percent, while third would be  the coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) with 12.7 percent.    The former Left Bloc coalition would receive 9.1 percent,  and  6.9 percent would vote for the Communist Party of Bohemia and  Moravia (KSCM).    With 5.3 percent, the government coalition Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) would  narrowly receive more than the five percent of votes needed for  entry to parliament. The Christian Democratic Party (KDS), also  a coalition party, would receive only 0.6 percent.    Parties on the rise include the Assembly for the Republic  (SPR- RSC) with 3.8 percent and the Free Democrats (SD, formerly  OH) with 3.4 percent of votes.    The Green Party would receive 2.2 percent and the Liberal  and  Social Union 1.2 percent.    Seventy seven percent of respondents would take part in  elections, a figure which rises to 92 percent among ODS  supporters and 83 percent of ODA supporters. At the other end  of the scale, 62 percent of Green Party supporters and 61  percent of SPR-RSC supporters would take part.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Turnover dries up as holiday season progresses THE Group of Seven summit in Munich and the summer holiday season reduced turnover levels across the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reversed Friday's index pattern with a better performance in the broadly-based FAZ, which rose 1.54 to 700.46 at midsession, than in the 30-share DAX, which eased 4.62 to 1,772.36 at the close. Turnover fell from DM8bn to DM4.5bn. The move from cyclical to defensive stocks which marked most of last week was hard to detect yesterday with banks fairly flat and utilities flat to lower, although carmakers, engineers and steels fell by more. Among special situations, the meat processor, A Moksel, closed DM10.20 higher at DM399 after DM406.50 on news that the German brewery group Gebruder Marz was close to taking a 33 per cent stake in the company. There was talk in the market that it might pay DM480 a share. In retailers, Asko recovered DM29 of Friday's post-suspension drop of DM109 to close at DM665. Mr Frank Raschke of Nikko Securities said that there were two views on Asko: first that there was more trouble to come from investments in companies like Adia, the Swiss employment agency group, and, secondly, that Asko would now concentrate on retailing and make lots of money. In the meantime, he said, yesterday's rise was simply a technical reaction. PARIS closed at its lowest level in nearly five months and the lack of business made many brokers wonder why they had bothered to come to work. The CAC 40 index lost 15.12 to 1,868.52, its lowest close since 1,865.11 on St Valentine's Day, in turnover of just FFr1.1bn. Leisure and tourism stocks suffered the most from the truck drivers' strike which has brought French motorways to a standstill. Euro Disney closed FFr2.20 lower at FFr102.90, its lowest close this year, while the hotel company Accor fell FFr7 to FFr739. Hachette was the sole provider of any news, announcing that it would sell some buildings in central Paris for FFr500m. The stock closed flat at FFr127. Meanwhile, worries about the state of the property sector continued to weigh on financial stocks, with the insurer UAP losing FFr17 to FFr447 in thin trading. MILAN sank further into its depression following the Bank of Italy's decision to raise the discount rate to 13 per cent. The Comit index fell 2.81 to 441.35 in turnover estimated at L65bn after Friday's L79.9bn. Fiat fell L51 to L5,061 and eased to L5,040 after hours while bigger losses were seen in second-line stocks. Burgo fell L360 to L4,880 and Italcementi dropped L290 to L10,450. In COPENHAGEN, trading re-opened in Hafnia shares after a three-day suspension, with Hafnia B falling as low as DKr94 in early trading but closing at DKr97, down DKr9, writes Hilary Barnes. Institutional investors guaranteeing the DKr2bn rights issue by Hafnia Holding might have to take up the entire issue. The all-share index rose 0.20 to 319.70 in a day of very low turnover. STOCKHOLM was led down by banks and finance which fell 2 per cent as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 10.5 to 904.1. Concern about loan losses left SE-Banken A SKr0.50 down at a new 1992 low of SKr27.50, and Svenska Handelsbanken lost SKr1.50 to SKr49.50. OSLO recovered a little on bargain-hunting after its latest slide, the all-share index rising 3.85 to 397.10 in turnover of NKr191m. The insurance company Uni Storebrand also recouped some of its recent losses, the A shares rising NKr2 to NKr33 as a domestic newspaper apologised for an article last week saying that Uni was 'technically bankrupt'. ZURICH traded in its new bourse building, where it saw profit-taking in insurers as the SMI index lost 8.4 to close at 1,862.6. In addition, the weak dollar hurt shares in export-oriented industrials, which earn a large portion of their revenue abroad. Bearer shares in the chemical group Ciba-Geigy topped the active list as they eased SFr4 to SFr683; Zurich Insurance bearers were SFr20 easier at SFr1,910 and Winterthur bearers SFr50 lower at SFr3,100. MADRID dropped in thin trade with investors discouraged by the gloomy outlook for the Spanish economy. The general index finished 2.70 lower at 236.74. Banesto underperformed in the banking sector, with a fall of Pta65 to Pta2,410. Constructions saw weakness again in Cubiertas, Pta260 lower at Pta7,000, and Uralita down Pta118, or 11 per cent, at Pta927 after last week's agreed merger with the chemicals company Argonesas, which dropped Pta200 to Pta1,150. AMSTERDAM closed lower as the dollar weakened. The CBS Tendency Index closed at 122.2, down 0.8. BRUSSELS closed mixed in thin trading as the Bel-20 index was almost unchanged, down just 0.20 at 1,174.60 in low turnover of BFr491m. Petrofina dropped BFr200 to BFr10,950, while CBR climbed BFr110 to BFr8,200. ISTANBUL leapt 5 per cent in a rally which accelerated towards the close after the market overcame nervousness hanging over from the heavy profit-taking of late last week. The 75-share index closed at 4,387.02, up 211.06.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1140.03  1139.15  1137.86  1137.48  1136.22  1135.35  1135.28  1134.09  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1140.15            Day's Low  1133.73  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Jul 3        Jul 2        Jul 1       Jun 30         Jun 29     1142.19      1134.63      1132.36     1139.30        1141.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

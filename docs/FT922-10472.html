			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market confident of scaling new high Pounds 2.5bn worth - and concern that the market may have run out of steam were firmly shrugged aside as equities moved tantalisingly close to an all-time closing high. The FT-SE 100-share Index ended the session 13.9 higher at 2,664.9, with a sizeable placing of Racal Electronics stock and renewed takeover speculation elsewhere in the market the day's chief features. There was considerable uncertainty around equities at the outset, with dealers still nervous about Wall Street, in spite of its late rally on Tuesday that left a modest closing gain, and the prospects for the gilt auction. It was also felt that most of the big trading houses had plenty of stock on board, and would probably be quick to unload if the market turned against them. While always maintaining a healthy premium over fair value, the performance of the Footsie future was never entirely convincing and kept traders looking over their shoulders for a sharp decline. However, developments in mid-morning delivered a substantial boost to confidence. The main factor behind this came from gilts, where the auction of Treasury 8 3/4 per cent stock 2017 was said to have gone exceptionally well. First indications that the gilts offering had been well received coincided with news that the near 10 per cent holding in Racal Electronics, a block of 130m shares, acquired by Williams Holdings during its unsuccessful bid attempt last year had been placed with ease by SG Warburg Securities. Warburg was thought to have acquired the shares at 58p and placed them with a broad spread of institutions at 58 1/2 p. Specialists said these were snapped up within minutes of being offered and that a number of institutions were unhappy at not being given the chance to take up the Racal shares. It was also pointed out that the market's appetite for such a large lump of stock as the Williams stake was a good barometer of the overall market. With the Racal stock safely placed and the auction going smoothly, institutional buyers moved back into the market, driving the Footsie up, from its brief excursion into negative territory during early trading, to a day's high of 2,673.5 just before the opening of Wall Street. Thereafter, the index slipped back to end within 15 points of its all-time closing peak and around 19 points below its intraday record. The Racal placing, which allowing for double counting involved 260m shares, gave a massive boost to stock market turnover, which shot up to 869.1m shares. The value of business on Tuesday returned to above Pounds 1bn, reaching Pounds 1.21bn. The bank sector saw profit-takers move in on Midland, while Barclays fell back amid worries about potential losses from the property sector. Retailing issues such as Dixons and Kingfisher were hit by bearish noises emanating from County NatWest, while Vodafone, a key component of the poorly performing telephone networks sector, suffered from a profits downgrading from one of the market's most influential agency brokers.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Fayed cleared over allegations of blackmail Mr Mohamed Fayed, chairman of Harrods, was cleared yesterday of allegations that he attempted to blackmail the government in the controversy over MPs accepting money to ask parliamentary questions. The Crown Prosecution Service announced there was no evidence Mr Fayed had committed any criminal offence, and that police would not investigate further. The allegations centred on a meeting on September 29 between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and an intermediary - widely believed to be Mr Brian Hitchen, the Sunday Express editor. The intermediary said Mr Fayed wanted a meeting with Mr Major to discuss the Department of Trade and Industry report on the takeover of the House of Fraser. He was also said to be contemplating passing on allegations about the conduct of ministers. Mr Major told MPs he had passed a note of the meeting to the prosecution service. The CPS said: 'Having considered the available evidence . . . it does not disclose the commission of any criminal offence by Mr Fayed.' Mr Fayed, who later made a series of allegations about Tory MPs through The Guardian newspaper, said: 'Allegations were made about me . . . that were unfair and untrue and to which I could not respond during the currency of the inquiry. I trust that the prime minister will take the earliest opportunity to set the record straight.' Mr Fayed's cash-for-questions allegations against Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, forced him to resign although he denied them. They also led to the resignation of Mr Tim Smith, a junior Northern Ireland minister, who admitted not declaring links with Mr Fayed. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, were both cleared of any impropriety in an inquiry carried out by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary. Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, said: 'I never thought there was anything to this except another wild diversion. I am glad this has now been acknowledged.'</p>

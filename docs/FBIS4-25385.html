			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A member of Hong Kong's  Government said Thursday [9 June] he hopes China's veteran  leader Deng Xiaoping dies before the British crown colony's  return to China in July 1997 so that clarification of China's  future course can be made by then.    "From the point of view of Hong Kong people, it's better for  Deng to go earlier than later," said Edward Chen, who sits on  the 15-member Executive Council, Hong Kong's cabinet.    Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, Chen  likened Deng's last years to the final period of a dynasty, with  government decisions paralyzed due to the unclear outcome from  an anticipated power change.    "Nobody will dare make major decisions, because if you did  something wrong, it will be disastrous and nobody will want to  take this responsibility," Chen said.    He dismissed scenarios predicting an outbreak of violence or  the country's disintegration should the mastermind of China's  opening policy and market reforms die.    Deng, who will be 90 in August, has frequently been rumored  seriously ill or dead and seemed frail during his last televised  public appearance during the Chinese new year festival in  February.    "Power struggle is inevitable, but I don't think there will  be huge bloodshed after Deng," he said.    With the purging of second-generation politicians such as  reformer Zhao Ziyang, and the current leading trio of President  Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and economic czar Zhu Rongji  being "too old," China's old guard will eventually be succeeded  by leaders emerging from the fourth generation, Chen predicted.    These leaders in their 50s can be trusted because they have  lived through the "bitter experience" of the Cultural  Revolution, but have also experienced 15 years of opening  policy, he said.    Chen, who is also a professor of economics, painted a bright  picture for China's future, saying there is no doubt the country  will become an engine for growth for the world economy,  overtaking the United States in terms of gross national product  in 2010.    The "rising star" among China's booming regions is the  Yangze  River [Chang Jiang] valley, stretching from western Sichuan  Province to Shanghai on the coast, because it offers "tremendous  investment opportunities" with its concentration of heavy and  military industries, he said.    He urged foreign investors to look into the service sector,  which will further open up in line with Beijing's bid for  reentry into the GATT world trade system, he said.    With a population of 1.2 billion and an increasingly  well-off  middle class, China constitutes a "gold mine" for the financial  and insurance business, he said.    Japanese investors should also be aware that China is no  longer a market for cheap mass products. "You have to aim at  the top end of the market," Chen said.    China is a large investor abroad and a major recipient of  foreign investment, which reached 90 billion to 130 billion Hong  Kong dollars in 1993, Chen said. The nation is "too integrated  in the world economy" to make an about-face in its economic  policy, he added.    "There is no way that the open-door policy will be  reverted,"  Chen said. "I think Hong Kong will be all right after 1997."</p>

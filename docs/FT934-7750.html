			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (3): A convenient cohabitation - Industrial relations THE African National Congress is heading for power next April with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's main labour grouping, as its chief backer. Former Cosatu organisers will be prominent on the ANC slate of election candidates, and the ideological compatibility between the two is close. Still, however, their relationship is little more than a convenient cohabitation. Backroom spats and whispered recriminations are becoming more audible, though both parties will continue to attempt to stifle such noises until after polling day. A break-up is likeliest to come in the 1994 public sector pay round, when Cosatu will demand its palimony. Last Thursday, Cosatu called off a one-day national strike planned for Monday - aimed largely at curbing employers' constitutional rights on lockouts - after the ANC leadership made clear that it would not countenance such disruption in what should be a triumphal week. Cosatu leaders, summoned to private talks at the World Trade Centre, were provided with a face-saving formula but no real gains. Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu's new general secretary, is unrepentant. 'Trade union independence is very important,' he says. 'Cosatu would be foolish if it cannot look at the (draft) constitution and ask what issues would adversely affect its own members.' Asked what the threatened stay away, followed by climbdown, achieved, he adds: 'One can say that the struggle for worker rights has begun. We are not a junior partner or appendage of the ANC.' Disagreements between the two, in other words, would not always end in this way. Mr Andrew Levy, a labour consultant, warns: 'Cosatu will determine what happens to this economy.' With some 1.2m members spanning sectors from mining to textiles to banking to teaching, Cosatu has an agenda which is in some ways supplementary to that of the ANC and in others places differing stresses or priorities on the same basic goals. As would be expected, both say they will seek to ensure an end to workplace discrimination, on gender and other grounds as well as race. Beyond that, they require affirmative action to purge the legacy of apartheid. Neither of these is yet much of an issue for large employers, particularly multinationals which have been running ahead of the game in promoting blacks. Unsurprising disgruntlement is being heard from some white staff in such companies, but rather more acute workplace difficulties may surface next year if black unions decide that, even so, the pace of change is not to their satisfaction. What is likely to set the ANC and Cosatu apart is wage restraint. This would be part of 'co-determination', currently the most commonly bandied catch phrase in industrial relations. Mr Shilowa professes not to know what it means - and fairly so, because its usage seems to vary. In the public sector, the implication from the ANC government-in-waiting is that black workers are already substantially better off than the 45 per cent or so who are without any formal employment. Thus they should accept wage rises next year substantially below the country's 9 per cent inflation rate so that cash can be channelled to upliftment programmes elsewhere. In return, unions should be given a say in reconstruction and development planning. Private sector companies, equally loath to make inflationary pay awards, are here and there offering seats on the board for labour representatives to instil a sense of participation in decision making. From Cosatu's point of view, though, these are often baubles rather than ballast for its cause. Some sort of accommodation between labour and capital is necessary to set the new dispensation on course; all but the most radical agree, but attempts at cosmetic corporatism are being treated with suspicion. Labour activists are demanding that a strategic view be taken across each industry, with retrenchments and new entrants alike being given equal scrutiny. To take three examples: At the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) - one of Cosatu's two largest member unions along with the National Union of Mineworkers - Mr Bernie Fanaroff maintains that some of the country's vehicle assemblers are already matching the cost structures of plants in Asia. But, he adds, the three dozen model variants for new cars are too numerous for the market, and further productivity improvements may depend on following Australia in shedding whole ranges. Never mind cars. Mr Shilowa, arguing for an audit of where investment is most needed, asks simply: 'Why don't we produce bicycles?' All are imported, most of them from Taiwan. Charity shops selling second-hand clothes donated from Japan and North America have at times been occupied by protesting members of the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu) on the grounds that even such outlets might erode their jobs. The union is now, however, concentrating on the real threat to employment in its industry posed by prospective Gatt reductions in import tariffs. What the three have in common is a recognition that solutions to labour questions within specific companies will not in themselves secure, let alone increase, jobs. On imports, there is an acceptance that tariffs will have to be lowered in many instances, but unions argue that this should happen only after inefficiencies have been sorted out and an upgrade taken place in manufacturing technology run down by sanctions and a general decline in capital spending. Such talks would happen on a tripartite basis among employers, unions and government, and foreign investors would have to accept that they did not have an unfettered right to manage, Mr Shilowa makes clear. 'We want to be involved in industrial restructuring,' he says. 'To improve productivity, one has to feel a sense of ownership.' He offers some assurances: unions would keep their side of the bargain and could not justify breaking a wage agreement within its lifespan. But any other grievances which surface would be dealt with as Cosatu saw fit. 'If co-determination means we are prepared to work with employers - yes. If it means us entering into social pacts without being allowed to strike - no.'</p>

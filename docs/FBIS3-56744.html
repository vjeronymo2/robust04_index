			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays by </F> commentator Nikolay Svanidze; place not given; from the  "Details" program -- live]    [Excerpt] [Svanidze] [passage omitted] After heavy  rearguard fighting in the form of desperate attempts to issue  ultimata to the government, the Gaydar team has retreated into  the State Duma, and its retreat not been very organized. The  personal mutual understanding between Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov has clearly broken down, and taking account of the major  tactical disagreements between Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis,  this points to a serious split within Russia's Choice.    It was natural and inevitable that political relations would  have to be clarified after the blow of the 12 December election  results. Russia's Choice is now becoming what amounts to a  constructive opposition to the government, and is entering new  and very complex relations with the president. A key role will  be played in Viktor Chernomyrdin's new government by  professionals with centrist views, close to directors' circles.  In a new spiral, and in different conditions, a government of  experienced managers is being set up which is ideologically  related in many ways to the Ryzhkov-Abalkin cabinet.    Only one person is left in the government today from the  government of the first Yegor Gaydar cabinet of two years ago --  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State  Committee for the Management of State Property.    Anatoliy Borisovich, you have found yourself in proud and  romantic isolation, alone among strangers. What will you do in  a government without Gaydar and Fedorov?    [Chubays] Well, first of all the decision on Fedorov has not  yet been adopted, so I would not draw such unequivocal  conclusions, let us wait a little. Second, I do not entirely  agree that Chubays has been left alone in the government, it  must be said that I have been working with these people for more  than a year now. Relations have certainly not always been  simple, and there are serious difficulties as well, but  nevertheless there has been real work on privatization with  these people in this government, and everything that has been  done on privatization has been done in this line-up. So we have  experience of work in a friendly environment, a not entirely  friendly environment, and an entirely unfriendly environment.    [Svanidze] How is the environment now?    [Chubays] I am ready to answer that question as soon as the  new government line-up is announced.    [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, do you see yourself now more  as deputy prime minister or as a member of the Russia's Choice  bloc?    [Chubays] Both, to an identical degree. Furthermore, I think  it is important that Gaydar's actions too -- I think it has not  yet been fully understood, but they must be regarded not as the  actions of Yegor Gaydar personally but as the actions of the  leader of a major political bloc. I remind you, by the way,  that today Russia's Choice has the most seats in the State Duma,  significantly more than either Zhirinovskiy or the Interregional  group. Gaydar as an individual perhaps might have followed some  other line, but as leader of the bloc, he is acting as a leader  should act.    [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin is a firm man. How do you find working with him?    [Chubays] I don't think it would be proper for me to assess  my own actions, but I have worked and work in the government  only as long as I follow the line which I consider to be the  right one, which I can answer for. That means that I have  followed that line until today, and it is that line which I can  answer for.    [Svanidze] So the character of the leadership does not worry  you in this instance?    [Chubays] No, why do you say that? The character of the  leadership is very important for me, and I think that the  premier of the government has to be a firm man, that is his  duty. Otherwise there is nothing underpinning you, otherwise it  is simply impossible to work.    [Svanidze] In that respect Viktor Stepanovich's personal  qualities suit you?    [Chubays] From the point of view of the firmness of his  character, undoubtedly.    [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, we have a triangle here:  Viktor Chernomyrdin and his government, President Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and the reformist party bloc. Which of  them do you plan to be guided by the most?    [Chubays] Things have worked out in such a way that the job  I  do would be impossible without the president's personal support.  It would be impossible without the personal support of Gaydar,  and everything Gaydar did back in the first government from  1990. It would be impossible without the present government as  well. Relations have been quite complex within the government,  but in spite of that, the line has been maintained, and I remind  you that my version of the privatization program was adopted at  a session of the government a month ago. Therefore it is, if  you like, the work of several authors -- the president, the  government, and the Russia's Choice bloc, probably to varying  degrees.    [Svanidze] You are answering about your work, but I am  asking  about you, whom do you as a politician intend to follow? After  all, the president, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and the  reformers, let us say in Russia's Choice, do not occupy the same  positions on all issues.    [Chubays] I intend to follow the fulfillment of those  duties which I personally as a member of the government took on  before the people when I began the issue of privatization checks  on 1 October 1992, and I am compelled to discharge these duties  in full, all the more so as our program is fully supported by  Russia's Choice, and in the Russia's Choice program there is a  whole section on privatization, which I wrote myself.    [Svanidze] What stance do you think the president should now  be adopting: father of the nation, the supreme arbitrator, or a  person persistently following a definite line?    [Chubays] Undoubtedly the president is unable to choose some  kind of black or white position for himself. So it is a  question not of either one or the other, but of finding  correlations between degrees or measures. I am convinced that  the president will remain president as long as he remains the  guarantor of reform in Russia.    [Svanidze] But for how long will he be the guarantor of  reform in Russia, if we are talking about Yeltsin? At the  moment it is a question of whether he should weigh up all  positions, like the statue personifying justice, or whether he  should have political preferences of some kind.    [Chubays] He must undoubtedly have political preferences and  be guided by the reforms, but at the same time, he must of  course weigh up the balance of political forces.    [Svanidze] But he must demonstrate preferences?    [Chubays] I think so.    [Svanidze] Thank you. I remind you that you were watching  Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays live on Russian television on the  "Details" program. Goodbye.</p>

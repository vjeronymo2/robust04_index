			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: DID JACKIE CALL MARILYN'S BLUFF?  </P> <P>  -- A new book about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis says she once told Marilyn  Monroe that she would divorce President John F. Kennedy if Monroe would marry  him and move into the White House. C. David Heymann, author of the unauthorized  biography, "A Woman Named Jackie," said he got files from the Secret Service,  FBI and CIA under the Freedom of Information Act, obtained the former First  Lady's social files and interviewed 825 individuals. Onassis had no comment on  the book's content, her spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman, said. Actor Peter  Lawford, Kennedy's late brother-in-law, is quoted in an excerpt as saying that  Jacqueline Kennedy offered to step aside when the actress called her, but also  said that "if Marilyn wasn't prepared to live openly in the White House, she  might as well forget about it." Among other stories in the book, to be  excerpted in a supermarket tabloid and elsewhere, is one from Kennedy legal  consultant Langdon Marvin Jr. -- also now deceased, a publisher's spokeswoman  said -- about President Kennedy sneaking away from his Secret Service guards  for a sexual liaison without taking the codes he would need for retaliation in  the event of a nuclear attack. The book also says Kennedy had illicit sexual  encounters on the night of his inauguration and before the debates with Richard  M. Nixon.  </P> <P>  -- A daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and a son of Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr., who say the death penalty would not bring back their fathers, helped start  a campaign against capital punishment at the Center for Nonviolent Social  Change in Atlanta. M. Kerry Kennedy said some killers should be imprisoned  forever, but that executions "won't bring back my father; they'll only take  someone else's father." Martin Luther King III said: "If we believed in an eye  for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, most of us would be without eyes and  without teeth."  </P> <P>  -- Every father wants his son to achieve things he never did. So it was a  proud Evel Knievel who watched his son, Robbie, soar over the fountains at  Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, completing a motorcycle stunt that nearly killed  the elder Knievel. "That was for you, Dad. I love you," Robbie told his father,  who ran to hug him after the jump. "I'm not the greatest daredevil in the  world, I'm the father of the greatest daredevil in the world," Evel said. About  20,000 people watched the younger man's perfect 180-foot flight, among them a  brain surgeon and paramedics who stood by in case accidents ran in the family.  Evel was in a coma for 30 days after he tried the jump and missed in 1967. DAVE  JOHNSON  </P></p>

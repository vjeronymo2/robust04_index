			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "NATO Disregards Russia's Position"] </F>   [Text] The NATO Council does not have the authority to  make decisions on a Bosnian settlement, including decisions on  inflicting strikes inside Bosnia -- such decisions must be  adopted by the UN Security Council. So says a Russian Foreign  Ministry statement circulated at UN headquarters in New York as  a Security Council document.    The first day of open debate on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrated the three fundamental approaches  taken by the NATO member countries, Russia, and the Muslim  countries. The NATO countries' stance has not changed, they  still insist that the decision to carry out air strikes does not  require additional approval from the Security Council.  Evidently NATO will continue to disregard Russia's  diametrically opposed stance by preparing to undertake the first  ever military operation outside the bloc's zone of  responsibility. The representatives of the Muslim leadership of  Bosnia, and of Iran and Turkey, reflected the Muslim side's  stance in their speeches. They insisted that NATO attack  Serbian positions not only in Sarajevo but also in other parts  of Bosnia.    In all probability no one now knows how to coordinate the  largely polarized notions of a Bosnian settlement without  splitting the Security Council along cold war lines. A great  deal will depend on the actions taken by the conflicting sides  in Sarajevo over the next few days. Russia's proposal to  immediately convene the Security Council to examine practical  ways of demilitarizing Sarajevo and introducing a UN  administration there could, evidently, be a compromise solution.  That allows the NATO countries and Russia "to stick with their  friends," so to speak, while resolving what is the main task at  this stage -- the demilitarization of the Bosnian capital.  Russia did incidentally submit this initiative long before the  present deterioration in the situation in Bosnia and, had it  been accepted by its Western partners in a timely fashion, it  might have been possible to avoid the bloody drama in Sarajevo's  market that spurred NATO to decide on bombing raids. Real moves  to transfer Sarajevo to UN control could remove the threat of  air strikes.    Nonetheless the way to secure a lasting peace in Bosnia lies  in the formulation by the main interested parties -- the United  States, the EU, and Russia -- of a unified concept of a  political solution to the conflict. This was stated at the  Russian State Duma hearings Tuesday. Indeed, if these sides  want to keep Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unified state and member of  the United Nations they should first remember that after World  War II this republic was a state with three peoples -- Serbs,  Croats, and Muslims -- where all vital decisions were adopted by  consensus alone. Consequently, it is inadmissible at any stage  in the settlement process to take anyone's side in the conflict,  which may result in the escalation of the conflict. At the  moment the Muslim side alone benefits from the bombing threats.  The proposal made by the United States and most Islamic states  that the embargo on arms shipments to Bosnia be lifted is also  untenable since this means shipments of arms to the Bosnian  Muslims alone.    The latest news from Sarajevo is depressing. Serbian forces  have stopped handing over heavy arms to the "blue helmets" and  are demanding UN monitoring of the numerically superior Muslim  infantry. In its turn, the Muslim leadership is not showing  willingness to do this.</p>

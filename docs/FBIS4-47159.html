			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Kharchenko, UNIAN special for </F> Post-Postup: "Landyk Left for a Tiny Candle Factory and His  Flame Went Out"]    [Text] Deputy prime minister Valentyn Landyk  submitted his resignation effective May 20. Although his  resignation may not be accepted, these events indicate a change  in his status. Landyk was in charge of the oil and gas complex,  external economic relations, investments, allocation of  financial resources, and coordination of privatization. All of  these ventures were far from successful, but true to Ukrainian  political traditions he was not held accountable and his  resignation--if accepted--is entirely voluntary.    Landyk's views were well known. His monetary policy was that  "in transition to a market economy prices will increase several  fold!" As head of a committee responsible for managing hard  currency Landyk was better informed than most about our  disastrous situation: Ukraine can afford to import only 30  percent of essential goods that she needs. In foreign trade he  remained true to licenses, quotas, and strict control over  exports, particularly the concentration of export trade in a  hands of a few chosen exporters. He also favored moderate  privatization.    Perhaps Landyk was best characterized at a press conference  by his colleague Vasyl Yevtukhov: "When I became head of the  USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] I  attempted to reconcile differences between entrepreneurs and  industrialists, i.e., to integrate them. But I soon realized  that they were one and the same; there was no need for an  integration!" In Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's government Landyk was the  prototype amphibian, both a government official and an owner of  a `small candle-making concern' [in Russian] at the same time.  After graduation from the Kramatorsk Industrial Institute he  followed the usual career path: mechanical engineer, plant  manager, secretary of the party committee, and director. As a  director he was in time for the golden age of leasing and  renting of state property. The Donetsk "Elektropobutmash" plant,  for example, was initially leased and then transformed into the  "Nord" stock company. Nord was founded in 1991 by the workers at  the plant and the USSR Ministry of Defense with the latter  getting "only 70 percent of the voting stock" and the workers 30  percent. Now we can understand why some people are so worried  about "dissolution of economic ties with Russia" and favor "a  single economic market." Such abuses in ownership of state  property--which took place under the aegis of the parliamentary  moratorium declared on November 11, 1990--were declared illegal  by the Ukrainian parliament on February 14, 1992. As a Donetsk  newspaper pointed out--Nord management ignored the legislation  and at an international exhibit in Moscow this year did not even  raise the Ukrainian flag as did our other enterprises. We can  also understand much better the psychology of the owner of a  small candle-making concern who feels that access to hard  currency should be restricted to a selected few.    But we have to give Landyk his due. He never pretended to be  a reformer or a liberal and never used the rhetoric of the  `Harvard boys', although tact and such rhetoric might have been  useful in international relations in securing credits and  investments. Take for example the discussion Landyk and Valeriy  Shmarov had with Nichols Burns [sic], a senior directors of the  American National Security Council [sic]. The deputy prime  ministers made it clear that Ukraine will not undertake reforms  `immediately' [in English], that there is a `Ukrainian road to  capitalism', and so forth, but that the Western countries should  provide money for this capitalism at once.    Having spent a year as a curator of privatization and  foreign  economic relations, and appreciating the indefinite nature of  his job, Landyk--like so many of his friends--decided to run for  parliament. In the Lenin electoral district of Donetsk he  defeated a communist, and the only ward he lost was one where he  was portrayed as a rabid nationalist and savior of the Ukrainian  state. And so, on May 20, the deputy prime minister declared his  desire to be a deputy rather than a "whipping boy".    But what is the real reason for this move? If Roman Shpek  were to become the new prime minister there would be no reason  for Landyk to leave the government. If, on the other hand,  Zvyahilskyy were to remain in office then the relationship  between them would be strained. The problem started with the  stock holding company Ukrnaftohaz which was promoted by Landyk  and opposed by Zvyahilskyy ("Over my dead body!", if rumors are  to be believed). Nevertheless, the president signed the company  into existence on May 14 and even though the Zvyahilskyy was  seen alive thereafter, Landyk had overstepped his bounds and had  to leave.    Landyk may feel that he wasted eleven months of his life in  the Cabinet of Ministers. But the fact remains that inflation  has been controlled (never mind the means!), Ukraine's  involvement with CIS has been limited to that of an associate,  Ukrnaftohaz has been created, and Nord has escaped bankruptcy.  Who will follow him? Most like another 'strong man" with a  little candle-making business on the side. Deputy prime minister  Shmarov has already started making his move, having made offers  of jobs in the future cabinet to industrial directors.</p>

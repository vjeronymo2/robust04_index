			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Russian gas shares to be offered in the west Gasprom, the world's biggest gas producer, is to offer up to 10 per cent of its shares to foreign investors after completing in a month's time the biggest domestic flotation in Russia's privatisation programme. Mr Valery Remizov, deputy chairman of Gasprom, said yesterday it was too early to say when and where this 10 per cent stake would be offered to investors as the company was still working on a western-style presentation of its accounts and a market estimate for the value of its shares. But he confirmed that Gasprom was likely to offer some, if not all, the 10 per cent in the west. Following last Monday's public offering of 28.7 per cent of Gasprom at auctions for privatisation vouchers reserved for Russian citizens, Gasprom will also be buying 10 per cent of its own stock at its artificially low Russian book value, of just Rbs236.7bn (Pounds 89.7m). It is this 10 per cent which may be offered to foreigners. The aim is to enable Gasprom to re-sell these shares to the highest bidder to raise funds it needs to develop new deposits in the Yamal peninsula and elsewhere. Gasprom staff already own 15 per cent of the company, while another 5.2 per cent is being reserved for inhabitants of the Yamal-Nenetsk autonomous region in the far north. The state holds the remaining 42 per cent. Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gasprom's chairman, said yesterday it was 'pointless' using figures to illustrate the company's financial position, however, because not all customers in the former Soviet Union paid their bills. Although he said Gasprom earned Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn a year from exports to the west and last year sold Rbs36,000bn (Dollars 20bn) worth of gas to customers in the former Soviet Union, the latter still owed it Rbs5,000bn. This meant that little had been left over for investment and any profit figure existed 'only on paper'. The government on Monday launched a series of Gasprom auctions to be held in 60 regions of Russia for individuals holding privatisation vouchers - excluding even the Russian investment funds which have bought stakes in privatised Russian companies on behalf of small investors. 'We want to reserve this sale for ordinary citizens who have not yet used their vouchers,' Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, said yesterday. His aim is to ensure that all of Russia's 150m citizens use the voucher they received free of charge by the time the voucher programme expires on July 1. Mr Chubais, who fought stiff opposition to incorporating this jewel of Russian industry in the programme giving away shares to the public for vouchers, said he expected the sale to attract 20m vouchers, or up to 20m small shareholders.</p>

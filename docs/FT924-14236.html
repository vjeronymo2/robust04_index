			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: The productive life of a past master - A fine biography of G M Trevelyan G M TREVELYAN: A LIFE IN HISTORY by David Cannadine HarperCollins, Pounds 18, 288 pages TREVELYAN IS by far the best book that David Cannadine has written. It is well, if somewhat oddly, constructed. It neither bulges nor drifts. It is compact and the style colourful and emphatic as one would expect, but more sober than his journalism. The character of Trevelyan and his role in the writing of history have never been better described. Cannadine has had access to a wider range of archival material than was available to earlier researchers on Trevelyan's life and work and he has used this with great skill not only to correct errors but also to fill out Trevelyan's somewhat arid private life. The book has one oddity which I particularly dislike and find mannered and rather silly; each chapter has a picture of a building or landscape and a paragraph of rather wrought prose explains its significance to Trevelyan's life. The book's first chapter covers comprehensively, but briefly, the life and work and beliefs of Trevelyan. It is a masterly summary and could exist in its own right: if detached from the book it would make a most useful pamphlet for undergraduates. This is followed by four chapters dealing with facets of Trevelyan's extremely active and productive life: The Liberal Internationalist; The Whig Constitutionalist; The Rural Elegist; The Historian and the Reputation. Obviously there is some repetition. Trevelyan was a man of remarkable honesty with a deep sense of the moral duties both of the rich and the gifted He spoke his mind bluntly; he wrote sensitively about history. He sought the wisdom it contained and brooded on the almost insoluble problems he found, not only in the world about him, but also in his own vulnerable heart. He discovered the depths of his own personality in the isolation and loss that history embodies, yet his pessimism was tempered. Although a good Whig historian, Trevelyan never thought that the moral improvement of humanity would be commensurate with progress in science, technology, food supplies, transport and human organisation, yet he would probably have maintained that some moral progress had been made particularly by the Western industrialised powers over the last few centuries. This may have been hard to believe in 1930s, not easy in 1950s. By the 1990s his very limited confidence would have been more justifiable. Trevelyan said, and no one can disagree, that he was a man of letters: a writer of history, not a professional research historian. Walking in the dene at Hallington he made the distinction clear to me in six words, barked out in his appalling, grating voice: 'Namier - good research worker - no historian]' Then he broke wind like a blast of trumpets and his grey eyes and thin mouth displayed the mischievous side of him which Cannadine does not see or deliberately neglects. Indeed, for me, Cannadine takes Trevelyan, generous as he was to noble causes, a little too much at face value. Trevelyan loved to be close to men of power and loved being tugged reluctantly to the Papal chair. He preferred winners to losers and gentlemen to academics. And he was prudish to quite an unnatural degree. His reaction to his brother's illegitimate child (sired when Sir Charles was nearly 80) was excessive for a man of letters and even more for an aristocrat. I suspect a considerable amount of his gloom sprang from emotional, probably sexual difficulties - his marriage to Janet had, I am sure, grown stale with time for both of them. I do not believe that his breakdown as an undergraduate was due to overwork  -he discharged throughout his life an astonishing amount of work, day in, day out, year after year. Overwork is an excuse not a cause. Actually Cannadine is particularly good on the fullness of Trevelyan's professional life - although he is over kind - Trevelyan was a bad lecturer, (I could not get pupils to stay with his lectures in the 1930s), just as he was a thoroughly bad reader either of poetry or even of his own prose - and he was far too self-secure in these matters to realise his weakness or to do anything about it. Deep down in Trevelyan, there was a spring of gloom that fertilised the beauty of his prose, that haunting tenderness of his for those who were and are not - as numerous as the sands of the sea and as nameless: somewhere here he generalises himself to embrace and succour humanity and so moves us as few other historians have. Trevelyan looms in his books, as he did in life, a little larger than the rest of us. And Cannadine should not be too gloomy about his fate. Trevelyan is still read, still admired - not by historians maybe, but by scientists, industrialists, economists and civil servants. The culture and the civilisation of England's past which was Trevelyan's major field of endeavour, has not been obliterated yet, except perhaps by those who study it in academe. Buy and read Cannadine's book - give it away at Christmas - it is an excellent and splendid book but better still, buy Trevelyan's own works, they are even better.</p>

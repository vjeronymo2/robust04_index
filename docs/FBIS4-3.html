			<p>SUMMARY                               Pyongyang has used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement to hint that resolution of the  current impasse over nuclear inspections through direct  negotiations with the IAEA is still a possibility.                         END SUMMARY     Pyongyang's latest authoritative statement on the nuclear  inspection issue, a 31 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement, seemed to fall short of conditioning resolution of the  issue on the resumption of high-level bilateral talks with  Washington.  It also avoided ruling out direct negotiations with  the IAEA for further nuclear inspections.  In what appeared to be  deliberately vague phraseology, the statement said that Pyongyang  "would not oppose" solving the issue "through negotiations," if  Washington 1) stops attempting to apply "international pressure"  and 2) "proceeds with the reestablishment of the foundation of  the DPRK-U.S. talks" (Pyongyang radio, 31 March).  The statement  failed to specify who should "negotiate" with Pyongyang on the  inspection issue, what it means by "reestablishing the  foundation" for bilateral talks with Washington, or how to  "proceed" toward that goal.  Thus, Pyongyang appeared to leave  open the possibility that Pyongyang could start negotiating with  the IAEA on additional inspections before high-level U.S.-North  Korea talks reconvene--something Washington had been urging North  Korea to do.     Nevertheless, the statement left no doubt about Pyongyang's  preference for resuming bilateral talks with Washington first.  It declared that had the bilateral high-level talks previously  slated for 21 March in Geneva been held, "routine and ad hoc"  IAEA inspections could have resumed and the inter-Korean exchange  of special envoys would have taken place.  Implying that  Pyongyang still hopes to salvage bilateral talks, the statement  said that if Washington continues to "abuse" North Korea's  efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, it will "no longer" pin its  hopes on the DPRK-U.S. talks.     The statement attempted to explain the disagreement over recent  IAEA inspections by revealing what it depicted as the  understandings reached at a series of  working-level contacts  with U.S. officials in New York, meetings that preceded the  recent IAEA inspections in North Korea.  The statement claimed  that Washington had agreed at the talks that the IAEA would  conduct "strictly limited" inspections and had asked Pyongyang  not to publicize the "limited" nature of their agreement in order  to "save face."  It also alleged that the U.S. side had agreed to  attend the high-level talks once the IAEA inspections were made,  "irrespective of their results."     Conciliatory Tone     Demonstrating Pyongyang's aversion to being  seen as caving in to international pressure to make concessions  on the nuclear issue, the statement used the unprecedented(SEE  NOTE) format of a question-and-answer session with an  unidentified KCNA reporter, a format apparently designed to give  the impression that the spokesman is simply clarifying North  Korea's stance and not making any new proposals.  Yet, in sharp  contrast to the 21 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement,  which openly threatened North Korean withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, the 31 March statement contained no  threat, promising only that Pyongyang would "counter" any U.S.  pressure.  Although the statement repeated allegations of U.S.  bad faith, using words such as "faithless," "false promises," and  "unjustifiable preconditions" to describe Washington's action, it  was devoid of the kind of bluster that has marked recent North  Korean pronouncements.     (NOTE: Although Pyongyang media have occasionally carried a  Foreign Ministry spokesman's answers to questions that were  purportedly posed by KCNA reporters, they had not been observed  to carry their questions.)     Implications     The 31 March statement seemed designed to give  the impression that Pyongyang could still negotiate with the IAEA  to resolve the current nuclear impasse in return for some  symbolic gesture from Washington.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- A long-delayed atomic  reactor project by a government-financed power development  company is expected to get under way in northern Japan in May,  industry sources reported Saturday [2 April].    The sources said the Electric Power Development Co. aims to  reach agreement with the local fisheries organization on terms  of the project which has been pending for the past 11 years.    The company plans to build an experimental light-water type  reactor, known as the Advanced Thermal Converter Reactor (ATR),  to start operations in the year 2003.    The reactor can be remodeled to consume plutonium as fuel,  they said.    The sources said the company has to clear a major obstacle  before the project is launched -- high construction costs  inflated since the original plan was drawn up.    Construction costs, originally estimated at 396 billion yen,  have inflated 20 to 30 percent in the past 11 years, making it  inevitable for the company to review a cost sharing agreement  reached with electric power companies, they said.    The company, a joint venture between the government and nine  major electric power companies, is 66.6 percent owned by the  government and 33.4 percent by power firms.    The original agreement reached between the two parties calls  for the government and the power companies to shoulder one-third  of the cost each, with the remainder contributed by the Electric  Power Development Co.    The power companies, which have agreed to purchase  electricity generated at the plant at 15 yen per kilowatt, said  they will have to raise utility rates if the production cost  rises above the agreed level.    They argue that the importance of the ATR as a facility to  supply plutonium for fast breeder reactors has declined due to a  worldwide glut of natural uranium, the sources said.    The Science and Technology Agency and the Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. stressed the role to be played by  the ATR as a system to consume plutonium.    The corporation has been experimenting on the use of  plutonium with an ATR in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, since 1979.</p>

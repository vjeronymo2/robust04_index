			<p>BFN     [Text] The Transitional Executive Council's subcouncil on  defense will today decide on the future of the National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. A NPKF spokesman, Colonel Coenie van  Rensburg, said a new intake by the peace force will also not be  trained at De Brug. He said the various forces comprising the  peace force no longer have soldiers available. Col. van  Rensburg said members of the peace force, after several  incidents since their deployment on the East Rand, have not been  limited to their bases but are instead performing supporting  roles in conjunction with the Defense Force.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Cookery: Putting the heat on Easter bunnies HARES once were associated with pagan rites of spring. Perhaps that is why they are believed by some to be magical, slightly frightening creatures. Rabbits, altogether tamer, have developed links with Easter although, frankly, I see more commercial reasoning than Christian message in giving and receiving chocolate bunnies and greetings cards depicting winsome cotton tails bouncing through the daffodils. I prefer my rabbits in the cooking pot - and the more readers I can persuade to follow suit, the better pleased I shall be. Anything to cut down on the numbers of these destructive wild pests attacking my garden and others hereabouts. But the recipes which follow - one hot and one cold to suit the vagaries of UK weather - work every bit as well using farmed rabbit although cooking times will vary depending on the life style (pampered or scavenging) and the age of the bunny you use. Although the finished dishes are different enough to be suitable for serving on consecutive days (the first is a hot main course, the second a first course for serving cold), both involve poaching. So, it makes sense to cook all the meat simultaneously in the same pot. This saves time and fuel and brings the bonus of particularly flavoursome stock - a key ingredient in the second recipe. RABBIT TWO WAYS The common preliminaries for BOTH recipes are as follows: Joint two small rabbits neatly. If they are past the first flush of youth, marinate them overnight in the juice of a lemon with a good grinding of black pepper. Next day, bring 2 pt light rabbit or chicken stock to the boil in a large, heavy-based pan together with a bouquet of bay, thyme, and around half a dozen lightly-crushed parsley stalks. Add the rabbit joints and bring back to simmering point. Then, poach very gently - barely a bubble should wink at the brim - for 30 to 90 minutes depending on the age and status of the meat. When it is tender, switch off the heat and set the covered pan aside. RABBIT WITH CUMIN, APPLE &amp; CELERIAC (serves 4) Ingredients: the hindquarters and most of the saddles of both rabbits, cooked as described above; 1 very large celeriac root; 9-10 oz Cox, Royal Gala or other aromatic eating apple; a generous teaspoon cumin seed; 1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard; 1 1/2 oz butter. Method: Prepare and poach the rabbit joints as described and let them rest in the covered pan for 15-20 minutes between cooking and serving. The accompaniments can be prepared ahead (they keep well in a covered dish in a low oven for up to an hour) or they can be cooked while the rabbit rests. Scrub, peel and dice a generous 1 1/2 lb celeriac (this is the prepared weight required; trimmings can be saved for soup). Steam the celeriac for 10 minutes or so until tender, and blot dry. Peel and dice the apples and saute them for 5 minutes or so in a little of the butter. Mash the two ingredients together roughly: aim for a texture closer to good knobbly tweed than potato puree. Add the rest of the butter. Season with sea salt, mustard, pepper and most of the freshly-toasted and lightly-crushed cumin seed. Drain the hot, poached rabbit for serving, lay it on the bed of vegetables and sprinkle it with the rest of the cumin and a little chopped parsley. RABBIT BRAWN (serves 6-8) Ingredients: the forequarters of both rabbits and some of the saddle, prepared and cooked as described above; all the cooking liquor; 6-8 oz cooked gammon or ham carved from the bone in 1/2 inch-thick slices; 1 slightly rounded tablespoon gelatine powder; 3 tablespoons freshly-chopped coriander leaves; the finely-grated zest of a lemon; a few green peppercorns. Method: Leave the poached rabbit in the cooking pot until cold, then strip the meat from the bones (there should be 6-8 oz of flesh). Wrap the flesh to keep it moist and chill it. Return the bones to the pot (together with any bones saved from the other recipe) and simmer very gently, without a lid, until the stock is flavoured intensely and reduced to 1 1/2 pt. Strain the liquid, dissolve the gelatine in it and cool, then chill it until syrupy and approaching setting point. Spoon a little into 6-8 small ramekins, just enough to cover the bottom of each dish. Add a pinch of chopped coriander and refrigerate until set. Meanwhile, cut the rabbit meat into small quills and dice the gammon or ham. Mix the meats in a large bowl with the remaining coriander, the lemon zest, the bruised green peppercorns and the rest of the cool syrupy stock. Divide the mixture between the ramekins. Cover and chill for eight hours or until set. Unmould for serving, with a little greenery to garnish and thinly-sliced brown bread and butter on the side.</p>

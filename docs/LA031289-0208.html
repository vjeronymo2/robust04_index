			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BETWEEN STRANGERS SURROGATE MOTHERS, EXPECTANT FATHERS,  AND BRAVE NEW BABIES BY LORI ANDREWS (HARPER &amp; ROW: $18.95; 282 PP.);  </P> <P> RE-CREATING MOTHERHOOD IDEOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY IN A PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY BY  BARBARA KATZ ROTHMAN (W.W. NORTON: $18.95; 260 PP.)  </P> <P> City University sociologist Barbara Katz Rothman is one of the last people we  would expect to find arguing against a woman's right to become a surrogate  mother. Like Lori Andrews, a lawyer, journalist and leading advocate of  surrogacy, Rothman is a feminist who takes pride in having successfully worked  toward social liberalization: Supporting "Roe vs. Wade" by arguing that women  are capable of making informed reproductive decisions; suggesting ways for gay  and lesbian households to become "alternative kinds of family," not merely  "alternatives to the family"; contending that divorce does not "have to 'break'  families, but can sometimes blend and extend them." Surrogate mothering only  follows in step with these liberalizations, one might argue, offering a  recourse for the growing number of women in their middle to late 30s who have  found that fertility passed them by while they were pursuing education and  careers.  </P> <P> Though she doesn't admit it in "Re-creating Motherhood," Rothman did once  support surrogacy. In a 1982 article for Ms. magazine, she called it a  promising new form of "reproductive communism, with each giving according to  his or her ability." Since then, however, Rothman has become convinced that  surrogacy will only diminish our appreciation of the most primal human bond,  that between mother and child, encouraging us to view childbearing not as a  spiritually significant relationship, but as a form of labor. Rothman's dreams  of a "communistic" surrogacy have thus faded behind nightmare visions of "baby  farms" where "the Third World women in America," "the women who are now pushing  white babies in strollers, will be seen carrying white babies in their  bellies." Rothman sometimes allows her visions to carry her arguments to almost  comic extremes, suggesting that babies might one day be bred and marketed like  "chickens at Holly Farms." The analogy is powerful, suggesting that surrogate  children are commodities, but Rothman offers no evidence that surrogacy will  exploit them or cause them to be any less loved by their families.  </P> <P> While Andrews argues reservedly, standing behind testimonials and polls showing  that Americans support surrogacy by a 2 to 1 margin, she does suggest a  workable solution to current anxieties about surrogacy: A bill (now vegetating  in the New York state legislature) that permits surrogacy after psychological  and medical testing of all parties and that allows the surrogate mother to make  all medical decisions (including abortion) during pregnancy. "Re-creating  Motherhood" remains the more powerful and heartfelt book, however. While  questionable for its call to ban surrogacy, it is eloquent in defending the  dignity of motherhood and in showing how it has become devalued. Rothman writes  of billboard ads, for example, that showed two newborn footprints, one from a  full-term and one from a premature infant. Asking, "Guess which baby's mother  smoked while pregnant?," the ads presented "mothers as 'bad workers' producing  'flawed products,' " Rothman writes, adding that she looked "in vain for the ad  that says 'Guess which baby's mother tried to get by on welfare?' . . . 'Guess  which baby's mother didn't get prenatal care?' "  </P></p>

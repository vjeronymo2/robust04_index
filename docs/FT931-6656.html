			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / US growth hits 4.8% in 4th quarter THE US economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, the fastest pace since the end of 1987, revised Commerce Department figures indicated yesterday. The new figures, which represent an upward revision of 1 percentage point on the initial estimates a month ago, indicate the economy was growing robustly during the closing stages of last year's election campaign when former President George Bush was widely condemned for failing to revive the economy. Few forecasters expect the fourth-quarter growth rate to be sustained in the early months of 1993, mainly because consumption ran ahead of incomes and because US exports are expected to be hit by the slowdown in Europe and Japan. But most are confident that the US is now set for several years of annual growth of about 3 per cent. The recent fall in long bond yields to below 7 per cent is expected to lead to further increases in business investment which grew at an annual rate of nearly 10 per cent in the fourth quarter. Other figures yesterday were mildly disappointing. An index of consumer confidence compiled by the University of Michigan fell slightly this month, partly because of adverse reaction to higher taxes announced by President Bill Clinton last week. The very strong GDP figures, however, may strengthen the hand of conservative Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are arguing that Mr Clinton's Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) short-term stimulus package of infrastructure spending and investment incentives is no longer needed. Critics argue that Mr Clinton should press ahead more quickly with spending cuts needed to bring down the budget deficit. The administration, however, continues to emphasise the slow rate of job creation and the relatively high unemployment rate. The fourth-quarter expansion followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter. It was the seventh successive quarter of growth following the official end of the recession in the spring of 1991. Revisions to net exports accounted for about half of the upward revision to fourth-quarter growth, according to Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at J P Morgan. Real exports grew at an annual rate of 9.8 per cent relative to the third quarter, against 3.7 per cent in initial estimates.</p>

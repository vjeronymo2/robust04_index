			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In recent weeks, scores of collaborators with  Israel have received blue Israeli identity cards. This came  after the PLO, in its negotiations with Israel, refused to issue  a general amnesty for collaborators.    This identity card permits collaborators and their families  to live wherever they wish in Israel. A large number of  collaborators have expressed their intention to reside in Arab  villages within the Green Line. [passage omitted]</p>

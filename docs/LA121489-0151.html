			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET SCIENTISTS TO VISIT 2 KEY 'STAR WARS' LABS;  </P> <P> ARMS CONTROL: A U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS THE TOUR IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS OPENING A  'WIDE WINDOW INTO EACH OTHER'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.'  </P> <P> A delegation of top Soviet scientists, led by the chief negotiator at the  strategic arms reduction talks in Geneva, will arrive Friday in Southern  California for an unprecedented tour of a sensitive "Star Wars" research  facility near San Clemente.  </P> <P> The Soviets' two-day visit to Orange County will be shrouded in secrecy. Except  for a brief picture-taking session when the 10-member delegation touches down  at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, neither the press nor the  public is invited to take part.  </P> <P> "This is essentially an extension of the (Geneva) talks," a senior Bush  Administration official said Wednesday. "Those talks are confidential between  the two governments."  </P> <P> Three senior U.S. officials discussed the week-long Soviet visit to the United  States at a briefing Wednesday, but they spoke on the condition that they not  be identified by name.  </P> <P> In addition to touring TRW Inc.'s Strategic Defense Initiative research  facility on Saturday, the Soviets will spend two days early next week at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where other SDI research is in  progress.  </P> <P> Also known as "Star Wars," the SDI program would create a partial shield  against incoming nuclear ballistic missiles in part by stationing powerful  lasers and other high-tech weaponry on rockets and satellites. The Soviet Union  in recent years has been conducting similar research.  </P> <P> At the TRW Capistrano Test Site, located on 2,000 acres of unincorporated land,  the Soviet scientists will inspect a powerful chemical laser.  </P> <P> Currently in the early stages of development, the laser eventually could be  enlarged and installed on a space-based platform to test its ability to detect  and destroy incoming ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. Such tests  are planned for the middle to late 1990s, according to the Strategic Defense  Initiative Organization, the Defense Department unit that oversees the project.  </P> <P> At the Los Alamos laboratory, the Soviet delegation will examine a project to  develop rocket-mounted devices that would generate powerful beams of atomic  particles intended to either identify or destroy incoming missiles.  </P> <P> Neither project is classified, but this is the first time that Soviet  scientists will be permitted to inspect the SDI laboratories where American  scientists are working and the hardware they are working on, officials said.  </P> <P> The Soviet visit is scheduled to begin less than two weeks after the United  States laid on the table in Geneva a proposal for a new Defense in Space  Treaty. The proposed treaty is an attempt to set ground rules for development  of space-based defense systems.  </P> <P> A key element of the U.S. proposal is reciprocal laboratory visits, in addition  to mutual observation of tests, annual data exchanges and joint briefings, one  official said.  </P> <P> The tour of the two SDI research units, another official said, is intended to  demonstrate to the Soviets how reciprocal visits might work.  </P> <P> "We believe that visits to laboratories are essential if the sides are to gain  an early and wide window into each other's research activities," the official  said.  </P> <P> The Soviet official who will lead eight scientists and a Soviet Foreign  Ministry official on the two SDI tours is Ambassador Yuri Nazarkin, head of the  Soviet delegation to strategic arms and space defense talks in Geneva. The  negotiations include both weapons in space and the strategic arms reduction  talks (START).  </P> <P> The American invitation was extended last September by Secretary of State James  A. Baker III during a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Soviets so far have not invited American  scientists to visit any of their space defense research facilities.  </P> <P> As originally proposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, SDI would have  shielded the nation with an impenetrable blanket of space-based defenses.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, the EPA requests comments on the use of boiler feed water flow as an alternative method for continuously monitoring load for steam-generating MWC's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the EPA is considering allowing the use of the continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate to measure maximum capacity for both steam-generating MWC's, as well as those MWC's that do not generate steam. These types of monitors are based on ultrasonic, thermal, or differential pressure methods, and are now being required as part of the EPA's Acid Rain Program (40 CFR part 75). The EPA requests comments on whether continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate monitors are adequately demonstrated and accurate methods for determining compliance with the load level requirements, and if they should be allowed as an alternative to the use of the ASME PTC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the NSPS, MWC's would establish a site-specific maximum flue gas temperature at the final PM control device inlet demonstrated during their most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Similar to the provisions for establishing a maximum load level measurement, the maximum demonstrated PM control device inlet temperature is established as the maximum 4-hour block average temperature measured during the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. The MWC must then be operated so that the temperature at the final PM control device inlet does not exceed this level by more than 17  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (30  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) (4-hour block average basis).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Operator Certification and Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed NSPS would require full operator certification of all MWC shift supervisors and MWC chief facility operators by the ASME or a State certification program. The proposed standards would also require that at least one of the following persons be on duty at all times during which the MWC is combusting waste: A fully certified chief facility operator, a fully certified shift supervisor, or a provisionally certified control room operator. A provisionally certified control room operator would be allowed to ``stand in'' during times a fully certified chief facility operator or shift supervisor is offsite. These requirements would become effective on the date of promulgation of the NSPS or 6 months after startup of a new MWC, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed NSPS would require each owner or operator of an MWC plant with an aggregate capacity greater than 35 Mg/day to develop and maintain a site-specific training manual and to review it with all employees associated with the operation of the MWC (including MWC maintenance personnel, crane/load operators, and ash handlers). The manual and training would be updated annually. This site-specific training requirement would be effective on the date of promulgation of the NSPS or 6 months after startup of a new MWC, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 129 of the Act of 1990 requires the EPA to develop and promote a model program for the training and certification of MWC operators. Section 129 specifies that ``any person with control over processes affecting emissions from a unit'' must successfully complete an acceptable training program. Consistent with section 129, today's proposed revisions would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators to complete the EPA or a State MWC operator training course before operating an MWC or within 6 months following promulgation of the standards, whichever is later. The EPA has developed a model training program and has distributed it to State air pollution control agencies, EPA regional offices, and MWC industry groups. This model training program could be used to fulfill this requirement and prepare for the ASME certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Nitrogen Oxides Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards include a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control requirement for MWC's at large plants and would require these MWC's to meet a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission limit of 180 ppmv (corrected to 7 percent O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , dry basis, on a 24-hour daily average basis). A ``no control'' NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission limit for MWC's at small plants is also proposed and is discussed in section VII of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Siting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Siting requirements are being proposed for all new MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. These siting requirements are not included in the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. The siting requirements would include the following three components: (1) A siting analysis, (2) a materials separation plan, and (3) public meetings. The siting analysis would address the impact of the facility, taking into account other major industrial facilities near the proposed site, on ambient air quality, visibility, soils, vegetation, and other factors that may be relevant in determining that the benefits of the proposed facility significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location and construction. The materials separation plan would summarize materials separation requirements for the facility and its service area. Following public meetings on the siting analysis and materials separation plan, the facility would be required to prepare transcripts of the public meetings and summaries of comments and responses for the public meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Fly Ash/Bottom Ash Fugitive Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standards are proposed for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive dust emissions from ash handling and storage facilities at all MWC's at plants above 35 Mg/day capacity. The proposed standards would establish a no visible emissions limit for fly ash/bottom ash handling and would apply to ash handling, conditioning, loading and storage buildings, any external ash conveyors, ash transfer points, or ash handling activities (e.g., truck loading), and any other area at the facility that is a potential source of fly ash or bottom ash fugitive emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Comparison of the 1991 NSPS and Today's Proposed NSPS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subpart Ea NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 and today's proposed subpart Eb standards both include emission limits for dioxins/furans, PM, SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HCl, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; however, today's proposed standards for most of these pollutants are more stringent than the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991. The February 11, 1991 NSPS did not address Cd, Pb, Hg, or fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions, but these pollutants are included in today's proposal. Also, today's proposal would apply to all MWC units at plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day, whereas the February 11, 1991 NSPS only included MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day. A comparison of the 1991 NSPS and the proposed NSPS emission limits for these pollutants is shown in table 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

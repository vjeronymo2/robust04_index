			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Ui-chun] </F>   [Text] The ROK and the United States on 11 March  reconfirmed their position that full and satisfactory nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  must be conducted and that the inter-Korean exchange of special  envoys must actually be held in order to hold the third round of  North Korean-U.S. high-level talks.    It was also learned that in the high-level meeting on the  North Korean nuclear issue held at the Foreign Ministry today,  the ROK and U.S. Governments agreed that if North Korea agrees  to conduct an envoy exchange by 21 March, the third round of  North Korean-U.S. talks will be postponed for the same amount of  days it takes for North Korea to actually conduct an exchange of  special envoys.    Present at the meeting were working-level officials from  relevant ROK ministries and agencies, such as the Chongwadae  [presidential office], National Unification Board, Foreign  Ministry, Defense Ministry, and the Agency for National Security  Planning, headed by Kim Sam-hun, the ROK Foreign Ministry's  nuclear ambassador, and the U.S. side was composed of  working-level officials from the White House, the State  Department, and the Defense Department, headed by Robert  Gallucci, assistant secretary of state.    It has also been learned that the two countries agreed that  if North Korea does not properly guarantee IAEA inspections and  does not agree to the envoy exchange, the announcement on the  third round of talks and the suspension of the Team Spirit-94  joint military exercise will be withdrawn, and the two countries  will push ahead with the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise.    The ROK and the United States agreed that if the third round  of North Korean-U.S. talks are held, North Korea's full return  to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, special inspection of  the undeclared nuclear sites, assistance in the replacement with  light-water moderated reactors, and improvement of North  Korean-U.S. relations will be dealt with comprehensively  [pogwalchoguro].    The two countries evaluated the current status of the IAEA  inspections and the last two rounds of the inter-Korean working  contacts, and agreed that, on the whole, the IAEA's nuclear  inspection has proceeded smoothly so far and that a last-minute  settlement of the issue on exchanging special envoys remained  possible.</p>

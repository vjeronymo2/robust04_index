			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Victoire bid talk hits CU The recent strong performance by Commercial Union, the insurance group, was stopped in its tracks by growing speculation that the company is about to launch a full or partial bid for Groupe Victoire, the insurance company owned by Companie de Suez, the French financial services company. The Victoire bid stories have been circulating in London and throughout European financial centres for some time, but up until now have largely been discounted by UK insurance analysts. CU is the UK's largest composite insurer, measured by market capital-isation. Suez chairman Mr Gerard Worms said on French television on Wednesday evening that a decision on Victoire's future would be announced at Suez's shareholders meeting on June 15. Suez is believed to have received two bids for Victoire, with Italy's Generali said to have been one bidder and CU strongly rumoured as the other. Yesterday, Generali acknowledged that it had bid for Victoire but said it had withdrawn the offer. Insurance specialists said that any move by CU for Victoire, which would cost in excess of Pounds 1.2bn, would almost certainly have to be accompanied by a fund-raising move, either via a straight rights offer or convertible bond issue. A move to buy Victoire's life operations would cost in the region of Pounds 600m. There were other reasons behind the weakness in CU. NatWest Securities published a note describing the stock as 'overvalued', while the shares figured prominently in a big trading programme weighted on the sell side. At the close CU shares were 23 weaker at 538p.</p>

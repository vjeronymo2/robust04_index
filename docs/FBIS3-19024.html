Hofland: "The Spreading of the </F> Scandal"]    [Text] The scandal occupying U.S. politics under the  collective name of Whitewater is approaching the point where it  will become too big to be tamed. It is just like the legendary  laboratory rat which has received too many growth hormones and  is now showing signs of growing into a monster of Spielberg-like  dimensions. As is the case with scandals, it is being  cheerfully fed by the many people who have an interest in the  destruction of the suspected victims. It is an omnivore of  rumors, revelations, hatred, pleasure in the misfortune of  others, panic, good intentions and the regular people's court of  investigations. If it is not killed in time, then it will  outgrow everyone, as happened with Watergate, which cost more  people than Nixon their political life. Seen from a distance,  the scandal is growing into a play where witches' cabals,  purification and self-destruction can no longer be separated  out. At this stage Whitewater already stands for an innumerable  quantity of suspicions, errors, contradictory interests, shadowy  affairs, embezzlements, a whole which in itself asks for  clarifications. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: This  could well last for a long time.    The U.S. scandal, in addition to being theatre along the  lines of drama, is also an obstacle which has virtually halted  foreign policy. When Joseph McCarthy declared that he had a  list of 254 members of the communist party who had infiltrated  the State Department, he kept Eisenhower's and Dulles' hands  full with more than a year of work. Watergate meant a temporary  end to the rest of the world for the Americans. Reagan proved  to have more understanding of scandal management. While the  evidence piled up about his involvement in, or at least  knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal, his enemies did not  succeed in damaging his presidency. He could not be disturbed  as he continued to fight the evil empire and then wind down the  Cold War. That was genius. When Bush took over, the  Republicans' front had closed up again, the confusion about the  smoldering scandal worked against his opponents and the urgency  had disappeared.    The Whitewater affair is totally different. At present  everything would indicate that the zenith has yet to be reached.  It is difficult to say how much hatred has been generated by  Clinton over the last two years. He successfully pushed his  affair with Jennifer Flowers into the background during the  election campaign. He managed to overcome the disadvantages of  his Vietnam past, he did not go there. Attempts to reveal  others affairs have been derailed. His plan to reform the  health care system is arousing fanatical opposition. The fact  that the economy is recovering well under a Democratic  presidency is not putting the Republicans in a good mood.  Everything is contributing at present to making Whitewater the  occasion for revenge.    We know that after the end of the Cold War, U.S. interest in  West Europe weakened considerably. The first cause is the  concentration on the big domestic issues, the second is the  European incapacity to solve the conflict in Bosnia. Other  priorities are emerging within the limited field of Washington's  interests. Last year at approximately this time the bomb  exploded under the World Trade Center. Those responsible have  been imprisoned for life. The initial investigation and trial  led to a suspicion that they are part of a wider conspiracy.  The suspicion has become stronger with the attack last week on  four orthodox Jewish students, one of whom has in the meantime  died. In the background the fear is growing that the conflict  between Israel and the Arabs is being extended to New York.    The unmasking of a CIA agent as a Russian spy has not  boosted  confidence in this famous secret service. Many murders occur in  the United States, ever greater efforts to fight them are taking  place, but political crimes and political terrorism  traditionally arouse extra opposition, as shown by the fate of  the Rosenbergs and Sacco and Vanzetti. Because then the efforts  have to be mobilized against foreigners with dangerous political  intentions.    The latest indication that Washington wants the least  possible involvement with problems in Europe, be it West,  Central or East, can be found in the visit by Shevardnadze, once  a faithful interlocutor of Reagan and now president of a  distant, small country in a civil war. It is rare that a  visiting president has been pushed into the well of oblivion so  quickly, although he did receive a promise of $70 million in all  sorts of aid, but without any perspective of U.S. participation  in a UN peace force.    The Whitewater scandal is developing in these circumstances.  Even if things turn out well for the Clintons, in any case they  will certainly have their hands full for a good time. This  means that West Europe will be able to count on a U.S. presence  even less than during the last two to three years. Fourteen  days ago U.S. fighters under the supervision of NATO shot down  four Serbian planes. The Europeans will have to content  themselves with that example. As long as Whitewater lasts,  Europe will have to clean things up itself.    Politics are surprising. The only person who will presently  be benefiting from an investment project in Arkansas 16 years  ago, and the obscurity which followed it, is the ethnic chief  Karadzic, who is investing in death and destruction.</p>

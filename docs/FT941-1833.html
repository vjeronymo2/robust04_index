			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mark time awaiting US news European equity markets marked time yesterday in advance of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to raise the federal funds rate by from 3.25 to 3.50 per cent, as they watched for clues from Washington. Before the close of trading on European bourses the only guidance available was that the committee was still reviewing economic conditions and had not yet discussed the direction it wanted to set for interest rates over the coming eight-week period. FRANKFURT consolidated its position with a day's gain in the Dax index of 10.06 to 2,141.34, but off from the session high of 2,155.31. Traders said that a weakening in the futures market contributed to the easing. Turnover was modest at DM7.6bn. The banking sector attracted attention with further results due out in the next couple of weeks. James Capel, in a research note issued on Monday, noted that its forecasts for 1994-95 had been shaded down for two main reasons. It said: 'We have probably been too optimistic for the pace of recovery in terms of lending growth and falling bad debts.' The note added: 'This years trading profits have been adversely affected by the markets' reaction to the trend reversal in US interest rates'. Bayerishe Hypo, which pleased the market with results yesterday, added DM1.50 to DM469, while Bayerishe Vereinsbank, results due later this week, gained DM2 to DM491. Volkswagen, up DM3.50 at DM490.50, strengthened on hopes of good 1993 figures due tomorrow. ZURICH finished higher as domestic institutional buyers returned at current lower prices but the day's best levels were not maintained. The SMI index rose 20.4 to 2,824.7, after a high of 2,843.3. Ciba registered rose SFr40 to SFr855: the company has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a rival to Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Nestle, with results due this week put on SFr21 to SFr1,241. Sandoz, with results scheduled for tomorrow, rose SFr50 to SFr3,920 amid suggestions that the introduction of its Lescol cholesterol drug could spark a price war in the US. Georg Fischer rose SFr50 to SFr1,310: the mechanical engineering group said it expected to break even in this year after a 1993 loss of SFr34m. Holderbank rose SFr3 to SFr963 in response to its 12.3 per cent rise in 1993 net profit. PARIS fell back from its session high in a volatile session, the CAC-40 index finally closing down 2.01 at 2,200.68. The index moved between a high of 2,222.52 and a low of 2,196.12. BNP, which the government said would have its stake in UAP cut from 19 per cent to 15 per cent as part of the insurers privatisation, lost FFr2.70 to FFr251.80. UAP was unchanged at FFr189.90. AMSTERDAM drifted down, with the AEX index losing 1.91 to 414.33. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group, which repeated its forecast that 1994 earnings per share were set to rise, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 53.80. In a separate development PTT, the Dutch post and telephone utility, announced that its first tranche of shares could be floated on June 7. MILAN was steady, helped by the positive early tone in other European markets and having found technical support at Monday's lower levels. The Comit index edged 0.34 lower to 664.68 as election uncertainties remained at the centre of attention. Industrials led the way. Fiat rose L61 to L4,999, Pirelli L58 to L2,431 and Montedison L43 to L1,238. Olivetti put on L65 to L2,593 as hopes remained high for a swift decision on Italy's second mobile telephone licence. ISTANBUL fell 4.8 per cent, wiping out Monday's gains, in uncertain trade ahead of Monday's local elections. The composite index lost 747.76 to 14,838. The elections are viewed as a key test of whether Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition government can be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis. Analysts agree that the election will be followed by sharp price rises as the government relaxes restraints on loss making state run companies, but observers are divided on what effect the polls will have on financial markets, hit by a plunging lira and soaring interest rates.

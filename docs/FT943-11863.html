			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Troubled health authority 'concealed information' Debt forecasts for South Birmingham District Health Authority last year jumped from Pounds 12m to Pounds 16m in a month because 'information had been concealed to feed out bad news in increments', the Commons public accounts committee said in a critical report yesterday. It says financial controls in the troubled authority were so poor that it failed to recover Pounds 3m owed by other health authorities. South Birmingham, West Midlands Regional Health Authority and the government's National Health Service Executive all shared some responsibility for failure to address the problems, it adds. The committee says it was not clear why a former chief executive and finance director of the South Birmingham authority, who were 'in effect dismissed from their posts', had subsequently been working as NHS consultants. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, acknowledged that the report addressed 'serious matters' - but said a range of remedial actions had already been taken. This new criticism of poor financial controls in the NHS comes as the government is about to announce the results of a review aimed at streamlining central administration and reducing bureaucracy. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, set up the review last year to determine the future shape of the Department of Health now that much decision-making has been devolved to local level. Senior staff at the department's headquarters in Whitehall and the Leeds-based NHS Executive, which has day-to-day managerial responsibility for the service, have been told to stand by for an announcement on the outcome of the review today. It is certain to lead to job losses at both locations, in addition to cuts which are arising from amalgamations of regional health authorities. The British Medical Association yesterday told its members not to negotiate local pay schemes with trust hospital managements as part of its resistance to government proposals to introduce performance-related pay for doctors. A special national conference to protest against the plans has been called by the BMA for August 31.</p>

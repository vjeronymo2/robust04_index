			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / IMF to support Brazilian debt revision with commercial banks THE International Monetary Fund plans to provide a letter of support to a debt restructuring agreement by Brazil and its commercial bank creditors, even though the government is out of compliance with an IMF stand-by loan programme. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, has indicated to Brazilian officials that he would provide a positive letter in support of the agreement when it is offered to banks, probably later this year. This is unlikely to be sufficient, however, to satisfy the banks unless the government returns to compliance with the IMF. It failed to meet first and second quarter targets under the fund agreement which it entered in January. Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman of Chase Manhattan bank of the US, which has Dollars 1.07bn (Pounds 620m) of loans outstanding to Brazil, said Brazil's failure to meet IMF conditions for the management of its economy would constitute a serious obstacle to completion of the debt deal. However, he added that the debt agreement was 'far from academic', despite the corruption scandal surrounding Brazilian President Fernando Collor. Mr Labrecque said Brazil's bank creditors are hopeful that any change in the government would not be too disruptive. A detailed agreement was reached this week by negotiators for the government and the banks. That must now be translated into Portuguese and approved by the Brazilian Senate before it can be offered to all Brazil's bank creditors. This will take more than a month, even if the decision is not held up by the corruption scandal involving Mr Collor. In Braslia last night, the nine judges of Brazil's Supreme Court ruled, during a nationally televised session, that the forthcoming vote in Congress on whether it shall hold an impeachment process against Mr Collor is to be open, and that it is to take place early next week as originally scheduled by the chairman of the House of Representatives. Mr Collor was believed to have more chance of survival if the vote were secret, and if it were delayed until after the municipal elections of October 3, thus giving him more time to present his defence and to rally support in the House. A two-thirds majority there is required to start such a process against the president. An extraordinary session of Congress was called for last night so that the special commission on impeachment could discuss Mr Collor's defence papers, filed on Tuesday night. These make no attempt to exonerate the president, but criticise the Congressional inquiry on the corruption scandal and - in a bid to win more time - demand that 20 witnesses be called. An agreement by the Argentine government and its leading bank creditors, announced yesterday, should allow signature of a debt restructuring accord by the end of next month, a senior banker said yesterday. It commits banks to take at least 35 per cent of discount bonds offered under the restructuring, the less attractive to most banks of the two types of bonds on offer. 'The attitude of many banks is that they want to have the deal completed as soon as possible,' said Mr William Rhodes, Citicorp vice-chairman.</p>

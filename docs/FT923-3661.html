			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Pretoria toughens line against ANC THE South African government yesterday stepped up its propaganda campaign against the African National Congress in the wake of the Ciskei massacre, appealing to the United Nations to put pressure on the ANC to stop what it called 'provocative actions which put at risk the lives of innocent South Africans'. The appeal came in a 21-page memorandum from Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, and the Security Council. Pretoria asked for a UN representative to visit the country urgently to mediate between the government and ANC. Relations between the two sides have fallen to new lows after the Ciskei shooting. Mr Botha warned the government was ready to 'take steps of a coercive nature' to handle violence. UN monitors, deployed as a result of the July visit of UN envoy Cyrus Vance, are to arrive within days. As Mr Botha released the memorandum to the press, the ANC's top policy-making body, the National Working Committee, met for a second day to determine its response to the Ciskei shooting, for which it holds Pretoria responsible. The committee is understood to be split between militants who believe all negotiations with the government should be abandoned, and moderates who argue that negotiation is South Africa's only chance. Winnie Mandela, estranged wife of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, has resigned her top posts in the movement because of 'a vicious and malicious' campaign against her, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. In a statement issued late on Wednesday night, Mrs Mandela said she had resigned from the ANC's policy-making national executive committee and its women's league.</p>

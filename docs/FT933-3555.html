			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Mercedes puts France on list for new plant FRANCE was identified by Mercedes-Benz at the weekend as the fourth short-listed production site for the German manufacturer's 200,000 units-a-year small car project. The others are the UK, the Czech Republic and Germany itself. The disclosure is certain to intensify rivalry among the short-listed countries to attract one of the most prestigious greenfield projects in the motor industry's recent history. In the UK 'there will be as many bids as there are local authorities that know about it', said a government official. He also suggested the project 'will need development funding, so will have to go to a selective assistance area'. Senior Department of Trade and Industry officials in London would not comment on what stage the assessment process had reached and what role the DTI might be playing. However, the Northern Development Corporation, whose area includes the Nissan plant at Sunderland, said it had already responded to a DTI request made last week for details of potentially suitable 250-300-acre sites in its area. The west Midlands, Merseyside and north and south Wales are expected to be among the front-runners in the UK for the project. Welsh development agency officials were at the weekend shedding no light on their involvement. However, they are likely to be encouraged in their own bid for the venture by the recent rapid growth of the motor components industry in Wales and the success of German motor components giant Robert Bosch in establishing a Pounds 100m (Dollars 154m) components manufacturing centre in South Wales, and that of Toyota, whose Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside in north Wales has just begun component exports to Japan as well as supplying engines to Toyota's car plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire. That the Mercedes assessment process is still at a very early stage was indicated by apparent surprise in both Paris and Prague that the project might be up for grabs. 'German companies have a strategic interest in the Czech Republic generally, but I have not heard of any discussions on this specific project,' a senior Czech official said. It would not be the first time Mercedes has examined the Czech Republic as a possible production site. It discussed a possible Dollars 250m joint venture with two Czech truck makers earlier this year, but the talks broke down in March. Spain is likely to be concerned it is not to be included in the short-list. Its low labour costs have attracted significant German and Japanese motor industry investment in recent years. However, it has been jolted by warnings from Nissan that its operations need to make sharp productivity and quality improvements.</p>

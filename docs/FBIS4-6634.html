			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra April 21 (CTK) -- The current visit of  Josef Zieleniec to Australia is the first visit by the Czech  foreign minister to the continent since the appearance of the  independent Czech Republic.    Before Zieleniec arrived in Australia, the last stop-over on  his current foreign tour, during which he also visited Vietnam  and Malaysia, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans stressed  that the Czech Republic was playing an ever greater role in  Central Europe. He voiced the conviction, which he reiterated at  a joint news conference with Zieleniec today, that the Czech  Republic had achieved great progress in its political and  economic reform since the 1989 revolutionary change.    Speaking after short talks with Zieleniec, Evans said that  the talks concerned both bilateral and regional problems and  could serve as a basis for firmer cooperation.    Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic was interested in  cooperation in traditional branches -- engineering and the glass  industry and that it would also be ready to export Czech beer to  Australia, regardless of the highly competitive environment in  this field.    Zieleniec expressed gratitude to Australia for receiving  Czech citizens who had to leave the communist Czechoslovakia.  At present these people served as a link between the two  countries which helped promote Czech-Australian trade, he added.    On the Czech Republic's joining NATO, Zieleniec said that it  was not a question of immediate security. Membership was  important from a long-term perspective as Central Europe had  always been a subject for fights between East and West and it  would be difficult for the Czech Republic to exist without  certain security guarantees, he said, adding that the Czech  Republic wanted to be a member of the West European family.    Zieleniec's visit follows Czech Economics Minister Karel  Dyba's visit to Australia last August during which an agreement  on mutual support and protection of investment was signed. The  two countries want to start talks this year on the next  agreement -- an agreement on the prevention of double taxation.    Czech-Australian trade reached 48.6 million USD last year.  The Czech Republic exports to Australia chiefly glass and  textile products and power equipment and imports mostly wool.  However, imports of Australian wool to the Czech Republic have  been diminishing considerably.    Since the '80's Australia has been markedly orienting itself  towards cooperation within the Asian-Pacific region and was an  initiator of the Council for Economic Cooperation for Asia and  the Pacific (APEC) which resulted in a dramatic change in the  structure and content of Australian trade. More than half of  Australian exports currently go to East Asia while formerly they  went mostly to Europe and the United States. On the other hand,  East Asian goods make up a third of Australian imports.</p>

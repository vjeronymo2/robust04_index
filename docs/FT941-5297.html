			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Business mission flies to Malaysia A group of leading British businessmen, including Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and a former cabinet minister, has flown to Kuala Lumpur in an attempt to persuade the Malaysian government to lift its trade ban on UK companies. The group includes Sir Charles Powell, a director of Trafalgar House and former foreign affairs adviser to Mr John Major and Lady Thatcher. It is engaged in an intense round of private diplomacy with Malaysian officials to try to reverse the ban. There were conflicting signs over whether this new mission could persuade Dr Mahathir Mohammad, the Malaysian prime minister, to reverse his policy, which followed allegations in British newspapers that UK companies had offered bribes to Malaysia's politicians in return for contracts. Some British industrialists have taken heart from a statement made at the weekend by Mr Abu Kamaradin, the Malaysian high commissioner in London, who referred to his government talking to 'diplomatic channels' and to reopening 'excellent contacts' because of 'good relations over years'. In London, one leading government minister was also confident that the Malaysians were seeking a way to drop the ban. The issue was simply how they could do so 'without losing face'. But there were few signs elsewhere of any movement on the issue. 'I think the Malaysian government is prepared to go all the way on this, especially if there is any retaliatory action by Britain,' said Mr Razaleigh Hamzah, the leader of one of Malaysia's small opposition parties. Representatives of the opposition in Malaysia said the ban on British companies should be lifted immediately. UK construction company John Laing has already withdrawn from preliminary tendering for a MDollars 3bn (Pounds 750m) contract to build a new airport terminal. Malaysia aid probe, Page 10</p>

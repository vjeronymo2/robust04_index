			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / HK talks counted out after 15 rounds SIR ROBIN McLaren, Britain's chief negotiator in talks with China over Hong Kong, yesterday cast doubt on whether agreement would ever be possible. The vexed negotiations have dragged on inconclusively for 15 rounds since last April. 'I am still uncertain as to whether we can achieve an agreement,' Mr McLaren said after two days of talks in Beijing. The two sides have agreed to meet again on November 19 and 20. There still existed 'quite a gap' between the parties. He called on the Chinese to be more flexible, but China has shown almost no willingness to compromise in the marathon negotiations. Beijing has denounced proposals by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten for an extension of the franchise for municipal elections due next year, and a Legislative Council (Legco) poll in 1995. China claims that Mr Patten's plans contradict prior agreements on the smooth transition of power to Chinese rule in 1997. They have threatened to dismiss representatives elected under the proposed Patten formula. The Hong Kong issue will be discussed at a cabinet committee meeting in London on November 10. The session, presided over by Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, will be briefed by Mr Patten. Hong Kong's governor said earlier this month that he would be obliged 'within weeks' to present to Legco legislation detailing an extension of the franchise for elections. Such a move would be likely to bring negotiations in Beijing over Hong Kong's future to a shuddering halt.</p>

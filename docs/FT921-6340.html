			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Police captain admits to ordering attacks on UDF A South African police captain who admits he sympathised with the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party says he ordered attacks on anti-apartheid activists in 1988, some of the most striking evidence yet of links between the security forces and Inkatha. Captain Brian Mitchell, on trial for the 1988 murder of 11 mourners at a funeral vigil, said on Wednesday that he ordered subordinates to attack members of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front (UDF) - a close ally of the African National Congress (ANC) - and was shocked to discover that they had instead ambushed a house filled with mourners. Anti-apartheid organisations allege that police have often instigated unrest and sided with Inkatha in township violence which has left over 10,000 people dead since 1985. The celebrated Trust Feeds killings, for which Capt Mitchell is being tried, increased tensions in the Natal township where supporters of the ANC and Inkatha have waged war since the mid-1980s. Prosecutors allege that Capt Mitchell, who is white, led the attack at the request of a local Inkatha leader. He and another white captain on trial have pleaded innocent. Five black constables charged in the case also pleaded innocent. Capt Mitchell said he regarded himself as a soldier engaged in a civil war where the UDF were enemies of the state.</p>

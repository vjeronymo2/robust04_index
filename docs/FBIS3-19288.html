Mr. Reynolds was speaking in New York about the  IRA statement which calls for a reopening of direct links with  the British Government. From New York, our political editor  Donal Kelly:    [Kelly] Mr. Reynolds played down the significance of the IRA  statement, saying he saw nothing new in it. He made clear there  could be no talks between two parties about the peace process to  the exclusion of all others. And anyway, he said, it was only  by a cessation of violence that talks could take place with  everybody around the table. If violence ended then the forum  for peace and reconciliation could get underway, as well as the  preliminary talks between Sinn Fein and the British Government,  leading to full all-party negotiations.    Asked if he thought the IRA was indicating the declaration  did not go far enough, the taoiseach said that if they didn't  like it there was nothing to stop them ending violence and  getting around the negotiating table. However, he said, he was  still cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the  declaration. It would form the basis for future talks, he said,  with or without Sinn Fein.</p>

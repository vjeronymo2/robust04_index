Andrzej Towpik, director of the MSZ [Ministry of Foreign  Affairs] department for European institutions, told journalists  after the meeting had ended that the conversation confirmed the  openness of the NATO military personnel to both political and  military cooperation with Poland. Towpik added that the  conversation was devoted primarily to the Partnership for Peace  concept. The status of the Polish presentation document, which  is to be submitted before Poland joins the Partnership for Peace  programme, was discussed.    Towpik emphasized that the partnership concept is a very  broad program that requires constant discussion. In his opinion  the Polish side is trying to understand the idea of partnership,  and NATO representatives will learn in the course of this  discussion that certain elements of the [Partnership for Peace]  concept require more precise definition and explanation.</p>

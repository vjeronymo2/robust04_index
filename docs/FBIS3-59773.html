The grown GaAs was etched to realize an  initial interface shape. Dopant distribution was measured by  imaging infrared light transmission. Hall mobility was obtained  by the Hall measurement. The temperature dependence of thickness  of the InP single-crystal growth-layer was experimentally and  numerically determined. Temperature effect on etch-pit density  was examined. Striations and the shape of the initial interface  were observed by etching the (211) plane. Photo-luminescence was  measured for determination of dopant distribution.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the  Ministry of Education (MOE), and the Science and Technology  Agency (STA) are planning to jointly launch an artificial  satellite in February 1995 called the Space Flyer Unit  (SFU)&lt;sup&gt; (1,2)&lt;/sup&gt;  which will be lifted aboard an H-II  rocket now in development. As for the role of MITI, it is  getting the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO) and the  Unmanned Space Experimentation Foundation (USEF) to line up  various companies to perform space experiments associated with  compound semiconductors. At this point, they have lined up seven  companies to perform eight experiments in the SFU mission (cf.  Table 1). Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) will carry  out two of the experiments.&lt;sup&gt; (3,4)&lt;/sup&gt;       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The semiconductor materials to be  studied in the space experiments include gallium arsenide (GaAs)  and indium phosphide (InP) (cf. same table). The Bridgman  technique, a melting method of growing crystal, will be the  method used to grow GaAs crystal, and the THM technique, a type  of solution growth method, will be used to grow the InP crystal.  The main purpose of the GaAs crystal growth experiment is to  obtain a crystal having a uniform concentration of impurities by  conducting crystal growth under managed diffusion  conditions.&lt;sup&gt; (3)&lt;/sup&gt;  The main purpose of the InP crystal  growth experiment, meanwhile, is to investigate the effect that  the convection generated in a solution has on the quality of  crystal.&lt;sup&gt; (4)&lt;/sup&gt;    In order to achieve these goals, IHI has been conducting a  battery of experiments on the ground for perfecting test  conditions and evaluating crystal growth. The furnaces used for  the ground experiments include an electric furnace, which  belongs to IHI (hereinafter called IHI furnace), and a ground  test furnace (hereinafter called ground furnace), which belongs  to USEF, and which is identical to that to be carried aboard the  artificial satellite. The IHI furnace has been mainly used to  establish growth conditions and verify the safety of the space  experiments, while the ground furnace has been mainly used to  verify the furnace conditions satisfying the parameters of the  experiments. In the future, the ground furnace will be used to  obtain reference comparison crystal here in the gravity  environment of earth.    In this paper, we report on the crystal growth experiments  and the results obtained therein.  <H5>  2. Test Equipment </H5>   2.1 Gallium Arsenide    The growth of GaAs crystal is performed by the Bridgman  method, which is a melting method of growing crystal in which  molten material is unidirectionally solidified from seed  crystal. An electric furnace called a complex heating furnace  (GHF: gradient heating furnace) has been built specifically for  this growth method. In the ground experiments, a GHF is used  together with the IHI furnace and the ground furnace. In Figure  1, we show a ground furnace having the same properties as the  gradient heating furnace carried aboard the SFU.&lt;sup&gt; (2)&lt;/sup&gt;  The ground furnace is made up of a high-temperature furnace and  a low-temperature furnace. A cooling block has been placed  between both furnaces to achieve a sharp temperature gradient.       A tantalum cartridge containing the growth material is  inserted into the ground furnace. The outer diameter of the  cartridge is 25, and the surface of the container is coated with  aluminum in order to improve emissivity. Figure 1 shows a  furnace in which the tantalum cartridge has been inserted in the  starting position.    The sample ampule, which fits inside the tantalum cartridge,  has a maximum diameter of 23.6 and a length of 220. Figure 2 is  a diagram showing the configuration of the actual GaAs ampule  which will be used up in space. The ampule basically has a  three-fold structure.&lt;sup&gt; (3)&lt;/sup&gt;  The very inner part is a  boron nitride crucible which holds the molten GaAs, and  surrounding that is a quartz container that seals the crucible  in a vacuum. The very outer part is a graphite containment  vessel which protects the sealed container from expansion and  deformation. Cushions have also been provided in certain  locations to absorb the stress generated by the differences in  the thermal expansion coefficient when the temperature drops.       The volume of GaAs or InP semiconductors with the  zinc-blende  crystal structure is reduced by about 10&percnt; when melted. In  order  to absorb this loss of volume and have the GaAs solution  maintain continuous contact with the wall of the crucible, a  graphite spring has been installed inside the crucible.    2.2 Indium Phosphide    The growth of InP crystal is performed by the THM method.  The  THM method is a method of growing crystal on the seed crystal  side in which a solution band sandwiched between the seed  crystal and raw material polycrystal is locally heated, and in  which the solution band shifts toward the polycrystal by the  movement of the furnace or ampule. An electric furnace similar  to a mirror heating furnace (MHF), which is able to perform  local heating, has been designed specifically for this growth  method. A MHF is also used together with the IHI furnace and the  ground furnace in the experiments. In Figure 3, we show the  configuration of a ground furnace having the same properties as  the mirror heating furnace to be carried aboard the  SFU.&lt;sup&gt; (2)&lt;/sup&gt;  The mirror heating furnace is an electric  furnace that uses a single elliptical mirror to focus infrared  radiation and heat the sample material. At one of the focusing  points in the MHF, a halogen lamp has been installed to act as  an infrared radiation source, and at the other focusing point is  the sample ampule, which has a maximum diameter of 30 and a  length of 120.       In Figure 4, we show the structure of the InP ampule to be  used in space. Following the direction in which the sample  material moves, the ampule is made up of a vacuum sealed area, a  cushion, raw material polycrystal, a solution band, InP  monocrystal, a graphite rod, a cushion, and a vacuum sealed  area. Indium is the material used for the solution band. In  solution growth, the temperature of the solid-liquid interface  on the raw material polycrystal side has to be higher than the  temperature of the growing solid-liquid interface on the seed  crystal side. That temperature difference is the driving force  which causes the raw material to dissolve in the solution band,  and causes the indium phosphide to be deposited on the seed  crystal. The temperature gradient of the seed crystal growth  interface is also what determines the length and quality of seed  crystal growth. In this ampule, the temperature gradient of the  growth interface on the seed crystal side is controlled by  graphite rods positioned adjacent to the seed  crystal.&lt;sup&gt; (5)&lt;/sup&gt;       Cushions have been installed in order to absorb the stress  caused by the thermal expansion of the graphite and indium  phosphide. Indium, unlike indium phosphide, gains more volume  when molten than as a solid. For that reason, the seed crystal  is precisely inserted into quartz tubes so that the molten  indium does not find a way around the seed crystal when being  dissolved.  <H5>  3. Test Results and Studies </H5>   3.1 Gallium Arsenide    When gallium arsenide is melted, it produces an arsenide  (As)  saturated vapor pressure of about one atmosphere. Because  arsenide and arsenide compounds are toxic substances, arsenide  steam cannot be discharged into the air. With that in mind, we  decided to conduct a GaAs crystal growth experiment using the  IHI furnace to verify the safety of the ampule. In Figure 5, we  show the extracted ampule after completing the crystal growth  experiment in the IHI furnace. In the upper part, we can see the  graphite containment vessel, and in the lower part, the  vacuum-sealed quartz container. A boron nitride crucible has  been sealed within the quartz container. It is apparent from  looking at the ampule that there has been some devitrification  on the surface of the sealed container but no damage to the  components that make up the ampule including the containment  vessel, sealed container, and crucible.       After verifying the safety of the ampule in the IHI furnace,  we conducted a crystal growth experiment in the ground furnace  with an identical ampule. The ultimate aim was to conduct the  experiment in a weightless environment identical to that found  in space, and obtain a reference crystal that can be used for  comparison purposes. In Figure 6, we show the ground furnace in  operation.       In Figure 7, we show a GaAs sample after the crystal growth  experiment. The growth plane is the (111) B plane. The metallic  shiny part on the left side of the picture is the seed crystal,  and the slightly more shiny area on the right is the growth  portion. Also, the place where both these meet is the initial  solid-liquid interface. We cut along the (110) plane in the  direction of crystal growth and evaluated the shape of the  initial solid-liquid interface by etching the crystal after  pretreating. The etching liquid used was a solution of chromium  oxide and silver nitrate called AB etchant, and the solvent was  hydrofluoric acid and water.       In Figure 8, we show a longitudinal microphotograph taken  after etching. The curved line on the right side of the  photograph is the initial solid-liquid interface. Crystal growth  starts from the initial solid-liquid interface, and proceeds  toward the left. The shape of the solid-liquid interface is  convex, so we believe solidification is taking place from the  wall of the crucible during crystal growth. This agrees quite  well with the direction of intercrystal growth. In the future,  additional improvements will have to made to the ampule material  and dimensions so as to make the shape of the solid-liquid  interface convex on the molten side. It is clear by looking at  the photograph, however, that the shape of the solid-liquid  interface on the seed side is convex, but from the location of  the initial solid-liquid interface, the monocrystal obtained  measures about 2 at the shortest point and about 9 at the  longest. This length represents approximately 16&percnt; and  60&percnt;,  respectively, of the crystal growth.       We measured the distribution of dopant concentration in the  sample by the infrared transmission method, which is one of the  methods used to evaluate optical characteristics. The results of  those measurements are shown in Figure 9. The bright arc-shaped  border is the initial solid-liquid interface. Measurements  indicate that the more transmitted light, the less dopant  concentration. Accordingly, as we can see from the image, dopant  concentration steadily rises as the crystal grows. This fact  agrees quite well with what we have seen in crystal growth on  the ground under managed thermal convection in which the dopant  concentration shows a tendency to steadily rise.       Hall measurements were taken to evaluate electrical  characteristics. In Figure 10, we show the changes in Hall  mobility along the direction of growth. This is the etch-pit  density in which the thin lines indicate mobility and the fat  lines indicate crystal fault density. It is clear from looking  at the drawing that we have achieved the same mobility as seed  crystal right from the time that crystal growth started. We were  also able to confirm that when growth advances, mobility  decreases as etch-pit density rises.       3.2 Indium Phosphide    In Figure 11, we show a picture of the sample ampule used  for  the ground experiments. The ampule that will be used in the  space experiments will have almost the same configuration. The  metallic shiny area is the indium solution band. This is the  part where infrared radiation is condensed from the mirror  heating furnace. The growth plane is the (111) B plane. Heating  was conducted in a maximum temperature range between 880&deg;C  and 1000&deg;C. The furnace traveled at 0.05 to 0.2/h. Also,  because it is a single-mirror heating furnace, the ampule is  rotated at 5 rpm to improve the circumferential temperature  distribution at the growth interface.       In Figure 12, we show the relationship between length and  maximum temperature in monocrystal growth. The white circles  indicate the areas tested. The diagram clearly shows that as  maximum temperature drops from 1000&deg;C to 900&deg;C the  length of monocrystal growth grows and reaches a length of about  2. 2 is too large for InP crystal growth that belongs to the  category of so-called liquid-phase epitaxial growth. We think  the optimum temperature for crystal growth is between 880&deg;C  and 900&deg;C. The solid line in the drawing is found by  calculating the solution band flow, the P concentration  distribution, and the temperature distribution in an IG  environment. This is done to make it easier to estimate  constitutional cooling (C/C&lt;inf&gt; sat&lt;/inf&gt; ).&lt;sup&gt; (4)&lt;/sup&gt;  Constitutional cooling is a yardstick of polycrystallization,  which means that the smaller the constitutional cooling, the  easier it is obtain crystal. As the temperature drops to  900&deg;C, the yardstick decreases and remains almost constantly  below 900&deg;C. This agrees quite well with the test results.  In the space experiments also, we believe that studying  constitutional cooling will be an effective tool with which to  make comparisons.       In Figure 13, we show the temperature dependency of etch-bit  density (EPD), which is an indicator of crystal quality. It  clearly shows that the bigger the drop in maximum temperature  the smaller the EDP and the better the crystal quality. It also  demonstrates that zinc dopants are more effective in reducing  dislocation. Figure 14 is a photograph showing the growth region  cut along the (211) plane in the direction of growth, and  treated with AB etchant. The streak seen in the unevenness of  the growth region is called an impurity band, and from it flow  data can be obtained. It is our belief that this impurity band  is more easily shaped on the ground than in space.             We measured photo-luminescence by a method which evaluated  the optical characteristics. In Figure 15, we show the peak  half-width mapping results from the growth crystal (111) plane.  The yellow region in the center indicates high zinc dopant  concentration, the surrounding blue area shows very little  dopant concentration. The shape of the growth interface is  indicative of a protruding shape.       There are two kinds of InP etch-pits, namely, the D-pit,  which is associated with dislocation, and the  S-pit,&lt;sup&gt; (6)&lt;/sup&gt;  which is assumed to be associated with  impurity concentration. In Figure 16, we show the relationship  between photo-luminescence intensity and S-pit density. We can  see from looking at the diagram that the greater the  photo-luminescence intensity, or rather the higher the impurity  concentration, the greater the S-bit density. These tests  further demonstrated that the S-bits originated from the  impurities.     <H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>   4.1 Gallium Arsenide    We were able to verify the safety of GaAs using an ampule  having a three-fold structure. In this ampule, we grew crystal  with the furnace on the ground, cut the crystal obtained in the  process along the growth axis, and performed a crystallographic  evaluation. According to that evaluation, the shape of the  initial solid-liquid interface was convex on the seed crystal  side, yet showed 16&percnt; crystal growth in the shortest areas  and  60&percnt; growth in the longest areas.    To evaluate crystal characteristics, we took an infrared  transmission image and then measured distribution along the  dopant concentration plane. We found that dopant concentration  steadily rises as the crystal grows. This suggests that crystal  growth was achieved under managed thermal convection. Next, we  measured the Hall effect in the monocrystal area. We found that  Hall mobility was the same as seed crystal in the initial stages  of growth, and that it decreased later as etch-bit density  increased.    4.2 Indium Phosphide    We elucidated the optimum conditions under which InP crystal  can be grown by the THM method. A monocrystal of about 2 was  obtained with a maximum temperature range between 880&deg;C and  900&deg;C. We found that the main reason for polycrystallization  was constitutional supercooling, and confirmed this by agreement  between a yardstick arrived at by numerical calculation and  actual test results. We also found that the lower the maximum  temperatures, the smaller the EDP and the better the crystal  quality. Meanwhile, by etching the (211) plane, we found  impurities which indicate the effect of heat convection  characteristic of IG. We believe that comparing the degree to  which this occurs in space will give us the difference in flow  behavior.    To evaluate the optical characteristics, we measured  photoluminescence, and were able to confirm dopant distribution  within the plane. The measurements for photoluminescence also  confirmed the fact that S-bits, which had been assumed to be  based on impurities, were, according to the experiments we  conducted, associated with impurity concentrations.

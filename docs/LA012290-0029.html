			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> EXINDIGO DELIVERS RECENT WORKS AT BARNSDALL PARK  </P> <P> Perhaps it was fitting that Steve Reich was the one major composer represented  on Saturday's program at Barnsdall Park. While the three relatively new works  on the program delivered by the new-music ensemble eXindigo! are not strictly  minimalist, each shows minimalist traits.  </P> <P> In the middle movement of "Walking on an Apple" (for mallet percussion), for  instance, composer/percussionist Ron George uses driving ostinatos as an  attractive minimalist foundation over which he improvised -- to fine effect. He  revealed his fascination with bell-like sounds in the outer movements, but a  dearth of substantive material renders these movements feckless. To make  matters worse, George's prerecorded sounds (also mallet percussion) were  cranked up to oppressive levels.  </P> <P> Soprano Sun Young Kim made a strong case for Ted Peterson's "Dr. John Wants to  Talk to Dolphins," delivering the odd text with incisiveness and haunting  resonance. Intermittent, quasi-minimalist percussion accompaniment provided an  interesting but often incongruous backdrop, and the rambling, 30-minute work  can be considered only a partial success.  </P> <P> But Peterson's strident "Voluntaries," minimalist only in its repetitiveness,  completely lacks any rhythmic drive, melodic inventiveness or harmonic appeal;  it probably made the five brass players suffer as much as the listener.  </P> <P> Reich's "Piano Phase," a work of remarkably simple design -- a seven-note  pattern is performed by two musicians who, by speeding up slightly, bring their  respective parts in and out of phase -- manages to engage the listener for 20  minutes. Originally for pianos, it was effectively performed by marimbists Ron  George and Deborah Schwartz.TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

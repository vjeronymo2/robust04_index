			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> RAM ATTACK: Fresh from their successful 1989 season, the Rams are starting  earlier than ever to drum up season-ticket support with a radio and newspaper  ad blitz. . . . "We thought we'd remind fans we do have season tickets," said a  spokesman. Last season, the Rams topped off at 49,000 season ticket holders in  a stadium holding 69,000. . . . The team hasn't sold out every game since 1981.  . . . Still, the Times Poll, above, shows people here follow the Rams more  closely than any other pro team.  </P> <P> OC's FAVORITE TEAMS  </P> <P> Clippers: 3%  </P> <P> Kings: 8%  </P> <P> Raiders: 10%  </P> <P> Dodgers: 20%  </P> <P> Lakers: 29%  </P> <P> Angels: 29%  </P> <P> Rams: 33%  </P> <P> Note: Up to three respones were accepted.  </P> <P> Source: Los Angeles Times Poll Dana Parsons  </P></p>

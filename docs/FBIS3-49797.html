			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia network] </F>   [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Poland on 28  January accompanied by a 10-person delegation, Janusz  Bryczkowski, head of the Samoobrona [Self-Defense] National  Front, who is currently in Moscow, has announced.    [Correspondent Iwona Parchimowicz; identified by caption]  The visit will last two to three days. It will most certainly  take place on Saturday and Sunday, as there are no meetings of  the State Duma then. It will depend on the situation in the  parliament whether the visit will be extended to Monday, 31  January. The Grunwald battlefields, Krakow, and Auschwitz are  still on the program of the visit. Zhirinovskiy's colleague has  also mentioned a visit to some large enterprise, preferably an  arms industry enterprise.    Bryczkowski is convinced that several important Polish  politicians would like to meet Zhirinovskiy in the hope of  getting closer acquainted with this Russian marvel. The  personal protection of the Moscow guest is Bryczkowski's  greatest concern. Most probably he will hire professionals from  the antiterrorist brigade operating at Okecie airport. Because  of the long route of the visit and a short stay, the guests will  travel in Poland by helicopter.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Switching talk again weakens shares FURTHER HINTS around the City that another big international switching operation out of UK equities could have been set in train saw London's equity market deliver another disappointing performance yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 4.8 lower at 2,832.3, ignoring a welter of positive factors, including the lowest UK headline inflation figure for around 30 years, a strong gilt-edged market and a firm opening performance by Wall Street. The major bearish factors affecting the market included substantial weakness in the food retailing and manufacturing sectors, the brewing group, power generation stocks, and the media and aerospace issues. And there were lingering fears that the completion of the BT3 flotation could bring a series of large rights issues. Significantly, the weakness in the market was not confined to the leaders: the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks also came under pressure, leaving the Mid 250 Index 7.5 down at 3,222.5. Activity in the market was a relatively high 612.7m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 55 per cent of the day's business, well down from recent levels. Dealers pointed out that customer business rose sharply on Tuesday when the value of retail activity was worth almost Pounds 1.6bn, the highest single day's total since May 20. Tuesday was featured by a string of heavy programme trades. The session began with share prices under minor downside pressure, reflecting the easier overnight performance by Wall Street and continuing concern over the recent poor showing by London in the face of the good news on UK manufacturing and output data published on Tuesday. The inflation news, revealed in mid-morning, showed headline inflation at a 30-year low and the underlying rate at a 25-year low. While it transformed the gilts market, where long-dated stocks raced higher, it failed to trigger any substantial support for equities. Share prices weakened significantly over the lunchtime period, with the FT-SE 100 declining to a low for the session of 2,826.7, a fall of 10.4, before stabilising as Wall Street opened in positive territory. The story of another switching operation being carried out followed hints that one of the big international broking houses had taken out a very big over-the-counter put option on the London equity market. The sharp sell-off that hit the London market last week was attributed to heavy switching, mainly by US institutions, out of UK equities and into the German market. Other traders said the weakness in the market was because of more mundane factors such as the continuing bookbuilding process in BT3, where the UK public part of the offer closed yesterday. 'It is summer, BT3 is there to distract us, and the market is struggling to find a support level,' said one strategist, but he conceded that the market could be due for a bounce. Sterling's strengthening, against both the dollar and the D-Mark, hit the big overseas earners. Abbey National, easier recently on a series of broker sell notes, topped the list of active stocks following a sizeable agency cross. But Standard Chartered, where talk of rights issues and takeovers were both heard, surged ahead to an all-time peak.</p>

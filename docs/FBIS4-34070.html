			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister Secretary General of Government Victor  Manuel Rebolledo yesterday ruled out any possibility that  President Eduardo Frei's government will promote a new amnesty  law to benefit those who are responsible for violating human  rights.    The minister was consulted about initiatives in this  direction by Center Alliance Party [PAC] President Adolfo Ballas.    Rebolledo said: "In our capacity as government we believe  that, in compliance with the laws currently in force, the  court's rulings on this matter must be respected."    He said that this was the governing coalition's proposal  regarding the human rights subject in its government program.    He added: "The idea of a new amnesty law has not been  considered."    The proposal made by Ballas, who proposed a new amnesty law  that would benefit military officers who had been tried and  civilians involved in terrorist attacks, was flatly rejected by  the members of the Communist Party [PC].    Yesterday the Leftist Democratic Party, like the PC,  categorically rejected the new amnesty law proposed by the PAC.    PDI Secretary General Antonio Leal said that the initiative  would only establish a precedent of a new "pardon" that lacks  any ethics.    Leal said it is immoral for this possible amnesty law to be  proposed by the president of a member party of the coalition  because it implies ignoring the governing bloc's policy on the  subject as well as affecting the performance of the magistrates  who currently hear cases involving violations of human rights.</p>

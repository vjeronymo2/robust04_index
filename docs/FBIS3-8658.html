			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Western European Union does not consider  Bulgaria guilty of the incident with the Khan Kubrat vessel,  Jacques Poos, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, said during his  conversation with President Zhelyu Zhelev.    Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president, informed the  journalists that, during the talks, the situation in the Balkans  was discussed, and more specifically, the situation in former  Yugoslavia.    The Bulgarian head of state again confirmed our steady  position regarding the observance of the embargo and declared  that an incident such as the one with the Khan Kubrat vessel is  not something strange against the background of the situation  that exists at present in the Balkans.    We suffer not only because of the economic losses related to  the embargo, but also because of the emergence of such forces,  which act in a provocative manner against Bulgaria's interests,  the president said.    Prior to his departure Mr. Poos gave a news conference, at  which he summarized the results of his meetings with President  Zhelev, Deputy Prime Ministers Evgeni Matinchev and Valentin  Karabashev, and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov.    [Begin Poos recording in French fading into Bulgarian  translation read by the announcer] This was a bilateral visit,  but it immediately engulfed all European subjects, which were  invoked in all the talks. We witnessed Bulgaria's ambition to  most rapidly join the European structures, which was evident in  all the talks I had here. I have the opinion that the steps  related to ratifying the trade agreement with the European Union  and the reform in your legislature, that already began, will  facilitate this process, Mr. Poos said. He stressed that the  protocol on the agreement to exchange the ratification  documents, that was signed at the Foreign Ministry, will give an  impetus to developing bilateral relations between Bulgaria and  Luxembourg.</p>

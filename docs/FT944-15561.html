			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Ending C4 funding 'safety net' ruled out The government yesterday ruled out early legislation to scrap the funding safety net for Channel 4, which says the formula could could cost it Pounds 500m over 10 years. Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, and Mr Michael Grade, chief executive, were left in little doubt yesterday after a meeting with Mr Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, that legislation in the next parliamentary session was virtually out of the question. Under complex funding rules in the 1990 Broadcasting Act a safety net was created to protect the minority remit of Channel 4 when it started selling its own advertising time. Sir Michael has called the formula a 'golden-goose windfall' for ITV. The act requires all Channel 4 revenue above 14 per cent of total non-satellite television advertising to be divided. Half goes to ITV, a quarter is kept by Channel 4 and the last quarter goes into a reserve fund. If revenue falls below 14 per cent Channel 4 is compensated from the reserve fund and ITV companies down to a floor of 12 per cent. Mr Dorrell yesterday refused to back a private member's bill to change the formula, under which Channel 4 last year paid Pounds 38.2m to ITV. This year's figure is expected to be Pounds 50m. A formal review of the funding mechanism in 1997 is provided for under the act and the issue could easily be shelved until then. The meeting coincided with the publication of a pamphlet by the Bow Group, the Tory think tank. In the pamphlet Sir David Knox, Conservative MP for Staffordshire Moorlands, warns that Channel 4's success is threatened by the formula. He says the safety net is the single biggest hindrance to reinvestment in new programmes.</p>

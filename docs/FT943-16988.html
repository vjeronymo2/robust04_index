			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: Hamlet from the Cape - Ballet A difficult evening. British ballet owes a great deal to South African dancers in such crucial figures as Nadia Nerina, Maryon Lane, John Cranko, David Poole, and it is pleasing that the Cape Ballet should make its first overseas tour under the new dispensation to London. We know that the past decades have been difficult for South African ballet, and artistic isolation has inevitably thrown the troupe on its own resources. But the Hamlet with which the company opening its Wells season on Tuesday night is an odd calling-card. Veronica Paeper, Cape's artistic director and chief choreographer, is a prolific creator, her works including John the Baptist, Sylvia in Hollywood and Nell Gwynne. Alas, her Hamlet is an altogether too innocent guided-tour of the play. With many danced versions of literary masterpieces, you tick off the Great Moments as they lumber past: 'Here's To be or not to be', and 'Caramba] we've only got to the Player scene - there's a hell of a long way to go yet'. So it was on Tuesday. Peter Klatzow's commissioned score is effective, atmospheric, a sure support for the drama. Peter Cazalet's clever permanent set can be castle (one wonders a bit about the gigantic candelabra that edge on and off, trembling the while) or battlements, with costuming that gleams very brightly. Miss Paeper dresses the stage efficiently in crowd-scenes. The problems lie in the naivetes of her choreographic manner, and of the company's dance style. What we see is uneasy and superficial as step and manner. Narrative procedures are no more than hints of what Shakespeare tells us, movement trapped rather than transcending. Expression becomes dumb-show of a predictable kind - a sexy Gertrude climbing over Claudius in a sub-MacMillan duet; Hamlet with two expressions: anguished and more anguished - while the cast make sudden and impulsive irruptions into classic dance, as if wanting to take it by surprise and thus get the better of it. They do not succeed. The academic style of the company is not well served, nor did I see the assurance and clarity that classical movement should have. Some dancers were vivacious - and rather too much so; others looked ill at ease. The choreography skittered around its subject; the dancers did not provide the emotional weight, the technical gravitas, to convince me that the evening was anything more than a display of the flimsy. Two later programmes will, I trust, be a better portrait of the ensemble. The Cape Ballet is at Sadler's Wells until July 9. Sponsored by Unifruco</p>

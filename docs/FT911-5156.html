			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hawker wins significant work for new Boeing HAWKER SIDDELEY, the diversified engineering group, has become the second British company to win a significant order to manufacture components for the Boeing 777 wide bodied aircraft. HS will today announce it has won an order worth about Pounds 90m to manufacture flaps for the tail section for the 777, which is due to come into service from 1995. This follows the announcement last week that Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment group, had won orders worth about Pounds 337m for computer systems to manage the plane's fuel and electrical power systems. The Boeing 777 is becoming an increasingly important project for aerospace component makers, as they seek to respond to the decline in military spending on aircraft. The 777 is a twin engined, wide bodied plane, and is the only major new civil aerospace project under development. The Boeing order comes as HS is beset by rumours that it may become a candidate for a take over bid from either BTR or Hanson, the industrial conglomerates. HS last month reported a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits after exceptional items. The elevator flaps will be manufactured by HS's Australian aerospace subsidiary, Hawker de Havilland, which is a long standing supplier of wing flaps to Boeing. It will be closely involved in the design and development of the flaps, which will be made from advanced carbon fibre composite materials. It is an indication of the size of the Boeing 777 that the 11 metre tail flaps will be as large as flaps for the main wing sections of smaller Boeing 737. The deal is an important boost for the HS aerospace division, which last year increased profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 22m, on a 10 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 297m, about 14 per cent of the HS group sales.</p>

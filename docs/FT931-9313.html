			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / People: Parkland picks outsider For the second time in a month an old-established Yorkshire textile firm has gone outside the family to find a chief executive. Bryan Lodder, who has spent 25 years in the textile industry in the UK and US, has been appointed chief executive of Bradford-based Parkland Textile (Holdings). Lodder, 48, joined Parkland last May as a non-executive director and first got to know it during his time as chief executive of the European end of Guilford Mills, a big US textile company. Parkland and Guilford have a three year-old joint venture which supplies fabrics for the car industry. In October 1989 Lodder was promoted to be president and chief operating officer of the the US parent which has 15 textile plants in the US and overseas and is headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina. He stepped down in April 1991. The appointment of Parkland's new chief executive comes only a few weeks after Dewhirst Group appointed its first chief executive from outside the family -  David Witt. Both family-run firms are suppliers to Marks &amp; Spencer and have been hard hit by the recession in the textile industry. Parkland has lost money for the past two years and is shedding its loss-making garment manufacturing operations. Parkland says that Lodder's appointment allows its executive directors to 'assume direct responsibility' for the group's core businesses. Lodder replaces John Hanson, 48, part of the controlling family and Parkland's chief executive since 1987. He moves to be managing director of Parkland Manufacturing and has been given the task of looking after the reorganisation and growth of the group's worsted fabric business - Parkland's major subsidiary. He will retain responsibility for the group's overall marketing strategy.</p>

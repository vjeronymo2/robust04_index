			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mexican brewer in Dollars 533m share issue Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewing group, and its owners are set to sell 12 per cent of the company's share capital today in a two-tranche initial public offering worth 1.652bn pesos (Dollars 533m). The primary and secondary offers, totalling 24.3m shares, at 68 pesos per share comprise the biggest domestic share issue of a non-financial group in recent Mexican history. They value the whole company at 13.77bn pesos, or 38.5 times earnings and 2.3 times book value. Modelo will become one of Mexico's most valuable companies, in terms of market capitalisation, and its shares will trade at a premium to those of Femsa, its main competitor. Best known for its popular Corona beer, Modelo accounts for more than half of Mexico's domestic beer market and two-thirds of the country's exports. Last year Modelo achieved net profits of 350m pesos, cash flow of 642m pesos, and estimated revenues of some 5bn pesos. Anheuser-Bush, the giant US brewery, bought an 18 per cent stake in the company last March for Dollars 477m. The two companies said at that time that they would co-operate on marketing and distribution. Anheuser-Busch also acquired the right to increase its stake to 35 per cent by 1997. Mr Jacques Levy, executive vice-president of Accival, the brokerage that managed the issue, said that the offering of Modelo 'is a big break that finally shows a company believes Mexico is mature enough to absorb this kind of money'. Mr Levy said that Modelo had no plans to make an international offering. The company will sell 5 per cent of its share capital in the primary offering, and its owners another 7 per cent in the secondary offering. Modelo said that it would use part of the proceeds from the primary share offering to build a new brewery in the state of Zacatecas. It reckons the new brewery will be ready by 1997, and that it will eventually produce 1.5m litres of beer annually.</p>

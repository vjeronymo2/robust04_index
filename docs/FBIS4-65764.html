			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Foreign Policy" column by Mustafa Necati Ozfatura: "The </F> Cyprus Problem and Western Pressure"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Cyprus problem is not a  run-of-the-mill problem. It is a national problem about which  the Turkish nation is very sensitive.    To portray Rauf Denktas as intransigent or as the party that  is preventing an agreement would be tantamount to working for  the Greek Cypriots. It is the Greek Cypriots who do not want a  solution. It is the Greek Cypriots who had Butrus-Ghali  puncture the package, eliminate the rights granted the Turkish  Cypriots, and accord more gains to the Greek Cypriots. The aim  is to portray Denktas and the Turkish Cypriot side as the guilty  party, and thus pave the way for the Greek Cypriot  Administration to join the European Union [EU]. The aim is not  to solve the problem through a balanced and mutual  give-and-take, but to ensure that the negotiations fail and  blame the Turkish Cypriot side for it.    In fact, the confidence-building measures are a trap that is  leading Cyprus toward enosis step-by-step and toward the  implementation of the salami tactic in favor of the Greek  Cypriots.    It is time for Turkey to set its Cyprus policy. The best  policy is to maintain the legal and practical existence of the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] and to assist in  securing its recognition by other countries. The Cyprus problem  was resolved with the 1974 peace operation. The West's  calculations regarding a return to the pre-1974 era do not  concern us. Let them try it if they can.    The fact that the $60 million in economic aid Turkey extends  to the TRNC every year was not delivered this year is being  interpreted as a move to pressure the TRNC. It is a significant  shortcoming that Turkey has not met the power and water needs of  the TRNC since 1974. Electrical power still comes from the  Greek Cypriot side.    Addressing a panel meeting on the economic relations between  Turkey and the TRNC, organized by the Turkish Businessmen and  Administrators Fund, Rauf Denktas said that his feelings were  hurt by Turkey, that the past 20 years were wasted, and that a  deep-rooted dialogue was not formed between Turkey and the TRNC  during all those years. He said: "The TRNC is a separate  country, but we have a common religion, language, and ancestry.  The interests of the two countries are the same as the  interests of the 60 million Turks. The Greek Cypriots always  see the Turkish Cypriots as a disintegrating community. Despite  all the negative stands, however, including the attitude of  Turkey, we have fought the difficulties and we have not  collapsed. We could have been in a much better position today.  We could have undertaken joint tourism investments with Turkey  during the past 20 years. The existing facilities in the TRNC  could have been exploited better through joint tourism projects.  Small- and medium-size industries could have been set up. The  TRNC's economy could have supported Turkey abd not been a burden  to it. It is not too late now...."    Unfortunately, with pressure from the EU, Turkey is  implementing a sort of economic embargo on the TRNC. For some  reason, the TRNC- Turkey customs union agreement could not be  concluded during the past two years. TRNC citizens are not  allowed to set up companies or trade in Turkey. Turkey does not  conduct with the Turkish Cypriots the commercial cooperation it  has with the Greek Cypriots. Turkey even refuses to recognize  the TRNC's sovereignty rights in the sea. The status of the  TRNC is always unclear during the UN debates on Cyprus. The  Turkish Republic does not recognize the TRNC as a fully  independent state.    Turkey is not helping the TRNC economy, which is tied to its  own economy, stand on its own two feet. Turkey's cool attitude  toward the TRNC upsets the balance in favor of the Greek  Cypriots.</p>

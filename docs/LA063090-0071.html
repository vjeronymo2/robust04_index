			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOURNALISTS SAY SOUTHERN BAPTISTS TOLD THEM TO QUIT  </P> <P> The director and news editor of the Southern Baptist Convention's news service  say they have been told to resign or be "dealt with harshly."  </P> <P> Al Shackleford and Dan Martin said they were given the ultimatum at their  Nashville office June 19 by the Rev. Harold C. Bennett, president of the  convention's Executive Committee.  </P> <P> The two journalists, who went public with the news a week later, said they were  told if they resigned quietly they would be continued on the payroll through  the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30.  </P> <P> "They've redefined the terms of objective reporting to mean they want to tell  their story their way, and anyone with another opinion is a troublemaker," said  Martin, the news editor.  </P> <P> Shackleford said the committee is making "an attempt to control the right and  responsibility of Baptist church members to know what's happening in their  denomination."  </P> <P> Bennett could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> For the last five years, Baptist Press has been under fire from fundametalists  for an alleged imbalance in reporting on developments in the denomination's  theological-political controversy.  </P></p>

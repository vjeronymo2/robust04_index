			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND FILES COUNTERSUIT OVER DEAL WITH MOTOROLA  </P> <P> Southland Communications Inc. has filed a $10-million countersuit against its  largest creditor, Motorola Communications Inc.  </P> <P> Motorola sued Southland in May, charging that Southland was delinquent in  payments for paging equipment it purchased from Motorola.  </P> <P> That lawsuit asked for $5.6 million  </P> <P> Southland's suit, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana,  denies most of the charges in the Motorola suit.  </P> <P> In its countersuit, Southland accuses Motorola of agreeing to sell pagers to  Southland even though Motorola knew that the small paging company, with 50,000  subscribers, would not be profitable and able to repay Motorola until it had  100,000 subscribers.  </P> <P> Motorola said in its suit that Ahmad Bayaa and Ziad N. Bayaa, chief financial  officer of Southland, both personally guaranteed Southland's debt. But Bayaa  said in the countersuit that he revoked the personal guaranty in August, 1987.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Griffith, an attorney for Motorola, declined to comment. In April, the  Securities and Exchange Commission sued Southland's president, Ahmad N. Bayaa,  and five other defendants for allegedly conspiring to manipulate Southland's  stock price, which soared 83% in value in late March and early April. The  company's offices have also been searched in connection with a criminal  investigation by the U.S. attorney's office.  </P></p>

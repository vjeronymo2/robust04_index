			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister German Correa by reporter </F> Maria Eugenia Oyarzun at La Moneda in Santiago on 18 May]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Oyarzun] How would you assess  the situation involving [Carabineros Director General] Rodolfo  Stange, 45 days after it started?    [Correa] I still believe it is a complex situation, not only  because of all the implications regarding Gen. Stange, but also  because this is a highly sensitive issue in view of the duties  with which the Carabineros are entrusted in their capacity as  uniformed police, that is, safeguarding peace and order. This is  why this is an extremely delicate issue, as anything that  undermines public order has very serious implications for  society as a whole, and not only for the government or for the  Carabineros. The situation, therefore, had to be handled with  great care.    [Oyarzun] Do you believe the situation was handled with  "great care," or with the gracefulness of a bull in a china shop?    [Correa] In practice, in compliance with express government  orders, the executive branch has handled Gen. Stange's problem  through the Defense Ministry. The Interior Ministry, which is  under my responsibility and which according to the Constitution  is responsible for safeguarding public order and the safety of  citizens, was not directly involved in the negotiations. As a  member of the political team, however, we were permanently  informed about the entire situation, discussing the issue and as  a group adopting decisions with the president. I have  nevertheless had a normal working relation with the Carabineros,  striving so that the problem with its director general would not  have an impact on public order, which has been maintained at  normal levels.    [Oyarzun] Is it true that last week the Interior Ministry  and  the Carabineros held unofficial contacts to solve the crisis?    [Correa] Within these past 40 days the government has been  willing to explore all possibilities.    [Oyarzun] The government or the Interior Ministry?    [Correa] The government as such; the Interior Ministry is  part of the government. We studied all the possibilities that  could have led to a proper solution. Unfortunately, the  different alternatives have not allowed us to achieve a  definitive solution, but I hope we will be able to do so in the  next 30 days.    [Oyarzun] What is this definitive solution?    [Correa] I sincerely believe that a continued lack of  definition regarding the Carabineros command is not desirable.    [Oyarzun] Who is to blame for this lack of definition, the  Carabineros or the government?    [Correa] I would say that this is a result of the situation  itself. There was a court ruling on one of the most abominable  crimes in Chilean history, which had already caused a crisis in  the Carabineros high command. This resulted in the ousting of  the then Carabineros commander, General Cesar Mendoza.  Throughout the nine years of this court case, there have been  events that have raised some doubts about the role played at the  time by the Carabineros high command, and Gen. Stange is the  only member of that high command who is still on active duty.  The government is not to blame for creating this situation. This  is the result of a very traumatic event. The government believes  that the mere fact that charges were raised against the  Carabineros director general--charges that must be proven in  court--constitutes in itself a very complicated situation.    [Oyarzun] The special judge assigned to investigate the  alleged crime of "nonfulfillment of military duties," of which  Gen. Stange is accused, has rejected the request made by the  lawyers of the accusing party to hold a confrontation [careo]  between Gen. Stange and other officers and to indict him. Is  this not an important sign that Gen. Stange is not guilty?    [Correa] It is up to the courts to decide that. The  government has always maintained that the unsuitability of Gen.  Stange's remaining in his post is not directly associated with  the result of the court case. In this country there are laws  through which it is sufficient that an individual be indicted on  charges of a crime deserving punishment, after which it is  presumed that he immediately loses certain rights, such as the  right to vote and to be elected.    [Oyarzun] There are those in the government who said that  Stange's ousting was not a legal issue but a matter of  principle, and that even if the president lost in this regard,  the government would win a moral victory. Do you agree with this?    [Correa] All this is part of a past we have not yet been  able  to overcome. There are many Chileans who suffered in their own  flesh and blood the rigors of the military regime, through human  rights violations. There are many pending trials, and many  things that will have an impact in our lives for years to come.  I believe that Chile has a very important moral debt with these  hundreds of thousands of Chileans, many of whose lives were  destroyed or who endured tortures or were imprisoned. We have to  make an effort to overcome this past. I believe it is very  important to pay your dues. I am not speaking negatively, but in  order to be at peace with ourselves.    [Oyarzun] Wouldn't it be better if we overcame some  chapters in this regard? Do you believe the country can always  look backward?    [Correa] To continue looking to the past is directly related  to how well or how badly we are able to overcome these  situations. There are different ways of going about it. One  would be to throw a blanket over the past, as if nothing had  happened, like a collective complicity in claiming there were no  human rights violations in Chile. Such an attitude would solve  current problems, but not future ones, as the ethical bases of  democracy and peaceful coexistence would be seriously weakened.    I believe that impunity and the fact that people do not  answer for their deeds undermines the ethical and political  principles of a democracy. People must have the courage to face  these issues with high-mindedness. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] Isn't the agreement reached by the defense  minister  and Gen. Stange like a predated check, a kind of "passing the  ball" for four weeks?    [Correa] Undoubtedly we achieved a partial agreement, which  should give us time to arrive at a definitive solution.    [Oyarzun] What does this "definitive" solution for the  Stange  issue consist of? Does he have to go?    [Correa] This will be decided in the next couple of days. I  believe we should continue to hold meetings that will allow us  to find formulas for finding a proper solution to problems. One  can understand Gen. Stange's interest in seeing that the court  case against him is definitively resolved, but as I have already  explained, the general must also understand that it is very  difficult to exercise a command when one lacks the president's  trust and backing. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] What has the administration done in its first 70  days in government?    [Correa] There were several important initiatives. Today we  are submitting to Congress a bill on the Copper Corporation  (Codelco), which is of vital importance to the country. This is  an indication that there have been substantial initiatives in  the drafting of laws. The opposition criticism that "there is a  legislative drought" and that there has not been a legislative  initiative is, therefore, unjust. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] If you had to render an account of your first 70  days in government, what would you point out?    [Correa] I believe I have fulfilled the tasks that are  pertinent to my post under not so normal situations.    [Oyarzun] Why?    [Correa] Because what we have experienced regarding Gen.  Stange's situation has not been a minor issue. Let me remind  you that three days after assuming power we were faced with  General Nunez's retirement, and Gen. Stange's problem cropped up  11 days after the inauguration and still must be resolved.  These 70 days, therefore, were not normal. I hope the  following days will not be as complex.    [Oyarzun] Didn't the administration bring these problems  upon  itself?    [Correa] No. All of those who have been most involved with  the issue have agreed that there were no solutions other than  those adopted by the government.    [Oyarzun] What about the opposition?    [Correa] The opposition has done its job in trying to create  the greatest number of problems possible; the opposition has  hardened. Please take into account that this administration has  not enjoyed the 24 hours of the so-called grace period. I  believe that even before assuming power we were under quite a  lot of pressure. In view of this, and because we were facing a  complex situation, the president invited the member parties of  the Coalition of Parties for Democracy to discuss the situation.  We were faced with the difficult issue of Carabineros. This is  all part of the costs and benefits brought on by continuity. We  inherited some problems from the previous administration, but  there are other long-standing problems as well.    [Oyarzun] Is it true that you have had disagreements with  the  defense minister and the minister of the presidency?    [Correa] There have been no disagreements with the defense  minister. We have a very direct relation, which contributes to  the openness of our work. As in all human affairs, we share  different points of view, but through dialogue and discussion we  will achieve agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

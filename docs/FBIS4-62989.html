			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Cherkovets: "To the Front Outside the </F> Pentagon...."]    [Text] INTERFAX has reported that Russian Defense Minister  P.

Meanwhile very curious details became known. The Russian  side has rejected the return exercise suggested by the Americans  on their territory: Why inconvenience our host, it said! But  inconveniencing its own citizens -- that is another matter, it  can do that.    As V. Semenov, commander in chief of the RUssian Ground  Forces, said in an interview with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, in response  to proposals to hold joint exercises on FRG territory the  Germans refused. Why did their country need such a "gift?"

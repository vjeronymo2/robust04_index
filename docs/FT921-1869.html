			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Old enemies agree to surveillance flights NATO allies and countries of the former Soviet bloc reached an Open Skies agreement in Vienna yesterday, allowing them to fly unarmed surveillance aircraft over each other's territory. The accord, reached six months after the revival of negotiations, means that a treaty can be signed by foreign ministers at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki on Tuesday. The pact is due to be initialled today by representatives of 24 countries including Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Other new republics as well as European countries outside Nato and the former Warsaw Pact will be able to join later. Russia and representatives from the nine-nation Western European Union are due to meet in Moscow next week to discuss the possible use of jointly-funded aircraft to carry out Open Skies flights. Initially, surveillance will be by cameras and radar, with infra-red sensors used only by bilateral agreement, but this restriction will be lifted after three years. Each country will have a quota of flights. Data from the flights will be available to all signatories, although payment arrangements have still to be settled. President Bush launched the Open Skies initiative in May 1989, taking up a proposal first put forward by President Eisenhower in 1955. But talks ran aground a year later over restrictions sought by Moscow. They resumed last September. Moscow dropped its insistence on territorial limits and the right to overfly US bases in other regions. In exchange, it obtained the right for any signatory to provide its own aircraft for surveillance missions.</p>

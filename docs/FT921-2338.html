			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: The Burrow/Manon - Sadler's Wells/Covent Garden It might be wrong to accuse the Birmingham Royal Ballet of corporate schizophrenia, but the company personality underwent a marked change during the triple bill which initiated a season at the Wells on Tuesday. The evening began with David Bintley's Galanteries, lately acquired for the repertory. It is a classical conversation-piece, set to two early Mozart scores, in which the dancers exchange academic proprieties in hushed voices. The set and costumes are fuzzy grey; the tone is muted and somehow remote; movement looks polite, numbed. Miyako Yoshida and Sandra Madgwick are advocates for sunnier, larger-scaled things, but mimsiness rules. Very different the look of the cast after the interval, when MacMillan's The Burrow took the stage. I reported on this study in claustrophobic anguish after its revival at the Birmingham Hippodrome last autumn. It projects even more strongly, seems more ridden by terror, on the confines of the Wells stage. And its cast  - with memorably good interpretations from Marion Tait as the Woman, Desmond Kelly as the Outcast, Michael O'Hare as the Joker  - expose every nerve and every fearful twitch of the psyche in bold movement. And as the necessary relaxation to end the evening, there is Elite Syncopations. The company romp, relax, show-off. A couple of the numbers need to be sharpened but Marion Tait, deliciously mocking, and the extra-sec Joseph Cipolla, are stylish, ideal. The score, under Jonathan Higgins, is no less witty. For the two earlier pieces, Anthony Twiner drew sound performances from the Royal Ballet Sinfonia. Darcey Bussell is making her debuts in Manon at Covent Garden this season. In her appearances in other MacMillan ballets  - her creation of Prince of the Pagodas; as the Woman in Song of the Earth are good examples  - and in such challenges as Balanchine repertory or traditional 19th century works, she offers a combination of technical grace and a trusting devotion to the choreography which is dazzling to watch. The dance is there, unadorned by anything save the integrity of Miss Bussell's manner and the felicity of her physical command. There is mystery  - that mystery we sense in the presence of any prodigally gifted young artist  - but it is bewitchingly mixed with an innocence that comes from talent that does not know how to dance badly. Yet as Manon, in her second performance which I saw on Monday night, her abilities did not seem to reflect the complexities of the character or to engage fully with the role. Of course her dancing was beautiful. Of course she looked ravishing in the first two acts, and piteous in the third (though her wig was a brute). Of course she conveyed the varied lures of true love in a garret and gilded vice in a house of assignation. But her sincerity of temperament made Manon too guileless, too unshadowed in sexuality and feeling. She was not selfish enough. And it must be said that the choreography is best suited to a smaller physique. The swooping, curving images through which MacMillan tells of Manon's charms gain their fullest meaning with a more contained frame  - even one more able to suggest the intoxicating, kittenish aspects of the girl's irresistible and fatal allure. This is, one must remember, a first sketch of a reading; experience, and her own great gifts, will surely show Miss Bussell the way to Manon's ever-changing, ever-fascinating heart. She had the real advantage of Zoltan Solymosi as des Grieux. He is an absolutely secure partner  - strong, sensitive  - and he made something ardently responsive of the young man's infatuation.</p>

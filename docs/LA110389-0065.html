			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOZENS OF BRITISH CULTURAL CAUSES LOOKING FOR U.S. MONEY  </P> <P> Sam Wanamaker's New Globe Theater project is only one of dozens of causes  seeking U.S. money to help preserve Britain's cultural heritage.  </P> <P> "They all seem to think there's a lot more money here than there is,"  complained Ann Webster Smith, chairman of the Washington-based American Friends  of English Heritage. "A lot of them think Americans are just going to sit down  and write checks," she added in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Among the newcomers is Oxford University, which launched a U.S. campaign for  the first time a few weeks ago. And the Church of England has begun a 14-city  U.S. effort to raise $3 million to help save the crumbling spire of the  600-year-old cathedral in the town of Salisbury.  </P> <P> These join such veteran organizations as New York's Royal Oak Foundation, an  affiliate of England's National Trust. The charity is Britain's largest private  landowner, sworn to preserve hundreds of thousands of prime seacoast acres,  gardens and about 240 historic buildings.  </P> <P> While there are no comprehensive figures available here, it is believed that  American giving to such causes amounts to millions of dollars a year. All of it  is tax deductible so long as the British recipient registers as a nonprofit  organization under the appropriate section of the U.S. tax code.  </P> <P> The private U.S. contributions are becoming more important during what the  experts here describe as a transition period from mostly public to more private  funding of museums, the arts and other cultural causes.  </P> <P> Historically, noted Anne Collins, a former U.S. cultural attache here who is  now an arts consultant, Britain has been like most European countries, with the  government heavily subsidizing what is sometimes called the "heritage  industry." There was little tradition of individual giving, and there are still  no U.S.-style tax incentives to encourage it.  </P> <P> Now, the Thatcher government has begun trimming subsidies, in effect, by  holding budget increases to a figure lower than the rate of inflation. But the  practice of individual and corporate giving continues to lag. As a result, some  British institutions are growing desperate.  </P> <P> "My own particular territory, the subsidized theater, now seems to be as much  under threat as the Amazonian rain forest, and there are as sound reasons for  preserving the one as the other," Richard Eyre, director of the financially  strapped National Theater, complained in an Arts Advocacy Day speech recently.  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, it's probably only a surprise that there aren't more  British cultural institutions seeking U.S. financial support, especially since  Americans have the reputation of being unreconstructed Anglophiles.  </P> <P> "Americans are just crazy about England," agreed Smith. "They're really  interested in their English heritage."  </P> <P> But while one J. Paul Getty or Armand Hammer can admittedly solve the problems  of a cash-strapped British cause, finding such benefactors "is not easy," she  said.  </P></p>

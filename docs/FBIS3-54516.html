"FIS firmly denies what has been reported that some shuyukh  (Islamic leaders) may perhaps represent the front in what is  called the national conference and reaffirms that this  conference is doomed to failure," said a FIS press release faxed  to IRNA Wednesday [26 Jan] night.    The 2-day national conference ended Wednesday without  reaching any decision on the political future of Algeria. The  military-backed regime said the conference will convene to try  to resolve the crisis.    The statement in Arabic, signed by FIS' exiled spokesman in  Europe, Rabah Kebir, said the contacts between the regime and  the jailed shuyukh were merely "discussions" and not a  "dialogue", and he accused the military-backed regime of  falsifying the facts.    Kebir, who lives in Germany, reiterated that FIS will not  participate in any conference before all political prisoners are  set free and their political freedom re-established. Most  opposition parties boycotted the conference.    The statement said FIS leader Shaykh Ali Belhadj, who began  a  hunger strike on December 4, was admitted to a military hospital  in an unconscious state after 22 days.    After undergoing medical treatment for five days Belhadj was  transferred to the military jail in Balida.    The FIS won a sweeping victory in the first-round in  Algeria's first multi-party elections at the end of 1991, but  the military-backed authorites scrapped the poll, banned the FIS  and arrested thousands of Islamists.    The regime last week released hundreds of Islamists, but FIS  said amnesty was not enough to justify opening a dialogue with  the regime.</p>

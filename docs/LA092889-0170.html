			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Plans No Action in Eastern Strike: The Bush Administration does not plan  to intervene in the Eastern Airlines strike, Transportation Secretary Samuel K.  Skinner said. Skinner said he has written to Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.) and called a proposed congressionally mandated committee on  the issue "entirely inappropriate." The Senate may consider a version of a  House bill that would force President Bush to establish a panel to make  recommendations on the dispute between Eastern and its three major labor  unions. Skip Copeland, leader of the striking Eastern Airlines pilots, said  they are "appalled" at Skinner's comments.  </P></p>

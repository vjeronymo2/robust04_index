At the conclusion of a Mexican Foreign Service meeting in  preparation for the binational meeting with the United States to  take place on 7 March in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Tello Macias  said that there is the possibility that some measures announced  by the neighbor to the north could be set aside. He rejected  accusations made Saturday by Chicanos, according to whom the  Foreign Secretariat spends more resources and time on organizing  the commemoration of holidays than on providing consular  protection.    Tello Macias said that violence against any single Mexican  citizen will be considered an act of violence against Mexico's  integrity. The man responsible for the country's foreign policy  said he does not know of any plans to construct a barbwire fence  parallel to the metal fence that already exists along the border.</p>

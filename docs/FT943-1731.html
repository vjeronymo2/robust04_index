			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Resistance caps rises in precious metals markets Gold and silver prices made further gains yesterday before hitting overhead resistance. During the London bullion market's afternoon 'fixing' the gold price was tried as high as Dollars 395.50 a troy ounce, but that proved to much and it eased to Dollars 394.90, the highest fix since January 5. By the close the price had drifted to Dollars 394.60 an ounce, up 80 cents on the day. In the absence of the Tokyo investment fund buying that had pushed the price upwards on Tuesday a day of consolidation was to be expected, dealers told the Reuters news agency. Some thought a retreat to the Dollars 390.50-Dollars 391.00 area, where a 'chart gap' had been left by Tuesday's sharp rise, was on the cards if the market failed to break strong resistance above Dollars 395.50. But others pointed to good physical interest supporting the market around Dollars 393. The silver price was fixed in the morning at 567.15 cents a troy ounce, its highest price since May 24, but it shied away from a test of resistance at 570 cents resistance and settled back to 562 cents, up just 2 cents on balance. One analyst suggested to Reuters that the attempted break-outs by gold and silver had come too early in the day. 'It leaves them open to retracement,' he said. Palladium achieved its highest fixing since May 15, 1989 at Dollars 156.25 an ounce, encouraged by tight supplies and continuing good offtake from the electronics industry. 'The market's fundamentals are the key,' said one analyst. The platinum market was also buoyant, although it was held within its recently-set price range.</p>

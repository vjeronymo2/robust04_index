			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Itoman in move to seize assets of debtor ITOMAN, the debt-ridden Japanese trading company, has started legal moves to seize the assets of one of its biggest debtors, Mr Ho Yong Chung, a Korean businessman. The company's action yesterday forced the closure of Kansai Shimbun, a newspaper which is one of Mr Ho's main operating companies. Itoman's action followed Kansai Shimbun's failure to meet deadlines for the repayment of Y62.5bn (Dollars 463m) it borrowed from Itoman last year to finance speculative investment in art. The paintings which were handed over to Itoman as security for the loan have been found to be worth considerably less than was originally claimed. The Osaka District Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the deal and other aspects of the relationship between Mr Ho and Itoman. Mr Ho was until early this year Itoman's largest shareholder with a 19 per cent stake and great influence over Mr Yoshihiko Kawamura, the Itoman president.</p>

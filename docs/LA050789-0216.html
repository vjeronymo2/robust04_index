			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> UCI HIRES PR FIRM ON MEDICAL COST ISSUE  </P> <P> With a gloom-and-doom press conference last week, UC Irvine's new vice  chancellor of health services opened an aggressive campaign to spotlight the  financial hemorrhaging that threatens to close UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> Dr. Walter Henry, who is also dean of the UCI College of Medicine, believes  that too many people think of the medical center as an ordinary public hospital  instead of a top-notch teaching and research facility.  </P> <P> So, faced with a projected operating loss of $13 million this year, Henry  reached beyond the medical center's seven-member, $250,000-a-year public  relations and marketing staff.  </P> <P> He got permission to go around normal university hiring rules and awarded a  $20,000, 3-month contract to a Newport Beach consulting firm headed by a woman  with whom he had previously worked. Saying the medical center's crisis needed  publicity and its image needed improvement, the consultant immediately  announced a series of press conferences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burden Called 'Unfair'  </P> <P> At the first of these last week, Henry said the medical center in Orange is  suffering because federal, state and county governments inadequately finance  insurance programs intended to provide hospitalization for the poor. The  shortcomings, he said, have forced the 493-bed facility to play the role of a  county hospital and shoulder an unfair burden. UCI has 6% of the hospital beds  in Orange County but treats 50% of the poor. Apart from the financial strain  that comes with treating indigents who cannot pay, UCI officials contend that  the consequently heavy load of routine medical cases is undermining plans to  develop the medical center into a major teaching hospital.  </P> <P> "We need to develop a consistent program that reflects the strength of the  (UCI) College of Medicine as well as my plans for developing UCI Medical Center  into a major academic hospital where research exists side by side with  teaching," Henry said before the press conference. "We need help to develop  that concept in terms of our internal perception and to communicate that vision  to the community."  </P> <P> Henry warned that the medical center could go bankrupt and close within 2 years  if it continues to be flooded with indigent patients. And his straightforward  comments were applauded throughout much of the medical community.  </P> <P> "It may be a direct and discomforting approach to a lot of people," said David  Langness, vice president of communications for the Hospital Council of Southern  California. "But the fact is, it is the truth.  </P> <P> "A record number of hospitals closed (in the nation) last year and Orange  County is not immune to those problems. What it (Henry's public statement) does  is communicate the severity of the problem and in so doing brings about  action."  </P> <P> David Paine, a Costa Mesa public relations executive who has several  health-care industry clients, also praised what he called Henry's honesty.  "When you talk about a potentially unpopular decision, sometimes it is better  to be pro-active and explain why you are doing what you are doing," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Confronting the Crisis'  </P> <P> L. Wade Rose, assistant dean of community affairs and development at the UCI  medical school, said: "What Walt is doing is confronting the crisis we have in  medical reimbursement head-on. And he knows when he does that it will create a  tremendous amount of concern among local, county and state governments as well  as the general public."  </P> <P> Advocates for the poor said the developments are worrisome.  </P> <P> "My concern is poor people are going to be dumped and where are they going to  go?" said Jean Forbath, a founder of Share Our Selves, a service organization  that runs a free clinic in Costa Mesa. "We feel this would be a tragic  development.  </P> <P> "I can understand UCI's position -- they are really in the hole," Forbath  continued. "But there doesn't seem to be any suggested alternative."  </P> <P> Henry, a research cardiologist who took the vice chancellor's post in March,  went after professional help in delicately charting his public relations  strategy. Days after he became vice chancellor and dean of the medical school,  he hired a friend, Susan Meister, who has 25 years' experience in medical  communications.  </P> <P> Meister's Newport Beach public relations firm, Communicore, is working under a  3-month consulting contract with the university. One of her jobs is to screen  all calls from the press to Henry and to Mary A. Piccione, the medical center's  executive director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Make Public Aware  </P> <P> But Meister says she was primarily hired to draft a game plan that will  emphasize the teaching and research functions of the medical center as an arm  of the UCI College of Medicine and make the public aware of how they may be  affected by the crisis in indigent care.  </P> <P> "If UCI Medical Center closes down, there will be no academic medical center in  Orange County," Meister said. "Academic medical centers are depended on to take  care of the most complicated medical problems."  </P> <P> "UCI is a victim, it's not a perpetrator" of the indigent-care crisis, she  said.  </P> <P> Meister said the amount of money her two-partner firm will be paid for the  consulting work will depend on how many hours of work are involved. But she  said she expects that the contract, which began in March and ends June 30, will  be worth about $20,000, a sum that she said was reasonable and far less than  she would charge a private corporation.  </P> <P> Henry hired Meister's firm without going through the university's customary  bidding process. Services expected to cost at least $15,000 must be bid,  according to the policy, unless a candidate has expertise that cannot be  duplicated.  </P> <P> Leon Schwartz, UCI's vice chancellor for administrative and business services,  said Henry persuaded him that Meister offered a unique combination of medical  communications experience and knowledge of the university. "I thought it would  be very appropriate to use her (services)," Schwartz said.  </P> <P> Meister acknowledged that her professional friendship with Henry helped her  firm hurdle the bidding process because Henry had gained confidence in her  communication skills and understanding of the medical industry. Also, she said,  as with most medical public relations consultants, she has considerable  experience in "crisis management."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Positions  </P> <P> Before Meister established her own public relations business in 1985, she held  a variety of health-care industry positions, including vice president for  medical affairs for Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, director of  communications for the Edwards Division of American Hospital Supply in Irvine  and vice president of Burson-Marsteller Inc.'s former health-care division in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Meister said she has known Henry since 1980, the year she joined Edwards, where  Henry was a consultant on cardiovascular-imaging technology. Also, for the last  5 years she has served on the board of directors of Medical Research and  Education Society, a volunteer support group that raises funds for younger  researchers at the UCI College of Medicine. This year she was elected president  of the organization.  </P> <P> Meister said UCI is only one of her firm's 15 clients. She said she is working  for Henry only on a temporary basis while he reorganizes the public relations  operations of the medical school and hospital.  </P> <P> As part of that reorganization, Henry announced last week that he is seeking  university authorization to create a new permanent position of assistant vice  chancellor of health sciences in charge of public relations and fund raising  for both the school and medical center. That person would report directly to  him. He said Meister could be a candidate for the new position, although a  hiring search would be conducted.  </P> <P> Seven employees, including two clerical workers, already are on the payroll of  the medical center's public affairs and marketing department. Salaries of the  department, which handles news inquiries, special events and in-house  publications, total $250,000 a year. A public information office on the UCI  campus also has two employees who produce press releases on the College of  Medicine's research, fund-raising and other activities.  </P> <P> Neither UC San Diego nor UC Davis, which have hospitals comparable to UCI's,  employ a top administration-level spokesman who reports directly to the  overseer of those medical schools and teaching hospitals. But neither school  faces the medical center's financial crisis.  </P> <P> The medical center's financial position has severely eroded since fiscal 1986,  when it posted a $772,000 operating gain as a result of cost cutting, officials  said. Last year, the medical center posted a $8.6-million operating loss, and  the operating loss this year is expected to reach $13 million.  </P> <P> Since taking office in March, Henry has been playing hardball with government  officials, beginning with a threat to withdraw from the Medi-Cal program if  reimbursement rates are not improved. The university is negotiating a new  Medi-Cal contract. Medi-Cal is the state's medical insurance for the indigent.  </P> <P> In an interview, Henry said medical center belt-tightening efforts, which in  the past included cutting staff, have been more than offset as the hospital's  share of indigent patients has continued to expand and Medi-Cal reimbursements  have fallen further behind costs.  </P> <P> "Now we are in a situation where we realize the major problem is the very large  burden of indigent care we are having to assume, and that burden has gotten  much worse," he said.  </P> <P> The medical center reports receiving about 30 cents in reimbursement for every  dollar spent to treat patients on Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> "We are simply trying to communicate the issues as strongly as possible," Henry  said. "We are trying to help the public understand the issues as we see them  and the implications of various actions."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lanie Jones contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UC MEDICAL CENTER BUDGETS  </P> <P> The following is a comparison of public affairs and marketing budgets for  medical centers at UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC San Diego. Among the five UC  hospitals, these three are most alike because all formerly were county  hospitals, are major centers for the care of poor patients and are affiliated  with a general campus.*  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:2.22IN:2.00IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> UCI  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> UC Davis  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> UC San Diego  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987-88 operating  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $157  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $230  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $165  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> budget (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Beds  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 493  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 467  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 347  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Profit (Loss) in millions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($13.1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Public Affairs &amp;  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $250,000**  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $233,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $345,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marketing salaries  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * UCI Medical Center is in Orange.  </P> <P> UC Davis Medical Center is in Sacramento.  </P> <P> UC San Diego Medical Center is in La Jolla.  </P> <P> UCLA is twice as large, has two hospitals and four health colleges and a lower  percentage of indigents.  </P> <P> UC San Francisco is strictly a medical school with its own hospital.  </P> <P> ** Does not include about $20,000 for Newport Beach public relations  consultant.  </P></p>

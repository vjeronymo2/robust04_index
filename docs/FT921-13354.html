			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: First sales expected next month THE FIRST sales of subsidiaries in Maxwell Communication Corporation could come as soon as the beginning of next month, the administrators said yesterday. Advertisements appeared yesterday for Maxwell Business Communications Group (MBC) and Macdonald, two publishing companies, and negotiations with potential buyers for several other companies are also well advanced. Mr Jonathan Phillips, a partner in Price Waterhouse and one of the joint administrators of MCC, said the priority was to sell the publishing companies first, since secure ownership was needed to continue to produce titles. The administrators hope to have all offers in by the end of January for MBC, the three divisions of which may be sold separately. More than 70 potential buyers have already expressed interest. Discussions are progressing towards the sale of a number of companies including QED Technology, a systems integrator and software supplier for the publishing industry which announced plans for a management buy out last week and Panini, the Italian-based sticker printer. Other companies involved are Nimbus, a compact disk manufacturer based in Wales in which MCC held a 76 per cent stake, ICDD, a printing company based in France and Maxwell Consumer Publishing and Communications, a contract publishing house.</p>

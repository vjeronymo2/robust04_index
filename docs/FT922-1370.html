			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Surge of demand greets Ecu350m offering from EIB THE European Investment Bank's reopening of the fixed-rate Ecu bond market with an Ecu350m offering yesterday captured a surge of demand which took traders by surprise, but is not expected to persist. Apart from a small issue of floating-rate notes, the Ecu bond market has been closed since the Danish referendum rejecting the Maastricht Treaty on June 2 sent Ecu bond prices tumbling. Although the positive result of last week's Irish referendum restored some confidence in the future of the market, dealers said that buying interest had remained thin. Friday's rally on news of the result was used by many investors as an opportunity to sell bonds which they have been trying to offload. The reopening is unlikely to be followed by many more deals, as the EIB is unusual in having a natural need for Ecu. The deal will be used to finance a number of Ecu loans due to be disbursed. The bank was pleased to have an opportunity to reopen the market, an official said. The sell-out of the EIB offering represents something of a special case. A substantial portion of the paper was sold to European central banks, some of which may have been politically motivated to support the Ecu bond market. A large portion of paper was also placed in Italy, where the EIB is exempt from withholding tax for domestic investors. The deal also met demand from fund managers due to the attractive pricing of the 10-year bonds at a yield spread of about 12 basis points above the comparable French government OAT issue, about six basis points more than the bank had to pay prior to the Danish referendum. At this level, the bonds yield just two basis points less than the theoretical 10-year Ecu bond yield, based on the basket value of the Ecu. The deal closed at 99.25 bid, above its fixed-reoffer level of 99.17. Eurodollar bonds issued by Statni Banka, the central bank of Czechoslovakia, yesterday stabilised at a yield spread of around 350 basis points over US Treasury bonds, writes Simon London. The Dollars 200m deal was launched last October at a spread of 300 basis point over Treasuries and narrowed to 280 basis points earlier this year. However, the bonds have under-performed since elections strengthened the position of Slovakian nationalists pressing for independence. Nomura International, which lead-managed the issue, yesterday reported 'good two-way trading' in the bonds at the new yield spread. The covenants of the bond make it an event of default if Statni Banka ceases to be the central bank of either the Czech or Slovak republics. In this case, bondholders would be able to put bonds back to the issuer at par.</p>

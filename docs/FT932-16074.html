			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Equities: Telecom sector to provide investors with spate of issues INTERNATIONAL equity investors can expect a spate of issues from the telecommunications sector over the next few months, with international share deals scheduled to come from Chile, Greece, the UK and Singapore. Investment bankers expect Compania de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications group, to have its 10-year convertible bond issue sized and priced today. Goldman Sachs is lead-manager for the deal, expected to raise up to Dollars 182.6m in total. The exact size of the international portion, however, will be determined by how much of the domestic rights offering is taken up. The results of the domestic rights offering were due late last night. The conversion premium is expected to be between 22 and 25 per cent and the yield to redemption between 5.5 and 6 per cent. Bankers expect half the deal to be sold in the US and the rest internationally. So far, those involved in the deal have noted strong demand for the issue, pointing out this is the first convertible bond issue to emerge from Chile. Further news emerged yesterday concerning the privatisation of OTE, the Greek state telecom group. The Greek government has appointed Credit Suisse First Boston and J. Henry Schroder Wagg as joint global co-ordinators and joint international lead-managers for the sale of 14 per cent of the state telecoms monopoly. The offering, due to be launched in the autumn, is expected to raise up to Dollars 420m, of which about Dollars 150m will be offered to international investors mainly in the UK and Europe. Four per cent of the company will be offered to employees on preferential terms, while the remaining 10 per cent will be split roughly equally into a domestic and an international tranche, according to a government adviser. The equity offering is the largest so far in Greece. It will be launched after the first stage of OTE's partial privatisation - the sale of a 35 per cent stake to an international telecom operator - is completed. The government will keep control of 51 per cent of the telecoms group. Morgan Stanley, Paribas Capital Markets and N. M. Rothschild are co-managers for the international tranche. Several Greek financial institutions will be selected in coming weeks to manage the domestic tranche. OTE, the only profitable Greek utility, forecasts earnings of around Dr190bn this year. But it faces heavy pension liabilities and needs substantial investment to modernise its network.</p>

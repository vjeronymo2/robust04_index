			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 1  March.    Banco del Cafe, Inc. and the Central American Bank of  Economic Integration (BCIE) recently signed a loan agreement for  $1 million for projects to bolster production activities of  agricultural enterprises, industries, tourism, and small and  medium-sized businesses. This is the fourth loan signed with  Banco del Cafe in less than a year, thereby bringing total  financing to $5.5 million. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in  Spanish 22 Feb 94 p 63)    In its most recent meeting, the Monetary Board favored the  terms of negotiations on the public and private foreign debts  with the Paris Club. After analyzing the contents of the  agreements with creditor countries, the Monetary Board concluded  that the terms will not adversely affect the balance of payments  or the money in circulation in the country. Willy Zapata,  president of the Central Bank and the Monetary Board, noted that  the negotiations are in their final phase and that it is  estimated that they will conclude in late March. Because of the  crisis of the 1980's, the country was left without reserves and  was forced to suspend its foreign debt payments. Last year, it  was allowed to renegotiate its overdue debts through  negotiations with the Paris Club. In these renegotiations, the  creditor countries gave Guatemala 20 years to pay its debt with  a 10-year grace period. "This means that Guatemala will begin  paying its debt in the year 2003," Zapata remarked.

With this second disbursement,  the amount the IDB has given Guatemala totals $122 million of  the $132 million in loans agreed upon. The remaining $10  million will be disbursed within a few months. The  modernization program is aimed at making credit to Guatemalans  more readily available through the banks. It also seeks "to  expand the operations of the national financial system to  promote capital flow and credit to all sectors and to people who  want to participate in the country's development."

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE AIR FARE COLLUSION  </P> <P> Justice Department antitrust lawyers are investigating whether airline fare  increases in September resulted from any collusion among the carriers, the  department said Thursday.  </P> <P> Civil investigative demands -- the equivalent of criminal subpoenas -- seeking  internal pricing information were sent to several airlines soon after the  increase went into effect Sept. 29, a department spokeswoman said. Industry  sources said most major airlines received the department's requests for data.  </P> <P> Although acknowledging that the investigation is under way, Amy Brown, the  department spokeswoman, declined to state whether it signaled a renewed  interest in assuring price competition in the airline industry or whether the  nature of this particular increase seemed different from other industrywide  price changes in recent years.  </P> <P> The increases, which appeared first in a Sept. 18 announcement by American  Airlines, ranged from $10 to $80 a trip and were pegged to the number of days  before the flight that tickets were purchased -- with the biggest price hikes  imposed on tickets purchased closest to departure. The increases appear to have  been adopted throughout the industry.  </P> <P> "We cooperated and returned the requested documents a couple of weeks ago," Pam  Hanlon, a spokeswoman for Pan American World Airways, said. "We would be  reluctant to disclose" the specific items sought by the department, she added.  </P> <P> However, a source familiar with the civil investigative demands said they  included any correspondence or other contact regarding pricing among the  airlines.  </P> <P> "We were contacted several weeks ago by the Justice Department and asked for  information about the fare action late in the fall," said Mary O'Neill, an  American Airlines spokeswoman. "We have cooperated fully."  </P> <P> Edwin I. Colodny, chairman and president of USAir, said Thursday: "It's my  understanding that the Justice Department asked all the airlines for  information. I'm not worried about it. There is no collusion." He spoke in a  brief interview at a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce luncheon.  </P> <P> Existence of the investigation was first disclosed Thursday by the Wall Street  Journal.  </P> <P> The investigation is the Justice Department's first civil antitrust inquiry  into airline pricing to surface publicly since 1985 when American Airlines, its  chief executive, Robert Crandall, and the Justice Department entered into a  consent decree barring conversations on fares between American and competitors.  </P> <P> Though he declined to discuss details of the current probe, Brown said it is  not related to the investigation of predatory pricing that James F. Rill,  assistant attorney general for antitrust, discussed in Senate testimony Sept.  20.  </P> <P> That investigation, which is looking into possible cutting of fares below cost  to drive competitors out of the market, is continuing, Brown said.  </P> <P> Concern about rising air fares and decreased competition has been expressed in  Congress recently. After airline deregulation in 1978, air fares dropped  sharply under pressure from new, price-slashing competitors. But some of these  competitors have dropped out of business, giving rise to fears about lack of  effective competition.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Denise Gellene in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / War of words over Baltic pull-out THE WAR of words between Russia and Lithuania grew more heated yesterday, after Moscow abruptly broke off talks last week and suspended its troop pull-out from the Baltic state. President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman warned Lithuania against seeking to apply international pressure on Russia to stick to an earlier agreement to withdraw its troops by the end of the month. 'The striving to inflict pressure through a third country can only cause a negative reaction,' Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. Lithuania appealed for international help after the Russian foreign ministry issued a surprisingly harsh statement telling Lithuania it no longer considered itself bound to complete a troop pull-out by August 31. Russia said it would withdraw over a period which was 'convenient to it' and which Lithuania would be informed of in due course. The statement accused Lithuania of blocking an agreement and hinted it was annoyed by Lithuanian demands for compensation for damage done by five decades of Soviet occupation. 'Democratic Russia is not responsible for the totalitarian repression of Stalinism. It suffered itself,' Mr Kostikov said. While only 2,500 Russian soldiers are left in Lithuania, mainly support staff based in the western port city of Klaipeda, Lithuanian officials said they feared Russia might bring back more troops to strengthen its position. 'We are prepared for the worst,' said Mr Justas Paleckis, an adviser to President Algirdas Brazauskas. The left-leaning Lithuanian government, surprised by the Russian move, had refrained from joining in the sharp criticism made by the nationalistic opposition, led by Mr Vytautas Landsbergis. Mr Brazauskas, who won February's presidential elections promising to maintain good relations with Russia, appealed for calm in a televised speech on Sunday night. He also expressed a desire to compromise, without condemning the Russian step.</p>

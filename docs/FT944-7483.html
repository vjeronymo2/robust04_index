			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Research Machines to join market Research Machines, a supplier of computers and computer software to schools and colleges, is coming to the market through a placing likely to value the company at about Pounds 30m. The company is expected to publish its pathfinder document later today. The flotation is not intended to raise new money for the company, which has about Pounds 6.5m in the bank, but to raise the profile and enhance the reputation of a 21-year-old company which is still relatively unknown outside the UK education market. It is anxious to increase its presence overseas where a listing would give it greater credibility. The flotation will also provide liquidity for existing shareholders including Citicorp, 3i, Kleinwort Benson and Rothschild. Last year it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.52m on turnover of Pounds 66.2m.</p>

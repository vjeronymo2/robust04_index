			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique </F> National Resistance, by Emilio Manhique in Maputo on 17 May --  recorded]    [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], left Maputo today for Maringue and the city  of Quelimane, where he will meet with Renamo district delegates  in Zambezia and Nampula Provinces.    [Dhlakama] Maringue is still our headquarters. It is the  historic headquarters. So, I will just stop over there on my  way to Quelimane, Zambezia Province. I will arrive in Maringue  today. On 20 May, I will leave for Quelimane where I will  attend a conference with all our district and provincial  delegates from Zambezia and Nampula. They are assembled in  Quelimane.    [Manhique] There is a question that I have been wanting to  ask you for a long time now. The city of Beira is very close to  Maringue. Yet, you have not gone there. Is there any special  reason?    [Dhlakama] Beira is my home.    [Manhique] But you have never visited it.    [Dhlakama] When I am in Maringue, it is like being in Beira.  Everyday I receive people from Beira -- our delegates, as well  as relatives. To be in Beira is like being in Maringue. I am  giving priority to the provinces which are distant from Maringue.    [Manhique] Have you already set a definite date to visit  Beira?    [Dhlakama] Yes, I will be there in June.    [Manhique] For sure?    [Dhlakama] For sure. I will visit Beira, Manica, and  Chimoio.    [Manhique] One has the feeling that the peace process is  somewhat bogged down. It seems that there are many problems,  things are not running smoothly, and there is some mistrust.  Would you like to comment?    [Dhlakama] I can clarify that. There are no problems. What  happens is that our Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]  brothers are nervous. That is self-evident. That has been  noticable over the past month. We understand the reason for  their nervousness. It is because they have been in power alone  for over 18 years, with no political opposition. In view of the  pressure from the various political parties, Frelimo does not  feel comfortable. Why do I say that? For instance, now the  question is whether the army should consist of 30,000 or 15,000  men. We have already said time is running out. It is  impossible to train 30,000 men before elections are held. The  government, however, insists that we go for it. Meanwhile, the  government has not made preparations for training. That makes us  believe that the government will continue to press for an army  of 30,000 men, thought it will not be able to do that. So, by  October the government will say that there can be no elections  because we have not completed training the army.    We are insisting to the government that we should only train  half of the required number. The other half will be selected  and sent home on leave for about three or four months. After  the elections, they will be called up. We are, however,  negotiating with the government.    [Manhique] It appears that there is a great deal of  confusion  in Sofala Province. Woodcutters claim you have assured them  that they can operate freely. There are, let us say, little  Renamo chiefs who are complicating things. Are you going to  deal with this issue?    [Dhlakama] There is no confusion. We have grown tired of  this situation. Our policy is to protect economic resources.  We have never allowed more than 150 people, claiming to be  woodcutters, to go about destroying the forest. That is where  we differ from Frelimo. Nobody has given them permission. At my  base in Maringue I received more than 150 woodcutters after the  signing of the General Peace Accord. We cannot allow people to  destroy the whole forest. We are protecting the forest. The  woodcutters have no reforestation program. They fell tress and  that is it. So, we are protecting the forest. It is not true  to say that I have given permission to fell trees and then a  little chief contradicts that.    [Manhique] So, what the woodcutters are saying is not true.    [Dhlakama] It is not true.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Helicopter scare in N Sea oilfield EMERGENCY services were called out yesterday after a North Sea helicopter on its way to the Brae oilfield suffered engine trouble. The helicopter, carrying 17 oilmen and two crew, later landed safely on the Miller platform. The alert came nearly three weeks after 11 men died when a helicopter crashed into the sea while taking workers from Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform to an accommodation vessel.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / OFT seeks power to probe cartels A DEMAND for tougher powers to investigate and impose penalties on cartels came yesterday from Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading. It was the second time this week that Sir Gordon had criticised the government's approach to competition policy. On Tuesday he told a parliamentary select committee that the policy of Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary who has referred bids by state-owned groups to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, was in disarray. Sir Gordon wants to be allowed to impose fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover on companies operating cartels. He also wants the government to broaden the OFT's powers to investigate cartels which operate within Britain. This would allow the OFT to match within the UK the European Commission's power to investigate cartels involving trade within the EC. Sir Gordon told a conference on regulation organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs: 'My officials accompany their counterparts from the EC when they mount raids in Britain and come back telling me how useful wider investigative powers would be.' He said it was unfortunate there was no sign of legislation on the issue even though the government had committed itself to such a measure in a White Paper on competition policy in July 1989. Sir Gordon hopes that a commitment to strengthen the OFT's powers to investigate cartels will be included in a forthcoming speech by Mr Lilley in which he plans to clarify the government's approach to competition policy. Sir Gordon told the conference that the pace of regulatory reform over the past 12 years - with the creation of powerful regulatory bodies to oversee privatised telecommunications, gas, electricity and water utilities - had created a patchwork of agencies and regulatory instruments. He raised doubts about the effectiveness of self-regulatory bodies under the Financial Services Act. The procedure under which he reported to the trade and industry secretary was a 'special, awkward and peculiar regime'. He said there was a risk regulations designed to protect investors were counter-productive because they imposed heavy costs on a dwindling number of independent financial advisers.

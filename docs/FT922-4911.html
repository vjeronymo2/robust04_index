			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Italian public offerings lined up THE LIST of Italian state-owned companies planning to raise money from private investors is set to grow following the news yesterday that preliminary prospectuses for Agip and Snam should be ready within the next month, writes Haig Simonian. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the chairman of ENI, the energy and chemicals group which owns the companies, said that valuation work should be finalised soon. Although ENI had already indicated plans for an initial public offering of shares in Agip and Snam on the Milan and foreign stock exchanges this year, this is the first time it has given any precise indication of the timing. Both companies are highly profitable. Agip, which is Italy's biggest oil and gas group, announced net earnings of L1,101bn (Dollars 908m) on sales of L10,957bn last year. Snam, which specialises in distributing natural gas, made after tax profits of L635bn last year on sales of L11,479bn. Mr Cagliari gave no indication of how much of the two companies would be floated, although he indicated that the overall transaction should raise around L2,000bn. IRI, the state-owned group, is is also planning to tap investors later this year.</p>

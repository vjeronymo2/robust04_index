			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: MCANALLY REALLY IN HIS PRIME IN 'COUP'  </P> <P> At last year's annual conference of the Labor Party in Britain, some of the  delegates were seen to be wearing badges that said "Harry Perkins for Prime  Minister."  </P> <P> This was a nice tribute to 62-year-old Irish actor Ray McAnally. He plays the  Socialist steelworker who becomes prime minister in the near-future  post-Thatcher years in the dazzling political thriller "A Very British Coup,"  which has been shown twice in Britain and which airs on PBS here Sunday and  Monday night. (See Howard Rosenberg's adjoining review.)  </P> <P> Like some Americans who found Henry Fonda so convincing as President that he  could probably fill the office, there were murmurs that the distressed Labor  Party might indeed think of McAnally (who is nothing if not convincing in the  role) for P.M.  </P> <P> McAnally, who is visiting Los Angeles to discuss some film projects, was moved  to write a tongue-deeply-in-cheek article for the New Statesman magazine,  declining to run. The magazine had carried a piece asking "Is Harry Perkins the  best prime minister the Labor Party never had?"  </P> <P> In his article, McAnally noted that both Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II  had done some acting before they went on to other work, but that he was not yet  done with acting. "I said I'd rather be an old hand than a new statesman,"  McAnally remarked the other day with a devilish Celtic grin.  </P> <P> The acclaim for his portrayal of the shrewd, tough, quick-tongued, dead-honest  Harry Perkins has included a color picture in Time magazine. McAnally's  preferred status as what he calls "the enigma" may be in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "I love the anonymity," McAnally says. "Maybe at a certain point, somebody will  say, 'Wait a minute, isn't that the chap who played that other role, the  cardinal or whatever it was?' But even then, perhaps they're not quite sure.  Oh, no, I like not bringing a lot of baggage to a new part. I prefer being the  enigma."  </P> <P> He is, that is, the actor who immerses himself in a role so thoroughly that he  is not the identifiable star pretending to be someone else.  </P> <P> When McAnally was at the Cannes film festival with "The Mission," in which he  indeed played the cardinal whose questioning face is the film's final image, a  reporter kindly remarked that it was wonderful McAnally should be getting such  acclaim for his first film.  </P> <P> Yes, but it wasn't quite his first film, McAnally replied. Making a joke of it  to spare the reporter some discomfort, he added that it was actually his 207th.  </P> <P> Now that was an Irish statistic, enriched by a generous infusion of blarney.  But it might have been his 40th. McAnally's amused and enigmatic point was that  he had been around quite a while, doing unobtrusively good work. Superior work,  an admirer might well add. Since his early days at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin,  he has done 250 plays, 50 films, 250 television appearances and more radio  shows than he can count.  </P> <P> He worked with James Cagney in "Shake Hands With the Devil" in 1958 and with  Gary Cooper in "The Naked Edge" in 1961. Last fall he was the ebullient con man  Rick Pym, father of Magnus, the perfect spy, in public television's "A Perfect  Spy."  </P> <P> As Pym, he aged from 25 to 75, from the brash young trickster to a scruffy old  man on the run, his charm and confidence now like the last bits of  silver-plating on a cheap spoon. There was in Pym little of the sad-eyed  worldly wisdom of the cardinal, nothing of the steely intensity and concern of  Harry Perkins, little of the public Ray McAnally but everything of the  thoughtful private craftsman McAnally is.  </P> <P> Accepting a British Academy Award for "The Mission," McAnally said, "The  wonderful thing about acting is that it lets you live other lives, like the  life of a 17th-Century cardinal."  </P> <P> Over lunch in Santa Monica, McAnally added that "the more seriously you take  the roles, the more interesting a life you lead. I've operated as a surgeon,  taken a submarine up and down, been shot, mangled and strangled and died any  number of times. It's all bound to be good for your breadth of mind, isn't it?"  </P> <P> Rick Pym was a favorite role. "There's something intriguing about watching a  con man conning," McAnally says. "You want him to get away with it. You see  through it, of course, and you feel superior to the victim. 'Look at that silly  fool being taken,' you say."  </P> <P> The Pym character was based on author John le Carre's own father, who went to  prison for fraud. McAnally met the author only once, at a dinner with BBC brass  before production began. Le Carre entered the room just as McAnally was  demonstrating the imposing presence of his fellow Irish actor Michael  MacLiammoir. McAnally stood and surveyed the room in a commanding and confident  way. "My God," Le Carre murmured to his host, "it's Rick." It was the first of  McAnally's good reviews for the role.  </P> <P> "A Very British Coup," financed by Britain's Channel Four, drew enormous  comment at home. "The conservative press praised the acting, the direction and  the production," McAnally remarks, "and said it was very good for a vehicle of  the fantasy type. The opposition press ignored the acting, the direction and  the production completely and said these matters the plot is about need grave  attention."  </P> <P> McAnally, who feels toward idleness a distaste bordering on revulsion, has done  three films since "A Very British Coup." Just now he wound up a remake of  "Great Expectations" for Disney with Jean Simmons and Anthony Hopkins. He has  played a Scottish fishing boat captain in the Orkneys in "Venus Peter." He has  been the father of Christie Brown in "My Left Foot," based on the autobiography  of the man who has created art and literature with the only part of his body he  could move.  </P> <P> McAnally also played what proved to be the title role in "Jack the Ripper" with  Michael Caine for television and did a four-month run in the West End as George  Bernard Shaw in "The Best of Friends," co-starring with John Gielgud and  Rosemary Harris.  </P> <P> Between 1985 and 1988, McAnally reckons he did 16 films, three miniseries and a  half-dozen plays. Now he's been asked to write a book about the Abbey. He  calculates that he is a member of its third generation, and he'll probably do  the book to preserve a piece of history that is fading. The Abbey is changing  because young actors will no longer sign the lifetime contracts that were once  the standard.  </P> <P> "Nor five-year contracts, nor even contracts for a year," McAnally says. It  seems a pity to him because the long, intense rehearsals and the runs  themselves become for the players profound explorations of the characters and  ultimately of the players themselves.  </P> <P> "The thing of it is," Ray McAnally says, "that the more truthful you are about  the interior of yourself, the more universal you are in your meaning to an  audience."  </P> <P> What now remains to be seen is whether McAnally, whose fame is fast increasing,  can be well known and enigmatic at the same time.  </P></p>

Context of Joint Exercises"]    [Text] Orenburg City -- Forty years ago nuclear weapons  tests in the atmosphere were carried out at the Totskoye test  site in Orenburg Oblast. Many of those who happened to be in  the area of the dangerous experiment are suffering from the  tests' effects to this day.    Totskoye test site was recently visited by Brigadier General  Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. Army 3d Infantry  Division. He was studying preparations for the tactical  exercises scheduled for summer 1994 in the southern Urals in the  same places where the atomic epoch left its tragic mark four  decades ago.    Who is Holder? What constitutes a U.S. division? The U.S.  general fought in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait and has a  master's degree in European history. He once taught at a  military academy. He has written a number of books on tactics  and the art of warfare.    The 3d Division, which Holder commands, is armed with the  latest military equipment. It consists of over 18,000 people,  290 tanks, 600 armored fighting vehicles and armored personnel  carriers, 220 artillery pieces including nine multiple  rocket-launchers, and 127 helicopters, 44 of them attack  helicopters. The division has a signals battalion as well as  mass destruction weapons protection and military police  companies.    It must be stressed that during Operation Desert Storm  alone,  which was notorious for its ferocity, the U.S division destroyed  105 enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers and captured over  800 soldiers. Currently 1,100 of the division's soldiers are in  Kuwait or on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Holder is now apparently  ready to pass on his combat experience of massacring an enemy to  Russian soldiers, in particular the personnel of the 27th  Russian Division at the Totskoye test site. Our division  consists of 8,000 soldiers and is equipped with tanks, armored  personnel carriers, self-propelled guns, mortars, and multiple  rocket-launcher systems.    The public in the Orenburg and Volga regions, concerned by  the unfolding events, are protesting strongly against the  scheduled exercises. Exactly what kind of joint "peacekeeping"  tasks can be being tackled here is a complete mystery. A number  of sociopolitical organizations in Samara and Orenburg Oblasts  have adopted a joint statement in which they strongly protest  about the two divisions' "peacekeeping" combat operations.  Especially as these exercises are extremely dangerous in a  region saturated with the defense industry. This area is  Russia's bread basket. Let us not forget that the Orenburg  region is a border oblast neighboring Kazakhstan. The  saber-rattling could alarm peoples with whom we have lived on  good terms.    The statement was supported by the oblast organizations of  the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Russian Communist  Workers' Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Socialist  Party of the Working People, the "For Social Justice" voters'  association, the Union of Officers, and veterans' and other  organizations.    A large group of candidates for Orenburg Oblast's  legislative  assembly has protested.    The text of the document was handed over to Vladimir  Nikolayevich Volkov, State Duma deputy from Orsk Electoral  District No. 133 and member of the committee for defense  questions, at a meeting with voters.</p>

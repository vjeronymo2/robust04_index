			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a letter sent today to the UN Security Council,  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency informs this body that the Serbian aggressor has  launched a fierce attack at the region of Bihac.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has successfully repelled the  brunt of the enemy attack, but everything implies that the Serbs  will not refrain from trying to capture this region, which is a  safe haven under the control of UN forces.    President Izetbegovic has asked the international  community's  Security Council and NATO to intervene swiftly to prevent new  massacres and ethnic cleansing in this part of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

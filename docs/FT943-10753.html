			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bank syndicate gears up to sell WPP shares from September The syndicate of banks which acquired shares in WPP, the marketing services group, in a Dollars 271.6m debt-for-equity swap in 1992, is gearing up to sell its interests from September. WPP announced yesterday that conversion notices had been received from the syndicate for 169.5m convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares. These are expected to convert to 190.2m ordinary shares - equivalent to 26.5 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share capital. The group said the shares could be sold from September 1. The bank syndicate has appointed a consortium made up of Bankers Trust International, JP Morgan Securities, and SG Warburg Securities to dispose of the new ordinary shares. The consortium said the number of shares to be sold will probably not be decided until nearer the sale date. A series of presentations by WPP management to investment institutions in the UK and continental Europe will be made during August, following the group's interim results. The deal struck in July 1992 stated that members of the syndicate could sell the ordinary shares arising on conversion at any time after September 2 1994. The first available date would have been September 3 - a Saturday - so WPP has agreed to bring the date forward to September 1. A further 12.2m convertible preference shares are convertible at any time. Conversion of these shares would mean the issue of a further 13.7m new ordinary shares - 1.9 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share issue. WPP shares were unchanged yesterday at 111p.</p>

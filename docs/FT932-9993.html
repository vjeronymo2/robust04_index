			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canada halves stake in Cameco THE Canadian government has halved its stake in Cameco Corporation, one of the world's biggest uranium producers, through a secondary issue of shares to the public. A group of underwriters, led by Burns Fry and RBC Dominion Securities of Toronto, yesterday sold 5m Cameco shares to institutional and retail investors at CDollars 20.50 a share. Before the sale, the shares were trading at CDollars 21.25 on the Toronto stock exchange. The bulk of the shares were sold in Canada, with European investors buying less than 10 per cent. The sale lifts the public's stake in Cameco to 51.5 per cent from 41.9 per cent. The federal government now owns 19.2 per cent, with the remaining 38.9 per cent held by the province of Saskatchewan, where Cameco is based. Both the federal and Saskatchewan governments aim to dispose of their entire stake by October 1995. The response to the Cameco issue was relatively subdued compared with other share offerings by Canadian resource companies in the past few weeks. One of the underwriters said investors appeared to be holding back, with the uranium market weak and further parcels of Cameco stock expected to come on to the market over the next year or two. In addition to its uranium mines in northern Saskatchewan and processing facilities in Ontario, Cameco is prospecting for gold and diamonds. The company earned CDollars 8m (USDollars 6.4m) last year on sales of CDollars 305m. It produced 13.6m lbs of uranium concentrates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marcos Antonio Aleman] </F>   [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] preliminary results  support statements made by the ruling party's candidate, who  said he would win the elections the first time around, but the  opposition candidate insists there is no absolute winner and  added there will be need for a runoff elections. Preliminary  figures gave the advantage to the ruling Nationalist Republican  Alliance, ARENA, and in a news conference, ARENA candidate  Armando Calderon Sol said preliminary results clearly indicate a  tendency favoring his party.    [Begin Calderon recording] In compliance with the agreement  I  signed, I cannot declare myself the winner, the victor at this  time of the night. I respect the pledge I took. [end recording]    Calderon Sol cautiously said TSE figures have given him the  victory in the first round.    [Begin Calderon recording] TSE figures, the vote tally, have  accorded me the victory the first time around, but I cannot say  that because I would be violating my pledge and doing what I  have criticized Mr. [Ruben] Zamora for doing. He has said there  will be runoff elections, and that is not so. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the  leftist coalition supported by the former Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front [FMLN], said projections show the need  for runoff elections. Zamora said the fact it will be necessary  to hold runoff elections represents a defeat for the ruling  party, ARENA. He also announced the beginning of a battle for  electoral purity.    [Begin Zamora recording] We are hereby beginning the battle  for electoral purity in the runoff elections to make sure all  the Salvadorans can vote in the runoff elections so we do not  have to face what happened today. Because of TSE's critical  deficiencies, thousands of Salvadorans were excluded from  exercising their right to vote; thousands of them could not  exercise that right because they were not included on the list;  because they had a voter registration card but did not appear in  the lists; or because their numbers were changed in the lists.  Therefore, when they arrived to vote another person had  exercised their right to vote. [end recording]    If Zamora's charges are confirmed, the runoff elections  should be held in April. Approximately 2.3 million Salvadorans  registered to vote but the FMLN insisted there were serious  irregularities in the process, for example, people who  registered and failed to receive their voter registration card.</p>

Zakhmatov (Problems of Material Science </F> Institute), AN Ukrayiny; UDC 654.924.5]    [Abstract] The development of a considerable industrial  potential, particularly in oil and gas production, transport and  consumption, has led to uncontrolled ecological catastrophes  comparable to catastrophes caused by wars. The current  protection technology is inefficient, poorly yields itself to  control and inadequate to the scope of destruction factors.  Mechanisms of pulsed detonation feeding and sputtering of  powders and liquids for fire extinguishing, setting up light and  heat protection screens in order to prevent explosions, and  spraying of binding coatings are being studied at the Problems  of Material Science Institute of the Academy of Sciences of  Ukraine. Key propositions of the theory of pulsed protective  action have been developed. A number of pulse devices have been  built and tested at test sites under close to real-life  conditions. A multibarrel unit that periodically creates  gas-dispersed streams with controlled parameters comprise the  most powerful pulsed system. The units are mounted on tank  chassis (50 barrels), gun carriages (9, 16 or 25 barrels) or on  skids (4, 7, 8 or 9 barrels). An important advantage of a  multibarrel unit is the capability to push and spray any  granular powders, liquids and viscous substances. The article  presents test results of various units. Simple explosive devices  and fire extinguishing bombs also have been developed and  tested. Multibarrel units can be effectively used for fighting  forest fires, as well as fires at oil and gas installations and  chemical industry enterprises, fires that can happen at airports  during emergency landing of an aircraft, and ship fires caused  by spilled petroleum products.

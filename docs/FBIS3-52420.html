They said they intended to submit that  draft to the meeting the 10 Palestinian factions were to hold  yesterday evening in Damascus to reactivate the role of the  coalition of the 10 factions out in the streets, in the field,  and in the political arena, and also to discuss political and  organizational relations with the aim of drawing up a joint  political program and joint leaderships structure, as stated in  a statement issued by these factions.    The new organizational draft of the four factions includes  the following:    1. Formation of a higher central command of the alliance of  Palestinian forces, to include two representatives from each  faction. The command would meet once every two weeks and its  decisions would be based on agreement among members. The  command would draft bylaws to organize its work and would form  the committees it deems necessary for that purpose.    2. Formation of a day-to-day follow-up command to include  one representative from each faction. Its task would be to  follow up implementation of the central command's decisions.    3. Confirmation of the previous decision to set up a  national and Islamic command for the intifadah inside the  occupied homeland, embodying all the factions which insist on  the intifadah option and which reject the capitulationist  agreement, to start work immediately.    4. Reactivation and continuation of the preparatory  committee for the general national congress to mobilize the  broadest possible front of patriotic rejectionist figures and  forces, according to the following guidelines:    A. A call for a national congress in the occupied homeland  to include patriotic, democratic, and Islamic forces, factions,  trends, and figures opposed to the agreement, and formation of a  preparatory committee of representatives of these forces and  figures to make the necessary arrangements for the congress,  from which a national steering committee for the Palestinian  people in the occupied territory should emerge, and also to  select representatives to the general national congress.    B. Full national and popular conferences in the camps and  environs of the Palestinian people in the diaspora to choose  representatives for the general national congress.    C. The general national congress shall combine  representatives of patriotic forces, factions, and figures  opposed to the agreement as well as representatives of the  national and popular conferences in the homeland and in the  diaspora, the aim being to continue the intifadah and strip  'Arafat and his clique who signed the agreement of their  legitimacy.    D. The preparatory committee, in consultation with all the  forces and influential figures, should devise a suitable  mechanism for the general national congress as soon as possible,  prepare the necessary documents for that purpose, and seek to  crystallize political and organizational formulas that would  safeguard the Palestinian national struggle in the future.</p>

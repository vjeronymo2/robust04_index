			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends at day's low Johannesburg finished at its low for the day as early steady sentiment was eroded by weaker London shares and concern about Wall Street's direction. A lack of upward momentum in the gold price also depressed equities. The overall index finished 45.6 lower at 5,648.9, industrials lost 33.9 to 6,819.6 and golds gave up 26 to 1,877.5. De Beers finished R1.75 down at R89.75, Anglos was R3.25 lower at R220.75 and JCI fell R4 to R99. Gencor lost 10 cents to R13.65.</p>

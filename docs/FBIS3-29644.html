The House of Representatives Budget Committee made the  decision in a bid to substantiate Hosokawa's assertion that he  repaid a 1982 loan of 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, then  chairman of the Sagawa Kyubin group of trucking and  parcel-delivery firms and one of key figures in a money-and-mob  scandal.    Committee debates on a third supplementary budget for fiscal  1993 were interrupted to deal with the matter after negotiations  by senior committee officials over the issue ran into problems,  parliamentary sources said.    Hosokawa has said he borrowed the money to buy a condominium  and repair his home in Kumamoto, western Japan, and that he  repaid the loan by January 31, 1991.    On Tuesday morning, Hosokawa turned in a "certificate"  issued  by the Tokyo branch of Sagawa Kyubin which says "the 100 million  yen has been entirely repaid and collateral rights have ceased."    But two opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party, were not satisfied with  the document.    Hosokawa last December submitted a memo to the opposition  intended to substantiate his claim.    The Sagawa Kyubin group was embroiled in a money scandal  involving a number of leading figures, including Shin Kanemaru,  former LDP kingmaker, who was charged with tax evasion last  March.</p>

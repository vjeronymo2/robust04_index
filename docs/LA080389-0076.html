			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 BUSINESS TAXES TO INCREASE  </P> <P> El Segundo council members have adopted a measure that will boost three  existing business taxes and raise more than $6 million annually in new revenue.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which three weeks ago had been informally endorsed by voice  vote, was approved 3 to 2. Council members Scot Dannen and Jim Clutter, who  voted against it, favored imposing a payroll tax on business.  </P> <P> The other council members, including Mayor Carl Jacobson, had initially  supported a payroll tax, but changed their minds after representatives of the  city's large aerospace industry lobbied against it. A payroll tax would have  meant substantially higher tax bills for some of the city's major companies,  such as Hughes Aircraft, that employ large numbers of well-paid professionals.  </P> <P> El Segundo officials have said that without new revenues, the city is facing a  $1.6-million deficit in its $20-million operational budget this year, as well  as further postponement of a number of capital improvement projects that it has  not been able to afford.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, the employee tax will double to $120 per worker, and the  square-footage tax for companies with more than 5,000 square feet will  quadruple to 20 cents. In addition, an acreage tax imposed on some industrial  businesses will increase from $300 to $500.  </P></p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Breeding success from a budding generation / A look at Spring Ram's winning formula for beating the recession CITY analysts will today have plenty of opportunity to cross examine Spring Ram Corporation, the kitchens and bathrooms group, on how it has beaten the recession. The results presentation, which is expected to include a near-25 per cent increase in pre-tax profit, is being attended by 18 directors from the main board and subsidiaries. Estimates of the pre-tax figure hover around Pounds 37m to Pounds 38m, compared with Pounds 30.1m in 1990. What the crowd coming down from Yorkshire should try to explain is how a company that was a baby in the last recession has tackled this one like a veteran, while continuing to grow like a stripling. Mr Bill Rooney, Spring Ram's chairman and joint founder, tends to talk about enthusiastic people, or even magic beans, suggesting that many of the reasons are intangible. However, some more down-to-earth strands can be traced and they weave themselves into a pattern of growth that has so far proved repeatable. Cash has been one of the keys. Spring Ram got over a bulge in capital spending in the late 1980s and in 1989 and 1990 spent only Pounds 3m a year. Cash held grew to Pounds 31.3m by the end of 1990 and interest contributed Pounds 2.2m to annual profit. Last year, even though capital spending was stepped up to nearer Pounds 15m, the cash pile continued to grow. In the autumn it was on course for a near-50 per cent expansion to roughly Pounds 45m. This contrasts with the debt-laden state of its two main rivals in kitchens, Magnet and MFI. Interest will again have been a profit centre in 1991, with resources husbanded in the tightest of ways. The Ram collects promptly but takes its time to pay, for instance. The more creative part of the equation has been the taking up of the factory capacity by a growing number of operating companies, created by a process similar to biological budding. New subsidiaries have rolled out the range of products into different niches of the kitchens and bathrooms markets. Last year, the generation of youngsters coming into profit included Chippendale Kitchens, taking the group into a more up-market area. Similarly the channels of distribution have multiplied. Independent retailers, won over by Spring Ram's marketing support, provided the original skeleton. It has been fleshed out by the DIY superstores and builders' merchants - supplied on the bathroom side, for instance, by another young company called Streamline. The process is set to continue with companies spun off to supply ceramic tiles - increasing the product range in a conventional Ram area - and doors, where a small acquisition followed by factory building is pushing the group into new parts of the house. The scale of the group's ambitions can be measured by the Pounds 60m that it plans to spend on factories over the next two years. Such heavy investment sounds like a risk and the case for saying it will pay off is based simply on history. In spite of the switch to cash absorption and the continued recession, analysts are forecasting a further profit rise this year - albeit at a slower rate. This bullishness is reflected in the share price, which has shot up from 63p at the beginning of last year to 164p earlier this month. Friday's close of 155p is more than 20 times estimated 1991 earnings. There has been some profit realisation along the way, notably by directors last summer. One of them, Mr Francis Galvin, has left and seems set to use the money to build a rival kitchens business. Perhaps a case of the budding going too far. How the group will maintain its entrepreneurial spirit in-house as it gets bigger - its market value is about Pounds 560m already - is just part of the inevitable question that will be asked after today's meeting: 'When will it run out of momentum?'</p>

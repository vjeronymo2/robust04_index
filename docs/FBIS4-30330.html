			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  resigned on Saturday [25 June] together with his cabinet  ministers in lieu of calling a snap general election and  creating a political vacuum at a time when Japan faces a number  of formidable challenges.    "I will resign with my cabinet en masse today," the premier  said at a hurriedly convened news conference at his official  residence.    "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will  entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the  Diet," Hata said.    The 58-year-old Hata said he decided to give up the  premiership because he wished to avoid contesting a general poll  for the House of Representatives and creating a political vacuum  before this year's summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major  industrialized nations.    "If the lower house is dissolved, there will arise a  political vacuum and it becomes impossible to tide over the  yen's appreciation and other problems," he said. "I want to  avoid a political vacuum by every means."    Hata's two-month-old cabinet formally resigned en masse  after  the premier's announcement of his intention to step down, but  Hata and his cabinet will stay on board until the Diet picks the  next prime minister.    Hata reached the decision to disband the minority coalition  government shortly before the lower house was to convene a  plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion filed by the  primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The no-confidence motion was expected to clear the  511-member  lower chamber after negotiations failed between the ruling  coalition and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former  coalition member, to form a new government.    The socialists, the largest contingent in the last Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government who walked out of the  coalition in April, also had threatened to submit its own  no-confidence motion.    Hata acknowledged he thought it difficult for his minority  government to vote down the motion and opted to disband his  cabinet before the motion was put to a floor vote.    During days of negotiations between the coalition and the  SDP, the socialists sought as a prerequisite for their return to  the ruling union the mass resignation of the Hata Cabinet on a  voluntary basis.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said the development was  what his party had demanded, adding it will seek to forge a  third coalition government.    Hata expressed hope the SDP will develop into a new party  that takes responsible action in Japanese politics, not as a  mere opposition party.    Meanwhile, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori expressed hope  his party will play a central role in a new government on the  grounds that the LDP is the largest single party in the Diet.    "As long as Hata said he will leave the issue of forming a  new administration to the will of the Diet, we have to govern as  the No. 1 party," Mori told reporters.    The LDP lost power last summer for the first time in 38  years  after failing to secure a majority in the lower house in a  general election.    Following Hata's resignation, the lower house decided to  hold  a plenary session at 1 p.m. Monday, where the next premier can  be selected at the earliest.    The current 150-day ordinary session of the Diet is  scheduled  to end next Wednesday.</p>

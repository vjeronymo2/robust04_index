			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Exco's future settled via placing with institutions THE FUTURE of Exco, one of the City's leading money brokers, was finally resolved last night with news that the majority of its shares are to be placed with a group of investment institutions. Exco's future has been uncertain since the collapse nearly two years ago of its parent, British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services group. Attempts by the B&amp;C administrators to float the group or find a buyer came to nothing. Mr Stephen Adamson of Ernst &amp; Young, one of the group's administrators, said that more than 50 per cent of the company's shares were to be sold to 'half a dozen' institutions assembled by NM Rothschild, the merchant bank. The expected sale price, which has yet to be concluded, was not disclosed. However, it is thought to value the money broker at considerably less than the Pounds 100m the administrators might have hoped to receive had the sale taken place at a more favourable time. Mr Adamson said the administrators had kept an undisclosed number of shares in Exco for sale in future when conditions improve. The B&amp;C administrators also said that they were close to paying out more than Pounds 200m to creditors of B&amp;C, which was brought down by losses at its Atlantic Computers leasing subsidiary. Following a scheme of arrangement agreed by B&amp;C creditors, and subject to court approval, Pounds 170m will be paid out in April to creditors of the B&amp;C holding company and its finance subsidiary, B&amp;C Group Finance. This would be the first payment, and would amount to 5p in the pound for creditors, together with 12p interest, Mr Adamson said. Creditors of the holding company should eventually receive back 23p in the pound, while the finance subsidiary is expected to pay 37p in the pound, he said. Also, the administrators are close to paying out more than Pounds 60m to creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Merchant Bank, equivalent to 20p in the pound. These creditors have already received 45p in the pound.</p>

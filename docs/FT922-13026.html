			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Observer: Hanson quits the turf It is not just Britain's horsy set which looks on the first Wednesday in June as one of the most important dates in the year. Derby Day is marked in red on a lot of proletarian calendars too. So there is bound to be widespread unease at the news that those well known turf accountants, Lords Hanson and White, are selling the Ever Ready battery company - proud sponsors of the Derby for the last six years. Is nothing sacred? Although Hanson has always insisted that sponsoring the Derby helped the group by re-vitalising its battery business's brand name, everyone knows that horse-racing is Lord White's favourite hobby. Last year's arrival on the Hanson board of champion jockey Chris Collins added weight to suspicion that the Derby was the one hobby horse that Hanson's hard-headed accountants were happy to feed. Yet Hanson is now selling Ever Ready to the world's biggest pet-food company . . . Hanson insists the deal has no strings attached to it that will permit the group's horse-loving directors to hang on to their Derby Day privileges. But buyer Ralston Purina says it has promised to honour Ever Ready's commitment to sponsor the event until 1994. Be that as it may, the future of the Hanson Coronation cup race in Derby week looks cloudy after this year. Moreover, there is little chance of Lord White hosting another Ever Ready Derby lunch, and still less of Epsom's new stand being named after him. Perhaps it's all for the best. Hanson has not been having much luck with sport. Not only has its investment in race-horses proved a financial and PR disaster, but its Tommy Armour golf club subsidiary stopped sponsoring Fred Couples less than four months before his weekend Masters tournament win.</p>

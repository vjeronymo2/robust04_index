			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PERU REBELS ATTACK MOBIL CAMP  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. has temporarily suspended its search for oil in Peru's jungle  after an attack by leftist rebels destroyed a jungle surveying camp it had  operated.  </P> <P> The attack this week was the most serious against Peru's oil industry in 10  years of political violence, as well as the largest ever against a foreign  company in Peru.  </P> <P> Peru's energy minister, Fernando Sanchez Albavera, said Wednesday that New  York-based Mobil would resume its survey operations in six to eight months with  Peru's army providing protection for the surveyors. But a Mobil spokesman  refused to say when exploration would be resumed.  </P> <P> Pro-Cuban rebels on Monday took over Mobil's survey camp in the Upper Huallaga  valley, 270 miles northeast of Lima.  </P> <P> The rebels, from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Group, blew up vehicles,  equipment and buildings and stole a helicopter. No one was hurt in the camp,  operated by a Mobil subcontractor, the Halliburton Geophysical Service.  </P></p>

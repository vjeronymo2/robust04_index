Gu Jinchi said: The letters and complaints work is an  important work through which we can listen to the voice of the  masses, rely on the masses, and maintain close ties with the  masses. The masses can not only reflect their opinions and  demands through the letters and complaints channels but also  exercise supervision on cadres and party members and provide  good opinions for the party and the government. Letters and  complaints departments should serve as good advisers to the  party and the government, strengthen the letters and complaints  work at the grass-roots level, and make grass-roots levels more  capable of solving problems on the spot. Letters and complaints  departments at all levels should pay attention to studying the  new situation in reform and do an even better job to ensure  smooth progress in reform. In addition, Gu Jinchi demanded that  leading comrades at all levels wholeheartedly support the work  of letters and complaints departments and create conditions for  them to do their work well.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Arrival of Japanese car plants will fuel growth of components sector, says study THE ARRIVAL of Japanese car plants in the UK will help fuel sustained growth for the motor components sector, says a study of the component industry's prospects, John Griffiths writes. It predicts that the plants will lift total demand for parts to Pounds 5.7bn by 1996 from Pounds 5bn last year. The study expects a 25 per cent increase in demand for components from vehicle makers over the period, based on an expected rise in car production from 1.25m last year to 1.5m in 1994. The market for equipment for new cars is expected to grow from Pounds 1.37bn last year to Pounds 1.71bn by 1996. The market for replacement parts is expected to grow more slowly - from an estimated Pounds 3.7bn last year to Pounds 3.99bn in 1994.</p>

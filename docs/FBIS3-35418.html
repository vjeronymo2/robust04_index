The explosion occurred  as the train was passing the village of al-Muti'ah after leaving  Asyut Station.    Some 11 passengers, including six tourists, were injured in  the explosion. They include: Major Faysal Fattuh al-Wakil of  Suhaj; Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hayy, a technician in the Arab  Contractors Company; Faysal Fahmi Adam, an orthopedist at Asyut  University; Lieutenant Jamal Ahmad Husayn, a resident of Suhaj;  and Rif'at 'Abd-al-Majid, a train worker. The wounded tourists  are Angel Ascot and Joe Fix, New Zealand; Ulrike Dolgan and  Christian Schreiker, Germany; and Grace Casio and Jocelyn  Clonita, Australia. They were all slightly hurt. All the  wounded were taken to Asyut University Hospital for treatment.    The explosion occurred in the second coach on first class,  damaging the coach roof and shattering windows. An initial  examination of the train indicates that the shattered glass  probably injured the passengers.    Leading officers in the Asyut Security Directorate, the  criminology laboratory, and various detective agencies went to  the scene and the prosecution was notified to launch an  investigation.    Investigations are under way to determine the circumstances  surrounding the incident. The train was sent on its way to  Suhaj then Luxor after an inspection by explosives experts.</p>

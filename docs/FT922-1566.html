			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / UK Company News: New structures that keep the stags at bay - The changes taking place in the way companies float their shares at a number unrivalled, barring privatisations, since before the 1987 stock market crash - would in days gone by have had the stags preparing for a bonanza. But this time round private investors hoping to make a quick profit by applying for shares and selling them soon afterwards may find that the issues have been structured to prevent the once-familiar scenes of mayhem when dealings in newly-floated companies' shares began. Partly through the privatisation programme, corporate financiers have developed ways to avoid the worst excesses of the old style issues, hoping to secure a higher price for companies going public and reduce the risk of spectacular flops. The new structures also cut commissions involved in issues. In the old days a flotation would usually mean a public offer for sale, perhaps with the price set by tender, but often with a fixed price pitched to ensure the issue's success. The offer would be fully sub-underwritten, costing 2 per cent of the value of the shares being sold in commissions. Investors would fill in their application forms - making multiple applications in the days before those were outlawed - then wait to see if the issue was oversubscribed. If an oversubscription was large it would result in a ballot for shares or the scaling down of allotments to perhaps 100 shares per investor. On the first day of dealings the shares would open at a large premium to the issue price, and stags would sell their small parcels of shares to institutions attempting to gather together a holding large enough to justify its place in a fund. Often large percentages of the newly-quoted company's share capital would change hands in the first few days of its stock market career. The Laura Ashley flotation in 1985 was by no means the worst example. Its offer for sale at 135p was 34 times oversubscribed, a ballot cut allotments to 300 shares for smaller applicants, and first day dealings saw the price at a 59p premium. But the shares' performance since has been dismal. While this was great fun for the stags, the company could feel it had sold its shares too cheaply, and paid a lot to do so. Since the last rash of new issues new ways of handling flotations have been introduced. Nowadays, according to one merchant banker, 'book-building is the buzz word in the new issue market'. Book-building - gathering indications of the number of shares institutions will buy in a placing at what price - is the basis of large international offers, such as those of Wellcome shares. But they have a place in smaller UK only issues. Corporate financiers say that book-building has always happened on an informal basis. That helps to assess at what price the shares will be fully taken up, so that pricing is a more exact art. Many of the current spate of issues have an institutional placing separate from the public offer for sale. This means the institutions can get the stock they want without having to scrabble in the aftermarket for it. It also reduces the risk of the issue flopping as a proportion of the offer is firmly placed before the public sale. 'A public offer for sale is a very blunt instrument,' one new issue expert says. 'There must be enough give in the price for the two week carry between pricing and applications closing'. Says one merchant banker: 'If you take the view that a proportion of the stock - say 65 or 75 per cent - is going to end up in the hands of the institutions, then the most effective and cheapest way of getting it there is through a placing. We are cutting out the stags, the middle men.' Another says: 'If you put the shares where the buyers are it makes the pricing more accurate.' That means a higher price as a narrower margin for error is needed. 'It is very, very hard to assess public demand', he says, explaining why in the past some issues have appeared underpriced. Kenwood Appliances, which is being valued at Pounds 104.5m in its float, is typical in placing half the 23.2m shares being sold and offering the rest to the public. The Telegraph and Anglian Windows issues take the same half and half route. The commissions on the public offer are the usual 2 per cent, with 1 1/4 per cent going to the sub-underwriters, and  3/4 per cent to the brokers who line up the sub-underwriters. But the placing involves commissions of only 3/4 per cent, of which  1/4 per cent goes to the brokers and  1/2 per cent to Schroders, the sponsoring bank. The bank takes on the full risk of holding the shares being placed in the few hours between pricing and the receipt of firm orders from the institutional buyers. At Kenwood's 285p issue price, the commissions on the public offer will total Pounds 662,000 and on the placing Pounds 248,000. By placing half the shares over Pounds 400,000 in commissions is saved. The Stock Exchange insists that a proportion of the shares - usually 25 per cent - in a flotation are publicly offered, unless the issue is raising under Pounds 15m. Smaller issues can thus avoid the costs involved in advertising a public offer, as well as the higher commissions. Country Casuals, the retail group, is only doing a placing in its flotation. However, another development in new issue tactics - the so-called financial intermediaries placing - helps smaller companies raise up to Pounds 30m without a public offer, and is also being used by larger ones to extend the placing element. One merchant banker planning a flotation for the autumn is aiming to keep the issue just under Pounds 30m to avoid the need for a costly public offer. Under this arrangement shares are placed with stockbrokers which specialise in dealing for private clients or small pension funds, charities or trusts. They then sell them to their clients at the issue price. These brokers can assure their clients that they will get shares, so they do not have to take the chance of applying in the public offer. However, investors who go through brokers will have to pay commission on the purchase whereas applicants in new issues pay no commissions. MFI Furniture Group's issue, expected to value the company at over Pounds 750m, will involve a public offer of 25 per cent, an institutional placing of 65 per cent or more, and a financial intermediaries placing of up to 10 per cent. The stags may not be pleased by these changes, but companies coming to the stock market must be pleased to see their shares heading into long-term holders hands at a higher price and lower cost.</p>

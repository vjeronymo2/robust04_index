			<p>BFN     [Text] London: Quds Press--A former PLO Executive  Committee member has termed yesterday's agreement launching  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho; unfair. Shafiq al-Hut, the PLO's  representative in Beirut, told Quds Press "the agreement puts  the Palestinian people's fate and cause on the line."    Al-Hut, who resigned his PLO membership to protest the  September signing of the Declaration of Principles agreement,  criticized the results of arduous negotiations between the  Palestinians and Israelis. The agreements that spelled out the  declaration of principles have confirmed the opponents of the  Oslo accord in their assessment that there has been a climbdown  on key issues. Al-Hut said that, initially, the Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat balked at signing the detailed annexes  of the agreement seeing that they had unforessen concessions  that took him by surprise, thus pointing up the existence of  differences blocking a final deal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By itar-tass correspondent tamara zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- The next package of the  president's economic decrees will contain a decree on the  dramatic reduction of mobilisation plans and reserve capacities  at enterprises of the defence complex. Deputy Prime Minister  and Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin announced today at a  meeting of the public chamber under the president of the Russian  Federation.    According to Shokin, the purpose of the decree is to promote  the working out of a new military doctrine and to reduce the  state order to the defence industry.    It is worth recalling that during his recent tour of the  country Yeltsin mentioned the forthcoming reduction of the army  from three million to 1.5 million and urged enterprises of the  defence complex to take up conversion. "The Russian Army does  not need a large amount of armaments. It needs mobile military  hardware, which can stand competition at the domestic and  foreign markets," the president said. His stand has been  reflected in the forthcoming decree.</p>

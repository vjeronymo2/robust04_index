Klimov, G.I. Zheltov, V.I. Mogutov, V.N. </F> Stiksova, Ye.V. Tolstikovaand V.P. Solovyov (Biophysics  Institute, Russian Federation Ministry of Health, Moscow)under  the ``Hygiene of Physical Factors'' rubric; received Nov 11 91;  UDC 617.7-057-02:[613.648:615.849.19-07]    [Abstract] The objective of the work was to substantiate  the coefficient ofinterspecific extrapolation (CIE) based on  results of comparison of the clinical picture of laser radiation  (LR) injuries to human eyes (as a result of accidents) and eyes  of laboratory animals - rabbits and monkeys (experimental data).  The clinical picture of the injury focus was used as the  equivalency criterion in determining the CIE, and the radiation  energy, under equal or very close to equal action conditions,  was used for comparison. Analysis was performed for LR with a  1.064 mcm wavelength and 10-100 nspulse length. Based on the  analysis of presented results it was concluded that eye immunity  of 21-27 years old people to threshold action of laser radiation  with the above parameters is higher than average eye immunity of  rabbits and monkeys by a factor of not more than 2.8 - 2.1 mean  with a mean deviation of plus or minus 0.7. This can be  considered the maximum CIE value when determining maximum  allowable levels of laser radiation based on data of  experimental studies of laboratory animals.

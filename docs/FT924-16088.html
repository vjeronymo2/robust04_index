			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / MMC to probe animal waste trade SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to carry out an investigation into the animal waste market. The references were prompted by a number of small acquisitions in recent years by Prosper de Mulder (PDM), Britain's largest offal rendering company. PDM's proposed acquisition of Nortech Foods, an animal fat processor, was cleared yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Sir Bryan concluded that the effect of the acquisition on competition was so small that it should not be referred to the MMC. However, he expressed concern about the cumulative effect on competition in the animal waste products market of the earlier acquisitions. Sir Bryan is concerned that the increasing domination of the industry by two companies - PDM in England and Wales and William Forrest and Son in Scotland  -may be incompatible with effective competition. The market was scrutinised by the MMC in March last year after the acquisition by PDM of the rendering interests of Croda International, its main competitor in southern England. The acquisition was approved in August. PDM has been required since an MMC investigation in 1985 to notify the government of any animal wastes acquisitions. Yesterday PDM appeared resigned to a further investigation, but said it was unsure what the probe could add to what was already known. The MMC has been asked to report in nine months.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Boost for futures FRENCH AND German money markets rallied strongly yesterday after the Bundesbank president was reported as saying that long-term interest rates in Germany could decline to below 6 per cent during the current phase of falling rates, writes James Blitz. The reaction to Mr Helmut Schlesinger's comments in a newspaper interview was far more muted in the sterling market, because of the pound's disconnection from the European exchange rate mechanism. However, at least one commercial bank dealer said the French and German markets' reaction to Mr Schlesinger's comments yesterday was significant, and that there were growing hopes of a reduction in official German rates at the first Bundesbank council meeting of the new year. 'It is the first time anyone can remember Mr Schlesinger saying something bullish about interest rate cuts,' he added. In an interview with the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung yesterday, the Bundesbank president said he was confident that Germany's inflation rate could near 3 per cent in 1993 from an average of around 4 per cent in 1992. But it was unclear from the interview which long-term interest rates Mr Schlesinger felt could be reduced. However, the comments triggered 'a rash of bullish feeling' in French and German markets, according to one dealer. Euromark futures rallied sharply, with the March contract rising 12 basis points to a close at 92.19. German cash rates were generally easier, with three-month money in the Euromark trading at around 8.87 per cent offered, down from around 9.25 per cent as recently as last Thursday. French futures rose sharply on Germany's coat-tails, with the March contract gaining 15 basis points to close at 90.64 and the June contract adding 9 basis points to end at 91.77. The cash market, centre-stage in the battle of the French franc, was more resistant to change: three-month money was as high as 12 1/4 per cent yesterday. The sterling markets were quieter. The Bank of England forecast a large shortage of Pounds 1.95bn at the start of the day, but trading was difficult and there was late assistance of Pounds 475m. Cash rates were generally unchanged, with three-month money closing again at 7 3/16 per cent.</p>

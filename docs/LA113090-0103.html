			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Wells Fargo Acquisition Approved: Wells Fargo &amp; Co. received Office of  Thrift Supervision approval to buy Great American Bank's 130 California  branches for $491 million.  </P> <P> The regulators' approval was the last obstacle facing the deal first announced  last July. The first phase of the sale, including branches in San Diego, Orange  and Riverside counties, will close today, Wells Fargo said. Wells Fargo said it  plans no layoffs among the 1,900 Great American employees it is absorbing, even  though the San Francisco-based bank plans to close seven of the 64 Great  American branches it is acquiring in San Diego County. The OTS also approved  Great American's capital plan, giving it until 1994 to raise its capital levels  to minimum regulatory requirements.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Ontario Hydro to cut 4,500 jobs ONTARIO HYDRO, one of North America's biggest utilities, is cutting staff by a further 4,500, bringing planned reductions since late last year to 6,000. This is part of the utility's restructuring to deal with a debt crisis and a 30 per cent increase in power rates over the past three years. Total payroll will decline to 23,000 mainly through attrition and early retirement, said Mr Maurice Strong, the chairman. Negotiations will begin soon with the unions. A programme to re-tube the Bruce A nuclear reactors, at a cost of nearly CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) is being deferred indefinitely. A Bruce heavy water plant will close in 1994. Ontario Hydro expects surplus generating capacity of 3,500MW once its Darlington nuclear plant is on full stream this summer. Demand for electricity has declined over the past three years. Mr Strong said about CDollars 10bn will be cut out of the utility's CDollars 30bn 10-year capital spending programme.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Management: A pension headache for the headhunted - There is no easy answer when making provision for 'capped' executives White's club in London. Sir Roly Split, chairman of Down-in-the-Dumps Dredging, is poised to agree terms with Alec Smart, freshly headhunted chief executive, when the latter suddenly insists: 'You will make sure that my Down-in-the-Dumps pension arrangements are as good as they were at Wizard, won't you?'. Sir Roly is nonplussed. However, in common with other chairmen desperate for talented managers at this stage in the cycle, he has no option but to agree. He settles down to coffee and cigars, uncomfortably aware that he will have to ask finance director Fred Fore how best to deliver. Until four years ago there was no great problem; high-flying managers simply joined an approved pension scheme (with all the tax breaks). The 1989 Finance Act, however, imposed an earnings 'cap' on the benefits from such schemes, with the result that other ways are needed to top up the pension of executives such as Smart. This year's decision by the UK Chancellor to leave the 'cap' at Pounds 75,000 exacerbates the problem. Some companies are simply paying higher salaries to 'capped' executives (those who have joined their companies since 1989). This is potentially divisive in the boardroom and almost certainly the expensive option for employers. It may also be tempting fate in the current climate of executive pay. Company law requires pension costs to be included in a company's aggregate remuneration for directors, whereas they are normally excluded from the individual 'headline' figure on which media criticism is based. The alternative to higher pay is to establish some sort of unapproved pension scheme, ideally combining the executive's desire for security with the company's need to restrict costs. One solution is for the employer to finance the benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. There is no pre-funding, merely a balance sheet reserve built up each year out of profits. That approach has the advantage of simplicity, but a drawback is the uncertainty for an employee. If Down-in-the-Dumps slides into receivership or liquidation - or is the object of a hostile takeover - Smart joins the list of unsecured creditors. Unfunded arrangements, moreover, create difficulties for early leavers. None of these complications - lack of security, penalties for early leavers  -arise with a funded scheme, whereby an employer sets aside contributions in a trust fund for the executive concerned. The up-front tax liability on contributions is off-putting. However, according to New Bridge Street Consultants, affiliated to solicitors Clifford Chance, it would make no difference mathematically were tax to be paid on the emerging benefit - on the accumulated pension assets - rather than on the up-front costs of funding them. Assume that Pounds 100,000 could be paid into a trust fund tax free, that it doubled in value during the life of the fund, and attracted tax at the current top rate of 40 per cent when the employee cashed in his benefit. The gross cost to the company (Pounds 100,000) and the net result for the employee (Pounds 120,000) is exactly the same if tax is settled at the outset. In this case the company pays Pounds 60,000 into the fund and a Pounds 40,000 bonus direct to the executive to settle his tax liabilities (Pounds 16,000 tax on the bonus itself, Pounds 24,000 tax on the pension contribution). For the employee, the choice between funded and unfunded schemes may be influenced by the expected rate of income tax prevailing at retirement. Paying 40 per cent on the contributions now is a more attractive option if it is believed the top rate will be higher when ultimately applied to unfunded benefits. More important is the rate at which the underlying assets providing the pension accumulate. It can be argued that the internal rate of return generated on an employer's capital is the appropriate one for unfunded investments, and that in a successful company this is bound to be greater than the return on external assets (in a trust fund). But David Reed, of Clifford Chance, says it is the marginal return on a company's assets that counts: 'In any reasonably large company, contributions to a funded scheme will merely deplete the cash balances or add to borrowings.' Besides beating bank interest in the longer term, the funded route is more tax efficient. Income and capital gains incur corporation tax at the current 33 per cent rate inside a business, compared with the 20 or 25 per cent suffered by a UK-based trust fund. Better still is an offshore scheme, which suffers no immediate tax on income or capital gains. But potential liability to tax on accumulated investment income can be a problem and smaller companies may want to avoid the extra costs of finding an offshore independent trustee. New Bridge Street Consultants calculated the contribution rate for a 40-year-old man required to secure a pension of two-thirds final salary, with a two-thirds widow's pension, assuming a gross investment return of 9 per cent (8.5 per cent for the offshore fund), salary increases of 7 per cent and pension increases of 5 per cent. Each year the unfunded option costs the company 78 per cent of the executive's base salary, whereas UK and offshore funded plans cost 68 per cent and 63 per cent respectively. If there were no 'earnings cap' on approved schemes annual cost would be only 41 per cent.</p>

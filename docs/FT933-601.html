			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: German engineer to raise DM202m MANNESMANN, the diversified German engineering group, announced a rights issue yesterday which it said would help it fight recession and continue diversification, Reuter reports from Bonn. The group said it would raise its capital by DM201.9m (Dollars 122.5m) to DM1.8bn through a one-for-eight rights issue in mid-October. The new shares, the price of which will be set near the issue date, will be entitled to half a dividend on results from the current business year, to September 30. 'The capital increase will serve to ensure growth and structural change,' Mannesmann said. 'Restructuring measures to improve profitability introduced in all areas of the company will still burden earnings in 1993 but will considerably lower the break-even threshold and show a clear improvement of profits in 1994,' it added. The company posted a net loss of DM467m in the first six months of the current year. Mannesmann also sought to allay fears that it would not pay a dividend on results from its current business year. 'The capital increase also underlines the intention of the management board to do justice to the interests of shareholders with an adequate rate of return on their invested capital,' it said. The group paid a dividend of DM6 a share in 1992. While giving no indication that its core businesses were close to returning to profit, Mannesmann said its mobile telephone division, Mannesmann Mobilfunk, would make a profit sooner than expected. Earlier forecasts were that it would not make a profit until 1995 after breaking even in the second half of 1994. Mannesmann earlier denied a report in Der Spiegel magazine that Mr Werner Dieter, its chairman, had come under pressure to resign because of big losses. A spokesman called the allegations 'pure speculation' and said Mr Dieter's resignation had not been discussed by the supervisory board.</p>

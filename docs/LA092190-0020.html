			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON RALLIES TO WIN, BUT COACH IS UNIMPRESSED  </P> <P> Even big plays can't draw big smiles from Pat Ward, Fullerton High School  football coach.  </P> <P> Fullerton improved to 3-0 after scoring 21 points in the fourth quarter  Thursday night to defeat Alta Loma, 36-18, at Chaffey College.  </P> <P> But the Indians' coach wasn't impressed.  </P> <P> "We are not a good football team at all," said Ward, in his first year at the  school. "This was the worst football game we've played all year." A tricky  lateral-and-pass play gave Alta Loma (1-2) an 18-15 lead at the end of the  third quarter. Alta Loma quarterback Robert Church hit Alfie Gallegos with a  long lateral, and then Gallegos heaved a 39-yard scoring pass to Rob Barry.  </P> <P> Even David Chacon, who almost single-handedly brought Fullerton back from the  brink, didn't escape criticism. Ward saw Chacon speaking to reporters after the  game and told him: "Give them a few words, then get your butt off the field.  You're not an NFL player."  </P> <P> Chacon, a 5-foot-9 cornerback and running back, erased the 18-15 deficit when  he scooped up a punt blocked by teammate D.C. Olsen and scrambled 55 yards down  the sideline for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Chacon also picked off two passes, returning the second interception 54 yards  for Fullerton's final score of the game.  </P> <P> Olsen blocked two punts, with the first setting up his own five-yard touchdown  run in the third quarter. He also scored on a two-yard dive in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> Olsen carried 11 times for 59 yards. Reserve halfback James Peterson added a  33-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

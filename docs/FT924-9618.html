			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Government will proceed with bill to curb unions THE GOVERNMENT, in an unexpected move, will today publish and give first reading to a bill imposing further curbs on trade unions. It will include the right of citizens to take out injunctions against unlawful strikes. The bill is also expected to pave the way for the abolition of wages councils, the statutory bodies that set pay rates for more than 2.5m workers in low-paid jobs. Mr Michael Forsythe, the employment minister, said in the Commons this week that the government saw no permanent place for wages councils. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said last week that the bill, expected to be brought forward this autumn, was being postponed on technical grounds until later in the year. The bill lost its parliamentary slot but Conservative party business managers have now squeezed it into the timetable. The legislation, on which Tory MPs are united, could be a morale booster to a party divided on other issues. In addition, the government may feel it wants to be sure of the new powers relating to strikes and public services before the full impact is felt of any pay squeeze in the public sector. The bill, whose architect was Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary and former employment secretary, is expected to conform broadly to its original form. It will include the right of employers to regularly seek employees' consent for union dues to be deducted from pay on automatic 'check-off'. That is expected to adversely affect union funds, which are already under pressure. Unions will also have to give seven days' notice of strikes and individuals will have the right to join the trade union of their choice regardless of the Trades Union Congress arrangement for regulating inter-union disputes. The green paper received a lukewarm reception from employers' organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [SEMANA Interview with Conservative Party presidential </F> hopeful Andres Pastrana Arango; place and date not given:  "Pastrana Speaks Out"]    [Text] Only hours before formally announcing his  presidential candidacy and following months of silence, Andres  Pastrana agreed to an interview with SEMANA in which he spoke  about Gaviria, the new right, the economic liberalization  [apertura], the Cali Cartel, kidnappings, relations with  Venezuela, and his father, former President Misael Pastrana.    [SEMANA] It has been said that your campaign will target a  small number of basic issues. Which ones?    [Pastrana] When I launch my campaign, I will tell the  country  what the main issues of my government program are. They are  seven in number and special emphasis will be placed on social  issues. On 10 February, Colombia will realize that it is a  serious, solid program that will propel the country into the  21st century. My platform will seal my ineludible commitment to  Colombia.    [SEMANA] Why did you wait so long before launching your  campaign? What benefits do you think can be derived from making  it a lightning campaign, as many call it?    [Pastrana] It is not a lightning campaign. Every political  campaign has its time. In Europe, campaigns last 30 days. Please  remember that I do not aspire to any candidacy in the  preliminary campaign. I am a candidate for the May elections,  not the March or October elections, as others claim. I am not a  person who improvises, much less makes casual promises. I am a  man of my word, a man who keeps his commitments. That is why I  took several months to draft the government program that I shall  submit to the Colombian people for their judicious examination,  months that I spent listening to and learning from others. I  toured the country and concluded that I share a common vision  with the people concerning our country's most urgent problems  and the course it must take.    [SEMANA] Why do you think the Colombian people should back  you in the presidential elections?    [Pastrana] Because I am familiar with and know in what  direction the country should be headed. I have experience and  keep my commitments, as I have demonstrated in my public and  private life, in the practice of journalism, and in my terms as  mayor and in the nation's Senate. They should back me because I  will seek to surround myself with the best people without  distinction as to party, race, creed, or social status. Finally,  I believe firmly in Colombia and will not fail Colombians in my  pledge to implement my government platform.    [SEMANA] Your adversaries criticize the great influence  which  they believe your father, former President Misael Pastrana, has  on you. How are your relations with him and how dependent on him  are you? Do you think you would be a candidate if you were not  the son of a former president?    [Pastrana] My relations with my father are excellent. I have  said so before and I repeat it now. What is more, I admire,  respect, and love him, as do the rest of my brothers and  sisters. Nevertheless, we are different persons living in  different times. We have disagreed on many occasions in public  and in private. He has been a harsh critic of some acts of  government that I have backed. He condemned the president's  candidacy for the Office of Secretary General of the OAS. In  contrast, I supported it, deeming it a positive thing for  Colombia. He is very respectful of my opinions and my way of  looking at politics, and I respect his equally.    As for the second question, I am not one for responding to  mere conjectures. Nevertheless, you can be sure that I  definitely would have been a candidate. My responsibilities in  the public sector have always been backed by the people's votes.    [SEMANA] There are those in this country who think that  Cesar  Gaviria has already carried out enough reforms in the legal,  political, and economic areas, and that it is up to his  successor to administer those changes and stabilize the rules of  play. Do you share that vision?    [Pastrana] I share the vision which President Cesar Gaviria  has of the country. The reforms initiated by his administration  are a starting point. While Colombia has made a major shift, it  will be up to the next president to consolidate processes,  introduce adjustments, and carry them out in the face of many  problems with innovative, realistic ideas.    [SEMANA] The issue of the guerrillas remains on the agenda.  Do you think that after an attack such as the one on the  minister of finance and a slaughter of poor people like that  carried out by the guerrillas in Uraba, it is possible to reopen  the doors to dialogue and a negotiated settlement?    [Pastrana] Colombia has had important lessons in how to  handle the guerrilla problem. By my very nature, I support  reconciliation. I am not one of those who close a door and throw  away the key. And yet, I shall not allow peace to become a "leg  up" for continuing the war. We have become accustomed to  governments that swing back and forth between war and peace. If  there is any one thing that we Colombians must bear in mind, it  is that it is not the government that is waging the war. The  National Government has an obligation to defend the life, honor,  and property of all Colombians, independently of what friendly  or barbarous acts the guerrillas and criminals commit. It has no  choice. That is why there can be no argument about strengthening  the military forces and intelligence units.    [SEMANA] Do you think that the solution to the stalemate in  these negotiations could be the beginning of regional dialogues,  as the guerrillas are asking?    [Pastrana] The president is the one responsible for  maintaining law and order. He has a constitutional mandate that  he must heed, enforce, and not delegate. Otherwise, we would end  up dividing the country unnecessarily. I do not even want to  imagine that one of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia] fronts could be slaughtering children in Cauca while  another is attending a political cocktail party in the capital  and all under the same central command! And yet, regional and  local authorities do play a key role in ensuring the  pacification of the country. They know the factors of violence  in their region better than anyone else. It is therefore their  duty to support the government in enforcing law and order, to  advise and heed it, without this turning into a license for  entering into a dialogue with the guerrillas behind the  president's back.    [SEMANA] Will you keep the office of minister of defense in  the hands of a civilian or, on the contrary, do you intend to  name one of the highest-ranking officials of the Armed Forces,  as has been done in the past?    [Pastrana] I like the institution of the civilian minister  of  defense very much and it has functioned well, even better in the  hands of persons like the husband of the manager of my campaign.    [SEMANA] What do you think of the contacts which the Office  of Prosecutor General has maintained with the attorneys of the  Cali Cartel? Do you think it would be meaningful, as has been  proposed during those contacts, to reach an agreement with that  group implying that their leaders could serve their prison  sentences in their own homes?    [Pastrana] I do not favor allowing prison sentences to be  served at home. That is an absurd idea that would never have  entered my head. The policy of bringing criminals to justice  cannot become a policy of bringing justice to the criminals. The  government's efforts to reduce violence cannot lend themselves  to improvisations or an under-the-table manipulation of our  system of justice.    [SEMANA] What is your opinion of the antikidnapping norms,  particularly the debate generated by a decision of the  Constitutional Court and by Dr. Carlos Upegui to the effect that  relatives of kidnap victims should not be prevented from  bargaining over their ransom?    [Pastrana] I am convinced that there is no argument, not  even  one that could grow out of possible political agreements with  guerrilla groups, that would justify granting pardons or amnesty  for that atrocious crime. There is no justification for  kidnapping and those who engage in it must know this  unequivocally. We cannot make progress toward eliminating it if  we do not establish certain concrete guidelines once and for  all. We cannot yield to blackmail.    I was a sponsor of the antikidnapping law in the Senate and  unreservedly backed the measure of the Free Country Foundation.  Now that we know the Court's ruling, which substantially limited  the range of the law, we must think of effective alternatives in  order to fight the kidnapping industry without wavering. I am  happy that Carlos Upegui is free and I am sure that he  repudiates this crime of lese humanite as I do.    [SEMANA] You are considered a leader of the new right. Along  that line of ideas, what do you think should be the future of  the policy of economic liberalization [apertura] and  privatizations?    [Pastrana] That is an outdated label in a world where action  speaks louder than words. Rhetoric has to take a back seat. We  live in new times and accomplishments take priority. I am not of  the new right, nor am I a neoliberal, as some insist on calling  me. I believe in sustained economic growth capable of  guaranteeing a better distribution of income and a substantial  improvement in the standard of living of the Colombian people.    Along that line of ideas, the future of the policy of  economic liberalization will depend upon providing our  productive sector with better tools so that it may be more  efficient and competitive and thus generate productive jobs. A  joint effort is required in which both the government and the  private sector assume their responsibilities. The latter cannot  do it alone. It has already done a great deal and now it is up  to the government to do likewise.    Privatizations are not a panacea. They are not inherently  good or bad. I think they are a good idea if they guarantee  efficiency in the case of public services and an interesting  alternative for generating resources that will enable the  government to properly meet its social obligations, obligations  that it can neither postpone nor delegate, such as education,  security, and justice.    [SEMANA] Speaking of privatizations, do you think they  should  continue to be carried out by auctions?    [Pastrana] Whatever procedure is followed must be  transparent. However, I do not agree that the most important  thing is to obtain the highest price. In some cases, it may be  important for the enterprise being privatized to have a leader  who can impose efficiency. In other cases, there may be a  greater possibility for many Colombians to participate and thus  democratize property. That is a debate which has not yet taken  place in Colombia and which the recent Court ruling puts on the  carpet.    [SEMANA] Another latent proposal is the possibility that  Colombia may join the ranks of the Free Trade Agreement that now  involves Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Will you back  that initiative?    [Pastrana] Yes, I would. The Free Trade Agreement offers us  great possibilities and opportunities and it would therefore be  desirable to be part of it at the earliest possible date.  Nevertheless, I do not think we are at the top of the list of  candidates, which means that what is most important is to make  the most of the time available and adequately prepare to enter  that market with a solid, competitive industry.    [SEMANA] One of the most important decisions that you will  have to make in the weeks ahead is the name of your running  mate: the vice presidential candidate. What qualifications will  he have? Will he be a liberal or a conservative? Will he be  young like you or an older person?    [Pastrana] It changes daily. I will make that decision later  on.    [SEMANA] If you win the elections, you will certainly govern  with a Congress having a Liberal majority. How do you expect to  handle that situation, based on your conservative background?    [Pastrana] I shall try to form a consensus on the major  national issues. We shall first determine which are the priority  issues in my government program that require the approval of  Congress. They will be solid projects that I am sure will enjoy  legislative support. While partisan forces play a preponderant  role in Congress, I am confident that there will be more  congressmen who prefer the country's welfare over their efforts  to obstruct the work of the government.    [SEMANA] You recently had a number of contacts with  Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera. Do you think your good  relations with that leader, whom many identify as  anti-Colombian, can help resolve the dispute over the Gulf?    [Pastrana] Without question, the fact of having good  personal  relations with President Caldera can help improve the climate of  understanding between our countries and even smooth the way to a  resolution of the problem of the dispute, which does not mean  that our friendship is the decisive factor.    [SEMANA] Colombia has never had a president who has not  served as minister. Do you not agree that missing that step  hurts you?    [Pastrana] It is generally agreed that the Office of Mayor  of  Bogota is the second most important post in the country. In  addition to administrative management, the experience I gained  in handling times of crisis brought on by the onslaught of the  drug terrorists taught me important lessons. Having served as  mayor of Bogota, with the commitment implied by election by the  people, far exceeds the responsibility of any ministry.  <H5>  [Box, p 31] </H5> <H5>  Andres' "Staff" </H5>   1--Luis Alberto Moreno: General campaign coordinator. With a  degree in Business Administration from Atlantic University [as  published] (United States), this former minister of development  is a talented, discreet man and the "guru" of the Pastrana camp  ever since serving as manager of "TV-Today News." Some view him  as the political genius who "thought up" Andres.    2--Francisco Lloreda: Pastrana's private secretary when the  latter was mayor of Bogota. In charge of coordinating  operations. A graduate of the Javerian School of Law who  specialized in Public Administration at the University of  Colombia and who has a background in journalism at Cali's EL  PAIS, the daily newspaper published by his father, Rodrigo  Lloreda. Simple, serious, and circumspect, if Pastrana should  become president, "Kiko," as he is called, would be the  government's "Miguel Silva."    3--Claudia de Francisco: She has been and remains a  "workaholic." Her resume contains such posts as vice president  for marketing of the Bank of Colombia, the Office of Secretary  of Finance of the District, and the post of manager of the  Bogota Telephone Enterprise. Now, as administrative coordinator  of the campaign and wife of Minister of Defense Rafael Pardo,  she has become a bridge between "Pastranism" and "Gavirianism."  Or the reverse....    4--Maristella Sanin: Close to Pastrana on the Senate bench  of  the New Democratic Force. In this campaign, she focuses her  efforts on political support. A graduate of the Javerian School  of Law, she is backed by her experience, not only in Congress,  but also at the head of the Labor Ministry.    5--Diego Pardo: Although no longer the young blade that he  was while serving as mayor of Bogota, this cachaco  retains his fire, coordinating the Youth movement with Andres.  In addition to serving as burgomaster of the country's  capital--briefly--this graduate of the Javerian School of Law  with a Master's from SMU in Dallas (Texas) served as director of  CAR [Bogota Plain and Ubate and Chiquinquira Valleys Autonomous  Regional Corporation] and superintendent of Exchange Control.    6--Carlos Duque: Adviser for communications, image, and  publicity, he is also the man who practically revolutionized the  image of political publicity in Colombia. The author of the  first--and famous--poster for Luis Carlos Galan.    7--Juan Hernandez: Has been with Pastrana since the  University of the Rosary, where they were classmates at the  College of Jurisprudence. Served as councilman of Bogota,  secretary of government during the Pastrana mayoralty, and  consul in Houston (Texas). Heads the Multipliers Program.    8--Efrain Marin: Press director. Was on the staff of newsmen  at "TV-Today News."    9--Gloria Isabel Ramirez: Publicity coordinator.    10--Marta de Arevalo: Volunteer coordinator.    11--Gustavo Pombo: Appointed to coordinate the campaign  launching ceremony and the accompanying falderal.    12--Hernan Beltz: Financial coordinator. Civil engineer, but  with an important career in the public sector (served as  director of the National Planning Department and minister of  public works), he was a member of the conservative board of  directors of the Tequendama line. A personal friend of Alvaro  Gomez.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, said in his letter to UNSC [UN Security  Council] Chairman Karel Kovanda that the joint declaration,  signed by Croatia and the FRY in Geneva, was the first step  forward in the process of the normalization of mutual relations.  Granic also said that the government of the Republic of Croatia  was deeply convinced that both sides will from now on act  strictly in accordance with the provisions laid down by the  Helsinki Final Document of 1975, and especially in line with the  principle whereby international borders cannot and must not be  changed by force. Granic stressed that the joint declaration  was on no account directed against the third side [Muslims] and  that it should ensure a modus vivendi for Croatian territories  under UN protection, in keeping with the European Union plan and  UNSC Resolution 871.</p>

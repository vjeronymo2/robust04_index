			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / GEC offers Pounds 532m for VSE: BAe attacks rival higher bid for submarine-maker as its own shares fall GEC, the UK defence and electronics company, yesterday stepped into the bid battle for nuclear submarine-maker VSEL with a Pounds 14-a-share cash offer which values the Barrow-based company at Pounds 532m. This tops the all-share offer launched by British Aerospace for VSEL two weeks ago, which valued VSEL at exactly Pounds 13 a share on Thursday night. VSEL's board, which had backed BAe's bid, refused to endorse either offer until clearance for the bids had been given by the Office of Fair Trading. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said yesterday that he would not use the government's special national security powers over VSEL to block either bid. VSEL's shares rose 72p to Pounds 13.95, while GEC gained 8p to 278p. British Aerospace's shares fell 16p to 459p, reducing the value of its offer to Pounds 12.60 per VSEL share. GEC said its offer would allow the two remaining warship building yards to be brought together, pooling their design and engineering skills, and that the integration of the two yards would allow their long-term future to be guaranteed. The company said its marketing arm would be able to help VSEL win overseas orders. GEC also said it did not think its ownership of the two large warship yards presented competition problems. Due to the low level of orders, there would in practice be little overlap between the work of Barrow and Yarrow. The ministry of defence, which had previously been indicating privately that it would oppose a GEC takeover of the Barrow yard, refused to comment. At the heart of the battle is the future of the British defence industry. As well as competing for the Pounds 2.5bn order for nuclear submarines due to be placed in 1996, the two companies are trying to strengthen their positions for the final stage of rationalisation of the defence industry. At its most extreme, this could involve the merger of BAe's and GEC's defence interests. BAe strongly attacked the GEC bid, saying that it was 'wholly inconsistent with the Ministry of Defence's declared policy in relation to defence procurement'. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said: 'GEC's bid raises profound competition issues and I would expect it to be blocked.' City observers expect BAe to raise its offer, but they also think that GEC's greater financial resources would allow it to win a bidding war. BAe's defence would then rest on persuading the government to block GEC's bid on competition grounds. GEC is expected to have to give assurances about the future of the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde if its bid is to be cleared. However, one City observer said: 'These assurances can be flexible. Barrow can build small frigates and large warships, but Yarrow can only build small frigates. If I were at Yarrow, I would be worried.' GEC dismissed such concerns and said: 'It is our intention to secure enough work to fill both yards'. Battle of the giants, Page 6 Lex, Page 24</p>

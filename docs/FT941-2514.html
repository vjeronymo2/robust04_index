			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / US to seek UN backing over North Korea inspections The US is to seek United Nations support in an attempt to force North Korea to allow international inspectors full access to its nuclear facilities, it said yesterday. Washington said it was also ready to act bilaterally, increasing its military activities in the region. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US was preparing to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea and to reinstate joint military exercises with South Korea 'in the very near future'. 'We're not seeking a confrontation with North Korea, but if they insist on it, I'm sure we'll prevail,' Mr Christopher said on US television. Mr Christopher said the US would be seeking a resolution at the UN Security Council. 'I think we'll be preparing for trade sanctions,' Mr Christopher added, but this depended on North Korea's actions. Congressional leaders put their weight behind the administration's increased pressure. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, said US aircraft carriers would be despatched to the region unless Pyongyang complied with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The US may also increase its troop strength there, he added. Currently 37,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea. The board of governors for the IAEA is expected to decide today to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the Security Council. In Beijing yesterday, Chinese leaders told Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the visiting Japanese prime minister, they would try to persuade North Korea to open its nuclear sites to avoid an international crisis, but Beijing counselled patience. China is key to any international approach. If China blocks sanctions in the UN Security Council, the US and South Korea will have few options left, short of military actions, to force the north to accept nuclear inspections. Mr Christopher said China would support the US plan because it was in its own interest to do so. 'They are much closer at hand than we are.' However, China's ambassador to South Korea warned at the weekend that his country would not support sanctions against the north. 'Such measures are not only ineffective, but would also complicate matters and aggravate the situation,' Mr Zhang Tingyan, the Chinese ambassador, told the South Korean news agency Yonhap. Any military response, such as an air strike on the North's nuclear facilities, is considered unlikely, however, since it would almost certainly provoke a North Korean attack on the South and destabilise the north-east Asian region.

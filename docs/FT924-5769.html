			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: The spirit of Windsor is lost - William Packer puts forward a personal view of the damage wreaked by the fire at the castle The loss from the fire at Windsor castle has nothing to do with Heritage, that now hateful, vulgar, sentimental word. Nor is it about the cost of repairs, nor the loss of objects and artefacts, however wonderful. The loss I feel as one who spent his boyhood in the shadow of that great tower is harder to explain: an enormous, possibly irreparable, damage to the spirit of the place and what it represents to Englishmen. Samuel Pepys called Windsor: 'The most romantic castle that is in the world'. It is also the largest inhabited castle in the world, and has been in continuous habitation, since the time of the William the Conqueror. It is, by any measure, extraordinary and wonderful. Even as the flames swept through the great hall on Friday night, television announcers were meanly asking how much it would all cost; and the row about who will pay continues in Parliament and elsewhere. Good God: could they not see that some 900 years of our common history has gone up in smoke. Yes, I admit, I take the disaster personally. For those of us who lived in the town, that familiar towering silhouette was always present, as constant as Fuji-san is to a Japanese or the Eiffel Tower to a Parisian. I saw it from my bedroom window, on my way to school, from the Great Park, from the forest at Dedworth, or away across the Brocas and along the river from Boveney Lock. There it would be, through the trees, around every corner. But it would change, too, with every shift of the clouds and mood of the weather. I remember it in the long damp week between the death of the King and his funeral, so quiet and still, shrouded in the mists of early February. Most of all I remember the funeral itself, we children standing at the top of the Long Walk inside the Park gates, the crunch of wheels and feet on the gravel, the shadowy, veiled figures in the closed coach, the bands, the shouted orders coming towards us through the mist, past us and away, the minute guns, boom, boom, in the Park: and all the while the white looming walls of the Castle just barely visible through the fog. I would often go into the Castle, a marvellously safe place for a schoolboy to be when he shouldn't be, with nothing better to do than slope off for a smoke and to admire the view. I would go up the Round Tower, or pay my sixpence to go into the Curfew Tower with its clock and dungeons, or perhaps, late in the afternoon, slip into St George's to hear sung Evensong. One special game, at the height of the tourist season, was to go out along the North Terrace, just where the fire has destroyed St George's Hall, to where one long queue was waiting to go into the State Apartments, and another, even longer, was waiting to see The Queen's Dolls' House. I would walk alone between the two lines and up to the barrier, which, after a low, brief exchange, would be unhooked to let me pass. 'Yes sir? You wish to see the drawings, sir? Of course. This way, sir.' Insufferable. I felt, as many others did, intensely proprietorial about the place. I too had - still have - a Windsor Castle of my very own - ancient, familiar, comfortable, romantic, fixing the present so very firmly in the continuous historic past. And it is a feeling about the place itself, and the town which grew up around it, and the countryside of river and park beyond, and the people who made it what it is.</p>

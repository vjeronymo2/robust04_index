			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economic Recovery Continues"] </F>   [Text] The economic recovery is gaining dynamism. The  orders received in industry, the expectations of the  entrepreneurs, and gradually also the production activity have  improved.    In the first quarter, building trade developed clearly more  positively than expected, above all because of high growth rates  in housing construction.    These were the results of the latest economic inquiry by the  Economic Research Institute (WIFO). However, the economic  development, which has been good, as compared with Austria's  most important trade partners, resulted in major increases in  imports.    As compared with European countries, particularly the most  important trading partners, the economic development was  relatively favorable in the first quarter of 1994, the WIFO  report says. Industrial production picked up and increased by  2.9 percent, as compared with the same quarter last year.    In the first quarter, all exports increased by 5.4 percent  in  nominal terms, as compared with last year, while imports  increased by a total of 9.5 percent. The interviews of  entrepreneurs as part of the economic inquiry provided an  optimistic picture. The assessment of the orders on hand has  clearly improved.    The number of enterprises with free capacities is  continuously decreasing. An increasing number of enterprises  expects a further stimulation in the second quarter.    According to WIFO, the trend of a slow decrease in the  inflation rate is continuing. The consumer price index in April  increased by 3 percent. The cost of housing and the services  sector continue to force an increase in prices.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Hochtief/Holzmann Hochtief's proposed acquisition of an additional 10 per cent stake in Philip Holzmann signals the beginning of antagonistic relations between Germany's two biggest construction companies. The move will take Hochtief's holding in the larger Holzmann to 30 per cent, a platform from which Hochtief, itself a subsidiary of the RWE energy conglomerate, is likely to agitate for management control. Despite Holzmann's desire to remain independent, the case for merger is strong. The companies operate in compatible areas, with an especially good fit outside Germany where Holzmann's DM4bn of turnover makes it twice as big as its rival. The smaller Hochtief is the more profitable with a return of nearly 5 per cent on turnover at the last earnings peak, five times as high as at Holzmann. Hochtief could extract operational efficiencies at Holzmann, whose shares have underperformed the market by 50 per cent over the past five years. However compelling the argument for fusion, changes of corporate control in Germany - especially those promoted against the will of incumbent management  -are long-drawn out affairs in which the interests of the big shareholding banks invariably take precedence over those of minority shareholders. The traditional, back-door way for Hochtief to win control would be to acquire Deutsche Bank's 30 per cent stake in Holzmann (though at present the bank says it is not selling). Better, for the evolution of Germany's financial markets, would be for Hochtief to make a full-scale takeover offer.</p>

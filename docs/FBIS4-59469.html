			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has called on Yemeni leaders to  comply with Arab efforts to end the war and to return to the  negotiating table.    Speaking at a press conference today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said  that every Arab wants to see the fighting stopped as soon as  possible. He described the situation in Yemen as "painful and  serious." He said he spoke via telephone today with Muhmammad  Sa'id Bayraqdar, member of the Arab League team currently in  Sanaa, to discuss the team's efforts to end the deteriorating  situation in Yemen. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid noted that the team will  meet later today with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to  pass on a message from the Arab League secretary general. The  message, he added, is part of the efforts to implement the  recent Arab League decision to end the fighting in Yemen, to  contain the deteriorating situation, and to start a dialogue  among the warring parties. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that it is  unlikely that an Arab summit will be held at the present time to  discuss the situation in Yemen.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid noted that the Arab League welcomes any  Yemeni proposals to end the fighting and bloodshed. He stressed  that finding a solution for the Yemeni problem rests with the  Yemenis themselves. He pointed out that Arab efforts are  seeking to contain the crisis, reach an immediate cease-fire to  halt the bloodshed, and bring the Yemeni parties back to the  negotiating table to find a peaceful solution for the crisis.  This, he added, is the task of the Arab League team now present  in Sanaa.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid noted the need to establish a mechanism  for  settling inter-Arab conflicts. He added: Serious attention  must now be given to establishing this mechanism, which the Arab  leaders included in the Arab League Charter in 1945, something  that shows their wisdom and farsightedness.</p>

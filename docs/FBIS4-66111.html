Answering journalists' questions, Christopher said that the  U.S. will follow with interest the democratic process in Italy.  He stressed Italy's "great role" in Europe, saying that he  would be talking with the new Italian foreign minister about  Bosnia, trade issues, and the Group of Seven summit in Naples in  July.    Asked what he was going to say to Christopher, Martino  replied: "The most important thing is reaffirming that the  general lines of our Atlantic policy will be marked by great  continuity with the past. We aspire to continue to be a  faithful and essential ally of American foreign policy." Asked  what he would like to hear in reply, he said: "The recognition  that this relationship will certainly continue in the way both  sides want."    Earlier, the G-7 summit was also a key talking-point at  Martino's meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen,  who said Italy now had the stability needed to continue on the  road to financial and economic recovery. U.S. sources said  Bentsen expressed appreciation, in particular, for last summer's  inflation-pegging cost-of-labour accord, and said there was  great U.S. investment interest in Italy, as shown by the recent  takeover of ENI's [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] Nuovo  Pignone.    Martino illustrated the government's tax-cutting and  job-creating plans, including the projected lowering of the top  rate to 33 percent. Bentsen noted that the U.S. top bracket is  39.6 percent, saying that "in the past it had gone a lot lower,  but that caused some public debt problems." One of Bentsen's  advisors pointed to the uniformity of wages between north and  south Italy, and Martino agreed that on this and other labour  market flexibilty issues, Europe had much to learn from the  United States.    (An earlier meeting with the American Jewish Conference was  described as "very positive" by its president, Lester Pollack,  who added that "we have opened a dialogue that will continue in  the U.S. and Italy." "This is the most pro-Israeli Italian  government in the last 20 years," he said.)    "The door is still open" for Italy's request to be included  in the contact group on Bosnia (U.S., Russia, France, Britain  and the EU [European Union] troika), Martino said after the  meeting -- although Christopher pointed to "coordination  difficulties" in enlarging the group.    As for Italy's other key request to get a greater say in  decisions that affect her, a place on the UN Security Council,  Martino said he had received a pledge that this would be  examined within the ambit of UN reform. He recognised that any  decision here "will not be quick in coming" given the timeframe  of the projected reform.    Martino said he had reiterated the "unacceptable" nature of  Italy being excluded from decisions directly affecting it:  especially its exclusion from the Bosnian contact group. To  Christopher's objection of "coordination difficulties," he  replied by stressing the importance of Italian air bases in  providing logistical support for missions. Martino stressed  that the talking on this issue had only just begun.    On UN reform, the two men examined an Italian proposal for  appointing rotating members alongside the five permanent members  of the Security Council, and a counter-proposal for 10 permanent  members, today's five plus Germany, Japan, and three other  members taken from Africa, Asia and Latin America. "A solution  of this kind, leaving Italy out, would be unacceptable for us,"  said Martino.    But the road to UN reform will be a long one, both men  recognise, leaving time to assign new roles for countries like  Italy which are among the major contributors to aid operations.    Bosnia and the UN -- two points on which Christopher was not  slow to praise Italy -- were not the only issues discussed in  the talks, which lasted about an hour.    Other points examined were U.S. President Bill Clinton's  coming visit to Italy, the G-7 in Naples in July, and Italy's  strategic role alongside the Balkans and at the crossroads of  the Arab-Western world.    Martino described his earlier meeting with the Conference of  America's 15 largest Jewish communities as "extraordinarily  important". He said he had reiterated Italy's traditional  friendship with Israel and its support for the Arab-Israeli  peace process. "There were no questions on the presence of  ministers from National Alliance in the government," he said in  reference to the rightist section of the Berlusconi government.    "No one during my stay here asked me any questions on the  so-  called Berlusconi issue, that is the possibility of conflicts of  interest between Berlusconi the premier and Berlusconi the  businessman," said Martino in reply to a later question. But he  added that the question had been raised "indirectly" by an  editorialist at THE WASHINGTON POST, where he had a foreign  policy interview this morning. On that occasion, he said, "I  replied that if an entrepreneur wanted to use politics for his  private business ends, he would not become the protagonist of  the political scene, since as premier he would draw the  attention of public opinion, the opposition, the press, the  magistrature, and the head of state".    Asked to comment on Left Democrat No.2 Massimo D'Alema's  image of him having to tour foreign capitals, cap in hand, to  reassure Italy's partners about an administration containing  ministers with a neo-fascist past, Martino replied: "Going  round with one's cap in one's hand means asking for money. That  is not the case, and I don't know how to do it. If D'Alema  means I was keen to get in touch with our international  interlocutors, that is true. But I believe it is the first duty  of a foreign minister".    Asked if Bentsen had shown any concern over Italy's ability  to put the economy and public accounts back on their feet,  Martino said that "I am more worried on that score, to be  frank... It's about time people were told that what has been  said about the last two governments undertaking vigorous  corrective measures is not true".    Before leaving for Rome in the early afternoon Washington  time, Martino also had talks with National Security Advisor  Antony Lake.</p>

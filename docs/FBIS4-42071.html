			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR  head of state, is dead. One of the most powerful men in the GDR  died of cancer today at age 81 in his Chilean exile, Santiago de  Chile.    The news of the death of the man who had been ill for a long  time has "come as no great surprise," government spokesman  Dieter Vogel said in an initial statement. Honecker failed in  his political objectives. His policy meant suffering for  innumerable people in Germany. However, respect for the dead  makes it appropriate "to say but little" at this particular  moment about his role in the German postwar period.</p>

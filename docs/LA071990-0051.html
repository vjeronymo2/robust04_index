			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA GIVES U.S. GYMNASTICS TEAM A 1-2 PUNCH  </P> <P> UCLA's Chris Waller and Yefim Furman believe that the Goodwill Games beginning  Friday will help revive American men's gymnastics, which has been in the  doldrums since the United States won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Waller, the NCAA high bar champion, is a member of the four-man U.S. team that  will compete at Seattle. Furman, an assistant to UCLA Coach Art Shurlock, will  be an assistant for the U.S. team.  </P> <P> Waller and Furman believe that the Soviet Union, the dominant gymnastics team  of the 1980s, will be difficult, if not impossible to beat. Both said the  United States has a good chance of finishing among the top three teams.  </P> <P> Waller, who qualified for the Goodwill team by finishing second in the  all-around at the U.S. Gymnastics Federation championships in Denver, said that  the U.S. victory in 1984 was not tarnished because the Soviets did not compete.  </P> <P> The U.S. team was led by Bart Conner, who finished first in the parallel bars,  and by former UCLA gymnasts Peter Vidmar, Tim Daggett and Mitch Gaylord. Vidmar  tied China's Li Ning for first on the pommel horse.  </P> <P> The 1984 U.S. team "was as good, if not better, than anyone around and U.S.  gymnastics was right in there with the rest of the world," Waller said.  </P> <P> Furman, who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1972 Olympics and coached in  his homeland, later immigrated to the United States. He said that the lag  resulted in an 11th-place finish for the United States in the 1988 Olympics and  seventh- and eighth-place finishes in the 1988 and 1989 world championships.  </P> <P> U.S. men gymnasts peaked in 1984, but members of the Olympic-championship team  gave up competition to capitalize on their success and there "was no  continuation," Furman said.  </P> <P> Waller said that U.S. gymnasts have worked hard since 1984, but he believes  that "grass-root programs for training athletes in that period of time" became  antiquated, but have since improved.  </P> <P> In Waller's opinion, there is nothing old-fashioned about the U.S. Goodwill  team. "We have a great team, we should be in the top three," he said.  </P> <P> Other team members are John Roethlisberger of the University of Minnesota,  Trent Dimas of the University of Nebraska and Lance Ringnald, a member of the  1988 Olympic team.  </P> <P> Roethlisberger, whose father, Fred, is the head coach at Minnesota, led the  Golden Gophers to the NCAA championship this year and finished first in the  all-around at the USGF championships. Waller said that he admires John  Roethlisberger because "his strength is consistency" and that Dimas and  Ringnald are also excellent performers.  </P> <P> Waller said that he, Dimas and Ringnald should make the United States "very  strong in the high bar." Waller, a native of Mount Prospect, Ill., won the 1990  NCAA high bar title, and Dimas was the runner-up. At the USGF meet, Dimas and  Ringnald tied for first in the high bar and Waller was third after his hand  grip (similar to a baseball batting glove) came loose midway through his  routine, forcing him to start over.  </P> <P> He said that the team's "routines are more difficult and our techniques are  better than U.S. gymnasts of the past. I'm encouraged. We have a good team, the  meet is in the United States, and I think we'll do great and win some medals."  </P> <P> As for his own prospects, Waller said that he feels confident going into the  games. "If you're not confident, you won't compete well. You'll be looking over  your shoulder, and you'll fall. I feel like I'm in great shape. I'm just a bit  fatigued from the long college season."  </P> <P> Furman said that the U.S. team should be "much better" than the one that failed  to win a medal in the 1986 Goodwill Games. He thinks that Waller, who has  completed his eligibility at UCLA, is capable of winning medals in the high bar  and on the pommel horse. Waller won an NCAA title on the pommel horse in 1989.  </P> <P> Furman said the Soviet Union has so much depth that it could "put two or three  teams on the floor, and all of them would be good."  </P> <P> Waller and Furman feel that the United States will benefit because the games  are in Seattle instead of Europe or Asia.  </P> <P> "The judging (at international meets) is very political, but a lot of Americans  will be judges (at Seattle)," Waller said. "So that is going to help our  gymnastics a lot."  </P> <P> Furman said that competing in Seattle "will be our plus. It's like having the  home-court advantage in a college basketball game."  </P> <P> Waller, 21, underwent heart surgery six years ago to repair a constricted  aorta, a condition that gave him high blood pressure and made his legs weak.  Surgeons opened up an artery and later closed it with a patch, he said.  </P> <P> His legs became much stronger after the operation. "Four months after surgery,  my vertical leap was four inches higher than before," he said. A year after the  operation, he became the youngest gymnast (at 16) to compete in the USGF  championships.  </P> <P> After the Goodwill Games, Waller and UCLA teammates Scott Keswick and Chainey  Umphrey will compete for the United States against the Soviets in a meet Aug.  3-5 in San Jose. Waller said he hopes to continue to compete with the national  team for two more years and in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.  </P> <P> Waller said he is grateful that he was able to compete in college gymnastics  because it "helped me tremendously. I got a lot stronger, physically and  mentally.  </P> <P> "But I finished (college competition) at a perfect time. I can focus on the big  (international) meets and be concerned more with doing the more difficult  routines. When you have a meet every weekend in college, you can't develop new  tricks."  </P></p>

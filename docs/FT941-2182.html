			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bavarian bank boosts pre-tax profits by 33% Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, one of Germany's two big Bavarian-based regional banks, yesterday initiated what promises to be a strong results season for Germans banks when it reported a 33 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to DM1.04bn (Dollars 580m). The bank released this figure, arrived at after providing for bad and doubtful debts, after a meeting of the supervisory board. Further details of Hypo-Bank's and other institutions' 1993 results will emerge in the coming weeks, with the banks expected to report record profits. There was no break-down of profits yesterday, but the figures reflect strong growth in German mortgage business, a Hypo-Bank speciality. For the German banking sector as a whole, 1993 is likely to prove a strong year, with robust mainstream commercial activity complemented by buoyant market conditions which benefited fee-income and own-account trading. Hypo-Bank is, as expected, paying a 1993 dividend of DM14.50 a share, up from DM13 in the previous year. It said yesterday that group assets rose by 20.4 per cent to DM266m last year. At the parent bank, pre-tax profits after provisions rose 25.2 per cent to DM860m and assets increased by 23.2 per cent to DM189m.</p>

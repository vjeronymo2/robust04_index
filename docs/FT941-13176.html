			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / German inflation fall renews rate cut calls The annual inflation rate in Germany fell to 3.4 per cent in the month to mid-January, in spite of new year increases in fuel and vehicle taxes, pensions and insurance contributions, according to provisional figures from the federal statistics office. The rate compares with 3.7 per cent in the previous month, and was lower than expected by most economists. While the latest figure was welcomed as 'good news' for the German Bundesbank, few analysts expect that it will be enough to justify a cut in short-term interest rates at next Thursday's central bank meeting. It does suggest, however, that Germany is in line for an average inflation rate of below 3 per cent for 1994 as a whole, as forecast by the government's annual economic report, published yesterday. Confirmation of the rest of the government's forecasts, including a growth rate for gross domestic product of between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent, brought a sceptical response from both German industry, and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). Only on its gloomy outlook for unemployment, suggesting an increase of up to 450,000 in the number of jobless, to around 3.9m, a national rate of around 10 per cent, is there general agreement. The government figures were presented by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, who insisted that they were sober and realistic. He said that although the latest increase in fuel prices and insurance payments might cause a temporary setback in the first quarter, the west German economy had clearly begun to recover from last year's sharp downturn. The German federation of industry said it would be 'delighted' if the government's forecast proved correct, but insisted that there was still no evidence to confirm it. The BDI said that with the exception of exports, all the main components in economic demand - private consumption, state consumption and private and public investments - were less favourable in its own calculations. Mr Uwe Jens, the economics spokesman for the SPD, called for rapid and clear moves by the Bundesbank to reduce its lead interest rates. However, recent speeches and statements by top bank officials have made it clear that further interest rate cuts depend mostly on further moderation in money supply. The bank sees the broad M3 measure of monetary growth, which expanded above target last year, as an early warning system for future inflation. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank vice-president, said on Tuesday: 'We will make further interest rate reductions when the data - especially money supply - develop according to our targets.' December M3 figures, due next week, are expected to be well above the 6.5 per cent upper target limit for 1993, due to 'distortions by special factors', according to Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the bank directorate. But in an interview with the Borsen-Zeitung newspaper, he held out the prospect of a marked improvement in the January figures.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN ECONOMIC FORECASTS (real %age change year-on-year)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1993*                      1994                      West  East     All       West    East       All  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP                  -1.9   6.3    -1.3    0.5 - 1   6 - 8   1 - 1.5 Private consumption  -0.2   1.2    -0.1     0 - -1   0 - 1  0 - -1.0 State consumption    -1.3   2.6    -0.7     0 - -1 -1 - -2  0 - -1.0 Capital investment   -6.8  15.0    -3.3      0 - 1 12 - 14     2 - 4 Exports              -7.3  -1.9   -11.1      3 - 4   6 - 8     3 - 4 Imports             -10.8   3.6   -11.3  1.5 - 2.5   2 - 4     1 - 2 Consumer prices       3.5   8.0     4.1    about 3   4 - 5   about 3 Unemployment (%)      7.4  15.1     8.9        8.5    16.0      10.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federal Economics Ministry *Provisional results  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

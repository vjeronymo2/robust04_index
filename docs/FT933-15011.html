			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Property: The Frasers move out - After 600 years, a Scottish idyll is on the market / Cadogan's Place IMAGINE a 60-acre island in the middle of a Scottish river. It is covered with mixed trees, rhododendrons and azaleas. The air is so pure that lichen abounds, even on the garden furniture. The cliff at one end is the Point, where the trees and rocks opposite shimmer in the calm water. Three-quarters of a mile away at the other end is the Counterpoint, where water meadows make the view. Between are paths and clearings and views of the river and a gorge and otters, roe deer, pine martens, red squirrels, herons and buzzards. A balustraded bridge over the Beauly river leads to this island fiefdom of Eilean Aigas in Inverness-shire. It is the ideal place for a holiday or honeymoon or to settle to write (as did Compton Mackenzie, Maurice Baring and Antonia Fraser) and garden in rare peace, 11 miles from Inverness and 25 from its airport. After 600 years in the Fraser family it is now for sale, complete with the laird's house of 1838 built by the then Lord Lovat, head of the Fraser clan, for the two extraordinary brothers who called themselves Sobieski Stuart. They claimed to be grandsons and heirs of Bonnie Prince Charlie and, remarkably, society in London and Scotland accepted them. They learnt Gaelic and chronicled the dress and customs of the Highlands in their book The Costume of the Clans, an invaluable work since the old tartans were being forgotten after the British government proscribed Highland dress from 1748 to 1788. At Eilean Aigas, they made themselves a set of out-size baronial wooden chairs (still in the house) and a rich Scottish interior - antlers galore - for their 'court.' John, the elder brother, painted a picture of the two of them,standing in the book room in front of the fireplace where the picture hangs now. They went to church by boat, in full Highland rig with a piper playing. They are buried in Eskdale churchyard, along with various Frasers and Maurice Baring. Benjie Fraser is selling Eilean Aigas, having inherited it from his father, Sir Hugh Fraser, the MP who died in 1984. The house is in good condition and can sleep 19. There is enough hot water for all and Sir Hugh installed a heated swimming pool, too. The property has been available for renting by the week, for Pounds 1,975 plus VAT. That is cheaper than a hotel for a houseful and there is a choice of looking after yourself, bringing your own help, or using the existing help in the house. Savills (031-2266961) is looking for offers over Pounds 800,000. The buyer of this island romance will want to bid also for the book, chairs and picture of the Sobieski Stuarts.                           *      *      * THE WINDS of change still blow in South Africa. Hamptons International (071-493-8222) teamed up recently with Seeff International Properties of South Africa, where property is remarkably good value. Now, it has announced its first South African house for sale: Withycomb, a 1909 Cape Dutch homestead in Constantia, 18 km from Cape Town, with a guest cottage and two acres. Price: R1.3m (about Pounds 265,000).</p>

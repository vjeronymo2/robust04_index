			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fossil fuel levy raises Pounds 1.35bn OFFER, the electricity regulator, said yesterday that Pounds 1.35bn was raised last year through the fossil fuel levy on electricity consumers. About 98 per cent of this went to nuclear power generators. Renewable generators, who produce electricity from sources including wind and the sun, received the remaining 2 per cent but their share is likely to rise to 6 per cent this year.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CHRYSLER TO SETTLE AGE-BIAS SUIT  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. has agreed to pay $5.1 million to about 150 former employees in  a settlement of an age-discrimination lawsuit filed in 1981 by a federal  agency.  </P> <P> The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claimed in its suit against  Chrysler Motors Corp., the auto makers manufacturing arm, that the salaried  workers were forced to retire because of their ages.  </P> <P> The case had been scheduled for trial Tuesday, but Chrysler agreed Dec. 30 to  the settlement, under which it admitted no liability or wrongdoing. The auto  maker reached a $2.9-million settlement earlier last month with 82 other former  salaried workers. The commission was to determine how the money would be  distributed.  </P> <P> The case originally sought compensation for more than 1,600 employees allegedly  forced to retire between 1978 and 1981, when Chrysler was near bankruptcy, said  Tom Keenbaum, a Detroit attorney representing the ex-workers.  </P></p>

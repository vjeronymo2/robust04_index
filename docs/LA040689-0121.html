			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE MAKE THEIR WISH, AILING BOY'S COME TRUE  </P> <P> A boy's wildest dreams were obviously coming true when Pomona police started  giving Christopher Wilson everything they could think of. And that may be only  the beginning.  </P> <P> By the time they're through, Chris may have visited the Statue of Liberty and  Disney World, and dozens of football-playing policemen will have had dreams of  their own fulfilled.  </P> <P> The 6-year-old Chris, who was born with cystic fibrosis, has already had a ride  in the Pomona police helicopter and on a police motorcycle that he got to  operate himself.  </P> <P> His benefactors include the Pomona Police Officers Assn., officers of the state  Department of Corrections and the Make A Wish Foundation, which makes dreams  come true for youngsters under 18 who have life-threatening diseases.  </P> <P> It all began when members of the police association, who often play on other  football teams, decided to form their own squad.  </P> <P> "We'd go out and beat our brains out, and the recognition would go to the team  we were playing for," said Pomona Detective Ray Birch. "We wanted some of the  glory that we were helping others to get."  </P> <P> So did officers of the California Institute for Men in Chino, who had the same  idea.  </P> <P> Together, they figured they could raise a lot of money if they held a charity  football game and sold all the tickets themselves, rather than paying an agency  to solicit ticket sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Donating Stadium  </P> <P> The athletic department at Chaffey College in Alta Loma is donating its  football stadium, uniforms and personnel for the game, which will begin at 7  p.m. on April 14. Tickets will cost $3 for adults and $1 for children 5 to 17.  Younger children will be admitted free.  </P> <P> When plans started falling into place, Birch said the police association asked  the Make A Wish Foundation to choose a special child to help.  </P> <P> Deborah Wilson said her son had been recommended to the foundation by a teacher  who tutors him in his La Verne home, through the Bonita Unified School  District.  </P> <P> Chris easily qualified for consideration, said Betty Strong of Riverside,  speaking for the Make A Wish Foundation. Proceeds from the football game will  not go directly to Chris, Strong said, but into a general fund. The foundation  spends an average of $2,000 for each wish it fulfills. She said many hotels  provide free or reduced-cost rooms, and the foundation gives each member of the  family $50 spending money each day of the trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Upper You Can't Believe'  </P> <P> "The effect on their lives is the excitement they get, the happiness," Strong  said. "It's an upper you can't believe."  </P> <P> Dozens of Pomona officers competed for Chris's attention during a  get-acquainted visit last week. They urged him to accept a special cake,  badges, a helmet and a baton.  </P> <P> "You can't believe how much this is doing for us," Birch said. "The kind of  thing we see every day out on the streets -- we really need this.  </P> <P> "He's the perfect kid," said Birch as he watched Chris easily take over the  entire police facility.  </P> <P> Chris is a blue-eyed, blond charmer with a disease that a spokesman at the  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Southern California called "the No. 1 genetic  killer of children and young adults."  </P> <P> His big wish, say his parents, Deborah and Scott Wilson, is to see the Statue  of Liberty. Disney World comes a close second.  </P> <P> All that will likely come true soon after the April 14 game, said Strong. She  has begun making plans for the family, including 3-year-old Cory, to spend a  week traveling to New York and Florida.  </P> <P> Chris, who is currently in good health, required surgery for an intestinal  blockage six hours after he was born, his mother said.  </P> <P> Cystic fibrosis forms a thick mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive tract  and makes its victims susceptible to pneumonia and other infections. Gary  Green, executive for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, said most of the 35,000  victims in the United States have a life expectancy into their mid-20s. He said  scientists may soon be able to identify the gene that causes the disease.  </P> <P> Deborah Wilson said Chris receives regular intravenous feedings and sleeps with  a mask and a humidifier to ease his breathing. While he appears robust, he is  not able to attend regular school classes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helicopter Ride  </P> <P> Last week, after touring the police facility and posing for photographers like  a professional model, Chris and his mother went to Brackett Field in La Verne,  where the Pomona Police Department's helicopter is kept.  </P> <P> "I've been looking forward to this since I first heard about it," said pilot  Dennis McCall.  </P> <P> A somewhat reluctant Chris was persuaded to mount a cycle. He immediately  identified the button that operated the siren.  </P> <P> He lasted as long as the police officers did that afternoon, running, leaping,  grinning and clutching his new possessions.  </P> <P> "He gave out and slept on the way home, but it was wonderful while it lasted,"  said his mother.  </P></p>

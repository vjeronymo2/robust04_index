			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government dithers over edible oil imports With the elections to be held in several states, including some major oilseeds producing states, late this year the Indian federal government is finding it difficult to firm up its edible oils import policy. The government, which must weigh carefully the impact of any policy initiative on its electoral prospects, finds the agriculture ministry strongly opposing the proposal of the civil supplies ministry to allow the free import of all kinds of edible oils. At present only the import of palm olein is freely allowed. While it is important for the government to keep the 15m farmers engaged in the cultivation of oilseeds happy bykeeping the import of oils to the bare minimum, it cannot overlook the fact that prices are high in spite of a good oilseeds crop during 1993-94 (November to October). Prices may rise even further during the Indian festive season beginning October. What the government has done in the prevailing circumstances is to postpone taking a decision on freeing the import of all edible oils to a future date and to allow the State Trading Corporation and the National Dairy Development Board to import 100,000 tonnes of edible oils each, excluding coconut oil, at a concessional duty of 20 per cent. The private oil trade has, however, taken strong exception to the government allowing only the state agencies to import oils. Earlier this year also, the traders were discriminated against when the government allowed the STC and NDDB to import over 200,000 tonnes of palm olein at a duty of 20 per cent, compared with the normal rate of 65 per cent. The import duty on palm olein may be reduced. The government is, however, deriving some comfort in this election year from the encouraging prospects for oilseeds production in the 1994-95 season. According to initial projections, output is likely to rise to 22.4m tonnes from 21.75m in 1993-94. The improvement in production will be mainly in the groundnut and soyabean crops. The excellent monsoon in most parts of the country has given a boost to oilseeds production. The monsoon influences the production in a big way as about 60 per cent of the land under oilseeds is unirrigated.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Role of industrial tribunals called to account: Richard Wolffe looks at the pressure for reform as the system's caseloads and costs jump to record levels The government is today expected to announce proposals to reform the industrial tribunal system, which has been criticised by businesses and unions alike. The proposals, which follow an eight-month review, aim to improve the efficiency of a system in which the number of cases has increased by 150 per cent over the past five years. Tribunals dealt with a record 73,000 cases last year on 60 types of claim, from race discrimination to unfair dismissal. The government has become increasingly concerned at the costs of tribunals, whose budget since 1988 has risen by 75 per cent to Pounds 26.6m this year. Launching the review in April, Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, said the government would 'review the operation of the industrial tribunals with a view to identifying any changes which would help them to cope with an increasing volume and complexity of cases and reduce delays, while containing demands on public expenditure'. Her announcement came just three weeks after a tribunal awarded record compensation of Pounds 300,000 to an army major who was forced to give up her career when she became pregnant. The case, which paved the way for a series of armed service claims worth an estimated Pounds 100m, highlighted the increasing powers exercised by tribunals. The compensation followed last year's decision by the European Court of Justice to remove the ceiling on awards in sex and race discrimination cases. Originally designed to deal with appeals against the training levy in 1964, tribunals have grown in response to a mountain of employment law. The 1971 Industrial Relations Act gave tribunals jurisdiction over unfair dismissal claims, and the caseload expanded again under the 1986 Wages Act. More recently the government transferred contractual disputes in England and Wales from the county courts to industrial tribunals. The growth in employment law has undermined the informal nature of the industrial tribunal, which is led by a panel of two lay members sitting beside a legally trained chairman. One in three employers and one in five applicants are now legally represented at tribunal hearings, although legal aid is not available. The Confederation of British Industry said: 'The whole process could be speeded up and made more efficient, but we would not want to see an increase in legalism. The informal structure would tend to permit less delay in most cases.' The CBI is calling for tribunal chairmen to hear more cases on their own, without the help of lay members. At the moment chairmen have the power to sit alone in cases which revolve around legal issues. However, the TUC argues that lay members have essential experience of the workplace, particularly in cases of sex and race discrimination. Mrs Sarah Veale, senior policy officer, said: 'Industrial tribunals should not resemble the labour courts on the Continent. We are rather saddened to see the use of lawyers, particularly by employers.' The huge compensation awards to former servicewomen also highlight the legal anomalies in the tribunal system. While there is no limit to discrimination awards, the maximum compensation for unfair dismissal remains at just Pounds 11,000. Mrs Janet Gaymer, chairman of the Law Society's employment law committee, said: 'We have been saying for a long time that it is totally illogical that you can have a limit on the amount of awards on an unfair dismissal and none on sex and race discrimination.' One of the options open to the government is to expand the role of Acas, the conciliation service, which attempts to reach a compromise in all tribunal cases. However the proportion of cases resolved by Acas has fallen over the last five years from 58 per cent to 33 per cent. More than two thirds of Acas resources are now committed to individual conciliations. Another option is to prune administrative costs by taking a stricter line on delays. However, employment lawyers fear further efficiencies will ignore the logistical difficulties of mounting a case. Mrs Gaymer said: 'A lot of the backlog of cases has reduced recently because of vigorous listing pol-icies. 'The concern that employment lawyers have is that tribunals are ignoring the requirements of both parties to a very large extent, over whether their representatives can attend or not.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Renee Lai] </F>   [Text] China's State Statistics Bureau will establish  overseas joint ventures to meet the need of foreign investors  for information about the country. Xiang Zhongde, chairman of  the China Statistics Information Consultancy Service Centre  (CSICSC), said the bureau planned to launch the joint ventures  in the United States, Britain and Hong Kong. He added that the  CSICSC was already involved in discussions with potential  partners.    Mr Xiang said the joint ventures would improve the bureau's  ability to provide information on China to foreign investors  who, he added, would no longer have to make the long journey to  get such information first hand. He said he expected the joint  ventures to be operative within a year.    The CSICSC was formed in late 1992 as the bureau's Hong Kong  vehicle, underscoring China's efforts in facilitating a flow of  information among the foreign investors who have joined the  headlong rush to invest in the mainland. The bureau has similar  offices in 30 mainland cities. Mr Xiang said Beijing was losing  control over the dissemination of information as the economy of  the country rapidly developed and opened.    He said more than 80 percent of official statistics and  information was now freely available to the public. As an  example, he said information was now available on foreign  exchange rates and gold reserves. Such information was  previously not disclosed. "Gradually, China will provide the  general public with more statistics and figures complied by the  country," Mr Xiang said. He said the bureau also planned to set  up a database for professional use which would be available to  both government departments and the public.    Mr Xiang said that in addition to regular large-scale  population censuses and surveys of the industrial and commercial  sectors and tertiary industry, the bureau also conducted sample  surveys on small enterprises to cater for the changing economic  environment. He said there had been a change in companies'  operating mechanisms after sweeping reforms in enterprise.  This, he said, had led to a proliferation of joint ventures,  collectively-owned enterprises and private concerns.    Mr Xiang said the CSICSC would conduct research on specific  industries in line with customers' requests. To improve  dissemination of information on China, the bureau will also  launch a bilingual annual statistics digest in the second half  of this year. This will replace the existing series with Chinese  and English versions.</p>

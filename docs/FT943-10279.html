			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low shares busy The fallout from the Tesco bid for William Low reverberated throughout the food retail sector, inspiring fresh acquisition speculation and reports of some inspired stockbroking operations. According to traders, Salomon International, the US investment bank, had been busy throughout Wednesday buying in Low stock and selling Tesco in order to arbitrage between the two stocks. In particular, it is thought Salomon was aiming to benefit from the all-share alternative to Tesco's cash bid for Wm Low. Sources close to Salomon said the broker bought a hefty 10 per cent of the Scottish supermarket group during its buying spree. Meanwhile, it was the turn of Kwik Save to attract speculators yesterday as the shares forged ahead 28 to 602p, although turnover was only moderate. The talk was dismissed by analysts, who pointed to the large minority stake held by Dairy Farm, of Hong Kong, in Kwik Save. J. Sainsbury, which lost out on the bid for Low, was at the centre of renewed speculation that it is about to make a large US purchase. The shares defied these suggestions, gaining 6 at 425p. Tesco put on 3 at 240 1/2 p, while Low steadied at 359p. Reports that Sainsbury had reported a sharp rise in its soft drinks sales during the recent hot weather in the UK contributed to a strong advance in Cadbury Schweppes, which added 12 at 453p. Wellcome was driven forward a further 20 on bid speculation but slipped back to close only 9 1/2 up at 685 1/2 p. Glaxo received some support from news that Serevent, its anti-asthma treatment, had received approval in France. The shares had been 5 off and closed unchanged at 603p. British Petroleum drifted 6 1/2 easier to 404p with 8.5m shares traded as UK investors cut long positions following the recent rally. Shell Transport was dragged down by the performance of its Royal Dutch arm and dipped 5 to 735p. Engineering group TI closed 7 ahead at 412p after cheering the market with an 11 per cent increase in interim profits. Market watchers were particularly pleased by the improvement in the balance sheet. Analysts expect full-year profits of around Pounds 145m. Glynwed International was another engineering company to please the market as it reported half-time figures ahead of expectations. The shares put on 5 at 390p after brokers upgraded full-year estimates. The market range is now between Pounds 65m and Pounds 69m. Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries eased a penny to 203p on reports that rivals Bosch, of Germany, and Fiat, of Italy, are setting up a joint venture in diesel engine fuel injection systems. Speculation that Tiphook will announce a rights issue next week continued in the market and the shares relinquished 4 to 30p. Speciality chemicals group BTP put on 7 at 324p, with dealers talking of a big buy order going through the market as the company held its annual meeting and announced a Pounds 12.6m acquisition for its German unit. Analysts said the ICI pension fund had been reducing its holding in the company over the past few weeks via BZW, but yesterday the investment bank received a sizeable order for stock. ICI rose 2 to 858p. Building materials group RMC gained 7 at 994p after a positive note from UBS. UBS issued a negative note on Courtaulds, sending the share price down 8 to 536p. Insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT Industries fell 14 to 446p on worries over a ruling by the US Food and Drug Administration that tobacco is addictive. Magazine group Reed International rose 14 to 812p ahead of first-half results due next Thursday. Paper group David S. Smith added 10 at 558p after Panmure Gordon recommended the stock at the morning meeting. News of the early break-out of a price war in the holiday market saw a predictable retreat for tour operator Airtours, off 10 to 449p with turnover a high 1.7m. Smith New Court said the stock still represented good value. Owners Abroad rallied from an initial fall to close steady at 100p. Estate agent Herring Baker jumped 13 to 51p as it was announced that property agency Conrad Ritblat, down 2 at 36p, had taken a 9.4 per cent stake. Other statistics, Page 29</p>

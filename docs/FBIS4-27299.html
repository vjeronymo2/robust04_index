			<p>BFN     [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has received a  reply from Yasir 'Arafat, president of Palestinian State and  chairman of Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive  Committee on his solidarity message to the latter.    The message reads:    Pyongyang,    Your Excellency DPRK President Kim Il-song: I extend my  greetings to you, Your Excellency President Kim Il-song. On  behalf of the Palestinian people, members of Executive Committee  of Palestinian Liberation Organization, and my own name, I  extend my deep appreciation to you, Your Excellency, and to your  government and to your friendly people through you, for your  solidarity message supporting the Palestinian people's struggle.    In the message you have expressed a firm feeling of  solidarity again. This proves how friendly and cooperative  relations and solidarity between the people of our two countries  are close and strong. We hope that we will be able to further  deepen and develop the relations to comply with the common  interests of the two countries' people, who want to secure peace  and stability and to make progress and prosperity in our area,  as well as in your area, thus making effort for its realization.    Since the signing of an agreement on the Palestinian  autonomy  in Gaza and Jericho areas, our Palestinian people have begun the  work of laying foundations and building facilities urgently  needed to establish the national government. With great trust  and hope, our people, who have entered such an important stage,  expect that all of our friends, as well as all people throughout  the world, who love freedom, justice, and peace, are able to  express their support and greetings needed to consolidate the  basis of the Palestinian government.    Strengthening the basis of the Palestinian government  guarantees security, peace, stability, progress, and prosperity  of the people of all countries in our area. Also, this will be  the first important step in maintaining the fair and durable  peace in the Middle East region, enabling our Palestinian people  to terminate Israel's occupation of their territory and to  restore and exercise their legal national rights, including the  rights to establish a independent state with the sacred area  [kudosul] as its capital.    Finally, I extend my deep thanks to you, Your Excellency,  once again, and wish you a long life and good health. I wish  you success in your people's work for national reunification,  progress, and prosperity. I extend my best regards and warmest  greetings to you as well, Your Excellency. [signed] Yasir  'Arafat, president of Palestinian State and chairman of  Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive Committee.  [issued] 16 May 1994, Tunis</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Glaxo scientists sign personal contracts GLAXO, the pharmaceuticals company, said that 60 per cent of a group of scientists at its Barnard Castle, Durham, site have signed personal contracts in spite of opposition by a union fighting to preserve its recognition agreement there. Signing the contracts will result in the scientists depending for pay rises on their individual performance. The Association of Management and Professional Staffs said that in a recent ballot among the 80-strong group, members voted by 11 to one against continuing a performance-related pay system introduced two years ago. It accused the company of reneging on an agreement, made at the time of the introduction of performance pay, that the scientists could revert to traditional pay bargaining systems if they wished. Mr Tony Casey, executive secretary of AMPS, said that only about 30 per cent of members had signed the contracts. Although there was no mood for industrial action, the scientists were extremely angry about the company's attitude. Glaxo said it was encouraging people to take time to make up their minds on the personal contracts. Scientists at two other plants in Glaxo Manufacturing Services are also being offered personal contracts. The company said it wanted to standardise an individual relationship between staff and itself throughout the graduate and professional groups in GMS. It denied that it had reneged on any previous agreement, saying the contracts issue was totally separate.</p>

His work to create opportunities for Malaysian businesses,  in  turn, may hold some lessons for Korean government officials and  perhaps President Kim Yong-sam himself. Since the beginning of  the year, Kim has said he will put top priority on boosting  national competitiveness and urged his administration officials  to spare no efforts to support businesses.    Frequent overseas working trips low on official protocol are  said to exemplify his efforts to achieve the goal of placing  Malaysia in the ranks of the most advanced countries, with a per  capita income of $16,000 by the year 2020.    The Malaysian prime minister recently made such a trip to  Korea with the sole purpose of business talks. His three-day  private visit at the invitation of the Hyundai Business Group  made Koreans realize again why he is called the "business  premier."    In December 1991, he had made a similar visit to Korea, also  at the invitation of Hyundai.    Mahathir arrived in a southern airport Saturday in a small  private airplane, accompanied by only three Malaysian  businessmen and no government officials. During his visit, he  declined any protocol.    Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong received and saw him off  at the Kimhae International Airport in his capacity as former  ambassador to Malaysia, not as the vice foreign minister.  Mahathir inspected the group's auto plant and shipyard in the  southeastern port of Ulsan. He checked a model of a small truck  Hyundai plans to produce in a joint venture with a Malaysian  business. He focused on business talks with Hyundai Chairman  Chong Se-yong and other top executives of the group about the  plan for the joint production of small trucks and another plan  to order ships.    A Hyundai official said Mahathir asked the group to keep his  visit unpublicized so that he could concentrate on objectives.    Besides the two business-only visits, Mahathir has made four  other trips to Korea, including his first visit in 1980 when he  was trade and industry minister. He made two official visits  here as prime minister in August 1983 and in September 1990.  Mahathir came to Seoul in May 1992 to speak to a meeting of the  Pacific Basin Economic Council, a group of regional private  economic leaders.    A Foreign Ministry official said business trips by Mahathir  should be a stimulus for Korean officials.    The official, however, said, it is hardly imaginable for a  Korean president in the near future to visit a foreign country  at the invitation of a private business.    "Korea is different from Malaysia in many ways, such as  social atmosphere and people's attitudes," he said. There can  also be a gap between words and attitudes of Koreans on the  matter, the official said.    "I don't think, despite what they say, that Koreans will  accept it as natural for their president to visit a foreign  country only for business talks with a private enterprise," he  said.    The official pointed out one thing that hinders Korean trade  officials from going all-out to support a Korean business in  overseas markets. In many cases, competition among Korean  companies is fiercer than competition with foreign firms, he  said.    "The President has told us to be salesmen for the nation's  businesses," the official said. "But whose products will we  have to help sell if Korean companies compete with each other?"</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Polish debt deal goes ahead Poland's western government creditors in the Paris Club have put into operation the final phase of a deal aimed at halving Poland's sovereign debt. Under the second tranche of the Paris Club agreement Poland's sovereign debt, estimated at Dollars 28.7bn (Pounds 19.6bn) by the Finance Ministry, is to be reduced by around Dollars 3.4bn while interest payments in coming years are to run at below market rates. However, the creditors 'reserved the right to review their decision' to make sure it is compatible with debt reduction agreement Poland struck with the London Club of commercial bank creditors last month. This is to put additional pressure on owners of Dollars 12.3bn Polish commercial debt, unhappy at the 42 per cent London Club debt reduction, to accept the arrangement, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor, said on a visit to Warsaw yesterday. The Poles expect to complete the London Club deal in the autumn but some Polish debt holders have protested that the agreement is too generous to Warsaw. The Paris Club yesterday agreed to reschedule Dollars 200m of Bulgarian debt repayments due in the year to March 1995. The move follows an agreement between Bulgaria and the International Monetary Fund signed this month.</p>

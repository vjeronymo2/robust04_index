			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Easier to complain - A new watchdog for the financial services industry UNHAPPY life insurance and pensions policyholders should have an easier time pressing their complaints under procedures to be adopted by a new self-regulatory body proposed for the financial services industry. So far, the Personal Investments Authority exists only in name. But one of the chief reasons for its birth has been the absence of coherent methods to handle grievances. For those seeking more than just an apology or modest redress, the present system works poorly. Lord Ackner, in his just-published report on it, noted that each of the three self-regulatory bodies for the industry - Fimbra, Lautro and Imro - has different rules for handling complaints and varying abilities to award compensation. The future of the PIA is still unknown. But if it is established, the ambiguities in the present mechanism should disappear. First, all companies will be required to resolve a customer's complaint  - albeit not necessarily to his satisfaction - within six weeks. Those who remain unsatisfied will be able to approach an independent conciliation service, unconnected with the PIA, to have it resolved. Ackner rejected specifically the suggestion that the PIA itself act as conciliator. If it did, it would risk being viewed as a captive of the industry. This is a suggestion which the new body wishes assiduously to avoid. The conciliator is intended to be a professional organisation, with skilled individuals experienced in handling complaints and resolving them. But before a complaint even lands there, the PIA will review the paperwork. It is possible that the PIA will urge a company against which a complaint has been laid to take a different approach. Or it might ask a complainant to visit the PIA to discuss some detail which might have been misunderstood or even overlooked entirely. Once a case comes before the concilator, the judgment will consider not only the contractual wording of the policy and the legal obligations on the seller but also what is 'best practice.' This means that a company which did not violate any rules technically, but which broke the spirit of the rules in selling or maintaining a policy, could be required to make reparations to a customer. This issue was a sore point for some in the industry who had opposed it on the ground that they were, effectively, providing investors with a free service as an alternative to having to resort to the courts. Why, they argued, should they pay for a service which offered the possibility of a solution better than what might have been achieved in the courts? Ackner rejected such arguments, more or less on the ground that the industry held the upper hand because of access to greater resources and expertise. The new system is intended to redress that imbalance. The conciliator will have the power to award restitution of up to Pounds 50,000, but those clients who are dissatisfied with any ruling will still have leave to bring their case to the courts. Investors should breathe a sigh of relief that some of the suggestions put forward by parts of the industry have been rejected. Most potentially damaging of these was the Life Insurance Association's proposal that any complainant whose case did not stand up to scrutiny would be required to bear the costs of bringing the complaint. A rule like that would, in effect, have killed off all but complaints of the most blatant instances of contract-breaching - hardly a reassuring environment for investors.</p>

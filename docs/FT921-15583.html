			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: America wakes up to a stricken commander - Collapse at banquet in Tokyo renews doubts over president's health and stamina THE pictures from Tokyo of a stricken President George Bush, his face ashen and his mouth agape, will remain embedded in the US popular memory for a long time. Millions of Americans woke up yesterday morning to watch the jarring images replayed again and again on breakfast television. Many wondered if there was more than met the eye in the White House explanation that the Commander-in-Chief had fallen victim to a severe bout of stomach flu. This was, after all, not the first time that Mr Bush had fallen sick on the job. Just seven months ago, the president was taken to hospital after suffering 'atrial fibrillations' - a rapid heart-beat which doctors later diagnosed as a symptom of a thyroid ailment. Then, as now, questions have arisen about the quality of Mr Bush's potential successor, Vice-President Dan Quayle. In the short term, it was Mrs Barbara Bush who probably saved the day. Soon after her husband had collapsed, the First Lady recovered her composure, remained at the state dinner hosted by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and proceeded to make light of the incident. 'I can't explain what happened to George because it never happened before, but I'm beginning to think it's the ambassador's fault,' said Mrs Bush, pausing for laughter and applause. She went on to explain that the president had played tennis with Mr Michael Armacost, US ambassador, for two hours against the Emperor and Crown Prince of Japan, and had been soundly thrashed. 'We Bushes aren't used to that.' Despite Mrs Bush's best efforts, the Tokyo tummy bug incident - if that is all it is - means that Mr Bush's health will become a factor in the presidential electoral campaign this year, as it threatened to do after Mr Bush had suffered his irregular heart-beat last May 4 while jogging at Camp David. In the coming months Mr Bush, who is aged 67, will face a travel schedule almost as rigorous as the 12-day, 26,000-mile trade mission which has taken him through 10 time zones to Australia, Singapore, South Korea and now Japan. Comparisons will be drawn between the White House incumbent and the ruddy-faced Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, 46 years old and the early Democratic front-runner. The experience factor can easily be turned into the 'age' factor - though neither will be enough to determine the outcome of the election. Mrs Bush's tennis anecdote is telling because it pinpoints both a great strength and weakness in her husband's approach to his job. The president makes few concessions to high office when it comes to physical activity. Having watched earlier White House occupants, such as Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, weighed down by the terrible burden of office, Mr Bush uses exercise as a mental escape, in much the same way as his hero President Theodore Roosevelt did at the turn of the last century. Last year Mr Bush lost almost a stone in weight after taking drugs for his thyroid complaint, but soon afterwards he was inviting reporters half his age to go jogging. 'He loves it,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary. 'What can you do?' Mr Fitzwater repeated the message yesterday. After declaring sombrely that 'nothing extraordinary has occurred' one hour after Mr Bush's collapse, the spokesman said: 'The president's schedule is one that he has maintained for three years and one that he enjoys. He is a very physical and vigorous man, and I don't expect any changes.' In recent months, however, Mr Bush has been more 'hyper' than usual. Some attribute the activity to an effort to compensate for his slump in the polls. This stems from a slide in public confidence in an early economic recovery, although Mr Bush has had plenty of other serious concerns such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fate of more than 27,000 nuclear warheads on Soviet soil and - the single most important political issue in the US today - the future of the US economy. Mr Bush has tried many a public gimmick to restore confidence. 'Activity,' says one critic, 'has replaced thought'. The decision to take 21 US business leaders on the trip to Tokyo may be the most unfortunate gimmick of all. Mr Bush faces criticism - in Japan and in the US - for having invited corporate executives such as Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler chairman, to berate his hosts. Five years ago Mr Iacocca was a corporate hero; these days he is often dismissed as overpaid and too inclined to shift blame on to foreigners. These presidential failings may reflect the sheer pressure of a non-stop job, but they are more likely the result of political misjudgments. The question is whether Mr Bush's political advisers will counsel him to slow down a little, if only better to collect his thoughts and conserve his energies for the strains of the campaign. Just before he collapsed at the state dinner, Mr Bush told a US reporter that he would not run for re-election if his health were in doubt. He added quickly, however, that he felt in good shape, though 'a little tired sometimes'. If Mrs Bush has her way, her husband will slow his pace - but it will be difficult for a man who has always prided himself in his stamina, athleticism and ruddy health. Having had one warning last year, will Mr Bush take heed this time round?</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / SmithKline and Glaxo in row over patents A SQUABBLE broke out yesterday between the UK's two leading drugs companies, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, over patents of one of Glaxo's most important new drugs, Zofran. SmithKline Beecham said the European patent office had decided to grant it a European patent for use of ondansetron (Zofran's chemical name) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer therapy and cytotoxic agents. Zofran is marketed by Glaxo for that use. The decision is an embarrassment for Glaxo. The drug won the Prix Galien last year as Europe's most important new drug. Last financial year, Zofran generated sales of Pounds 259m compared with Pounds 78m in 1991. Its launch was described by Mr Ernest Mario, chief executive, as one of the most successful in the history of the pharmaceuticals industry. SmithKline Beecham is unlikely to call for the product's withdrawal and is unable to market the drug directly. However it will be looking for royalty payments. Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at James Capel, said: 'This is unlikely to have any immediate impact on Glaxo's bottom line.' Glaxo shares fell 20 1/2 p to 786 1/2 p, while SmithKline Beecham rose 2p to 538p. SmithKline Beecham said it expected to have a European patent within six months. Glaxo said eight countries were covered by the decision: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. They represent about 25 per cent of Zofran's sales. Glaxo said it would appeal against the decision and would seek to invalidate the patent in any country where SmithKline Beecham tried to enforce it. Glaxo's US and Japanese patents for the use of ondansetron for nausea associated with chemotherapy are also being challenged by SmithKline Beecham. Glaxo said it had discovered, patented and marketed ondansetron worldwide. It was originally patented for migraine and anxiety. SmithKline Beecham, which has expertise in nausea in chemotherapy, tested the drug for that use and then patented it. The company markets Zofran's main competitor, Kytril. The main legal debate is about the difference between nausea in migraine patients and nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Iliana Hautrive] </F>   [Text] Slightly less than three months after the  reintroduction of self-employment in Cuba, results can already  be seen in attaining its primary objectives: satisfying the  population's needs, providing jobs, and generating state  revenues.    A recent evaluation by the National Assembly deputies on the  economic affairs committee showed that with the passage of time  after the implementation of Decree-Law 141, the self-employment  phenomena are growing increasingly complex, which means that  activity is expanding, not the contrary.    The greatest achievement of this measure was certainly  eliminating needs not being met by the state, and helping to  reactivate the national economy. Among other things, it provides  another outlet in Cuba's present imperfect and difficult  situation.    This effort requires constant modification to continue  seeking a happy medium, whose essence consists in not drifting  toward capitalism, but instead developing a Cuban formula in  order to comply with the fundamental principles that have given  it life.    Over 106,000 applications have so far been made, and of  these  almost 87,000 were approved; fewer than 2 percent were rejected.  This shows a trend toward greater openness in this area.    The status of workers who were self-employed some years ago  is also favorable, and while the number of approved occupations  has been increasing, it seems promising that studies are  continuing for the approval of others, and also of occupational  sectors that may be included as suitable for self-employment.    With ups and downs related to the particular features of  each  area, the matter of supervision is now a topic of debate. In  some places, like Holguin and Granma, inspections and procedures  have been established, but that has not been done in all  provinces.    I believe the city of Havana merits different treatment, but  there is no doubt that the legal instrument now being prepared  by the State Finance Committee will provide a positive mechanism  for dealing with possible violations.    Moreover, more than a few people believe that  self-employment  foments the diversion of resources and other forms of crime, and  the strict controls of which we are speaking must also deal with  this vital issue. Still, I agree with those who think the  negative phenomenon of theft was present before the  implementation of Decree-Law 141, and now it should disappear  with more stringent controls.    The issue of prices is also controversial, with a range  going  from a pair of earrings for 10 pesos up to a small carton of  fried rice, pork, meat, or salad, which may cost 70 pesos,  depending on the province, day, and category of the place of  sale, as is frequent in the Paladar network--recalling the  unforgettable Raquel of "Vale Todo" ["Worth It All"]--so well  known in the city of Havana.    I agree that some prices are too high, but prices are  subject  to the laws of supply and demand, in which prices cannot be  managed. They will regulate themselves as the situation  stabilizes and there will be greater satisfaction of needs.    In one essential oversight--which may include strong fines  and even confiscations--consideration is being given to the  future application of a variable progressive tax on personal  earnings. Sales and services for foreign currency, which are  damaging the meaning of self-employment, also need to be  scrutinized more carefully.    Taking a positive view, I think of the hundreds of thousands  of workers who, because of the necessary layoffs in search of  greater efficiency, may find an occupation and employment in  this activity, not to mention people of diminished capacity,  those without jobs, housewives, and retirees; all these people  will ensure a good selection.    I am also thinking of the revenues that may be provided for  next year's state budget; the program may also help to improve  finances and reduce the excessive amounts of cash in circulation  in Cuba.    In a preliminary accounting, self-employment seems to be  working, though it has its weak points because of the short time  it has existed. Soon improvements will be made, and there will  be more complete control; the workers' movement may also focus  on this new labor sector.    And of course, when the National Assembly of the People's  Government examines the application of Decree-Law 141, the  debate will be enriched and the Cuban economy will move toward  the consolidation of another necessary measure that will be of  great benefit in our immediate future.</p>

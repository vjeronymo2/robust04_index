			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- Railroad transportation  will return to near normalcy toward the end of the week as more  and more striking engineers resume their positions.    Strikers who had returned to work or made known their  intention to do so as of 9:00 A.M. Monday, the fifth day of the  strike, numbered 5,755, or 88 percent of all 6,540 people. They  included 2, 766 locomotive engineers and 1,536 assistant  engineers, 69 percent, according to the Korean National Railroad  (KNR).    To compel the remaining strikers to take up their posts, the  KNR warned that those failing to return by 10:00 A.M. Monday  will be sacked. It estimates that some 900 engineers and  assistant engineers will not return by the deadline.    As more engineers report back to work, the KNR will increase  operations of commuter trains linked with the Seoul subway to  66.9 percent of the normal level by the weekend, while  normalizing cargo train runs for such important freight as  containers of export and import goods, oil and cement.    To fill the openings left by those who remain on strike, the  KNR will utilize some 500 retired and stand-by engineers to  increase passenger and cargo transportation to 90 percent of the  normal level and normalize commuter train operations in the  capital area by mid- July.    The KNR has already decided to sack 108 strikers, including  28 members of Chongihyop, an unregistered union of locomotive  engineers which led the strike, and 70 engineers who abandoned  their trains or took with them engine parts when the walkout  started.    Some 360 servicemen assigned to the KNR during the strike  will be employed as engineers and to perform other jobs after  training, if they so desire after discharge from military  service, the KNR said.    The KNR will also cite 539 workers who refused to strike and  who persuaded many strikers to return to work.    In a related development, organized workers of business  groups such as Hyundai and Daewoo showed no signs of initiating  a walkout Monday, the day Chonnodae (the National Council of  Union Representatives) set for a nationwide strike of its member  unions in sympathy with railroad and subway workers.    As a result, the railroad and subway strikes are not likely  to develop into a nationwide stoppage at business groups.    According to the Labor Ministry, some of the 26 big company  unions belonging to Chonnodae have already refused to follow  Chonnodae's nationwide strike plan, though organized workers of  Hyundai Heavy Industries began a partial strike Monday morning.</p>

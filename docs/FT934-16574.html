			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Irish opposition party leader resigns MR Des O'Malley has resigned as leader of the opposition Progressive Democrat party in Ireland, to 'make way for new blood'. He said he was under no political or personal pressure to do so. Mr O'Malley, 54, said he would stand for election one more time before quitting politics altogether. He did not say what his long-term plans were. A long-time opponent of Mr Charles Haughey within Fianna Fail, he split with the party leader in 1984, when Mr Haughey had him expelled for publicly differing with him on Northern Ireland, the contraception issue and internal party democracy. He founded the Progressive Democrats (PDs) in 1985, presenting it as the party of high standards and open government. The party has since had an influential minority voice holding the balance of power with six out of 166 Dail seats in the coalition government from 1989 to 1992. It was Mr O'Malley's decision to withdraw his party's support from Fianna Fail in January 1992, as a series of political and business scandals began to wash over Mr Haughey, then the prime minister, that precipitated Mr Haughey's resignation and the formation of a new Fianna Fail-PD coalition, under the leadership of Mr Albert Reynolds. Mr O'Malley has been one of the principal proponents of dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and, as a member of the government negotiating team to the 'round-table' talks on the province during 1992, clashed with his Fianna Fail colleagues in the negotiations, who insist that any constitutional change should only be made as part of an overall settlement. He then fell out with Mr Reynolds over contrasting evidence the two men gave to the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry between June and October of 1992. It was this disagreement which led to the collapse of the coalition and a general election. The tribunal, which was set up to investigate allegations of fraud, malpractice and political favouritism in Ireland's huge beef industry, concluded last summer after sitting for two years. A report of its findings is expected later this year.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Trimmed CSI Pounds 115m in loss CANNON STREET Investments, the struggling mini-conglomerate, yesterday reported a jump in pre-tax losses from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 115.5m for the year to January 2, reflecting trading losses coupled with substantial goodwill write-offs and losses on the sale and closure of businesses. However, the group's new management, which has been struggling to preserve operating cash flows through the sale and closure of a string of subsidiaries, said 'the cash drain has been stopped and the group's indebtedness and interest charge reduced significantly.' Although shareholders' funds fell by more than a third to Pounds 17.8m, Mr Tom Long, chairman, said the group's principal banker, the Bank of Scotland, remained supportive. He expressed confidence that 1992 marked a turning point and that Cannon Street would return to profit this year, helped by the installation of 'proper financial controls.' Mr Long expressed satisfaction that the immediate task of stabilising the group had been achieved and that borrowings had been brought down to 'manageble levels,' although they still represented gearing of more than 100 per cent. He said management attention was now focused on 'improving profitability and increasing the return to shareholders.' The hotel and leisure assets and the electronics distribution businesses, which together have sales of about Pounds 135m, are seen as the main opportunities for the slimmed down group. Trading losses increased to Pounds 8.44m (Pounds 1.57m) on turnover which fell to Pounds 240m (Pounds 295m). Mr David Smith, Cannon Street's new chief executive who had headed the troubled buy-out of Isosceles, the retailer, blamed the higher losses on the depressed economic conditions and the poor performance of several subsidiaries, some of which had been closed or sold. He said the remaining subsidiaries, loosely grouped together in three main divisions, were now trading profitably. The group has adopted new accounting standards including FRS 2 and FRS 3 resulting in a number of changes including the restatement of some 1991 figures. Following a 'comprehensive appraisal of all investments', Pounds 57.4m of goodwill was written off against the profit and loss account last year. There was also a Pounds 42.5m loss on the sale and closure of operations, because proceeds from disposals were below historic carrying values. These charges compare with a Pounds 20m fixed asset write-down recorded in the restated 1991 results. Interest charges fell to Pounds 7.04m (Pounds 12.4m) reflecting a reduction in bank borrowings from Pounds 75.6m to Pounds 29.6m achieved through disposals, including flotation of the Avonside housebuilding group, and more effective cash management. Mr Long said borrowings stood at well under Pounds 20m. After a tax credit of Pounds 755,000 (Pounds 155,000 charge) and payment of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 4.16m) in convertible preference share dividends, losses per share were 114.11p (37.68p). No ordinary dividend is being paid compared with 3.3p in 1991. Cannon Street sold PM Tamson, a Dutch subsidiary, for Fl 17m (Pounds 6.07m). The incorrect currency was reported yesterday.</p>

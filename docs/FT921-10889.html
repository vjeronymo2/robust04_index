			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADERS reported a dull session in the derivatives markets, with little in the way of economic data or other features on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the March contract opened strongly, with a 32-point premium and was squeezed higher before running into a bout of mid-morning selling. The selling reduced the March premium prompting renewed buying before a poor opening on Wall Street once again halted the contract's advance. Sentiment was also affected by weakness in other European markets and concern at the level of pay settlements agreed for German steel workers. March closed at 2,589, and some 13 points above its estimated fair value premium of 16. Volume reached a reasonable 6,820 contracts. In traded options, turnover reached 24,680, down on Friday's high figure of more than 31,000 contracts. The FTSE-100 Index option was busy, trading 7,058 contracts. British Gas was the busiest stock option, with 2,182 lots dealt. The June 240 puts were the busiest series. This was followed by Hillsdown, with 1,560 contracts and then Cable &amp; Wireless, with 1,133 lots changing hands.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace in Palestine Still a Mirage"] </F>   [Text] The latest hope for peace in Palestine was shattered  yesterday when a "lone" Israeli gunman sprayed Muslim  worshippers at the tomb of the Patriarch in Hebron killing more  than 30 Palestinians and injuring dozens more.    Israeli security force also did their bit by killing at  least  another 18 Palestinians and wounding many more when they fired  into the crowds gathered at hospitals to donate blood and show  support for their fellow countrymen.    The U.S.-brokered agreement between the Zionists and the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for an autonomous  Palestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho, is now  christened in blood. The PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat issued a  statement saying the massacre could have "very serious  fallout... at all levels," and his organization declared a  3-day strike in Gaza in memory of the dead.    'Arafat is not the only party to blame for this massacre,  nevertheless he must take the major share of responsibility for  this tragedy because his cooperation with the Zionist entity and  its American handlers gave some Palestinians the impression that  the usurper Zionists could be trusted and that peace may be  achieved simply by taking the Zionists and the Americans on face  falue.    Throughout their 45 years of occupying Palestine, the  Israelis have claimed that their security agencies are the best  in the world and have often criticized other countries' security  systems. It would take a great deal of faith to believe that  this massacre was purely a coincidence and the work of a "lone"  crazed Jewish fanatic. Hopefully, later investigations will  clarify questions regarding the slow response of the Zionists to  this massacre, as well as the reason why nearly 20 more unarmed  Palestinians were slaughtered by Israel's security officers.    Israel is just buying time until its lobby in U.S. Congress  can once again convince congressmen of Israel's strategic value  to America. After the fall of Communism the American Israel  Political Action Committee (AIPAC) lost some credibility among  Americans. AIPAC's perennial argument that Israel, as the "only  democracy in the region," and as a bastion of anti-Islamic  ideology in Muslim Middle East is no longer valid due to the  disintegration of the Soviet Union and the gradual realization  by the U.S. that Islam can not be defeated by Israeli  conspiracies and lies.    It is for the people of Palestine to draw their own  conclusions from this latest Zionist atrocity. But logic,  common sense, and the past behavior of Zionists tell us that the  Israelis, despite their peaceful utterances, have no desire for  peace.</p>

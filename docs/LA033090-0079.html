			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIOCESE SAYS NUNS SOLD CONVENT AND BOUGHT CARS, RACEHORSES  </P> <P> Twin tales of mercenary nuns, involving racehorses, luxury cars and pink  bathrooms, were described Thursday by a Roman Catholic Church spokesman as  "something right out of 'Dallas' or 'Dynasty.' "  </P> <P> The Bruges Diocese was rocked this month by two bizarre episodes: The  conversion of a convent into a luxury hotel by a defrocked nun and the sale of  another convent by eight nuns who fled in a limousine to the south of France.  </P> <P> "It's like a TV show," said a diocese spokesman, "something right out of  'Dallas' or 'Dynasty.' "  </P> <P> One episode involves eight members of the Order of the Poor Clares, aged 62 to  93, who sold their convent in Bruges -- without the Pope's permission -- for  $1.4 million.  </P> <P> They promptly bought a castle in the French Pyrenees, a farm, 11 racehorses and  six luxury cars.  </P> <P> Authorities this week charged a former financial adviser to the nuns, Ronny  Crab, 35, with swindling the sisters through abuse of trust to gain control of  their financial affairs.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, about 20 miles from Bruges, a former nun is converting part of the  Arme Klaren convent in Nieuwpoort into a hotel, complete with pink bathrooms.  </P> <P> Maria Logghe, 49, was dismissed by the bishop two years ago for a lifestyle  "not in accordance with the church," including fancy clothes and a penchant for  smoking cigars and driving fast cars.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BETTING THE SYSTEMS;  </P> <P> CRAZY ANNIE IS NUTS FOR THE HANDICAPPERS  </P> <P> Her friends at Santa Anita Park call her "Crazy Annie" because she looks as if  she were more suited for the homeless colony in downtown Los Angeles than for  the Club House, where she always sits in the same reserved seat every day of  the race season.  </P> <P> Crazy Annie has long, stringy, gray hair that she never combs, walks with a  cane, which she sometimes uses as a threat to people who get in her path on the  way to the betting windows, talks loudly to herself and afterward glares at  certain people around her as if they had said something reprehensible. She  wears the same black dress every day and old, torn tennis shoes and carries  whatever belongings she has, including her money, in a shopping bag.  </P> <P> What intrigues her friends is that she has the funds to bet every race, day in  and day out through the season. Actually, although Crazy Annie doesn't look it,  she is a wealthy woman.  </P> <P> In her youth, she was a part-time actress, married a businessman who piled up a  fortune in real estate and office buildings along Wilshire Boulevard, and she  received a huge settlement after a divorce.  </P> <P> Crazy Annie isn't as crazy as she seems. Since she isn't a handicapper and has  no patience with the Racing Form, she assumes that someone else should pick the  horses for her. And that someone, she reasons, should be the handicapper who is  getting paid for making such selections in her local newspaper.  </P> <P> Before the Herald-Examiner folded, she had been following Bob Mieszerski. When  Mieszerski moved to the Los Angeles Times, she continued to follow his  selections, betting $5 to win a race, no matter what the odds were on the  horse.  </P> <P> On March 14, 1990, Crazy Annie's nag, Highland Mint, came in third in the first  race. Hollywood Reporter ran out of the money in the second and Maid O Gold  lost the third.  </P> <P> Then came a streak of four consecutive winners. In the fourth race, Mieszerski  chose Business Prospect, which turned out to be the favorite at $1.60 to $1.  </P> <P> Business Prospect broke from the No. 11 post position and raced into second  place behind the leader. The nag then charged to the front by two lengths at  the quarter-pole. At the finish, Business Prospect won by six lengths. Crazy  Annie picked up $13 for her $5 bet.  </P> <P> In the fifth race, about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf for 3-year-old fillies, the  lineup and odds to $1 was as follows:  </P> <P> 1. Nu Myoozik, 35.90  </P> <P> 2. Icy Folly, 18.30  </P> <P> 3. Phil's Illusion, 17.70  </P> <P> 4. Effusive Bounty, 11.50  </P> <P> 5. Nijinsky's Lover, 4.30  </P> <P> 6. Somethingmerry, 7.40  </P> <P> 7. Saros Treasure, 16.30  </P> <P> 8. Forest Fealty, 4.40  </P> <P> 9. I Canon I Will, 35.20  </P> <P> 10. Wakia, 10.60  </P> <P> 11. Brought To Mind, 2.20  </P> <P> The favorite in the race was Brought To Mind, but Mieszerski's choice was  Somethingmerry at $7.40 to $1. At the start, Somethingmerry tucked into fifth  and continued in that spot until the stretch, when it moved up to fourth. Then  Somethingmerry shifted into high gear and made a big rush down the stretch to  win by two lengths and pay $42 for $5.  </P> <P> In the sixth race, six furlongs for 3-year-old maidens, Crazy Annie bet on  Itsthefax, which went off the favorite in the race at $1.30 to $1. Itsthefax  started out in the outside post position of a 12-horse field but immediately  took the lead as the gate opened. At the quarter-pole the nag was running  easily 1 1/2 lengths in front. It ended up a winner by five lengths, going  wire-to-wire and paying $11.50 for $5.  </P> <P> The seventh race saw another favorite win for Crazy Annie. Kimo's Kid,  Mieszerski's best bet of the day, was entered in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance  sprint for 4-year-olds and up. Kimo's Kid was first by a head at the  quarter-pole, increased its lead to 1 1/2 lengths by the stretch, then tired  but held on to win by a head. It paid $13 for a $5 wager.  </P> <P> In the eighth race, Crazy Annie ended up third with Devil's Orchid and ran out  of the money in the ninth with Free Living.  </P> <P> For the day, Crazy Annie had invested $45 for the nine races. Returns amounted  to $79.50, and her profit turned out to be a nifty $34.50.  </P> <P> The next day, March 15, also was a winning day for Crazy Annie, inasmuch as  Mieszerski repeated with four winners. Rash Decision, running in the second  race with 3-year-old fillies at 1 1/16 miles, took the lead at the quarter-pole  by a head. It faded back to second until the stretch, where it made another  move and took over the No. 1 position by 2 1/2 lengths. At the finish, Rash  Decision won by 1 1/4 lengths. Backers received $17 for every $5 bet.  </P> <P> The favorite, My Niriko, and Mieszerski's best bet of the day, won the fourth  race to pay $13 for a $5 wager. Paisano Pete won the fifth with a $17.50 payoff  and It's All Relative, a heavy favorite, paid $8.50.  </P> <P> For the day, Crazy Annie again had wagered $45. Although the day was  profitable, returns amounted only to $56, for an $11 profit.  </P> <P> What Crazy Annie may tell her cronies is that handicappers generally win or  lose in streaks.  </P> <P> She has discovered with her system that most handicappers average about 28%  winners. "When they're hot, they're good," she says, "but when they're cold,  they're awful."  </P> <P> No one has to strictly follow a handicapper. To cut down on losses, the player  can skip maiden and 2-year-old races.  </P> <P> Even when using the picks made by professional handicappers, there is no way to  guarantee that a horse that may have won in the past will do so again in the  future, no matter how many races it runs. However, a nag that has recorded many  wins and has won a lot of money for its owner is more of a sound investment  than is the occasional winner.  </P></p>

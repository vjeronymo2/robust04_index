			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Privileges Granted"] </F>   [Text] Baku -- President Geydar Aliyev has signed an edict  on the liberalization of foreign trade on the territory of the  Republic of Azerbaijan.    Henceforth, all restrictions on the export of strategic and  nonstrategic output by all legal entities observing the law and  customs and banking procedures are being removed. This will  primarily make it possible to attract currency from abroad and  speed up the formation of the republic's currency fund, so  experts believe.    Obviously, this is not a question of total license, because  a  special commission will be strictly observing exports.    A reliable customs barrier has also been placed in the way  of  excesses: It is only possible to export output when its value  is paid for in hard currency or the relevant banking letter of  credit provided. The practice of holding of commodity exchanges  is being introduced -- these will determine the value of output  destined for export. The role of the national currency -- the  manat -- is also being strengthened. The exchange rate of the  manat will be established at currency auctions, which is  reviving hopes of its convertibility.    At the same time as the long-awaited edict, the Azerbaijani  Ministry of the Economy has also published forecasts for foreign  trade activity for 1994. The commodity turnover will increase  by almost $297 million and will constitute $727 million by the  end of the year. Barter deals will have to be given up. Like  in previous years, exports are mainly made up of oil and oil  products (up to 40 percent) and raw cotton (up to 28 percent),  as well as machine-building, metallurgical, and petrochemical  output. Currency receipts are also expected from the export of  caviar.    Iran and Turkey occupy a priority position in Azerbaijan's  foreign economic activity. These countries also account for the  largest volumes of food product purchases.</p>

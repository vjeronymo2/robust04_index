			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The other side of the ledger - Computing A RECENT survey found that 52 per cent of purchasers bought their new computer to do the accounts, principally the sales and purchase ledger. But readers wanting to put their accounts on to computer should be aware that a new generation of sales and purchase ledger packages is in the pipeline. Traditionally, these two ledgers are used for credit control. A sales ledger will record your credit sales invoices and group them in customer order. The credit controller can then simply look up the customer's 'account' on the screen to see which invoices are overdue for payment and need chasing. When a cheque is received from the customer, the computer matches it to an invoice or group of invoices, clearing them from the ledger and keeping an accurate record of paid and unpaid invoices for this customer. The purchase ledger does the same thing with purchase invoices from suppliers. Credit control is largely the province of the accounts department. However, those sales and purchase invoices also contain information vital for your sales and purchasing staff. For example, suppose you issue sales invoice 999 on March 25 1992 to customer XYZ Caterers, as follows: 'Spoon, serial no 123: Pounds 25 Knife, serial no 456: Pounds 35 Food mixer, serial no 789: Pounds 40 VAT at 17.5 per cent: Pounds 17.50' When recording this invoice, a typical sales ledger package will ask you to allocate the value of each of the four invoice lines to an account in the nominal ledger. This 'analysis to the nominal' helps the accountant produce his month-end accounts. Otherwise the four individual detail lines are ignored, and it will post a summary of the invoice to XYZ Catering's account, perhaps as follows: '25/03/92 999 sale at Pounds 117.50.' This summary is all the credit control staff need to know. But while the serial number of the food mixer may be of no interest to them, it may be important to the service department. And all the detail is interesting to the sales staff. A year later they might look at this customer and decide it is about time they tried to persuade him to upgrade his food mixer or to add a fork to his knife and spoon. Your sales invoices are the source documents for everything you have ever sold. The new-type sales ledger invites you to enter the sales invoice line by line, not just in summary. The aim is to capture that sales information at the invoice entry stage, and to catch it in the greatest possible detail, thereby enabling you to build up a sales history database which you can retain on file for as long as you like - years if necessary. I have seen one or two systems which retain this detailed information. You can call up a customer sales history and at the touch of a button see the sales invoices not just in summary form, but broken down into an item by item history of everything you have sold this customer in the last two years. Instead of the computer telling you about your customers merely as debtors, it now tells you everything about them as customers. This applies equally to purchases and the purchase ledger. As you enter a supplier's invoice for 20 of Item X, the computer can automatically look up the last price at which you bought Item X and display it, enabling you to confirm that the price on the invoice is correct. It is only within the last year or two that unlimited disk storage has made these sales and purchase histories feasible. Perhaps the best example of the new ledgers is Business Manager, released by Pegasus last September. It costs only Pounds 299. Anyone who has their accounts on computer should consider buying it just to see the future of business software. Until now sales and purchase ledgers have been simple, humdrum affairs run by the accounts department, but once the sales and purchasing people realise what the new ledgers can do, they are not going to stay that way for long. Accounts packages are much too important to be left to the accounts staff. Pegasus Business Manager, Pounds 299, is available from Pegasus Budget Software, 0536-415522. It requires a 286 PC with 1 megabyte of memory. David Carter is a consultant in information systems for small businesses tel: 0727-812447</p>

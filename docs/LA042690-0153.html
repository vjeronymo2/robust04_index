			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLITICIANS CUT IN ON CAREFREE DANCERS;  </P> <P> PROTEST: LANCASTER SENIORS REFUSE TO LET CANDIDATES STEAL THE SHOW AND PREEMPT  THEIR WEEKLY DANCE.  </P> <P> The members of the Carefree Dance Club in Lancaster meet to do the most genteel  of dances -- the waltz, fox trot and an occasional cha-cha. Their manner is  refined, too.  </P> <P> At a regular Thursday night dance sponsored by the club at the Antelope Valley  Senior Center, most of the men wore ties, and most of the carefully coiffured  women wore dresses or skirts. When a man asked a woman to dance, he politely  approached and offered his hand.  </P> <P> They were all, in accordance with club rules, above the age of 50 -- but most  were retired people in their 70s or 80s.  </P> <P> But their refinement and retirement didn't mean they were harmless. Los Angeles  County officials found this out the hard way last month when they asked members  of the club to give up just one night of dancing.  </P> <P> The officials had planned to use the senior center -- which is owned by the  county and used by the dance club free -- on a Thursday night for a candidates'  forum. Fifteen local politicians running for office were to be on hand to give  short speeches and answer questions from anyone who might like to attend. The  dance would be preempted.  </P> <P> "We had followed county policies, and we really didn't anticipate any  problems," said Nina Frazier, director of the center. "It was for only one  night."  </P> <P> Frazier might as well have told the dancers they would have to skip a week's  Social Security.  </P> <P> "They said it was only one night," said an irate Tina Naylor, 64, who lives in  a seniors' housing complex near the center. "But when you reach our age, you  never know. We might not make it another night."  </P> <P> When candidates arrived for the forum, they found more than 100 members of the  club in front of the senior center, with picket signs held high. The signs  carried messages such as "Unfair to Seniors," "Please Let Us Dance" and most  distressing to politicians, "Cross This Picket Line, Lose My Vote."  </P> <P> Only seven of the 15 candidates scheduled for the forum entered the building,  and only about 40 spectators ventured in to hear them.  </P> <P> "We had 'em outnumbered," said a jubilant Claude Bills, 71, a retired golf pro  who is the president of the club.  </P> <P> The club pretty much got the results it wanted, although Frazier has not  apologized, as club members demanded.  </P> <P> "If there is any way around it, I would not schedule anything for that night,"  Frazier said in a telephone interview. She had found records that traced the  club's association with the center back 11 years. "They had not had their night  preempted for 11 years. Chances are it won't happen for at least another 11  years."  </P> <P> Club members admit that their protest came about largely because they felt they  were being unfairly pushed around. But it is also true that dancing is an  important part of their lives.  </P> <P> "I've danced all my life," said Noni Carver, a trim, spirited woman of 83, at a  recent Thursday night Carefree dance. She was taking a rare break from the  dance floor, where almost 50 couples were cutting it up to "Sweet Georgia  Brown."  </P> <P> At one end of the hall, on a stage, the Crescendos, a five-piece ensemble,  played the music.  </P> <P> "This is our fun," Carver said defiantly. "What are we supposed to do, sit  around at home?"  </P> <P> There were folding chairs on the perimeter of the wooden dance floor, but only  a few of the seniors spent much time in them. They were there to dance.  </P> <P> "I've got a special style that the ladies like," said John Milbourne, 76, with  a sly smile. He was standing on the edge of the dance floor, between numbers,  holding his wife's hand.  </P> <P> Milbourne retired after working 27 years at nearby Edwards Air Force Base.  </P> <P> "I balance the mass weight here and then shift the mass over so it bounces back  and forth," he said, demonstrating his style. "Then you have to pay attention  to the trajectory, so you can just glide through the crowd."  </P> <P> For many, it's a welcome social evening.  </P> <P> "You have to understand that up here there isn't much to do," said Ruth Penn,  73. "The wife wanted this because it gave her new friends," said her husband,  Herb, 77, a retired manufacturing engineer from Lockheed.  </P> <P> It's also an important social evening for Chester Wolowicz, 76, a former  research scientist for NASA, even though he doesn't dance. He had a major  stroke nine years ago and manages to walk with a cane, but only with great  difficulty.  </P> <P> "I was on the picket line," he said, "in a wheelchair. My wife made a sign for  me." The sign said, "I come to hear the music."  </P> <P> His wife, Eve, 71, joined him after finishing a dance. She said that her  husband's stroke was so devastating that at the time, doctors suggested he be  put in a nursing home. But she brought him back to their own home, determined  that their lives would include many of the things they enjoyed before his  illness. High on her list was going to the Carefree dances.  </P> <P> "There are not too many places I can take him," she said. "You go to a  restaurant, and you are never sure about access, and it's hard for me to lift  him now. But here we can park right by the door, and I know there will be no  problem."  </P> <P> A social evening becomes even more important when a spouse is gone.  </P> <P> "When my wife died three years ago after 39 years of marriage," said Lou Abber,  69, "I was just feeling sorry for myself. And then I finally got myself up and  got out to dance."  </P> <P> He paused to dab the sweat worked up from dancing to a spirited rendition of  the Jim Croce song "Leroy Brown."  </P> <P> "The first time, I was like a kid going to his first prom," he said.  </P> <P> Romance is undeniably a possibility under the dimmed lights of the dance hall.  Indeed, several couples met here.  </P> <P> "I had lost my first husband, so I had to have something to do," said Marion  Grace Gardner, 59, who was collecting admittance fees at the door.  </P> <P> The charge is $2 on nights when the club has a live band and 50 cents when it's  just recorded music.  </P> <P> "I was sitting there waiting for someone to ask me to dance and he did,"  Gardner continued, pointing to Chuck Gardner sitting beside her and beaming. "I  stepped all over his toes."  </P> <P> "Heavens, I didn't even notice," said Chuck, 70, with a hearty laugh. They were  married three years later.  </P> <P> When Marion gets invited to dance, Chuck watches over the cash box. He doesn't  dance much anymore because he has cancer, and it has slowed him down.  </P> <P> Abber came back to his chair after another dance to finish his story about his  first night here.  </P> <P> "I was so nervous," he said. "I didn't know how it worked anymore. But you know  what? The women, they asked me to dance!"  </P> <P> There was a bit more of his story to tell, but Abber was getting fidgety and  seemed distracted. Suddenly he rose to his feet.  </P> <P> "I just got to go," he said apologetically. "I've got to get in the last  dance."  </P> <P> He quickly stepped over to where Mary Halsey, 63, was sitting, took her hand  and they moved out on to the dance floor.  </P> <P> The band was playing "I'll See You in My Dreams."  </P></p>

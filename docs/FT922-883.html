			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK wins EC working hours deal THE UK last night reached a compromise with its EC partners on European Community limits to working time which it had previously said it could never accept. But final agreement was held up by a Franco-German dispute over the number of months during which the proposed 48-hour limit on the working week should be averaged. The compromise came at a meeting in Luxembourg of ministers responsible for working conditions. Under the compromise, Britain secured a partial opt-out on introducing the 48-hour maximum working week. It would get a 10-year grace period, while the other 11 EC member states must introduce the measure within three years. In Britain's case, the EC council of ministers would 'review' the situation after its additional seven-year grace period, leaving open the question of whether the UK adopts it even at that stage. But Britain would for the first time have to provide legal protection for workers who do not want to work more than 48 hours and to bring in legislation on mandatory time off. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK employment secretary, said: 'In a word, we've won. I had to make on concessions whatsoever.' She said that legislation the UK would have to enact to conform with the planned EC directive was still 'a long way off' and that Britain had 'slashed the costs' of introducing it. Despite her claim of victory, Mrs Shepard added: 'We have not ruled out. . . the possibility of legal challenge' to the directive. The UK insists the EC measure should not have been tabled under health and safety regulations, which allow majority voting and override national vetoes. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour opposition's employment spokesman, said 'the British government has been forced to concede much on the working-time directive that will benefit British employees'. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary hailed 'a major step forward for the UK and a major climbdown by the government'. The compromise followed negotiations on Tuesday between Mrs Shephard and Ms Martine Aubry, the French labour minister. Although a deal was not finalised, this did not overshadow member states' efforts to demonstrate unity in the face of current uncertainty over the Maastricht treaty on the eve of tomorrow's EC summit in Lisbon. Final passage of the EC directive will now be stewarded by the UK presidency of the Community, which begins next week. Ms Vasso Papandreou, the EC social affairs commissioner, said how the UK handled the issue 'will be a test of the British presidency and whether it acts impartially'.

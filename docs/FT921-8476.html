			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / BR wheels in new promotion scheme promotion on seniority alone - will disappear from British industry at the end of next month. Rail commuters may not immediately notice the difference but from March 29 nearly 30,000 British Rail station staff will be promoted on merit rather than length of service. Although the Buggins principle seems quaintly old-fashioned in the era of performance-related pay it was considered a step forward by the rail unions when they forced the private railway companies to concede the principle in the early 1900s. Mr Lawrie Harries of the transport union RMT said: 'In those days there was a lot of nepotism and favouritism on the railways with managers picking their blue-eyed boys regardless of merit.' The union says it is no longer opposed to the principle of suitability as opposed to seniority in selecting job candidates and has already conceded the point for most other rail workers. But some reservations remain about giving management complete discretion. The introduction of an unpopular system of promotion assessment was one of the causes of the 1989 London Underground strike, led by RMT. Also, the union argues that because of the non-transferability of many rail skills, such as train driving, long-serving staff should be compensated for their limited options outside the rail industry by preference for promotion within it. The union-favoured compromise, which already applies to train drivers and will probably now apply to station staff, is that seniority should determine the order of applicants for promotion even if suitability will remain the final test of whether someone gets the job. RMT will today present a claim to BR for a substantial increase in pay and a reduction in hours to 35 a week. Average earnings for hourly paid rail workers are pounds 266 a week but that includes a large amount of overtime. The national average of hours worked each week is 52.

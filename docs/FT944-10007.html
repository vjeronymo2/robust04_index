			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Political waves alter sentiment - London / Utilities are in the firing line British investors have become inured this autumn to having their hopes for equities dampened by regular waves of pessimism from the US over further interest rate rises. It came as an unusual diversion, therefore, for London to be swept up in a tide of euphoria from Wall Street. No matter that US traders' exultation over the rout suffered by the Democrats on Tuesday quickly gave way to second thoughts about the implications of legislative stalemate: a surge in strength by the dollar helped inspire international bond and equity markets. The transatlantic stimulus was sufficient to lift the FT-SE 100 by 35.8 points on Wednesday - reversing the market's 31.8 point fall on Monday, when traders had continued to fret about the interest rate outlook amid very thin trading. The market marked time on Tuesday and Thursday, but fell again on Friday as traders once more focused on the increasing likelihood that US interest rates would rise by at least half a percentage point next week. Another douche of cold water for the UK market came from Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who said that a future Labour government would impose a one-off tax on the 'excessive profits' of the privatised utility companies. This threat depressed the share prices of the water companies, even although Northumbrian Water Group took the lead in the industry's dividend bonanza with a record 16 per cent increase. The announcement by Northumbrian, smallest of the privatised companies, followed better than expected pay-outs from Thames and Anglian, which increased dividends by 11 and 10 per cent. Brown also proposed imposing a windfall tax on the Pounds 3.5bn that will accrue to the regional electricity companies with the coming flotation of the National Grid. Scottish Power kicked off what is likely to be a politically contentious interim results season by the regional electricity companies, lifting its dividend 10.2 per cent. One analyst said the reaction of shares to Brown's speech 'serves to remind investors of the political risks attached to utility stocks'. Not all privatised industries reported record results, though. Shares in British Telecommunications slipped after the group said its interim profits had been held back by the cost of cutting prices and jobs. The group took redundancy charges of Pounds 151m and said staff numbers were now 151,600 - a 4,400 reduction on the start of the year and on track for a reduction of 15,000 in the full year. BT has reduced prices 11 times this year under the conditions of its pricing formula and has already returned about Pounds 1bn to customers in the form of price cuts, with a further Pounds 400m to be shaved in the present year. These price cuts have increased pressure on its competitor, Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of the telecommunications group Cable &amp; Wireless. The group said overall profits were up but announced a substantial cost and head-count reduction programme which, analysts suggested, could cut up to 2,000 of Mercury's 11,400 jobs. BT and Mercury are feeling these cost pressures in spite of vigorous growth in the wider economy. The Central Statistical Office said industrial production grew unexpectedly fast in the three months to September, and upgraded its estimate of the present annual trend rate of growth for production industry output to 6 per cent. Increasing economic activity meant that BAA, the privatised airports group, saw a 7 per cent increase in airline passenger traffic. But the group's shares fell nearly 5 per cent after disappointment that the growth in retail spending by passengers had been held back by building work at Heathrow. British Airways managed to increase its interim pre-tax profits by 45 per cent and said it was reaping the rewards of cost controls and a campaign to win business travellers. In spite of flagging a possible write-down of its Dollars 400m investment in the troubled USAir, BA said the outlook for the full year was encouraging. Another blue-chip stock to benefit from economic recovery was Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing chain, which reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. Already established as the UK's most profitable retailer, M&amp;S has lifted sales in continental Europe by 20 per cent since exporting its Outstanding Value campaign from the UK. These were impressive results, but investors were cautioned not to get carried away by the retailing sector's potential. The stores team at Flemings cited the importance to retailers of the coming pre-Christmas rush (see chart below). They said the sector seemed to be influenced by this and it often outperformed the market pre-Christmas. It almost always under-performed between early December and the end of February. Flemings said: 'We think the most likely explanation for this effect is that investors tend to react positively to seeing the stores busy in the run-up to Christmas, but do not have the quantitative input to provide the necessary balance (if the queues at the till are five-deep this year, were they four-deep or six-deep last year?) Quantitative measurement comes after Christmas with company statements indicating how good or bad trading was during the peak period. Rarely, it seems, are expectations exceeded]' Finally, business came under fire from Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who berated executives for not investing enough and expecting too great and quick a return. He was addressing the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry whose president acknowledged there was a case for companies re-examining their rates of return.</p>

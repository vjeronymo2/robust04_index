			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shake-up planned at Woolworth WOOLWORTH, the large US retail group whose interests range from general merchandise stores to speciality chains, yesterday announced a major operational overhaul. This will involve the sale or redeployment of 900 poorly-performing stores, eliminate 10,000 jobs over the next 12 to 18 months, and produce a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 250m. Woolworth's announcement is the latest in a series of upheavals in the beleaguered US retail sector. Earlier this week, Sears Roebuck announced plans to cut almost 7,000 jobs through improved customer service facilities. Seaman's, the east coast furniture retailer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shortly after Christmas. Certain creditors at Zale are also attempting to put the largest US jewellery retailer into bankruptcy. Mr Harold Sells, Woolworth's chairman, claimed that the move would 'focus resources on (the company's) strongest store formats and locations', and help it meet financial objectives. In the first nine months of 1991, Woolworth saw a 55 per cent drop in net profits, to Dollars 75m. Woolworth shares, however, greeted yesterday's announcement with a fall of Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 27. Woolworth said the shake-up would involve discontinuing two speciality store formats - Susie's/Sportelle womenswear boutiques, with 207 stores, and Richman Brothers/Anderson-Little clothing chains, with 268 outlets and three manufacturing plants. The Susie's/Sportelle locations will generally be redeployed, while Woolworth said it was investigating the possibility of selling Richman-Anderson-Little. Five other chains within the Woolworth group are being pruned: the Kids Mart/Little Folk childrenswear chains by 15 per cent, the Kinney shoe shops by 25 per cent, and the Woolworth/Woolworth Express general merchandise stores by eight per cent. During the first nine months of 1991, stores involved in the overhaul had sales of around Dollars 342m, and an operating loss of Dollars 50m. Total operating profits for all US stores during this period were Dollars 168m. Woolworth Corporation currently operates around 6,500 stores in the US, of which about 5,500 are speciality stores. It has around 9,300 outlets worldwide. The overhaul affects around 4,700 full-time jobs and 5,300 part-time employees. Woolworth said staff in the specialty chains which are not sold 'may be offered other jobs within the company'. The group's total US staff comprises 38,000 full-time employees and 32,000 part-timers. The retail group also announced a variety of management changes at senior executive level yesterday.</p>

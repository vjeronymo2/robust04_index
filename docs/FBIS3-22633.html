In Rio de Janeiro County the death rate from  meningitis is also subject to debate. According to National  Meningitis Commission [CNM] Chairwoman Marilia Bulhoes, the  death rate is declining. Meanwhile, Municipal Health Secretary  Ronaldo Gazolla and Keyla Marzochi, head of the biological  sciences department of the National Public Health School  sponsored by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, claim that the death  rate from meningitis is high and worrisome.    Approximately 5 million doses of expired anti-meningitis  vaccine still are being kept in cold storage at the Athaualpa de  Paiva Foundation facilities in a Rio de Janeiro suburb. The  Cuban Government promised to replace the lot free of charge as  soon as news about the loss worth some $50 million hit the press.    The CNM chairwoman advised Health Minister Henrique Santillo  against importing the vaccine on the grounds that it does not  protect children younger than four, the age bracket most  vulnerable to meningitis. The champions of the Cuban vaccine  argue that despite the fact that it does not offer total  protection, the Cuban vaccine is the only one that has been  tested in Brazil with an average success rate of 70 percent.    The matter is far from closed. On 8 February, the CNM will  meet in Brasilia once more. Meanwhile, the United States is  testing a similar vaccine in Chile that could become available  on the market very soon.    According to Bulhoes, the CNM chose not to use the Cuban  vaccine after the Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo conducted  studies that showed a significant increase in antibodies,  meaning immunity, in only 22 percent of the children ages 23  months or less, in 45 percent of the children between 24 and 47  months, and in 42 percent of children between 48 and 53 months.  When used in Amapa State, the same vaccine increased the  immunity of only 12 percent of the children who had been  vaccinated. Health expert Keyla Marzochi claims that studies  showed that the vaccine was effective in "at least" 70 percent  of the children four years and older in Sao Paulo and Rio de  Janeiro.    Marzochi reported that in Rio de Janeiro County the  vaccine's  average rate of success for children between six months and nine  years was 74 percent, while for those four years or older the  rate of success was 82 percent. Marzochi stated that the Adolfo  Lutz Institute conducted laboratory rather than epidemiological  studies. Laboratory testing uses significantly smaller samples.    Marzochi argued: "Bearing in mind that the World Health  Organization (WHO) recommends a vaccine against leishmaniasis, a  nonfatal disease, whose rate of success is only 50 percent, why  shouldn't we use a vaccine that gives protection to an average  of 70 percent of those who have been vaccinated?"    The first lot of 5 million doses of Cuban vaccine against  B-type meningitis were purchased at $10 per dose on instructions  from former Health Minister Alceni Guerra, on the advice of  then-Health Ministry Secretary General Augusto Farias, the  brother of Paulo Cesar Farias. In 1990 and 1991, the death rate  from meningitis stood at 15 percent of those who caught the  disease; in 1992 it climbed to 19 percent, and in 1993 it  reached 23 percent.    Rio de Janeiro Municipal Health Secretary Ronaldo Gazzola  spoke in favor of using the vaccine in Rio de Janeiro and  pointed out that the main concern that prompted him to suggest  to Health Minister Santillo to import the Cuban vaccine was the  upswing in the death rate. Marozchi feels that just replacing  the Cuban vaccine would not be enough. "The best thing for  Brazil would be for the deal to include an agreement on the  transfer of technology so the vaccine could be produced in  Brazil."</p>

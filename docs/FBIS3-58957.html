			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor of the </F> exchequer: "The Tories Lied About Taxation"]    [Text] As April approaches, not only are taxes going up,  but all trust in a Conservative Government on matters of  taxation has broken down. As the typical family prepares to pay  an extra 10 pounds a week, rising to 16 pounds next year, the  full extent of the Tory tax deceit is becoming apparent. The  typical British family is now paying more of its income in tax  than in 1979. By focusing attention on the headline rate of  income tax, Mr Major and his ministers thought they could get  away with freezing tax allowances, lowering tax thresholds and  cutting mortgage tax relief. They even thought that they could  obscure the doubling of VAT [value-added tax] since 1979 and a  50 per cent rise in National Insurance. The attempt has failed.  The facts are out.    The Conservatives will never be trusted on tax again. In  1988, George Bush famously called on American electors to "Read  my lips: No new taxes." Taxes rose once and he was never  trusted again. In 1992, John Major told people to read his  manifesto commitment not to increase tax. Now taxes are set to  rise--not just once, but in 20 separate ways over the next two  years. Mr Major will never be trusted again.    Both the tax rises themselves and the sense of betrayal will  get worse. When Labour left office, 34.75 per cent of national  income was taken in tax. This year, tax will take 35.5 per  cent, rising to 37 per cent next year, 37.5 the year after and  38.5 per cent by 1998. Never again can the Tories claim to be  the low tax party, or that they have an "instinct" for low  taxation, when they have had to admit that in every year until  the brink of the next century, taxation will take more and more  of national income.    Almost all of us are now paying for the Government's  mistakes. Families on half average income have seen an increase  in the share of this taken in tax, and so have families whose  income is twice the average. Even families which have benefited  from cuts in top rate income tax--those on four times average  income, nearly 80,000 pounds a year--will be paying more than  they did in 1979.    The only beneficiaries of Conservative tax policies have  been  a tiny minority very close to the Tory party. The top I per  cent, earning more than 120,000 pounds a year, received 30 per  cent of the tax cuts in the big handout of 1988. Only a  fraction of that is being taken back. It is still possible for  someone earning 1 million pounds a year to pay virtually no tax  at all. But because this tiny minority pays less, the rest of  us have to do more.    Yet Tory tax-cutting promises were not incidental  commitments, the accidental result of casual remarks in the heat  of the election campaign. The tax promises were the centrepiece  of the Tories' political strategy and their attack on Labour.  They were the cornerstone of Mr Major's attempt to secure  re-election, and they are at the heart of the question of  integrity in politics.    In 1992, Mr Major promised that "we have no plans and no  need  to extend the scope of VAT." He now claims his statements were  to be taken as aspirations, rather than undertakings. Yet the  evidence is against him. For he also categorically stated  "there will be no VAT increase." His party even issued a  special campaign briefing which said that "following a series of  unfounded and irresponsible scares by the Labour Party, the  Prime Minister has confirmed that the Government has no  intention of raising VAT further."    The promises given on national insurance and income tax  were,  if anything, even more explicit. The Tory party chairman called  national insurance rises "a backdoor stealth tax," while Michael  Portillo said that "higher tax and national insurance would hit  those who work harder and do overtime."    It was not only that Mr Major promised not to raise income  tax. He went far further. He promised that he would cut it  "year on year."    The Government now claims that circumstances changed. But  when Norman Lamont was asked at the election whether he would  increase taxes, he replied: "We will not have to increase taxes.  I cannot see any circumstances in which that will be necessary."    What annoys people is a Conservative Government making  promises one year and refusing even to acknowledge breaking them  the next. The Prime Minister's "back to basics,'" if it were to  mean anything, should mean telling the truth, and there can be  little sympathy for a Government that simply refuses to do what  it asks of the rest of the public: to be honest in its  promises, to face up to the consequences of its commitments and  to understand the difference between right and wrong.    Tax is the cash nexus between people and government. Trust  is therefore essential. The Tory deception is therefore  betrayal of a central trust.    A new confidence needs to be established between people and  government on tax, a confidence the Conservatives are incapable  of achieving. The Labour party has made it clear that it will  not tax for taxation's sake. There will be no sleight of hand.  By linking the benefits that people receive to the taxes they  are charged, we will show what they are getting for what they  are paying. And Labour--unlike the Tories on VAT--will be fair  in its approach.    Honest disclosure, full consultation, open debate and full  accountability for how money is spent are the means to  reestablish trust between government and electorate. Only  Labour can do that now.</p>

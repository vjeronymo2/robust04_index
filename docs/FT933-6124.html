			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Small-business optimism higher than on Continent SMALLER companies in Britain are more confident of economic recovery than their counterparts in the rest of Europe, a survey has found. The survey by 3i, the investment capital group, and Cranfield School of Management found that while fewer Spanish and German companies expect a decline in profitability over the next six months, French and Italian businesses have become more pessimistic since the last survey six months ago. The different views are reflected in investment plans over the next six months. UK companies plan to spend more on training, marketing, and research and development. In France, by contrast, budgets are falling in these areas and a majority of companies expect to cut their training programmes. Professor Paul Burn of the Cranfield School of Management said: 'UK companies are anticipating recovery and are doing things that will contribute to it.' But he warned against complacency, pointing to differences in expectations on prices. French companies expect falling prices and low wage increases while UK companies envisage price rises and Germany has the highest proportion of companies expecting wage rises. A report today from the National Westminster Bank says that growth in the north of the UK will match that in the south over the next few years, thanks to the manufacturing sector. Mr David Kern, NatWest's chief economist, says in a preview of the September issue of the bank's Economic and Financial Outlook: 'Over the period 1994 to 1998, I expect growth to average 2.1 per cent (per year) in the northern and southern UK regions against 2.5 per cent in central Britain.' He expects manufacturing output to grow at an above-average 3.5 per cent and that northern and central Britain will have an above-average share of manufacturing. The share of GDP taken by manufacturing will rise from 19.9 per cent in 1991 to 21.4 per cent in 1998. Mr Kern says: 'The south-east will be relatively subdued - reflecting the continued impact of high indebtedness and some further relocations from the region.'</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS GAIN ON DEFENSE, LOSE ON OFFENSE  </P> <P> The Raiders found one of the missing pieces in the puzzle of their defense . .  . but lost one from their offense Friday, as the signing period for  unrestricted free agents moved into its final hours.  </P> <P> From the Cleveland Browns, they signed Bob Golic, the 31-year-old, three-time  Pro Bowl nose tackle they've been looking for since the departure of Reggie  Kinlaw in 1985.  </P> <P> To the San Diego Chargers, they lost tight end Andy Parker, the starter last  season after Todd Christensen was hurt. The little-known Parker is a better  blocker and was expected to retain the starting job this season even with  Christensen back.  </P> <P> Golic's agent, Ralph Cindrich, confirmed that his client had been "signed,  sealed and delivered," and after a day of inquiries, the Raiders announced it,  too.  </P> <P> The team made no mention of Parker, but he signed a Charger contract Friday.  </P> <P> The Golic story is a big one in Cleveland, where he was born and became a local  star and community leader. An All-American linebacker at Notre Dame, he was a  No. 2 pick of the New England Patriots in 1979 but was waived in 1982.  </P> <P> He was then picked up by the Browns, who converted him to nose tackle.  Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so  quickly.  </P> <P> Said Golic: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant."  </P> <P> And: "I'm 6-3 on Saturday nights, but 6-0 on Sunday nights."  </P> <P> Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the  Raiders, whose rushing defense fell apart last season.  </P> <P> Since waiving Kinlaw, a star of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 Bill  Pickel, a natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse  results. Last season, the Raiders largely abandoned their old base defense for  a four-man line -- at the order of Al Davis, who wanted more pressure.  Meanwhile, other players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it  was the only run defense they knew how to play.  </P> <P> Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in  the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run."  </P> <P> The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the Browns. The new  Raider defensive coordinator, Dave Adolph, comes from Cleveland. The new Brown  head coach, Bud Carson, the former New York Jets' defensive coordinator, plans  to put in a four-man line.  </P> <P> Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him $600,000 and $650,000,  respectively.  </P> <P> His welcome to the Raiders seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider  facility, he stayed at the home of Howie Long.  </P> <P> Parker signed a two-year contract which, with makeable incentives, reportedly  will pay him $400,000 a year, a big increase over the $175,000 he made last  season.  </P> <P> The Chargers, under new Coach Dan Henning, the former Washington Redskins  assistant, are expected to go to a double tight-end alignment, and Parker is  expected to start.  </P> <P> A No. 5 pick from Utah in 1984, the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder played on special  teams until Christensen was hurt last season. Coach Mike Shanahan's preference  for the better blocker led him to Parker, rather than the smaller, faster Trey  Junkin, a better pass receiver. Christensen's listed weight is only 230, and,  despite his years of pass receiving prowess, Shanahan was thought to be leaning  toward keeping Parker No. 1.  </P> <P> The signing period ends today.  </P> <P> The Raiders have added Golic; linebackers Otis Wilson from the Chicago Bears,  Jackie Shipp from the Miami Dolphins and Emanuel King from the Cincinnati  Bengals; offensive lineman Dale Hellestrae of the Buffalo Bills, and  placekicker Jeff Jaeger of the Browns. They were talking with Chicago  cornerback Mike Richardson, who is in the Bears' doghouse, but haven't made a  decision.  </P> <P> The Raiders have lost Parker; linebacker Reggie McKenzie to the Phoenix  Cardinals; kick returner Chris Woods to the Browns; running backs Chris  McLemore to the Seattle Seahawks and Reggie Ware to the Denver Broncos. Only  Parker and McKenzie were on the active roster throughout last season, and only  Parker figured prominently in Raider plans.  </P></p>

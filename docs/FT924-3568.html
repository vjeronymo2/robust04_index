			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK stores Shoppers may not yet be dashing into the stores, but investors have certainly been rushing into some of their shares. Although the sector as a whole has moved comparatively little since Black Wednesday, there has been a striking divergence within the group. The defensive quality core of Marks and Spencer, Boots and GUS - which accounts for more than half the sector's weighting - has just outpaced the market. But the really eye-catching performances have come from some of the smaller, more volatile fry. Excluding the big three, the rest of the stores sector has outperformed the market by almost 40 per cent. It is difficult to believe that this giddy ascent has not been overdone. Although it is still early Christmas days, there appears to be little anecdotal evidence of any great surge in consumer sales other than those induced by Nintendo fiends. Robert Fleming points out that the stores sector has underperformed the market in December and January in 17 of the last 22 years - although it adds the important proviso that the five exceptions have been at times of falling interest rates. Yet even if consumers do indulge in an unusual burst of enthusiasm over Christmas, it may benefit other sectors more than stores. The firmer the evidence of recovery becomes the more likely investors are to chase highly-geared capital goods stocks where volumes and profits should rebound more sharply than in shops.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Setback for Australian merger plan A four-way, ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 950m) merger plan in Australia's grocery wholesaling industry faces problems, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. One of the potential participants - Davids Holdings - has ended discussions and will instead float its shares on the stockmarket early next year. The planned amalgamation had originally involved Foodland Australia, Independent Holdings, Composite Buyers and Davids. It would have consolidated the grocery warehouses into a national group, with an estimated 26 per cent market share. However, approval for the deal from the Trade Practices Commission had yet to be secured.</p>

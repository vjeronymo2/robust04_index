			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shi Lujia (2457 7627 0163)] </F>   [Text] London, 14 Apr (XINHUA) -- The British Parliament's  Foreign Affairs Select Committee issued a report on Sino-British  relations on 13 April, openly supporting the perverse acts of  Hong Kong Governor Patten and the British Government on the Hong  Kong issue.    The committee held eight hearings from July 1993 to February  this year, to prepare the long report which is entitled:  "Sino-British Relations Around 1997." At the hearings, many  people of insight criticized Patten and the British Government's  policy on the Hong Kong issue, called for setting sights on  overall Sino-British relations and for cooperation with China,  and opposed confrontation. However, ignoring the facts, the  report asserts that Patten's constitutional reform package does  not violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the "Basic Law,"  and the agreements reached between Chinese and British foreign  ministers; and holds that Patten was correct in unilaterally  announcing his constitutional reform package in October 1992  without consulting China beforehand. The report states the  committee supports the British Government in continuing to do  things in its own way and in submitting the entire political  reform package to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for  examination. The report says: Given the current deadlock, it  is impossible to win China's cooperation by revising the reform  package. On the contrary, such an act will only draw opposition  from a sizable number of people on the Hong Kong Legislative  Council, impair the Hong Kong Government's prestige, and may  jeopardize Hong Kong's stability and economic order. For this  reason, the committee "supports the foreign secretary in  refusing to strike a deal with China," and says the Hong Kong  governor should submit "as soon as possible" the entire bill to  the legislative council for examination.    Without the least reason, the report blames China for the  slow progress in Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks,  claiming that, if China continues to obstruct the group from  holding further talks, the Hong Kong Government will have no  choice but to submit the necessary legislation to the  legislative council so Hong Kong's laws can be revised and made  regionally-oriented before sovereignty is transferred to China.    Moreover, in the "political and foreign relations" section,  the report suggests relations between the British Parliament and  Taiwan's Legislative Yuan be strengthened; and urges the British  Government to re-examine the status of Taiwan's office in  Britain and to relax restrictions on it. The report also  encourages Britain to discuss the so-called Tibet human rights  issue, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs.    Observers here have pointed out that, at a time when  Sino-British relations are already in a very difficult state  because of Britain's perverse acts over the Hong Kong issue, the  British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report  will inevitably create more adverse effects on relations between  the two countries; therefore, the report should attract people's  attention.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4120.3&hyph;9&blank;Water Rights for the Purpose of Livestock Grazing on Public Lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section was added in response to comments on language pertaining to water rights that was presented in the advance notice. This section would provide consistent direction for the BLM regarding water rights on public lands for livestock watering purposes. Under the proposed rule, any new rights to water on public land for livestock watering on such land would be acquired, perfected, maintained, and administered under State law, and in the name of the United States unless State law prohibits it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would not create any new Federal reserved water rights, nor would it affect valid existing water rights. Any right or claim to water on public land for livestock watering on public land by or on behalf of the United States would remain subject to the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 666 (the McCarran Amendment) and section 701 of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701 note; disclaimer on water rights). Finally, the proposal would not change existing BLM policy on water rights for uses other than public land grazing, such as irrigation, municipal, or industrial uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4120.5&blank;Cooperation in Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would add a new section on cooperation in management to recognize and regulate cooperation with, among others, State, county, Indian tribal, local government entities and Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4120.5&hyph;1&blank;Cooperation With State, County, and Federal Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would recognize existing cooperation with State cattle and sheep boards, county and local noxious weed control districts, and State agencies involved in environmental, conservation, and enforcement roles related to these cooperative relationships. The Taylor Grazing Act, Noxious Weed Control Act, FLPMA, Public Rangeland Improvement Act (43 U.S.C 1901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and other statutes and agreements require cooperation with State, county and local governments, and Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 4130_Authorizing Grazing Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4130.1&blank;Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would make it clear that applications must contain the proposed active grazing use, temporary nonuse, and conservation use. This amendment is proposed to end confusion about the ``failure to use'' provisions of subpart 4170. The inadvertent loss of permitted use or preference due to punitive action in response to failure to make use is easily avoided by applying for nonuse and receiving approval from the authorized officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4130.1&hyph;1&blank;Changes in Grazing Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would provide for field managers to make temporary changes in authorized use, either increases or decreases, not to exceed 25 percent of the authorized use or 100 AUMs, whichever is greater, following consultation with the affected permittees or lessees and the State having land or responsibility for resources management within the allotment. This would provide latitude to the authorized officer for authorizing minor or incidental adjustments in grazing use without extensive consultation, simplifying day-to-day administration. The provision for 25 percent or 100 AUMS, whichever is greater, is intended to specify what constitutes minor or incremental adjustments. The Department proposes the 100 AUM limitation to provide sufficient latitude in cases where minor adjustments, in terms of the total amount of forage, would constitute a large percentage of the permitted use (i.e., small permits or leases). Changes of a temporary nature could be made in a timely manner when the proposed changes conform with the applicable land use plan and standards and guidelines, and are within the terms and conditions of the existing permit or lease. Examples of the types of changes that would be considered under this section are the activation of previously approved temporary nonuse, placing permitted use in temporary nonuse, and the use of forage temporarily available on ephemeral or annual ranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4130.1&hyph;2&blank;Conflicting Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended by adding criteria to be considered in granting a use authorization or permit or lease. The proposed rule would incorporate the history of applicants' and affiliates' compliance with the terms and conditions of Federal and State grazing permits and leases and demonstrated stewardship of the public lands as criteria for granting permits or leases where there is more than one qualified applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4130.2&blank;Grazing Permits or Leases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The permit and lease tenure proposals included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking have not been carried forward. Public comment on the advance notice suggested the permit and lease tenure provisions would result, among other things, in severe limitations on the ability of prospective permittees and lessees to secure financing for the purchase and operation of ranches. Under this proposed rule, permits and leases would continue to be offered for 10-year terms except in specified circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

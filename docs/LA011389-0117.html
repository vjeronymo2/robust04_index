			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> A dash of Man Ray's zany surreal photo manipulations, a pinch of brave new  world technology and a good bit of popular tabloid gimmickry imbue eerie  Polaroid portraits by New Yorker Nancy Burson.  </P> <P> Trained as a painter, Burson became intrigued with translating photographed  portraits into the digitized language of computers, hoping to mathematically  manipulate -- for instance, "age" or recombine -- faces according to pre-set  parameters and programs. Burson and husband collaborator David Kramlick  patented the software to systematically "age" faces, making "People" magazine  with geriatric versions of Lady Di and Brooke Shields and helping the FBI with  "aged" composite photos of missing children.  </P> <P> Well and fine, but was it art? Burson's mid '80s "Composites" established her  among wry political-conceptual photographers such as Cindy Sherman. "Big  Brother," a computer combination of Mao, Hitler, Stalin, Khomeini and  Mussolini, or "Warhead," a hybrid of nuclear power leaders Thatcher, Brezhnev  and Reagan, put a face on abstractions.  </P> <P> In this show Burson's computer scrambling creates invented faces from the  photographed features of two or more portraits of mostly children. She's used  Victorian period death portraits and photos of physically deformed children,  mixed in with the heavily lashed, marble eyes or too perfectly formed porcelain  features of play dolls. Once Burson achieves the computer image she's after,  she shoots black and white Polaroids straight from the monitor. The result is a  macabre collection of innocents, victims and carnival freaks who test the  membrane between real and fictional, tugging at our pathos, curiosity and  repulsion as tangibly as if they lived next door.

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS CLASSES  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "Job Payoff for Teens," Nov. 29:  </P> <P> How can we train kids to get jobs when business teachers are being slowly  eliminated from California schools?  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles city schools, senior high business departments that once  bustled with classes and activities are becoming ghost towns of few people and  few course offerings. Courses in shorthand, business English, accounting,  advanced typing, law, etc. have been discarded year by year. Business education  programs that took years to build are being severely cut back in California  schools.  </P> <P> How do I know? I was a business teacher at Roosevelt High School in East Los  Angeles for the past eight years. I taught brothers and sisters and cousins. I  reached kids, and I gave them job skills to prepare for the outside world.  </P> <P> Today I am a displaced business teacher looking for a job.  </P> <P> MARIANNE FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

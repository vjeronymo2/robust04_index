			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Who Is Opposing the King's National </F> Reconciliation Policy and Further Inflaming the Vietnamese War  of Aggression?"]    [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk has proposed a roundtable  meeting since early 1993, after the injudicious elections  organized by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]  concluded. The aim of this is to reconcile the nation and put  an end to the Vietnamese war of aggression, thereby restoring  peace, independence, national unity, and territorial integrity.    Democratic Kampuchea and the entire Cambodian nation and  people have supported the king's initiative and have undertaken  all kinds of activities to speed up the call for the roundtable  meeting with a view to quickly ending the sufferings of our  nation and people. Nonetheless, the communist Vietnamese puppets  and the two-headed government, abiding by the advice of the  communist Vietnamese and their alliance, have persistently  opposed the king's initiative. At this present time they are  continuing their opposition to the roundtable. They have  impudently said that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge must be  brought about by guns and that the Khmer Rouge should be smashed  to pieces.    [Words indistinct] the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-  headed government were very busy buying armaments, ammunition,  tanks, and cannons for the purpose of launching offensive  attacks on Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people. They  launched an audacious attack on Stoung and Phnum Chhat in August  1993. Afterward, they attacked Anlung Veng and Pailin in the  most brutal and barbarous manner. During their attacks, they  indiscriminately massacred our people. They also plundered and  completely destroyed houses, property, and farms that had taken  our people several years to build in difficult conditions.  Hundreds of thousands of people, with their children, run away  from their houses and villages to escape from the criminal  activities of those bandits. The two-headed government, the  communist Vietnamese, and the alliance, which is their master,  declared that those criminal activities were their great  victories. They claimed they had destroyed the Khmer Rouge at  this or that area and had occupied and captured this or that  Khmer Rouge position, and so on.    The aforementioned events have been given very wide coverage  both nationally and internationally. It is the communist  Vietnamese puppets, the two-headed government, the communist  Vietnamese, and their alliance which have opposed the king's  national reconciliation plan and further inflamed the Vietnamese  war of aggression. At present, our Cambodian people are  denouncing them and jointly attacking them everywhere. This is  to force them to accept the king's five-point national  reconciliation plan.</p>

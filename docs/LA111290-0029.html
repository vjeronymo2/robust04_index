			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> One Small Step: Astronauts, given a crash course in filmmaking, shot  spectacular footage from outer space of live volcanoes, burning rain forests  and severely eroded coastlines for "Blue Planet," a new film about the Earth.  Crews from seven different U.S. space missions worked on the movie, made by  Imax Systems of Toronto, which will be shown on giant screens in museums and  planetariums around the world. Complementing the footage from outer space, a  two-minute computer-simulated sequence makes viewers feel they are taking a  high-speed flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco along the San Andreas  fault.

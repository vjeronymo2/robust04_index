			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / NVQs criticised as 'too narrow' for trainees The government's new occupational training system is not giving trainees the basic skills for their working lives, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said yesterday. It said the national vocational qualifications system was 'not a sensible use of public funding'. The institute criticised the system as too narrow, focusing on competences in particular tasks, and argued that government money would be better spent on 'the development of general, transferable skills in an educational environment'. It also suggested that NVQs were 'inappropriate' for unemployed school-leavers and questioned the independence of their assessment. In a report in its latest quarterly review, published yesterday, the institute says unqualified, unskilled young people with about 40 years of working life ahead of them 'are being trained in a set of narrow competences which will not easily permit either the flexibility or career dev-elopment in later years which the economy and technical progress increasingly demand'. The report follows similar criticisms of the NVQ system last year by Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Manchester, who advises the Department for Education on further education. He said NVQs were 'a disaster of epic proportions' because they were not independently assessed, and trainees were not given necessary theoretical grounding to accompany skills. The study focuses on the impact of NVQs, introduced in 1990, on youth training for the building trades. It is highly critical of NVQ Level 2, which has replaced City and Guild certificates. It says the standards have 'led to a significant reduction in the amount of mathematics taught to young building trainees' compared with the old City and Guild standards and those required by young people on similar courses in France and Germany. It says NVQs in mathematics for bricklaying do not examine conversion of one metric measurement to another, fractions and percentages of quantities and calculating the volumes of solid shapes. These elements were all included in the City and Guilds certificates. The report points out that the NVQ's competence-based assessment 'requires the candidate to pass in every element of the assessment'. It suggests that 'low levels of numeracy among large parts of the workforce has led to minimal levels of mathematics being required for NVQ certification at Level 2 in order to ensure that the qualification is within reach of the average adult employee'. It says that as a result those requirements are 'unsuitable for young trainees who need to consolidate and build at mathematics acquired at school as preparation for further progression and for maximum adaptability to a fast changing labour market'. The report adds: 'The linking of Youth Training funding to outcomes of NVQ assessment without proper guarantees of independence for college-based assessors has resulted in damaging press-ures on colleges to deny entry to poorly qualified trainees and to pass students who are only barely competent.'

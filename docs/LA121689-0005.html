			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE OF A RAM FAN HAS UPS AND DOWNS  </P> <P> Why am I a Ram fan? Roman Gabriel to Jack Snow. Why should I be a Dolphin fan?  Bob Griese to Paul Warfield. Why am I a Ram fan? John Hadl to Harold Jackson.  Why should I be a Cowboy fan? Roger Staubach to Drew Pearson. Why am I a Ram  fan? Merlin Olsen and Fred Dryer.  </P> <P> . . . And now why am I a Ram fan? Jim Everett to anybody. Why should I be a  49er fan? Joe Montana to anybody. Why am I a Ram fan? Someday they will win a  Super Bowl. Why should I be a 49er fan? They win Super Bowls.  </P> <P> Why am I a Ram fan? Because I love roller-coaster rides? Because I am a  masochist? Because they are underachievers, like me? Because I've lived here so  long I bleed L.A. smog? No.  </P> <P> I love the Rams because they are the epitome of the agony and the ecstasy --  always so close, yet so far away.  </P> <P> Remember there's always next decade.  </P> <P> KERRY KEMP, Long Beach  </P></p>

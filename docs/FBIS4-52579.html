			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--President Suharto has  warned that although Indonesia is rich in oil and able to export  it, there is a possibility that Indonesia may become an oil  importing country in the future.    "The demand for petroleum, which is now the main source of  energy, will continue to grow as the incomes of the people rise.  Therefore, although Indonesia is still a petroleum exporting  country, with the present growth in consumption it will be a  petroleum importing country in the future."    The chief state said this Saturday [5 March] as he  inaugurated the PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas  Company]-Atlantic Richfield Bali North, Incorporated, [ARBNI]  natural gas production and transport facilities in the  Pagerungan Islands and the PERTAMINA-Atlantic Richfield  Indonesia, Incorporated, [ARII] natural gas production and  transport facilities at Sidoardjo in East Java.    Therefore, according to the president, efforts to conserve  and diversify energy sources must be made consistently and  continuously. In this connection, the use of natural gas, the  reserves of which are quite large, is very important.    The chief of state said that the use of natural gas as a raw  material in making fertilizer has stimulated development in the  agriculture sector. Through the success of agricultural  development, millions of farmers have increased their earnings,  and the growth of domestic industry has been stimulated.    "Natural gas has now become an important export commodity.  No  small amount of foreign exchange has been earned from natural  gas exports," the chief of state said.    Indonesian natural gas enters a new era with the  inauguration  of these two projects in the natural gas sector. The Indonesian  people will use natural gas on a large scale for domestic needs.    Natural gas flowing through the PERTAMINA-ARII production  and  transport facilities off the northwest coast of Java will be  used to fuel the steam-electric power plants at Muara Karang and  Tanjung Priok.    With the construction of Pagerungan PERTAMINA-ARBNI natural  gas production and transport facilities, all the fuel  requirements of the gas-fueled steam power plant at Gresik will  be met. Gas from that project will also be used by the State Gas  Company to meet the needs of homes and small industry in and  around Surabaya and as a raw material for the petrochemical  industry.    Indonesia is now experiencing a great increase in electric  power demand because of the progress of industrial development.  If that demand for power cannot be met, the industrialization  process will be hindered.    The chief of state said that because of the importance of  natural gas to future development, the government will keep  encouraging exploration activity. Although natural gas reserves  are now quite large, the search for new reserves needs to  continue into order to meet long-term demand.    "There is a good possibility of this, because geologically  Indonesia possesses very great natural gas resources. I am  confident that, with the support of advances in science and  technology, there is still a great possibility of finding new  oil and gas in Indonesia," the chief of state said.    It is hoped that the success achieved by ARII and ARBNI  under  production-sharing contracts will create optimism among other  contractors working in Indonesia that there is a big chance of  finding new oil and gas in the country.    The chief of state said that in the development of oil and  natural gas efforts, the government has listened to complaints  about oil and natural gas exploration in Indonesia. A positive  dialogue needs to be developed between PERTAMINA and its  partners with regard to the various methods that can enhance  their mutual benefit.    In this connection, on 31 December 1993 the Indonesian  Government issued a new incentive package that is more conducive  to exploration and production activity.  <H5>  Background </H5>   At the beginning of 1992, PERTAMINA and ARCO Indonesia  contracted with PLN [State Electricity Public Corporation] to  supply 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 11  years beginning in 1994.    The natural gas will be used as fuel for the gas-fueled  steam  power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, which are  long-term projects scheduled for phased implementation. The  first phase, implemented on 1 September 1993, was conducted as a  "fast track" by the direct appointment of an implementing  contractor.    The second, third, and fourth phases are to supply 50  million  cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bima and Northwest  Corner Fields and develop existing natural gas reserves as an  effort to maintain natural gas supplies until 2004. Initial  capital for phase one until production will be more than $300  million. For development through phase six, the total cost is  estimated to be $824 million. This investment will be used to  expand 5 platforms to 29 platforms, 135 kilometers of pipeline  to 423 kilometers, and 11 production wells to 89.  <H5>  Benefits </H5>   Many benefits of the presence of ARCO at Pagerungan were  reported to President Suharto, but the president did not accept  the reports at face value. In a dialogue with members of the  Pagerungan community who gathered at Permisan Village, Jabon,  Sidoarjo, the president asked them directly about the benefits  of the presence of ARCO in its involvement with natural gas.    Haji Djaelani, leader of the "Abu Hurairah" Islamic Boarding  School at Pagerungan frankly answered the president by saying  that the presence of the project is very beneficial to residents  of Pagerungan. "Damaged, unusable school buildings, both secular  and Islamic, have now taken on a new look," he said. Similarly,  a fisherman from Wadjo, who had long lived there, expressed his  many thanks for the project.    Also, a teacher from there has experienced the facilities:  ARCO has built a new school, and he obtained a new house near  the school. A cooperative managed by teachers has been  developed, too. A Pagerungan PKK [Family Welfare Development]  manager asked for communications facilities to facilitate his  work of visiting isolated groups on some of the islands. "I  request communications facilities to facilitate my work," he  said expectantly.    The president later asked ARCO to take part in considering  the request. A young man then followed by speaking of the  potential of existing neighborhood youth associations. The  president asked the young man to take part in finding  alternatives for fishermen who cannot go to sea in the  off-season so that their energies can be put to use. He said  that Pagerungan fishermen cannot work during the westerly  monsoon. "Find a good alternative--using other skills,  naturally--so that fisherman can continue to work during the  westerly monsoon." The regent of Sumenep also accompanied  members of the community in the dialogue with the president.</p>

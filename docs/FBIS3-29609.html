Kumagai told a press conference after the regular morning  cabinet meeting that the stalemate in the negotiations is "an  issue which cannot be left to bureaucrats and requires a  political decision."    He also reiterated that the government has to decide what  measures -- both micro- and macro-economic -- it will take and  when to break the impasse on the talks.    The bilateral framework negotiations meant to whittle down  Japan's lopsided trade surplus with the U.S. broke down earlier  this month due to a discord over a U.S. demand for quantitative  targets for Japanese imports.    The collapsed talks apparently prompted the U.S. to announce  plans last week to impose sanctions on Japan over a cellular  phone dispute.    Asked about a U.S. move to withdraw its offer on tariff cuts  on electronics products made at the completed Uruguay Round of  trade talks, Kumagai said the U.S. about-face should not be  "viewed in the context of the Japan-U.S. relations."    Washington has threatened to do so unless Japan reduces its  timber tariffs.    He also appeared to be critical of the U.S. move, saying,  "The Uruguay Round was concluded last December."</p>

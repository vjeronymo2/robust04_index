			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> WATER-PLAN PENALTY DELAYED  </P> <P> In a concession to landlords irked by a pilot water-conservation project, the  city of Santa Monica has delayed implementing a penalty clause in a toilet and  shower head replacement program that is designed to cut city waste water by  about 8% by 1994.  </P> <P> Voting 6 to 0, the City Council approved the plan proposed Aug. 1 to install  ultra-low-flow fixtures on as many as one-fourth of residential bathrooms in  Santa Monica. The measure, hailed by the city as an innovative conservation  step, includes free distribution of 1,000 toilets and shower heads to property  owners and a $100 rebate for each retrofitted bathroom.  </P> <P> Property owners succeeded, however, in postponing a planned $1-a-month  surcharge on water bills, scheduled to go into effect April 1 next year, for  those not complying with the program. The landlords objected to the council  that costs of replacing toilets and remodeling surrounding floor and wall areas  exceeded city estimates, and that some costs should be passed on to tenants,  who are responsible for using the water-saving devices.  </P> <P> The city agreed to review its replacement cost estimates and consider requiring  tenants to pay part of them before the measure goes into effect next spring.  </P></p>

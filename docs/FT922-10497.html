			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: MFI summer reflotation details expected today MFI is expected to announce today that it is going ahead with its reflotation this summer. The kitchen and bedroom furniture retailer's shareholders met yesterday to discuss proposals for the float. The group, which was the subject of a Pounds 718m management buy-out from Asda, the supermarket group, in 1987, has fought off recession and a Pounds 500m debt burden to return to the stock market. Analysts are forecasting that it will make trading profits of Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m for the year which ends this month. MFI reported a rise in trading profits to Pounds 25m (Pounds 20.6m) at the interim stage. It said that January sales were buoyant and trading wasstrong. On that basis the group could be valued at more than Pounds 750m in the flotation. The issue will raise cash to pay off most of the debt as well as providing some return for existing shareholders. Asda retains a 25 per cent stake in MFI, which it carries at nil in its books, and has some convertible loan stock, acquired when MFI had a refinancing in 1989, which it wrote down to Pounds 2m in its balance sheet. MFI appointed advisers for the float in February. County NatWest is the merchant bank, and Smith New Court Corporate Finance and Rowe &amp; Pitman are the brokers.</p>

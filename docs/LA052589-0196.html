			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN BIKERS PATROL THEIR OWN ON THE TRAILS  </P> <P> The biker was cranking hard along a shady fire road toward a pair of older  riders in Point Mugu State Park's Sycamore Canyon.  </P> <P> A slight swerve by one of the slow riders forced the young man to sharply  maneuver his 18-speed mountain bike off the road and back on. He pedaled away  without a word.  </P> <P> But Mark Langton, coordinator of a group of mountain bikers who patrol Santa  Monica Mountains park areas, saw the incident and caught up with the speeding  biker.  </P> <P> "You're in Sycamore Canyon, and you have to mellow out," Langton told the  bicyclist. "You can't ride that way here."  </P> <P> Operating on fire roads and trails in a number of popular biking areas since  late December, the 25 volunteer members of the Van Nuys-based Mountain Bike  Unit hope that their presence will serve to moderate the sometimes dangerous  behavior of thrill-seeking fellow riders.  </P> <P> The patrol's members, who underwent extensive National Park Service training,  want to be ambassadors for their sport. They want to calm the fears of hikers  and equestrians who see mountain bikers as a safety threat.  </P> <P> They hope to demonstrate that mountain bikers also cherish the natural beauty  of the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Formerly unregulated, many trails have been closed to bikers in recent years  amid concerns by hikers about safety, trail damage and destruction of  wilderness calm.  </P> <P> By improving the image of mountain bikers, members of the patrol units and the  Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn. -- the patrols' parent organization -- hope  to regain access to back-country trails. Although substantial barriers remain  to achieving that goal, CORBA has won some converts during its 18 months of  existence.  </P> <P> "We have, if nothing else, put a face on the mountain bike riding community,"  said Langton, an editor at a Woodland Hills-based off-road biking magazine and  a member of CORBA.  </P> <P> "The attitude and the climate toward mountain bikers has improved. We're not  faceless marauders. We're a group of individuals . . . concerned about the  environment as well as with enjoying the aesthetics of the area."  </P> <P> Indeed, partly as a result of CORBA's efforts, the Santa Monica Mountains  Trails Council, a longtime opponent of mountain bikers, has endorsed opening  three trails to the bicyclists.  </P> <P> In addition, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy plans to supply equipment  for CORBA to expand its patrols into conservancy territory, and CORBA intends  to recruit additional volunteers. The expansion would be a prelude to giving  bikers access to most of the roads and trails on conservancy property, a  conservancy official said.  </P> <P> "Their presence in our parks is good for their image, and our image," said  Carolyn Barr, a project analyst for the conservancy, a state agency that  acquires and manages parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> The patrol units can "explain to people why they need to be polite," Barr said.  If mountain bikers behave irresponsibly, other groups will question their  presence in the back country, she said.  </P> <P> Even though the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the National Park  Service -- which together control 56,000 acres in the mountains -- welcome the  bike patrols, each has strict limits on where bikes can go. Essentially, the  agencies allow bikes only on fire roads.  </P> <P> A state parks department policy, which became effective in January, allows  district park superintendents to grant exceptions to the restrictions.  </P> <P> The problem, said several longtime Santa Monica Mountains hikers, is not the  behavior of mountain bikers, but the sheer numbers of them. Practically unknown  five years ago, riders of the durable, fat-tired, multispeed bicycles have  become the largest and the fastest-growing recreation group in the mountains,  parks officials said.  </P> <P> A ranger in Point Mugu State Park, one of the most popular biking areas,  recently counted 700 bikers in Sycamore Canyon during a single day. Also  popular are Malibu Creek State Park, Topanga Canyon State Park and trails in  the Cheeseboro Canyon area.  </P> <P> "We're the newest, fastest-growing user group out there and that isn't making  the other two groups very happy," said Peter Heumann, a Woodland Hills bike  rider who helped form CORBA. The other major groups are equestrians and hikers.  "They don't see us as legitimate back-country users. They see us invading their  privacy."  </P> <P> The CORBA patrols, modeled after the Mounted Assist Units organized by  equestrian groups, have been trained by the National Park Service to give first  aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to keep their unofficial standing in  mind when dealing with the public. The two-person bike patrols are equipped  with emergency radios, first-aid kits, repair kits and maps.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Official Power  </P> <P> Patrol members stressed that they have no power to enforce laws; they can only  remind park users of rules and provide directions, maps, advice or emergency  water. On a recent patrol that Langton said was typical, he helped repair a  bicyclist's gears, informed someone clutching a bouquet of wildflowers that  picking flowers is against the law, advised another visitor that dogs are not  allowed in the park and reprimanded a fellow biker for riding too fast.  </P> <P> "It's not that you should never go fast, but you should always be in control of  yourself," Langton said. "There are plenty of places you can go flat out, with  no regard for people going slow."  </P> <P> But, he said, Sycamore Canyon, which stretches in a sometimes steep slope from  Newbury Park to the Pacific Coast Highway, is not one of them. That message  seems to be getting out.  </P> <P> "Most mountain bikers we encounter any more are courteous and they either slow  down or stop for horsemen," said Ralph Bauer of Chatsworth, an equestrian who  recently encountered one of the CORBA patrols in Sycamore Canyon.  </P> <P> "There are only so many trails, and we know we have to share them," added his  wife, Elodie Bauer. "If we don't all work together, we're going to lose these  trails."  </P> <P> "I'm impressed by their zeal and their sincerity," Dan Preece, Santa Monica  Mountains state park district superintendent, said of CORBA members.  </P> <P> But issues remain, he said. "We are determined to keep an open mind, but  basically we have been concerned by the things we've seen on the trails with  bikes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints Continue  </P> <P> Hikers and bikers are often injured in collisions, he said, although he could  supply no statistics. And park rangers continue to hear complaints about  speeding bikers. "Our concern is that bicycles do move down steep inclines at a  high rate of speed in silence, so there is very little warning," he said.  </P> <P> Preece said he also worries about the difficulty of enforcing any policy change  that opens some state park trails while keeping others closed.  </P> <P> Ron Webster, who builds trails in the Santa Monicas for the Sierra Club and the  conservancy, once praised CORBA's efforts. But he had a change of heart when,  on a recent hike, a large number of bikers peddled past and he felt besieged.  </P> <P> "I go into the parks, personally, for peace and solitude," he said. "I felt  they were seriously infringing on my ability to enjoy the parks in that way."  </P> <P> Consequently, he said, he will urge that all state parks, including their fire  roads, be off limits to bicycles.  </P> <P> But Linda Palmer, president of the Santa Monica Trails Council, plans to  support the reopening of three trails for use by bikers: the Bent Arrow Trail  in Topanga State Park; the Yearling Trail at the Reagan Ranch in Malibu Creek  State Park and the La Jolla Loop Trail near the western end of the Santa  Monicas. Palmer said the trails council's stand is a departure from past  positions. She said the change "is probably a good deal due to CORBA's  educational efforts.  </P> <P> "The mountain bicycles are probably with us to stay, and it is such a large  user group that they do need places to ride," she said. "It is a legitimate  recreational pursuit, and there must be a way of working it out."  </P></p>

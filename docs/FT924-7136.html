			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wages councils battle begins THE government's decision to abolish wages councils covering some 2.5m low-paid workers showed the Tories' 'moral degradation', Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, said yesterday as the bitter parliamentary battle over the councils' future began. But Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, insisted they were an arbitrary and outdated structure and an obstacle to creating new jobs. Opening the debate on the employment bill, which includes provisions to abolish the remaining wages councils covering industries such as retail and catering, Mrs Shephard came under opposition fire when she went on the political offensive, highlighting the abolition of 10 wages councils by the last Labour government in the 1970s. This removed 600,000 employees from wages councils. 'If the opposition are going to argue that the wages councils are a sort of safety net, they will have to acknowledge they made some pretty big holes in it when they were last in power,' she said. The thrust of her argument was that the conditions that had applied when the wages councils were created in 1909 were no longer present, since most of the employees they covered lived in households with two or more incomes, and there was much greater social security provision. But Labour signalled that this 'nastiest' element of the bill will attract fiercest opposition, and accused the Conservatives of pandering to their sponsors in business. The policy would enable the worst employers to undercut competitors at the expense of employees and of the taxpayer, who would have to fund extra social security benefits. As for the bill's new rights for trade union members, Mr Dobson warned that they failed even on the government's own terms, since they would add to burdens on employers.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Attali confirms first-half deficit for Air France AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned airline, will show a loss for the first half of 1992, Mr Bernard Attali, chairman, confirmed yesterday. The airline will also put forward a new plan to cut costs next month. He did not say how big Air France's losses would be and gave no details of any cost-cutting schemes. In June Mr Attali said it was unlikely Air France would manage to break even in 1992, but he hoped to achieve this in 1993. Air France, like other airlines, has suffered from the combined effects of the recession in many world markets and the hangover from the slump caused by the Gulf crisis. In the first half of 1992 Air France and its subsidiary Union des Transports Aeriens, carried just 0.8 per cent more passengers than in the same period of 1991. Cargo traffic fell by 6.7 per cent. It is the world's third biggest airline by sales and has lost a total of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 292m) during the past two years. It has already put in place a plan to cut FFr1.5bn costs a year, under which it expects to lose 3,000 jobs. The European Commission in July approved a FFr1.25bn injection by the state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris for an 8.8 per cent stake in Air France.</p>

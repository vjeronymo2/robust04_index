			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Defence cuts high on Aspin's agenda MR Bill Clinton's choice of secretary of defence in his new administration is far from being a 'stealth' nominee. Congressman Les Aspin's thoughts on just about any aspect of defence policy are copiously detailed in the pile of position papers and discussion documents he has produced in 22 years representing Wisconsin's first congressional district - the last eight of them as chairman of the House armed services committee. A rumpled, 54-year-old economics professor, Mr Aspin and his staff - sometimes joined by his Republican colleagues - have in the last year alone produced reports on post-cold war US force structure, the lessons of the Gulf war, military procurement policy in an era of reduced defence budgets, and when to use force in conflicts such as those in Bosnia and Somalia. Pentagon and defence industry officials do not always agree with his conclusions, but they have, for the most part, considerable respect for his intelligence, his command of military issues and his understanding of their relationship to budget questions. Mr Aspin, along with Senator Sam Nunn, his Senate counterpart, has led the fight to destroy the Democrats' reputation as soft on defence; and his efforts in this direction have not always endeared him to his more dovish colleagues in the party, such as Congressman Ron Dellums of California, who is likely to take over the armed services chairmanship. Military leaders are unlikely to be too worried by Mr Aspin's arguments for bigger cuts in the US force structure than the 25 per cent put forward by the current administration; most recognise that deeper cuts were likely to be made even if President George Bush had been re-elected. Greater potential conflicts may loom in Mr Aspin's criticism of what he calls the 'all or nothing school', which fears another Vietnam or another Beirut any time US forces are used. Here too, however, many generals appear to recognise that Mr Aspin has a point when he questions 'the willingness of the American people to pay Dollars 250bn (Pounds 165bn) or even Dollars 200bn a year for a military that is not very useful'.</p>

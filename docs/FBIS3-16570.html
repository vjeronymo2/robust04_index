He said a social charter is needed to supplement the  agreement on the economic alliance designed to offset the burden  of ruptured economic links inside the former Soviet Union which  was "built like one huge factory."    Shumeyko, who urged the search for new forms of cooperation  within the Commonwealth in the cultural, economic, political and  military fields, said a new legal infrastructure was needed to  remove barriers from the path of economic and financial  cooperation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 4 Apr [month as received] (PL) -- Cuba and  Colombia have seen a significant increase in bilateral actions.  With the latest agreements signed, these actions will increase  further, mainly in trade, cultural cooperation, and science and  technology.    Two recent examples are Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin's visit to the island and today's signing of documents  authorizing the recent resolutions of the mixed commission that  met in this capital last month to establish new cultural and  educational agreements.    In the first semester of 1994, a monumental effort by the  two  Latin American countries led to a decision to work together on a  number of projects in public health, cattle and farming, energy,  and cultural and educational exchanges.    Likewise, in the metallurgical, the iron and steel,  pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and construction materials  industries, common interests were found which could result in an  important increase in the total volume of bilateral trade.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Martinez Beaton, the  Cuban ambassador in Bogota, referred to current negotiations on  the eventual supplying of crude oil to the island, as well as to  increasing trade between the two countries.    Martinez said that following the agreement under which  Colombia would accept Cuban products in payment for a debt of  approximately $40 million, a list of products was exchanged upon  which broader future trade relations could be based.    Martinez said the possible sale of Colombian hydrocarbons to  Cuba is being studied, as are methods of payment, shipment, and  other issues common to trade negotiations. This was confirmed  by Foreign Minister Sanin upon her arrival in Havana.    The ambassador was optimistic about advances in Colombian  and  Cuban trade relations and emphasized visits to Cuba in recent  months by the South American nation's ministers of mines and  energy, health, and agriculture, the result of which was the  signing of trade agreements in each area.    In the case of Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, it  was revealed recently that during his stay in Havana an  agreement was reached on joint ventures in fishing,  phytosanitation norms, biological control of plagues, and the  marketing of veterinary and farming products.    Another result of the conversations held by Ocampo was the  decision by a delegation of Colombian sugar cane and coffee  growers associations to visit Cuba in June to discuss joint  ventures with their Cuban counterparts.    Ambassador Martinez said that this month a large delegation  of Colombian investors will visit Cuba for a first-hand study of  areas for possible joint ventures with the Caribbean state.</p>

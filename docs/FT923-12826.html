			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Brussels fines Parker Pen PARKER PEN, the British-based company, has been fined Ecu700,000 (Dollars 615,601) by the European Commission for trying to prevent its German distributor from exporting its pens to other EC countries. The German company, Herlitz, has been fined Ecu40,000 for its involvement in the illegal agreement. The Commission said the deal - which was concluded in August 1986 - would clearly have obstructed the achievement of the single European market and was therefore 'a very serious infringement of EC law'. The illegal agreement came to light after a Dutch importer of office furniture discovered it could not buy Parker products from Herlitz except where Parker had given its consent in writing. Parker has managed to avoid a heavier fine by co-operating with Brussels. It has drawn up a programme for its EC subsidiaries, showing them how to comply with EC competition law. As a result, the Commission decided to fine Parker only on the basis of its German sales rather than taking into account EC-wide turnover.</p>

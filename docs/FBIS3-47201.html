			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister  suggested Tuesday [11 January] that Tokyo will reject U.S. calls  for administrative guidance to reduce its trade surplus.    International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  said at a press conference, "We cannot practice managed trade or  allow administrative guidance only to reduce the surplus with  the United States by using double standards at home and abroad."    "The government of (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa is  trying to create transparency in markets," Kumagai said.    Referring to reported U.S. criticism that bilateral trade  framework negotiations have faced hard going due to Japan's  bureaucracy, Kumagai said that bluff or dissatisfaction may be  expressed when negotiations reach the final stage.    "At least, I don't think the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry insists on its own logic being accepted," Kumagai  said.</p>

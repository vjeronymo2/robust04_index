			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Observer: Rival exhaustion First the good news for owners of Trabant cars who live in Budapest. In a bid to get rid of the fume-belching relics of the communist era, the city announced yesterday that it would give free public transport passes for two years to motorists who hand over their two-stroke cars for demolition. The bad news is that Wartburg owners get three years' free travel if they promise to ditch their old bangers.</p>

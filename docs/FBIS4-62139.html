			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 12 May, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister  Juri Luik attended on Wednesday [11 May] a session of the  Council of Europe [CE] committee of ministers in Strasbourg. At  the top of the agenda were expansion of the Council of Europe  and the CE Vienna declaration on combating anti-Semitism, racism  and other manifestations of intolerance.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo told BNS that most  representatives from the CE member states underscored that  Russia, in order to become a full member of the CE, must  withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia. Arusoo said the  participants affirmed no exceptions in admission to the CE can  be made for Russia.    Luik emphasized in his address that Russia, to gain full  membership in the CE, must pull out its troops from the Estonian  territory, abandon the "near abroad" concept in its foreign  policy, and give an unequivocal assessment to the events in  Estonia in 1940.    The session discussed the Vienna declaration that was  adopted  by the October meeting of the CE member states' heads of state  and government.    Luik signed on Wednesday in Strasbourg the 11th protocol of  the European Convention on Human Rights, which introduces some  amendments in the mechanism that controls the implementation of  the convention.    The protocol foresees the formation of a permanent European  Court of Human Rights to interpret the convention. The court  will accept petitions about human rights violations from  individuals, groups of people, and states.    The signed protocol comes into force from the moment of  ratification. The Estonian parliament also has to ratify the  human rights convention and ten other protocols pertaining to it.</p>

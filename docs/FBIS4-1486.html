			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Service on 28 </F> April]    [Text] As we enter the third day of the first ever  democratic elections in our country, the ANC welcomes the  massive enthusiasm shown by the people of KwaZulu/Natal as well  as other parts of the country, despite the logistical problems  experienced. In this regard we appreciate efforts which have  resulted in the voting, proceeding well in many areas in Natal.  Areas where voting has succeeded, are only those where the SAP  [South African Police] has provided security.    We have along with other parties, made concrete  recommendations to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to  help resolve these logistical problems.    Further, we are encouraged by the relatively peaceful way in  which the election has unfolded -- in a province recently  plagued by intense violence. We urge our people to use this last  day of voting to ensure that everyone entitled to do so cast  his/her vote.    However, we wish to put it on record that the ANC has  received extensive reports of violations of the electoral laws,  regulations and code of conduct in some parts of the province of  KwaZulu/Natal. We are filing with the Independent Electoral  Commission a detailed complaint of a series of such violations  by the Inkatha Freedom Party and its supporters. This is  particularly rife in parts of northern Natal and the Midlands. A  list of such incidents is attached to this statement.    Evidence at hand already indicate the following violations,  among others:     -  Removal of ballot boxes from polling stations by IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters;    -  Transfer of IEC voting material to "pirate polling stations"  run by supporters of the IFP;    -  Threats against IEC officers and expulsion of ANC party  agents  from polling stations; and    -  Lack of secrecy in polling booths where voters are coerced  into  voting for the IFP.       These problems are in the main a consequence of inadequate  security at these polling stations -- because either the KwaZulu  Police [KZP] is the only security force present or there are no  security forces at all. In the main the areas where violations  are extensive, the security is exclusively provided by the KZP.  This matter has been raised with the law and order sub-council,  and we have been assured that steps are being taken to correct  the situation.    We urge the IEC and the security forces to take immediate  action to restore the integrity of the electoral process in  these parts of Natal.    The ANC is confident that the IEC will resolve these  problems  in accordance with the relevant statues, thus inspiring  confidence in the electoral process in this province.    [Dated] 28 April 1994</p>

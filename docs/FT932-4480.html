			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / People: Another directorship for Sir Roland Professor Sir Roland Smith has just accepted his 10th non-executive directorship, this time as chairman of specialist publisher Harrington Kilbride. 'He is just the sort of person Ted Croker would have recommended to succeed him if he had been planning his retirement' says Kevin Harrington, founder and managing director. Croker, the former chairman, died suddenly last Christmas at the age of 68. Although the two never met, Smith, who is chairman of Manchester United football team, will have known of Croker, who was secretary and chief executive of the Football Association betwen 1973 and 1989. 'Given it was not a planned retirement we had to go back and define the requirements. We wanted someone who was very much an international businessman as well as someone who would fit in with the fair amount of (sports-related publishing) that is still within the group,' says Harrington, who did not employ headhunters to fill the position. Smith, 63, is a also a director of the Bank of England, and chairman of Readicut International and Hepworth in addition to other non-executive posts. He was forced out of British Aerospace in a boardroom coup 18 months ago.</p>

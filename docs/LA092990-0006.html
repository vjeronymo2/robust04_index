			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> TEACHER OF THE YEAR BRINGS PAST TO LIFE  </P> <P> A Thousand Oaks social studies teacher who conducts mock trials in her  classroom -- with real attorneys and judges presiding -- has been named Ventura  County teacher of the year, school officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Joan Gorner of Colina Intermediate School was selected by a committee from the  county superintendent's office from a field of four nominees, Assistant Supt.  </P> <P> Chuck Weis said.  </P> <P> "I try to make learning fun," Gorner, 52, said. "I don't ever want to be bored,  and I don't want to bore my students."  </P> <P> One of Gorner's favorite projects is to have students build medieval weapons  and castles, and then quiz them about their historical significance.  </P> <P> A 30-year veteran of teaching, Gorner has been in Thousand Oaks schools for 25  years. She has been at Colina Intermediate School for 17 years and now oversees  classes of seventh- and eighth-grade students.  </P> <P> She has taught English, Spanish, science, mathematics and home economics from  elementary to high school grades.  </P> <P> Colina Principal Michael Waters said students are excited by Gorner's spirited  approach to history.  </P> <P> "History is a story well-told, and she's the kind of person who can teach  history as a story," Waters said. "Students just love her."  </P> <P> Gorner has also participated in Conejo Valley Unified School District  committees that offer tips to other teachers on how to improve instruction.  </P> <P> "I haven't turned education upside down," Gorner said. "It's just innovations  that I've made for my own classes, and people have picked them up."  </P> <P> Gorner's name will be submitted to the state Department of Education as the  county's nominee for Teacher of the Year, Weis said. The state announces the  winner Oct. 31. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

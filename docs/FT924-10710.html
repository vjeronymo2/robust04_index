			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UN elects Security Council members THE UN Security Council, which many countries are eager to expand and re-organise, will acquire five new members as a result of General Assembly elections late on Tuesday. Brazil, Pakistan, Spain, New Zealand and Djibouti will supersede Ecuador, India, Austria, Belgium and Zimbabwe for two-year terms beginning on January 1. The changes are not expected to alter greatly voting patterns in the 15-nation council. However, India and Zimbabwe were inclined to be fence-sitters on some issues, including those of Iraq and former Yugoslavia, sometimes abstaining on crucial resolutions. Pakistan and Djibouti, both Moslem countries, may be expected to be more supportive of actions designed to help Bosnia-Hercegovina. Regional groups in the UN customarily offer agreed nominees for the five elected positions that have to be filled every year. The 'western European and others' group - the others being states of the old British Commonwealth  -proposed three candidates to succeed Austria and Belgium, leaving the assembly to choose two among Spain, Sweden and New Zealand. As expected, Spain easily gained the required two-thirds majority in the first ballot. New Zealand was a surprise winner in a third ballot, overtaking Sweden, which had led in the first round. Japan, Morocco, Hungary, Venezuela and the Cape Verde Islands will complete the second year of their elected terms in 1993. The permanent members are the US, Russia, China, Britain and France. The question of increasing the number of permanent members will be taken up by the assembly within the next few weeks, with Japan and Germany believing that, as global economic powers, they deserve to join the original five. India, Brazil, Pakistan, Egypt and Nigeria also believe they have a good claim. The UN's 50th anniversary year, 1995, has been set informally as a target for change. It is not proposed that additional permanent members would have the power of veto, last used over two years ago.</p>

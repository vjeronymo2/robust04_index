			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Determine if the official listed on the petition is the appropriate contact. If not, show the name, telephone number and FAX number (if available) of the appropriate contact person on the face of the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Confirm the product description reported on the petition. Accuracy is critical to DOL in determining whether imports of like or directly competitive products have increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Ask the company official about total and partial worker separations at the firm during the past 12 months. If there were separations, ascertain if it was because of increased company imports from Mexico or Canada, an actual or threatened shift of production to either country, or lost sales to customers to purchase from firms importing from Mexico or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Alert company official that data request forms will be sent by FAX (if available) or by mail, and obtain the official's cooperation to supply the requested information within 5 days of petition receipt. If the company official fails to cooperate, inform the company of subpoena authority to obtain the requested data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the company continues to refuse to supply the data, the State must notify the company in writing of its subpoena authority and determine if the data is to be furnished. Subpoena procedures should be instituted when there is non-compliance with the request. TAA program regulations at 20 CFR 617.53 provide that States may issue subpoenas for attendance of witnesses and production of records on the same terms and conditions as under State law. If a State court declines to enforce a subpoena, the State agency may petition for an order requiring compliance with such subpoena to the United States District Court within the jurisdiction of which the relevant proceeding under 20 CFR part 617 is conducted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obviously, encouraging company cooperation is the best solution to obtaining requested information. Use of subpoena procedures often result in lengthy legal negotiations and even court proceedings. Notify OTAA when subpoena procedures are being considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Use the dedicated line (telephone number 202&hyph;501&hyph;6489) to FAX to OTAA the face page of the petition form as well as any corrections or additions obtained during telephone contacts with the company official. This action will serve as notification to the Secretary that the Governor has received a petition and that the investigation has been initiated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) FAX (if available) or mail the data request forms, which include a request for a listing of company customers, to the company official, specifying a due date for the information to be returned via FAX or mail. If appropriate, inform the State employment security agency that an investigation is underway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) OTAA will check its records for duplicate petitions and assign a NAFTA&hyph;TAA number to the case. OTAA will enter the case number in the OTAA Management Information System and institute the investigation of the petition. A notice of the investigation will be forwarded for publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the regional offices and State agencies notified according to established procedures in the regular TAA Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) OTAA will begin the analysis of aggregate U.S. imports for the article(s) listed in the petition that are like or directly competitive with the article(s) produced at the subject firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Day 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTAA will complete the aggregate import analysis and FAX a determination to the State as to whether relevant imports from Mexico or Canada have increased. This determination will be made part of the case file as it will be used by the State in making its preliminary finding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Day 5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the data package has not been received from the company official, the State will contact the company official to urge completion and transmittal by mail or FAX (if available) of the data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Day 10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. State will make a preliminary finding regarding whether the petition meets the criteria in section 250(a)(1), except clause (A)(iii), and will prepare a brief statement on the basis for the finding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. State will FAX the petition face sheet, the data packet (including the customer list), and the preliminary finding and reasons for the finding, to OTAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. State will notify the petitioners of the Governor's preliminary finding on the NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition and that the petition package is being submitted to the Secretary of Labor for review and final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. When an affirmative determination is made, the State will take the necessary action to ensure that the JTPA Title III (Economic Dislocated Worker Adjustment Assistance) rapid response and basic readjustment services are made available to the impacted workers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.6. Review of Petition by Secretary: Certifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

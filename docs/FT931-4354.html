			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Strong tobacco side lifts BAT to Pounds 1.65bn SHARES in BAT Industries rose 18p to 955p yesterday after the tobacco and financial services group reported annual pre-tax profits up 68 per cent to Pounds 1.65bn, which was at the top end of City expectations. Turnover grew 7 per cent to Pounds 22.1bn. The figures were attributed to an unexpectedly strong fourth quarter by the group's buoyant international tobacco business, and the continuing reduction in losses from Eagle Star, the UK insurance subsidiary which has been hit hard by mortgage indemnity losses. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the performance of Farmers, the group's US insurance subsidiary, was a highlight. It had become the third largest general insurer in the US, and its life business had contributed Pounds 93m to a trading profit above Pounds 400m. Farmers and Eagle Star helped financial services' trading profit from continuing operations to recover from Pounds 230m to Pounds 598m. Losses from mortgage indemnity insurance - which covers lenders against a portion of their losses on sales of repossessed properties - amounted to Pounds 244m. This was mainly because Eagle Star increased its provisions against claims on policies insuring commercial property lenders, a class of business it no longer underwrites. Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity policies fell to Pounds 97m, compared with Pounds 213m in 1991. Higher premiums and more selective underwriting led to a sharp fall in Eagle Star's underwriting losses in motor, home and commercial insurances. The group's tobacco trading profit increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.31bn. Total volumes rose to more than 570bn cigarettes, increasing the group's share of the world market to 10.9 per cent. Sales of international brands grew by 19 per cent, while export volumes were 23 per cent higher. As the most international cigarette maker, BAT continued to increase its share in key domestic markets around the world and to expand into newly emerging markets such as eastern Europe. Earnings per share more than doubled to 58.7p. The group's tax rate fell from 56.5 per cent to 41.5 per cent, mainly due to the improvement in UK profitability. A final dividend of 22.6p (against 11.2p) gives a total for the year of 37.2p, up 11 per cent. Details, Page 27; Lex, Page 24</p>

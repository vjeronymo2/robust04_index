			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: President of Sanyo Securities to step down Sanyo Securities, the financially-troubled Japanese broker, yesterday said Mr Yoichi Tsuchiya, president, was likely to step down next month to take an advisory post. The move comes as the broker is struggling to finalise its restructuring programme with its creditor banks and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder, due to mounting debts and bad loans held by the broker's non-bank financial affiliates. While the company denied that Mr Tsuchiya, the thrust behind Sanyo's aggressive expansion during the late 1980s, was resigning to take responsibility for the financial problems, its creditors and shareholders had anticipated such a move. The burst of the asset 'bubble' in the 1980s led to mounting bad loans at Sanyo's financial subsidiaries, and it had to borrow large amounts. After months of negotiations with its leading creditors - Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank, Nippon Credit Bank and Nomura - officials were forced last March to announce a restructuring plan. The plan, expected to be finalised in the next few weeks, includes an Y80bn (Dollars 769m) write-off over the next nine years, a reduction of interest rates from its main creditors to 1.25 per cent, and a third-party share allotment of Y20bn to the three creditors and Nomura.</p>

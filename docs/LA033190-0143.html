			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ESPERANZA USES EVERY INNING TO DEFEAT LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> After watching Esperanza High School score in every inning of a 12-5 victory  Friday, Los Alamitos Coach Mike Gibson didn't hesitate to offer an opinion.  </P> <P> "We've seen every team in the league, and they're definitely No. 1," Gibson  said. "That's a good-hitting team that's going to score runs against anybody at  any time."  </P> <P> Esperanza (9-2, 5-0 in league) gained sole possession of first place in the  Empire League and made it look easy. Third baseman Keith McDonald got things  going with a three-run home run to center in the first inning.  </P> <P> Every Esperanza starter reached base safely. McDonald drove in four runs with  two hits and Dan Redington had three hits and two RBIs.  </P> <P> Esperanza also proved resourceful, twice scoring without benefit of a hit as  the Aztecs stole six bases and executed three sacrifice bunts perfectly.  </P> <P> "You look up and see 12 runs and think we're mashing the ball," Coach Mike  Curran said. "But we did the little things today, like sacrificing a runner  into scoring position and then scoring him with a fly ball.  </P> <P> "We can't muscle-up with Los Alamitos. Their first four batters are strong  power hitters who are capable of extra-base hits every time they come up to the  plate."  </P> <P> Esperanza, which averages 9.5 runs per game, has two muscle men of its own in  Redington and McDonald.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos (5-6-1, 4-1) had a four-game winning streak ended and managed only  five hits off Shade Summers (5-0) through five innings. Redington earned the  save by retiring the side in the sixth and seventh.  </P> <P> Summers got off to a shaky start, allowing a lead-off homer to Todd Gragnano  and then walking four consecutive batters in the first inning. But he didn't  allow another run until an error by Redington helped Los Alamitos score three  times in the fifth.  </P> <P> "I was pleased the way Shade battled back in the first inning and then got us  out of a jam in the fifth," Curran said. "He's only a junior, but he gets more  seasoning with every start."  </P> <P> Gibson said Los Alamitos' inability to take advantage of Summers' wildness in  the first inning was the turning point.  </P> <P> "We did things in reverse today," Gibson said. "We got a homer and then four  walks. Now, Esperanza is in the driver's seat for the league title."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> El Dorado 4, Katella 2 -- Gar Vallone had two hits and one RBI to lead visiting  El Dorado (8-3, 2-3). Katella took the lead on Jeff Evans' two-run triple, but  El Dorado scored once in the second, twice in the third and once in the fifth.  Katella is 2-3 in league.  </P> <P> Loara 7, Cypress 4 -- The Saxons (3-9, 2-3) rallied from a 4-1 deficit for the  victory at Loara. Cypress (1-11, 0-5) led, 4-2, after three innings, but Loara  scored four times in the fourth. Charlie Gibson had a two-run double in the  inning. Gibson also pitching the final three innings in relief of Joey Gaudio  for the save. Kyle Poffenberger and Erich Munzner each had two hits for Loara.  </P></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Resale of council homes 'blocked by loans policy' HOMEOWNERS WHO bought property from local authorities could be trapped in houses they cannot sell, a study of building society lending policies says. The study, conducted in the Midlands by a Birmingham City Council housing official, suggests many owners will be unable to sell because of building defects or the reluctance of lenders to offer mortgages in rundown areas. The report concludes that a growing number of former council house tenants who exercised the right to buy are finding that building societies have become increasingly reluctant to offer mortgages on properties of non-traditional construction - mainly houses with prefabricated reinforced concrete or steel frames. According to Mr Trevor Graham, the study's author, who questioned 15 lenders during academic research on the subject, some societies will not offer loans on such housing - favoured by councils because it was quick and cheap to build - as it has a reputation for cracking and corrosion which makes it a bad risk. The problem has been raised in parliament, where the Commons environment committee has demanded a government inquiry into the growing numbers of 'unsaleable right-to-buy properties'. Mr Alex Smith, a Birmingham chartered surveyor, said: 'The societies have made too many bad loans, so now they're much tougher. On every property they ask, 'Has it got bricks in it?'' Leading building societies deny refusing to lend on properties of non-traditional construction. Each case is treated individually, according to societies such as Nationwide and Halifax, which add that their mortgage managers have not been advised to steer clear of former council properties.</p>

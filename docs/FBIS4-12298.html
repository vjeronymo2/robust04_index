			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Velayati by unidentified </F> correspondent upon Velayati's return on 6 April from visiting  African countries--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Please tell us what issues you  discussed and what agreements you reached during your tour of  some African countries?    [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Before the revolution, the regime did not pay much  attention to ties with Africa in its foreign policy. After the  revolution, for various reasons, that attention was considerably  increased. There was first the expansion of diplomatic ties.  The next step was the expansion of cultural, economic,  commercial, and industrial ties. By the expansion of industrial  ties, I mean those countries are eager to use Iran's industrial  goods. During that period there were very good examples of  cooperation with those countries in that field. The inception  of temporary or permanent trade and industrial exhibitions in  some countries was one of the first steps taken and was very  successful in those countries.    One of the main reasons for the extraordinary welcome by all  the African countries in which we opened exhibitions is that not  many countries can compete with Iranian prices, while the  quality of our goods is relatively high, particularly the  quality of goods offered there. In some commercial and economic  fields, the private sector could definitely be more active, and  in some other fields the public sector. Without exception all  the African countries we visited asked for the expansion of  economic and commercial cooperation.    [Correspondent] To what extent could cooperation with Africa  help our presence on the international scene?    [Velayati] Because of the end of the cold war, some Western  countries are today interfering more blatantly in the internal  affairs of Third World countries, particularly African  countries, without any consideration for their endemic  characteristics. They have disturbed the situation in some  African countries. The people of Africa are wise to this and,  therefore, seek cooperation with countries that have  particularly more influence on the international scene.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much.    [Velayati] Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Avner Regev: "A Few Musings Between the </F> Interim and the Permanent"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The negotiating teams are  dealing with the many issues as if nothing was wrong.  Meanwhile, murderous attacks have become routine, one event  after another, and warnings conveyed to various elements that  the terrorist attacks have to stop have done no good; this will  have to be solved in some way.    A military reaction, such as a closure on the Strip and the  West Bank, is one of the options discussed today. The police  minister and the chief of staff have openly discussed it. As  far as the Palestinians are concerned, a hermetic closure will  once again place Jerusalem -- which will be severed from Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza -- on the agenda. A closure on the  territories, which would be parallel to the implementation of  the agreement with the Palestinians this time, may create a  situation in which autonomy will be implemented over the entire  territory long before the timeframe envisaged in the original  plan.    The current situation, in which tension in Lebanon rises  daily and the security deterioration continues, will eventually  affect the talks with the Palestinians. Top officials in  Washington as well as Jerusalem have recently observed more than  once that the prime minister is not particularly insistent on  the Syrian issue, and with the exception of an occasional  statement about his desire to advance the Syrian track, Rabin  seems unconcerned. This, although al-Asad has not made the  awaited declaration about the nature of peace.    The prime minister seems to be disinterested in launching  substantive negotiations with Syria at this time, preferring to  postpone them until after the implementation of the agreement  with the Palestinians. Rabin is probably worried about the  situation in Lebanon. His close circles speak of a possible  conflagration in the north, in which Syria may be involved even  in fighting on Lebanese territory. Some members of the top  political echelons believe that without a limited military clash  between Syria and Israel that is followed by massive American  involvement, the sides will find it difficult to agree to  dramatically advance the peace process by significantly ceding  some of their present opening stands.    The katyusha which fell in western Galilee and all the  ensuing media coverage, including the delay in the release of  the fact itself, heralds the beginning of an attempt to gauge  the tolerance of the sides to the conflict. The katyusha rocket  had been fired from beyond the security zone, and it does not  matter, therefore, whether it was launched by a Palestinian  member of Hizballah affiliated with one of the rejectionist  organizations, or any one of the other regional elements: After  all, they are all sponsored by Syria. And Syria has proven  before that its determination can prevent terrorist attacks as  soon as it is displayed. That was the case in the weeks before  the Clinton-al-Asad summit, and that was the case as long as the  Syrians indirectly agreed to honor the understandings regarding  Lebanon achieved in the wake of Operation Accountability.    The status of Jerusalem, which is likely to be discussed in  the coming months, the preoccupation with the implementation of  the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians, and the situation in  Lebanon all take Rabin back to his term as prime minister in the  1970's. At that time, post-Yom Kippur War interim arrangements  were on the agenda. Those negotiations were also leisurely,  with ups and downs. And just as now, only American pressure  brought the agreement to fruition.    The prime minister is on the verge of critical decisions,  but  he may very well be unwilling to make them. That is probably  the reason for his almost excessive insistence on security  issues; he does not want to go down in history as the man who  gave up Israel's security values. Furthermore, Rabin seems to  be vacillating whether to take responsibility for an agreement  that will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state and a  total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and he prefers at this  stage to deal only with interim arrangements that will leave  Israel in control of security and avert the need for a physical  withdrawal from the Jordanian border. Gaza, in his opinion,  could have been given up years ago. Similarly, his stand on the  matter of the security arrangements on the Syrian border is that  land concessions will necessarily involve a recognition of  Syrian sovereignty in the Golan Heights.    Rabin does not seem interested in reaching permanent  arrangements at this stage, and his stands sharply contrast with  those of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his aides.    These prime ministerial vacillations make one muse about his  political future. Is it possible that Rabin will end this term  in office and not run for prime minister in 1996? Is it  reasonable to assume that he prefers to leave well-secured  Israel to his successor and not to commit himself to permanent  arrangements? And perhaps the prime minister has also realized  that soon he will have to discuss the issues of Jerusalem, the  Palestinian state, and the Golan withdrawal, all of which will  force him to agree to a geopolitical reality he repudiates.  These are the reasons for his insistence -- justified, from his  vantage point -- on interim arrangements that can stand on their  own feet without a link with the permanent arrangements.    In any event, these impressions are prevalent among members  of a limited group of Israel's top political-defense echelons  with whom Rabin converses as equals.</p>

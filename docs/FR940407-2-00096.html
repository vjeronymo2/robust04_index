This notice will soon be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application for reconsideration states that the Department's survey was inadequate in that only the hard alloy customers were surveyed, not the soft alloy customers. It was also stated that (1) the Russians were dumping large amounts of aluminum in the open market and that (2) workers at two other Alcoa locations were certified for TAA_Newburgh, Indiana and Wenatchee, Washington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation findings show that the workers produce both hard and soft aluminum extrusions and tubes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other investigation findings show that in 1993 Lafayette exited the commercial extrusion (soft alloy) business because of non-trade reasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the workers; firm' major declining customers. The Department's survey showed that none of the respondents reported purchasing imports in the relevant period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On reconsideration, the Department obtained the major declining customers of soft aluminum alloy extrusions. The customers accounted for over half of the 1993 sales decline of all aluminum extrusions. The Department survey on reconsideration found that the respondents did not import soft alloy extrusion during the relevant period but transferred their business from Alcoa to other domestic producers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other findings on reconsideration show that Alcoa's Lafayette ingot production was used internally for the production of extrusions and tubes at Lafayette. Lafayette did not use imported aluminum ingots. Lafayette's ingot production decreased in 1993 because the company exited the soft alloy extrusion business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workers at Alcoa's Newburgh, Indiana (TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,848) and Wenatchee, Washington (TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,882) produced aluminum ingots as the finished article and were certified for TAA because they met all the worker group requirements in the period relevant to their petitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance to workers and former workers of the Aluminum Company of America in Lafayette, Indiana. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC, this 29th day of March 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen A.

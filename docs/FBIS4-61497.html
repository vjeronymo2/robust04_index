			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhi Shamov] </F>   [Excerpts] Makhachkala, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A conference  protocol on examining issues relating to border and customs  control between Russia and Azerbaijan was signed in Makhachkala  today. It recognizes the expediency of speeding up the start of  talks with Azerbaijan to maintain and develop traditional ties  between the residents of border areas of southern Dagestan and  the north of Azerbaijan and their freedom of contact. Until  agreement is reached on these matters it has been decided, in  particular, to establish a border and customs regime that  facilitates as far as possible contact between ethnic Dagestanis  living on both sides of the Samur River.    The protocol was signed, on the Russian side, by Sergey  Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence  Service and member of the Russian Federation Security Council,  and other members of an important delegation from Moscow. The  delegation discussed the sociopolitical situation in Dagestan,  problems on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan, and the  crime situation in the republic. On the Dagestani side, the  protocol was signed by Magomed-Ali Magomedov, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Dagestan, and Abdurazak  Mirzabekov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic  of Dagestan.    Today the Russian Federation delegation met with staff of  the  Federal Counterintelligence Service of Dagestan and held talks  and consultations at the state nationalities committee of the  Republic of Dagestan, where discussion of the problem of the  Lezgin people was continued.    The visiters and hosts noted with satisfaction the  fruitfulness of talks with the Azerbaijani delegation on the  border yesterday, at which an initial understanding was reached  on the Russian and Azerbaijani sides reaching agreement as soon  as possible on the establishment of a "transparent" border for  Dagestanis living in both states. [passage omitted]    Summing up the results of the stay in Dagestan by the  delegation of representatives of the federal authorities in a  conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the delegation's  head, Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service said: "We fulfilled the main points  of our program and have outlined specific proposals to improve  the sociopolitical situation in the republic, particularly in  the south. These will be taken to the president of the Russian  Federation and to members of the state council [as received],  and of the appropriate ministries and departments.    "During yesterday's talks with the Azerbaijani side, members  of its delegation promised to take our proposals on the border  to Geydar Aliyev and other state leaders. And I believe that  talks with them on this matter will begin within the next month.    "As for the issues of terrorism, the rise in crime in the  republic in general, and the Derbent tragedy in particular, I am  sure that these problems will be solved. A special group of top  professionals -- investigators, lawyers, and others -- will come  to Dagestan from Moscow to help with this. I have already  issued the relevant instructions.    "I would like to wish the Dagestani people continued  patience  and wisdom so as to improve the situation through joint efforts."    The delegation of representatives of federal authorities  left  for Kabarda-Balkaria today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira] </F>   [Text] Brazil and the United Kingdom will sign an  extradition accord next week. British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd is examining the Brazilian proposal to create a  businessmen's forum, but talks between Hurd and Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim did not stop there. They also discussed the  environment, free trade zones, and technical cooperation, but  all attention was indeed focused on the extradition accord. The  accord has yet to be signed, but according to Minister Celso  Amorim it will soon become a reality.    [Begin Amorim recording] An extradition accord was proposed  a  long time ago. The idea was not born after the Paulo Cesar  Farias affair. The problem is that in the past the United  Kingdom did not sign extradition accords. That policy has now  changed, and they do sign this sort of accord. The Farias  affair, naturally, made the need more urgent. From that affair  on we began a negotiation process, which is practically  finished. I believe, however, that there is still a small  problem regarding coordination among UK Government departments.  I believe the difficulty resides, practically speaking, in a  language problem. [end recording]    Douglas Hurd has already left for Britain.</p>

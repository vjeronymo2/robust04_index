			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FIELD PUBLICATIONS SALE PENDING  </P> <P> A New York publishing firm is negotiating to buy Field Publications, the  company that publishes Weekly Reader, a news magazine read by more than 10  million schoolchildren each week.  </P> <P> Field Corp., the Chicago-based parent of the Middletown-based publishing arm,  is in the final stages of negotiations with K-III Holdings Inc., Field  executives said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Field has been looking for a buyer for its Middletown subsidiary since summer.  </P> <P> "It's not final, but hopefully it will be final soon," said Bruce Seide,  president of Field Publications.  </P> <P> The negotiations also involve Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc., Field's encyclopedia  affiliate in Ramsey, N.J.  </P> <P> K-III Holdings, the company negotiating for the purchase, was formed in 1989 by  former executives from the publisher Macmillan Inc. and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  &amp; Co., a New York-based leveraged-buyout giant that owns RJR Nabisco Inc.,  Stop &amp; Shop and Duracell.  </P> <P> The family of Marshall Field IV, which owns Field Corp., decided to consider  selling Field Publications to raise cash and not because of the subsidiary's  performance, Seide said.  </P></p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / ELS receivership puts 550 jobs under threat ABOUT 550 jobs were put at risk yesterday at 40 ELS stores throughout England and Wales as administrative receivers were called in at the troubled furniture chain. ELS, which is wholly-owned by the Greater Nottingham Co-operative Society (GNCS), had been particularly badly hit by the collapse of the housing market. According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver, it had suffered 'continuing significant losses'. ELS had turnover of Pounds 50m last year. The company employed 423 full-time workers and 123 part-time staff. KPMG said it would seek to sell the business, or parts of it, as going concerns. It added that the first priority was to ensure that cus-tomer orders were ful-filled. All the stores have been closed to allow stock-taking to be completed. Customers who have paid deposits are advised to telephone the stores from Monday onwards. GNCS, which runs several other businesses, is unaffected by the receivership at ELS. For some weeks, however, the society has been in merger talks with Co-operative Wholesale Society. GNCS's members have approved the merger which is expected to be confirmed by mid-March.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AID HINGES ON FREE ELECTIONS, HAITI IS TOLD;  </P> <P> CARIBBEAN: IN UNUSUALLY TOUGH LANGUAGE, QUAYLE WARNS THE MILITARY: 'NO COUP. NO  MURDERS. NO THREATS.'  </P> <P> Closing a swift tour of four Latin countries, Vice President Dan Quayle arrived  in impoverished Haiti on Thursday with a plea and a blunt warning that unless  its military allows free elections in November, it faces more cuts in foreign  aid.  </P> <P> Using unusually tough language for a diplomatic setting, Quayle told a meeting  of Haitian military officers in the Presidential Palace:  </P> <P> "We take note of the assurances of the Haitian army that they will not allow a  coup and that they will not allow the democratic process to be impeded. So my  message is: No coup. No murders. No threats. And, instead, free and fair  elections that will bring honor to the brave people of Haiti."  </P> <P> Earlier, speaking with reporters on his plane en route from Bolivia, the vice  president, discussing the Haitian elections, said, "If you are going to have a  country that is not democratic and is not respectful of human rights, they are  not going to be recipients of the American taxpayers' money."  </P> <P> American economic aid of $100 million a year was cut drastically in 1987 when  the armed forces, still linked to the despised dictatorships of Presidents  Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, turned elections into a violent and  bloody sham by allowing thugs to massacre more than 30 civilians trying to  vote. Since then, U.S. aid has risen to $60 million a year.  </P> <P> New elections have been set for Nov. 4, and Quayle, in his meetings with Gen.  Herard Abraham, commander-in-chief of the Haitian armed forces, and his top  officers, clearly wanted to ensure that these elections are allowed to proceed  democratically.  </P> <P> "I think Gen. Abraham is committed to having secure elections," Quayle told  reporters. "The question is whether he can implement this."  </P> <P> He said it was important that outsiders like himself come to Haiti before the  elections to impress upon the military the importance of free elections. He  mentioned former President Jimmy Carter and President Carlos Andres Perez of  Venezuela as others who have come to Haiti on similar missions.  </P> <P> He said that Haiti, despite the overthrow of the younger Duvalier in February,  1986, stands with Cuba as the only holdouts against democracy in the  hemisphere.  </P> <P> He said the Bush Administration, which has offered Haiti $3 million to organize  free and secure elections, wants the United Nations to send observers to the  Haiti elections. He discussed this Tuesday, he said, with Perez and President  Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, but he ran into a snag.  </P> <P> While the Bush Administration wants the United Nations to act swiftly through  the Security Council, Perez and Gaviria want action to be taken by the U.N.  General Assembly, which, unlike the Security Council, is dominated by Third  World countries.  </P> <P> "It's a plausible argument," Quayle said, "but time is of the essence." He said  he fears that the General Assembly would act too slowly on observers for Haiti.  </P> <P> Quayle seemed generally optimistic about the chances for fair elections in  Haiti, but he told reporters: "I'm not going to disabuse you of the fact that  there are some very bad people in Haiti. It's a very divided country."  </P></p>

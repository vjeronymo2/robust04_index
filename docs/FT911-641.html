			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Cautious bidding at Christie's: Saleroom CHRISTIE'S leading spring sale of Impressionist and Modern art in New York on Wednesday went the same way as Sotheby's on Tuesday - with cautious bidding and a total well below expectation. The auction brought in Dollars 23.14m (Pounds 13.5m), but with 29 per cent by value unsold. The comparable auction last May totalled Dollars 269.4m. The collapse in demand for expensive Impressionist and Modern art is reflected in the shortage of important works appearing on the market. There was nothing of outstanding quality on offer. The top price was the Dollars 2.2m - above estimate - paid by a private US collector for Les Barricades Mysterieuses, a brooding evening landscape by the Surrealist artist Magritte. Surrealism is riding the recession better than most other Modern movements. La Ville Endormie, shrouded nudes in a classical landscape by the Surrealist Paul Delvaux, sold within forecast for Dollars 1.375m. A Monet view of the fort at Antibes sold to another private US buyer for Dollars 1.87m, below its estimate of Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m. A year ago a painting of this quality would have been expected to achieve at least Dollars 5m. A further picture to sell below forecast was Femme a sa Toilette by Degas, which made Dollars 1.76m. Challenging 20th century works seem more popular than standard Impressionist paintings. Gli Archeologi, a neo-classical canvas by De Chirico, almost doubled its low estimate at Dollars 1.65m. The main disappointments centred on Chagall, including the failure of La Nuit d'Orgeval, with an estimate of Dollars 4m-Dollars 5m, to find a buyer. The Japanese were the main supporters of Chagall and they have deserted the market, as have the dealers.</p>

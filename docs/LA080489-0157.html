			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NO DRIVING FOR DROPOUTS, JUDGE SAYS  </P> <P> A judge today upheld a West Virginia law that allows the state to revoke the  driver's licenses of school dropouts, a law used as a model for pending federal  legislation.  </P> <P> Kanawha County Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib said the law is based on the state's  interest in keeping teen-agers in school, "is not unreasonable and withstands  any constitutional challenge."  </P> <P> The case involved an appeal filed by Michael Means, 17, of Charleston, who lost  his license after he dropped out of junior high one month after his 16th  birthday. Means, whose 16-year-old wife is expecting their first child this  month, says he cannot get a job to support his family without driving  privileges.  </P></p>

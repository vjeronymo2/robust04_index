			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 17 May TASS -- A statement of the press service  of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers on the  Crimean situation has been circulated by mass media today.    The statement runs as follows:    "The recent developments in the Crimea, statements and acts  of the Crimean officials provoke Ukrainian and international  concern over a possibility of sharp deterioration of the Crimean  social and economic situation and formation of a danger and  instability spot in Central Europe.    ``The new leadership of the autonomy has passed over from  declaration of its intentions to actions aiming to change the  legal status of the Autonomous Republic of the Crimea as an  integral party of Ukraine.    ``For instance, a regular meeting of the Crimean Supreme  Soviet plans to discuss the return to specific provisions of the  Crimean Constitution in the edition of 6 May 1992, which ran  counter to the Ukrainian Constitution and were changed by the  Crimean Supreme Soviet itself in September 1992. Thus, an  attempt is being made to revise the current Crimean constitution  and create grounds for the Crimean separation from Ukraine which  would be a gross violation of the Ukrainian territorial  integrity.    ``Attempts of the Crimean leadership to legalize Crimean  citizenship, create the Crimean Armed Forces and change the  status of the city of Sevastopol provoke alarm.    ``All this runs counter to the Ukrainian Constitution and  laws, as well as universally-recognized principles of the  international law.    ``Ambitious strivings of some Crimean politicians run  counter  to the Ukrainian goodwill to contribute to the comprehensive  social, economic and cultural development of the Crimea. It was  the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet that gave the Crimean region a  status of the autonomous republic within Ukraine, adopted a law  `on division of powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean state  power bodies.' The Ukrainian president issued a decree `on  regime of open economy on territory of the Crimean Republic.'  The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has regulated with the  Crimean Government the property issues, the formation of the  budget and implemented a number of measures to stabilize the  Crimean economy.    ``Ukraine is holding a policy to restore historical justice  as regards the deported peoples, and helps the return of Crimean  Tatars to their historical motherland.    ``Instead of fully using the possibilities to overcome the  economic crisis, certain political forces of the Crimean  Autonomous Republic have adopted a different course. They are  clearly speculating on economic difficulties in Ukraine and  other Commonwealth states. Even under these complicated  conditions Ukraine finds it possible to cover the deficit of  Crimean financial and material resources. Despite the objective  realities, anti-Ukrainian and anti-state feelings are being  stirred up among the Crimean population.    ``The facts show that dangerous processes in the Crimean  Republic not only have purely Crimean nature but also, to a  considerable extent, encouraged by certain Russian political  forces, whose actions are growing into clear interference in the  Ukrainian internal affairs.    ``In accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution and the  current legislation, the Republic of Crimea is an integral  autonomous part of Ukraine, which has broad rights in the sphere  of the economy, the use of natural resources, ecology, culture  and public life. Being an integral autonomous part of Ukraine,  the Republic of Crimea is not a carrier of state sovereignty and  cannot have political relations with foreign states.    ``The Ukrainian Constitution is valid throughout Ukraine,  including the Crimea. The Ukrainian territory is single,  indivisible, inviolable and integral. The Republic of Crimea  cannot have its own, separated from Ukraine, citizenship.  Citizens of the Crimean Republic are also citizens of Ukraine.  The autonomy cannot have its own armed forces.    ``The press service of the Ukrainian president and the  Cabinet of Ministers is authorized to state that the Ukrainian  president and the Supreme Soviet will take all measures  necessary to stabilize the Crimean political situation and  ensure territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Ukrainian  president will provide for unconditional observation of the  Ukrainian Constitution and laws throughout territory of the  state, including the Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine.    ``The press service of the Ukrainian president and the  Cabinet of Ministers calls attention to the fact that some  Russian politicians and public figures are breaking the rules  and norms of behavior on territory of a foreign state. In this  connection any further attempts to interfere in the Ukrainian  internal affairs will be resolutely stopped in accordance with  the current Ukrainian legislation.''</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Executor's entitlement I am sole executor in a relation's will. I paid a lot of her bills out of my own resources, some of these arising before I had power of attorney. I kept a record of these as I had been looking after her affairs for some two years. Clearly I wish to debit her estate with these before inheritance tax is levied as they fell due before her death. The solicitor is implying that I should have mentioned these before obtaining probate. Is it not enough to give records in the corrective affidavit? They amount to nearly Pounds 2,000. I note that you have paid bills on behalf of the estate and have now obtained probate. It should be possible to obtain a corrective affidavit to take the expenses into account when calculating inheritance tax and also ensure that you can obtain a rebate. If an executor advances money out of his own pocket to pay the debts of his testator, he is entitled to be repaid in full, in priority to the creditors. He is also entitled to an allowance of interest for the money so advanced. Repayment will come from the estate and his liability must be allowed for in calculating inheritance tax.

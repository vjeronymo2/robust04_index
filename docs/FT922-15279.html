			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: A limited nostalgia Sir, Barry Riley's piece on Office Block Mania ('Canary that could not fly', March 28) was apposite. Could you please look up your records to see whether Barry Riley's predecessors wrote similar items on Railway Mania, and before that, Canal Mania? To those of us inhabiting the shallows of the small business community it is tremendously reassuring to watch the really big fish making silly mistakes. I should imagine the scope for the office block nostalgia industry is strictly limited. Bill Badger, The Corner House, Top of Searle Street, Crediton, Devon</p>

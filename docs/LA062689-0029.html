			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENIOR DRIVERS  </P> <P> Much publicity has been properly given to the valiant efforts of the Police  Department to cut down on accidents resulting from drunk drivers. This is a  major effort, which is rightfully applauded by all citizens.  </P> <P> I have a suggestion that I think will contribute a great deal to safety on the  highways. I believe all citizens over the age of 75 (which includes me) should  have their license renewed for only one year at a time and that an actual  driving test be mandatory.  </P> <P> There are far too many senior citizens on the roads that, if subjected to a  driving test, would fail to pass. And this group too constitutes a safety  hazard.  </P> <P> ARMAND S. DEUTSCH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

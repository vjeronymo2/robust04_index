The Ministry of Communications decided to construct  expressways at the beginning of the 1980s when the country's  economy began to boom.    Building of the first one started in 1984 in northeast  China,  from Shenyang to Dalian. After its completion in 1990, the  375-km- long road brought with it great economic and social  efficiency.    The ministry made a long-term program in 1988 to build a  national highway network in several five-year plan periods.  Since then, some expressways have been built from Guangzhou to  Foshan, Xian to Lintong, Beijing to Tianjin and Beijing to  Shijiazhuang.    Several expressways from Shanghai to Nanjing, Guangzhou to  Shenzhen and Hangzhou to Ningbo are now under construction.    These expressways have given an impetus to the local  economic  development along these roads. Some industrial zones and  economic development areas have arisen along the routes.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: Liza Minnelli - Pop Liza tells us that when she was a youngster she used to sit on the stairs at Sammy Davis Junior's Hollywood mansion and listen to the adults enjoy a sing-song around the piano. Brando, Dali, Monroe, Dietrich, Sinatra did their party pieces with James Stewart rather improbably rattling the ivories. Ah, happy days. Now, so many breakdowns, marriages and traumas later, Liza Minnelli stands almost alone in perpetuating the show biz tradition she was raised in, the old trouper for ever smiling through, alive only on stage. Any performance by Liza Minnelli is bound to be heavily seasoned with schmaltz. When she committed herself to holding a charity tribute, 'paying back something to Sammy', the sentimentality was guaranteed to be boundless. In the event the evening was beyond criticism because it raised over Pounds 500,000 for cancer charities in the UK and the US. It also delivered the personalities that the audience craved. On to the stage in the round, like bulls entering an arena for their brief moment of glory, bounced an extraordinary mishmash of stars. Why, that's Jerry Lewis; it's Tom Jones; surely Joan Collins; and Charles Aznavour; and Cliff. There was room, too, for that ineffable sidekick of the stars, Lionel Blair, who can always be relied on to put in an appearance rather than put on a performance. The only time the audience hesitated was when Liza's sister, Lorna Luft, did her party piece. In the event her Sammy Davis story capped them all - he was actually present at her birth. No matter that many read their tributes from the autocue - they'd answered the call. The second half was all Liza. The voice may be dodgy, especially in the high notes, and the movement less spring- heeled, but no one can publicly emote like Ms Minnelli. There were too many of those noisy tuneless songs inspired by positive thinking, epitomised by the newly penned 'Yes I can'. And the Newley-Bricuse songbook featured too prominently. But you have to admire Liza - if she'd been on the Titantic she'd have gone down tapping. There was even a medley of real style, of classic standards ('Just You; Just me'; 'Never be Another You'), the songs the stars sang 'At Sammy's House'. At the end the greasepaint crown was passed on - the tributes transferred from Sammy to Liza. Sinatra was on screen to seal the show, and then Jerry Lewis gave Liza the first 'Sammy', which looked like an African fertility symbol. Judging by the praises sung - his generosity, his friendship, his professionalism - Davis is on his way to a swift sainthood. The man himself, in a remarkably frank autobiography, painted a portrait of a frankly reprehensible person redeemed by his honesty. But for one night the audience, who enjoyed the privilege as cardholders of American Express, the sponsors of the show, could take a peep at the garish, glitzy world of entertainment and go thankfully home to their discreet beds.</p>

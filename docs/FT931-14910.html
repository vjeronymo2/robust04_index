			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Denmans Electrical advances 21% SHARES OF Denmans Electrical, the USM-quoted electrical goods group, were yesterday marked 50p higher in a thin market to 275p after a 21 per cent profits advance. On turnover of Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 34.5m), pre-tax profits for the 12 months to September 30 rose from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.52m. Mr Arnold Denman, chairman, said that stringent cost controls had again contributed to the improvement in margins. Recession in the building industry continued to affect the wholesale business. Profits were again depressed by an exceptionally high level of bad debts, Mr Denman said. The Euroelectric importing and distribution side achieved 'significant growth' in sales and improved profits, while the Eterna Lighting manufacturing operation reported increased profits despite higher costs from assimilating new products. These products helped Eterna maintain volumes in spite of 'severly depressed' traditional markets, he added. The final dividend is raised to 4.3p making a total of 6.1p (5.85p), covered just under 4 times by earnings of 23.73p (18.75p) per share.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / SFr200m frozen in Schneider's accounts A Swiss prosecutor has frozen some SFr200m (Pounds 94m) in accounts in Geneva banks connected to the fugitive German property developer, Mr Jurgen Schneider, for whom a Frankfurt court yesterday issued an arrest warrant. The 59-year-old entrepreneur, who has been missing since early this month, is charged with fraud and falsification of documents in connection with a DM45m (Pounds 18m) loan obtained from Deutsche Bank for financing the 'Les Facettes' development in the centre of Frankfurt. Mr Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a prosecutor in Geneva, said he took the action to freeze Mr Schneider's assets last week following a formal accusation of money laundering made in Geneva 'by a Frankfurt bank'. The accounts were 'directly or indirectly' related to Mr Schneider, he said, and were held at 'several Geneva banking institutions'. He would not name the banks, and Swiss bank secrecy law prevents the banks themselves from revealing whether Mr Schneider is a client. The SFr200m sum is close to the DM219m that Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, on Monday accused Mr Schneider of taking out of his group before fleeing Germany. Mr Kopper claimed that Mr Schneider had transferred the money during March from time deposit accounts at German institutions to foreign accounts. Mr Hellmut Hartmann, Deutsche Bank's press spokesman, refused to confirm yesterday that the money had been frozen at the bank's request. The Schneider group collapsed on April 15 with debts of more than DM5bn. On Monday Deutsche Bank, which is owed DM1.2bn, blamed the collapse of Schneider on systematic fraud. The bank admitted its image had suffered as a result but said the direct financial losses would be limited to a few hundred million D-Marks, to be written off in the 1994 accounts. The Swiss prosecutor responded immediately to the German bank's complaint. Under Swiss law, a prosecutor can act if a victim of a suspected financial crime, even if foreign, submits charges. It is no longer necessary to wait for the customary government-to-government lettres rogatoires. He can also open an inquiry if, as in this case, charges of money laundering are filed. However, the party making the charges cannot have access to the results of the investigation. There is no limit on the time the accounts can be frozen, although the account holders may appeal against the freezing. In another development, Mr Dieter Vogel, the spokesman for the German government, said yesterday that some 250 small construction companies had registered themselves as affected by the collapse. They are based mainly in the Leipzig and Frankfurt areas and are owed a total of DM250m, Mr Vogel said. Most had 20 employees or less. The government, acutely conscious of the knock-on effects of the affair on the small business sector in an election year, has committed itself to help companies weather the storm. Mr Vogel said that the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the public sector bank specialising in development credit, would provide bridging credits to the stricken companies.</p>

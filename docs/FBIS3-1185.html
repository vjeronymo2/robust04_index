			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Goldstone Unfair to Police Generals in Gun Running Probe --  "We would be the first to condemn any police involvement in  Third Force activities," declares the page-6 editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 21 March. "However, we  do not think that Mr Justice Richard Goldstone has been fair to  the three police generals who were said to have been involved in  gun running and other activities. He admitted that the prime  facie, untested evidence should be subjected to the normal  judicial processes." Therefore, if any policeman is guilty of  being involved in Third Force activities, "he deserves to be  prosecuted and punished. Conversely, if some or all of them,  including the generals, have been unjustly maligned, then we  hope their names will be cleared if not by the commission, then  by the courts."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Call for Security Forces Deployment in Natal -- "For two  weekends in succession the ANC [African National Congress] has  been unable to hold planned rallies in townships near Durban,"  notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on  22 March. "On the first IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] zealots  occupied a stadium in Umlazi which had been booked in advance by  the ANC; on the second `Zulus', suspected of being IFP  loyalists, again thwarted the ANC by occupying a stadium in  kwaMashu. Major conflict was avoided but the portents of a  major disaster are there for all to see." It is "good" that the  Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is "sufficiently  concerned" to arrange meetings with President de Klerk, Nelson  Mandela, and the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly. But, "it is not  enough," and security forces must be "deployed in strength, not  to overthrow Mangosuthu Buthelezi but to ensure that all parties  have the right to campaign peacefully and that all voters have  the right to vote or not to vote. The situation must not be  allowed to degenerate into chaos."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Call for No Vote for Prisoners -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY  in English on 22 March in a page-14 editorial remarks that "the  TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has shown little backbone,  particularly for anything the ANC does not want. The ANC is  among the parties wanting to slip a ballot paper under every  cell door. Prison riots may be all that is needed to persuade  the council that any perpetrator of any crime, no matter how  heinous, should have a say in the composition of the next  government. The answer to that proposition must remain a firm  no."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   `Unrealistic Expectations' of Prisoners -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 22 March in a page-10 editorial is "aghast  at the violence that has led to the death of 23 people in prison  riots." "The Prisons Department, unhappily, is shrouded in  secrecy forced upon it by apartheid laws. Such laws must  disappear in the South Africa of the future. Those friends of  the prisoners, who may be sparking unrealistic expectations,  should be wary of causing more harm than help to their charges."  <H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>   Zwelithini, Buthelezi Conceal True Intentions --  Johannesburg  CITY PRESS in English on 20 March in a page-18 editorial is not  surprised by the proclamation on 18 March of a sovereign  kwaZulu/natal kingdom by Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini.  Zwelithini and Chief Minister Buthelezi "were determined to  break up this country. However, they concealed their true  intentions with claims that all they wanted was greater powers  for the regions. Now, the pretence is over. By this decision  King Goodwill and Chief Buthelezi and the King must be stopped.  We cannot allow a coterie of power-hungry potentates to  dismember the country." "The unpalatable truth is that  Buthelezi was never keen on testing his popularity at the polls.  All that he wanted was kwaZulu/Natal. To achieve that he seems  prepared to go to any lengths."</p>

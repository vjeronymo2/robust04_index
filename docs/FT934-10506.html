			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Conservatives in SA talks The South African government and the conservative Freedom Alliance ended two days of talks yesterday and agreed to meet again next week to try to resolve differences stalling the transition to black rule, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The two sides said they were committed to trying to finalise outstanding problems in the shortest possible time. Issues debated included self-determination, boundaries, citizenship and taxation. More bilateral talks would take place next week. The government called the talks with the black and white pro-federalists in the umbrella alliance to try to draw them back into mainstream negotiations on the new South Africa.</p>

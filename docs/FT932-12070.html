			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Morale suffers in the old east: The consensus is it has not been a good week for east Germany SOME east Germans might believe in the conspiracy view of history. Others might put it down to a string of unfortunate coincidences. Either way, the consensus is that this has not been a good week for eastern Germany. First there was a fire - allegedly arson - at the central land registry at Barby, near Magdeburg, in eastern Germany. This is usually the place where anyone seeking restitution or compensation for property confiscated either by the Nazis or the communists comes to identify what happened to their land over the past 50 years. In an old castle which has become a huge storeroom, shelves stretching for some 15 km hold large, bound books. Little is on computer. The authorities reckon that thousands of pre-war records were destroyed in the fire. The point is that, despite priority given to investors over restitution, sorting out who owns what before final investment decisions are made might well be further delayed. Then there was the decision by the European Commission against recommending public subsidies by the German government to modernise Ekostahl, the largest steel producer in eastern Germany. Located near the Polish border, Ekostahl, which in its heyday employed more than 11,000 people, sustains the town and environs of Eisenhuttenstadt, with a population of 50,000. The Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern German industry and which owns Ekostahl, has thrown its weight behind turning the plant into a mini-mill: equipped with a highly-skilled work force of about 1,000, producing over 1m tons of high-quality steel a year and capable of competing with the best of west German steel manufacturers. The problem is that a hot-rolling mill and, at a later stage, a mini-mill providing steel to the Opel car plant in eastern Germany, would require subsidies of well over DM1.1bn (Pounds 440m). The western German steel federation has opposed the idea - not just because it would re-open the question about over-capacity in Germany; but, as Treuhand officials admit, the west Germans do not want competitive steel from eastern Germany. To damp morale even further, IG Metall, (western) Germany's powerful engineering union, obtained, what it believed was a resounding vote of confidence by eastern German steel, and engineering workers to stage an all-out strike in eastern Germany, beginning next week. The irony is that workers at Ekostahl openly say they would prefer to work and not strike. IG Metall wants to use the strike to force employers to rescind a contract, signed in March 1991, between employers, the unions, and eastern German managers. That contract would have equalised eastern and western German wages by April 1994. The employers pulled out of the contract, invoking a revision clause allowing them to do so if economic conditions had changed radically for the worse. IG Metall has persistently argued that the employers wanted to get rid of the traditional system of collective wage bargaining. Ambiguity towards a strike among eastern Germans was tapped by IG Metall, whose message to the region's workers was blunt. 'Since the easterners are going to be unemployed sooner or later, they might as well vote for a strike in support of higher wages so that they can obtain higher unemployment benefit,' one union official explained. IG Metall, which also wanted to prove that it could reawaken 'working-class consciousness', suffocated by the Nazis and the communists, and display its own power. But if strikes do take place, and if investors pull out, IG Metall through further job losses in eastern Germany will lose more members. In 1991, it had more than 750,000 in the region. Today, it has less than 400,000. Moreover, strikes would weaken further eastern Germany's attempts at becoming competitive through low labour costs. It is precisely the difficulty in making eastern industry competitive, and the persistent lack of confidence, which links this week's incidents. Employers' associations and unions admit that decisions over the east's wage dispute are made at the 'centre', where they are based. 'The eastern German states have no power whatsoever. In some ways, the wage dispute is about a power struggle between Cologne and Frankfurt,' an official from Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association said.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bank report supports derivatives Derivative instruments are more a consequence than a cause of instability in currencies and interest rates, according to a report issued by the central banks of the G10 countries. Concern has been expressed that growing use of derivatives might add volatility to financial markets and create the risk of a system-wide financial crisis. The report, prepared by a working group headed by Mr Herve Hannoun, deputy governor of the Bank of France, says that derivatives are only one of the innovations which have altered financial market behaviour. The report argues that derivatives make markets more efficient and should, under normal conditions, have a stabilising influence. However, in times of stress the derivatives can amplify price movements. Central banks can avoid contributing to market instability by following a 'strategy that is predictable and well-explained to the public' and by implementing that strategy 'in a consistent manner so as to aid the formation of non-inflationary expectations'. Derivatives do not diminish the control that monetary policy has over inflation, and the limited evidence available suggests they have yet to alter significantly the efficacy of monetary instruments. Macroeconomic and monetary policy issues raised by the growth of derivatives markets: a report by a working group established by the Eurocurrency standing committee of the central banks of the Group of 10 countries, published by the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.</p>

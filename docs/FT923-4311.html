			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Cavallo firm on Argentine austerity MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday lashed out at critics who are seeking to soften his strictly orthodox policies by demanding an increase in government spending. In a hard-hitting speech at a conference of bankers, Mr Cavallo warned that Argentina's disastrous experience with inflation meant that 'we cannot have a fiscal deficit for many years. We must revive the idea of budgetary restrictions: that we only spend what we raise in taxes. It would be foolish for us to throw away all we have achieved and return to inflation. That hurts the poor most of all.' His speech comes after a week of vicious infighting within the government, in which even President Carlos Menem seemed to withhold support from the minister. Mr Cavallo is being blamed by the opposition and some cabinet colleagues for worsening poverty. Mr Cavallo said: 'In September we have reached the maximum bearable level for public spending in Argentina.' Spending in 1993 would be held at its present level. Earlier this year he told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) he would boost current spending in line with economic growth. In 1993 it was to rise 7 per cent over 1992 to about Dollars 35bn (Pounds 17.5bn). However, Mr Cavallo said a Dollars 300m monthly increase in pensions now meant that spending would be frozen. Just as spending has reached the limit, so has the tax burden. He said that, while his campaign against tax evasion would continue, added revenue would not be used to increase spending but to eliminate inefficient taxes. The minister also called on the private sector to make greater efforts to become competitive, instead of demanding protection. However, the business community accuses Mr Cavallo of inaction in reforming the labour market, which they say is the principal source of Argentina's poor international competitiveness.</p>

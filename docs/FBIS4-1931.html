			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The Economics Ministry is revising the nation's  automobile industry development strategy in a bid to prepare  Taiwan for admission into the General Agreement on Tariff and  Trade, or GATT. According to the revision, import duties on  compact passenger cars will be slashed and the ban on imports  from Japan and South Korea will be lifted. Officials said  Japan, South Korea, and Hungary have requested specifically that  Taiwan open its automobile market. On the other hand, Taiwan  will emulate other countries in dealing with the imports of  Japanese-made cars; that is, Japan will be required to impose a  quota on such exports to Taiwan on its own in order not to  disrupt market order on the island.</p>

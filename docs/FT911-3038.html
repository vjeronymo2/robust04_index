			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fraudsters face a fist fight FINGERPRINTS and retina scans have been tipped as two ways of ensuring security and preventing fraud. Now a further 'biometric' device has been developed that could prove more effective in maintaining security in financial transactions, such as withdrawing cash from hole-in-the wall machines. Veincheck, developed by Cambridge Consultants and the British Technology Group, verifies a person's identity by the internal vein pattern on the back of the hand. By passing a clenched fist under a scanning camera for a fraction of a second an infra-red beam can scan the veins and the hand shape and recognise the unique pattern. This pattern is compared with a digital representation of it stored on a plastic card to verify the identity of the person. The developers believe the system will be more readily accepted by the public than other more obtrusive biometric equipment. They are now looking for funding to help commercialise the product - a demonstrator machine is now in operation. Veincheck could be incorporated in cash-point machines within two years.

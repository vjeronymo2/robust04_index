			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Advert 'untruths' are attacked THE Advertising Standards Authority has accused estate agents and property developers of using 'blatant untruths' and 'hidden conditions' in advertising intended to tempt customers in a collapsed market. In its latest monthly report, the authority quotes a housebuilder claiming that a development was in quiet countryside when it was next to a busy military airbase. The authority said some estate agents were using misleading illustrations of property. 'Advertisers have been known to feature houses unbeknown to their owners,' it explained. The report covers complaints about advertising against more than 100 companies. Among those rejected by the authority, an independent self-regulatory body, was one filed against Co-operative Bank by the Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association. It objected to some of the bank's advertisements that were critical of cosmetic testing on animals and were used by the bank to promote its investment policies. The authority upheld one complaint against a British Airways newspaper advertisement which promoted a 'return ticket to the USA from Pounds 309', but failed to mention that the offer required a minimum one-week stay. Forte Hotels was found to have misled customers through an advertisement promoting a special offer of a three-night break for Pounds 113, which included a table d'hote menu. The complainant discovered that no such menu had been on offer at any of the hotels in the chain for the previous 12 months.</p>

Noting that to establish an independent and democratic  government in South Korea is the main goal of the struggle for  independence and democracy, the author of the article says:    It will be a government based on the anti-U.S., anti-fascist  united front and a coalition government made up of  representatives of various classes, strata, political parties,  groupings and political forces joining in the struggle for  independence and democracy.    Only when an independent and democratic coalition government  is established on the grave of the colonial fascist  dictatorship, is it possible for the South Korean people to  bring about a historical turn in saving their livelihood from  distress and defending human dignity and national independence.</p>

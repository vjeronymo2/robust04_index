			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Gas plan 'may force prices up' THE GAS Consumers' Council said yesterday that prices for domestic consumers could rise if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission forced British Gas to sell its pipelines and storage arm as proposed by Ofgas, the industry regulator. Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, said in a letter to the commission, which is reviewing the structure of British Gas's business: 'The council is not convinced that consumers will gain more from total divestment in the manner that Ofgas has recommended.' The consumers' council, which represents the interests of customers, said Ofgas's proposals threatened price stability to industry, commerce and householders throughout Britain. British Gas has already agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to put its transportation division into a separate subsidiary. But Ofgas believes true competition will not be achieved until the pipelines business is under separate ownership. Mr Cooper said: 'I think Ofgas runs the risk of jeopardising some of the tremendous achievements it has made, such as the 'RPI minus 5' pricing formula.' The tough formula restricts British Gas's price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation for the next five years, which means price cuts when inflation falls below 5 per cent. Mr Cooper said the council was greatly concerned about how a residual gas trading company, acting on its own and with few assets, would maintain the service to consumers that an integrated British Gas now provided. The sale of the pipelines business would leave a gas trading company that might not be able to meet its supply obligations, Mr Cooper said. 'These changes are irreversible, it can't just be changed back if it doesn't work.' He said he was not necessarily against the sale of the pipelines business. 'What we're trying to say is: prove to us that it's a good idea.' Mr Cooper also said he had yet to receive any proof from Ofgas that its proposals would benefit consumers. 'The package consumers have, which gives British Gas a supply obligation and keeps prices low, is a good one and we want some pretty strong proof that anything that puts that at risk will be better for consumers.' Ofgas, however, believes more competition means more choice for consumers. Mr John Dorken, deputy director of Ofgas, said: 'I don't see that it necessarily leads to an increase in prices.' Ofgas wanted to spell out the way forward for the industry, said Mr Dorken, and not move in a piecemeal way. 'The Gas Consumers' Council is taking a slower, more cautious approach,' he said. The regulator is due to make a further announcement next week about the future of British Gas, including the way pipelines could be separated from the rest of the company.</p>

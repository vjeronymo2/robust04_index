			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT WILL NAME TRULY TO HEAD NASA  </P> <P> President Bush turned Wednesday to Navy Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, a veteran  of two space shuttle flights, to take over the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration.  </P> <P> "This marks the first time in its distinguished history that NASA will be led  by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has been to space," Bush said at  a White House ceremony at which he announced his plans to nominate Truly to  succeed James C. Fletcher.  </P> <P> Truly has been the agency's associate administrator for space flight since  1986. He was the pilot of the Columbia on the second shuttle flight, and  commanded the eighth flight.  </P> <P> He became a central figure in the agency's operations after the Challenger  disaster on Jan. 28, 1986, leading the NASA recovery team and taking charge of  the redesign of the shuttle's boosters and safety procedures.  </P> <P> Design flaws in the boosters were blamed for the Challenger disaster. After  their redesign and an overhaul of safety operations, the shuttle program  resumed flights last September.  </P> <P> As an active duty naval officer, Truly must obtain the assent of Congress to  move into a job designated for a civilian. A White House spokesman said that  such approval has been obtained. Senate confirmation also is required.  </P> <P> Truly holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from the Georgia  Institute of Technology and was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy in  1959.  </P></p>

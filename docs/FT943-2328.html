			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Full Channel rail link for cars to start in November A full Channel tunnel passenger service for drivers and their cars will be phased in from mid-November, Eurotunnel, the tunnel operating company, said yesterday. Eurotunnel expects to obtain safety clearance from the intergovernmental commission in the next few weeks, clearing the way for the long-delayed start of its passenger shuttle service. This will carry cars and their drivers between Folkestone and Calais. Shortly after shuttle ser-vices start inter-city Eurostar trains will also begin running between London and Paris and Brussels. It will be next spring, however, before both services are operating a full capacity. The launch of Channel tunnel passenger services has been dogged by technical and safety problems in recent months. It had been hoped to start services about the time of the official inauguration on May 6. Freight services have been running since the end of May. In the approach to the launch of the full turn-up-and-go shuttle operations on November 15 Eurotunnel will run an 'overture' service from October 3. This will be open to all shareholders, people in the travel trade and other 'opinion formers', although they will have to make a reservation and pay Pounds 30 to cover administration costs. This service will operate five days a week between 8am and 8pm. In addition, shareholders eligible for the free or cut-price journeys under travel privileges attached to the 1987 share offering and the 1990 rights issue will be able use their privileges from November 15. Eurotunnel said it had carried 10,000 cars through the tunnel in the past two weeks as part of its testing programme. It will be next spring at the earliest before Eurotunnel is running its full proposed service of four shuttle departures an hour. European Passenger Services, operator of the Eurostar trains, said that it would wait to obtain safety clearance before announcing its fares and the date when services would start. It has been running four trains a day through the tunnel, carrying up to 400 members of staff for training sessions. Safety clearance would allow it to run fully loaded trains carrying up to 800 people and to complete its training programme.</p>

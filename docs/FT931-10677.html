			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Private View: Sex secrets of art history HE WAS A white male 'colonizing tourist' who, to boost his career, went to Tahiti and exploited a 13-year-old girl called Teha'amana, his native wife, by painting her naked on a bed. That is Gauguin, as seen through the eyes of Professor Griselda Pollock, a feminist art historian. To be sure, she does not put it quite so baldly. Here is a specimen comment on Gauguin's nude, Manao Tupapau, from a book of hers published this week: 'The culturally feminized and racially othered body also carries the projected burden of the cultural lack - the ennui - experienced by some of the Western bourgeoisie in the face of capitalism's modernity.' Well, I suppose she is right. I felt a bit like that myself when I visited Tahiti and was asked by the beautiful leading canoeist of Brando's Mutiny on the Bounty if I would like to marry her daughter. But does it matter to Art if Gauguin behaved like a pig with women? I complained to Prof Pollock: You never say whether you think Gauguin was a good painter or not. 'I don't think it's particularly relevant,' she answered. 'You see, assuming that the only justification for studying anything in the past is because we think it is good raises the question: Good for whom? Who said so? By what criteria? I much prefer to say: historically these people were active.' Griselda Pollock is Professor of Social and Critical Histories of Art at the University of Leeds in Yorkshire. She is a leading British feminist with a Marxist perspective who represents what is called the new art history. She has the reputation of being very tough and ambitious. After reading her new book and her earlier Old Mistresses written with fellow-feminist Rozsika Parker - the title is the only joke in it - I did not expect to find a prettily-smiling feminine person with fluffy blonde hair (OK, it was dark at the roots) nor to hear her admit: 'People often say they expected something different from this sort of floozy blonde.' But I soon saw the tough side. The moment we sat down she switched on a tape-recorder. Prof Pollock started by explaining her version of the new art history. She told me it was not only about 'the repressed question of gender'. It was not even about restoring to women painters (there are few in history, but not as few as you think) the place denied them by men. Its domain included race and class, exploitation and profit, the way curators 'choreograph' painters' work and art experts manipulate their saleroom value. The idea that works of art are purely aesthetic objects is a 20th-century fetish, she said. Nor was she engaged in psycho-biography. 'I am not trying to peek in, to get behind the mask and tell you the inner man. I'm trying to work from the pictures to construct the conditions of those pictures' production, what motivated them, how they were first perceived.' Do you actually look at paintings? 'Social historians pay infinitely more attention to art than the traditional art historians,' she replied firmly. Prof Pollock is convincing but long-winded. It was difficult to interrupt her. When I asked her whether she actually liked painting, or preferred one painter to another, she finally relented. 'Yes. Ten years ago I would have said art is the product of the social and ideological conditions of its time, which is a strategy for distancing yourself from the overwhelmingly celebratory, mystical view. 'Now I feel much more able to relax a bit and say I think it's wonderful. I mean, I think art is so brilliant. I admire the whole process. I wouldn't dedictate my life to studying it, I wouldn't be so hungry to understand it, if I was not quite literally made speechless with admiration at what artists can do.' Do you get the same feeling when you see an exhibition of dirty nappy-liners? (I was referring to Mary Kelly's Post-Partum Document shown at the ICA in 1976). She replied: 'It wasn't an exhibition of nappy liners. That's a Daily Mail view. It's in the ordering, not the objects. Mary Kelly's work is deeply imprinted with the aesthetic preferences of minimalism.' Just as the message of a Rubens painting of Christ depended on the spectator's knowledge, conceptual art was legible to those who bothered to learn the language. Why are you a feminist art historian, not just a female one? 'There are no such things as female art historians. If you are a woman you are required to be a professional transvestite. To be a feminist art historian is to say the world might be slightly different from the point of view of women. Women travel in social space differently. I can't walk down the street in the same way as you do.' I asked her about The Nude. Is it wrong for men to have used women's bodies for so many hundreds of years? 'Not wrong in the moral sense. It is typical of our culture in so far as it privileges masculinity.' You quote with approval a theory that men's idealisation of naked women is due to their fear of losing their willies. Might it not just be because they like the look of a naked woman lying on a bed? 'If you liked the look of a naked woman lying on a bed you wouldn't make nudes. If you actually liked women, as Stanley Spencer seems to have done, you would look at the form in which their bodies actually come. The point is that looking at women is extremely difficult for men because the body of woman has become for men a sign of the danger to themselves. 'I don't say you can't have your fantasies. But at whose cost? That's what most women feel. We are not in this culture, we are the objects of it.' Griselda Pollock is not struggling against her own biology. She is married, to a Reader in computer science at the same university and they have two children. 'He wanted children as much as I do,' she said. 'I have to struggle with him to get back enough of my children to satisfy my maternal needs.' She was born in South Africa, lived in Toronto and Quebec and came to England in her teens. Her father worked for big tobacco companies and her mother died young. She went to Oxford University: 'I was horrified to discover that men found it tiresome and unattractive that I was intelligent.' Weren't you pretty too? 'I was a sad, earnest young woman who wanted to get an education, and passionately wanted to be allowed to be a thoughtful and sensible person. 'I saw these louts who'd got degrees by playing rugby and so on while we were being told (by the careers office) to go and be these men's secretaries. I thought that was unbelievably unjust.' At the Courtauld Institute she was asked to give up her scholarship in favour of a man, realised the women students were not being groomed to run the National Gallery one day and replied by setting up a women's art history collective. The professor may be prettier than her prose, but she can be just as prickly. We were discussing whether pictures should be studied by gender (a word that in feminist vocabulary seems to imply a choice) when she dropped in the fact that she was Jewish. When I asked her later whether she was born Jewish or was converted on her marriage, she refused to answer. (It may be because she rejects the notion that anyone can be born Jewish.) Twice subsequently she accused me of offensive, anti-Semitic language: in using the word 'disciple' to describe her readers and the word 'jargon' to describe her prose style. Jargon, she said, was a German word for Yiddish. (I could find no support for this in the dictionary). She was much angrier when I accused her of writing in a way that obscured an interesting story and using terminology that would appeal only to feminists. An altercation ensued and she said: 'I write with incredible passion and with a sense this is relevant, not academic. It may be hard, it may be challenging, it may be unfamiliar vocabulary. But I will not give an inch to what I see as philistine, anti-intellectual British middle-class complacency.' I hoisted the white flag and conceded it might be the message not the words I found difficult; she, in turn, conceded that her tone was often 'relentless'. We returned to the safer subject of sex. Prof Pollock became engaging and said it was a wonder to her that girls managed to grow up heterosexual after their early attachment to the mother. It was the excuse I needed. Did you find it difficult to love men? She was not flustered. 'I get on extremely well with most men. I am happily married and I have friends of all sexes and sexual orientations.' You've never been a lesbian? 'No, no,' she said, but musingly. She recalled a stage of her activism which she described as a kind of political lesbianism. 'I have very many dear, dear friends who are lesbians. But no. On the other hand, it's very difficult because I don't think men in general find powerful, intelligent women particularly attractive. 'I sometimes wish men were more understanding of their own anxieties so that they could take responsibility for them and engage more easily with women who are attractive as people. 'To be an attractive woman in a situation like I am means that men just get horribly confused all the time. Because I'm meant to be the receiver of their intellect and then I'm meant to give the gift of my sexual compliance. That's the game. When I promise to be 'a good wife in Israel' (the phrase from the marriage service) I take that very seriously. I am not available for gameplaying. 'I am deeply concerned with violence and violation, and art is concerned as much with that as it is with what is subtle, empowering, creative. We need to have both versions of it.' The wrestling over, Professor Pollock was flushed but smiling sweetly once more. Conscious now of my masculine deficiencies I tried my best to look neutral. Forget the tender trap, I thought. This is the gender trap. Avant-Garde Gambits, the 1992 Walter Neurath memorial lecture; is published by Thames and Hudson, Pounds 6.95.</p>

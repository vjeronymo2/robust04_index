			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The UN  Security Council today changed the brief of its Somalia  peacekeeping mission (UNOSOM) by deciding to abandon any attempt  to disarm Somalia factions by force.    In a unanimous resolution, the council limited UNOSOM's  mandate to assisting the Somalia parties in achieving national  reconciliation, providing humanitarian relief and protecting  major ports and airport, etc.    A direct outcome was that the council also authorized a  gradual reduction of the UN Somalia peacekeeping forces to  22,000.    The UN Operation had over 30,000 soldiers at its peak and  currently there are about 25,700 troops.    The resolution follows the UN's failure to forcibly disarm  Somalia factions.    U.S. troops last summer masterminded operations in Mogadishu  in a search for faction leader Mohamed Farah Aidid, whose  supporters were accused of killing 25 Pakistani peacekeepers in  June.    When 18 U.S. soldiers were killed on October 3, the United  States, facing strong domestic opposition to military  involvement in Somalia, announced it would complete its  withdrawal by the end of March.    Since then the UN policy towards Somalia has been under  scrutiny.    The Chinese ambassador to the UN, Li Zhaoxing, noted the  importance of a political settlement on the issue.    "The international community had become increasingly aware  that the final solution to the Somali question lies within the  Somali people themselves and the key to it is the realization of  broadly- based national reconciliation," he said.    "UNOSOM's experience and lessons have shown that the  fundamental and effective way for a settlement is by peaceful  means. Resorting to military action will only serve to  complicate the matter," he added.</p>

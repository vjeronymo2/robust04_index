			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips 4 per cent on futures selling STOCKS closed sharply lower on futures-linked selling and publication of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly economic survey, which showed business confidence at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 800.78 or 4.2 per cent to 18,107.69, a 2.4 per cent decline on the week, closing just above its intraday low of 18,097.55 after a high of 18,902.85 in the morning session.

'Bad data was expected, so the tankan is no surprise,' one analyst said. 'Today's fall was mostly due to futures.'

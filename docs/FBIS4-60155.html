			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 23, IRNA -- Three Iranian dailies Monday  commented on the kidnapping of the leader of `the faithful  resistance group of Lebanon', Mustafa al-Dirani and condemned  the silence of international bodies on the tragedy. Reports  indicate that Zionist forces kidnapped al-Dirani from his  residence in eastern Lebanon early Saturday and took him away to  the occupied terrritories. In its editorial, the Persian daily  `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' termed the act as the most explicit form of  state terrorism displaying the inhuman nature of the Zionist  regime once again. However, said the daily, such crimes by the  Zionists have always been connived and even supported by the  west and international community thus encouraging the criminals  to further expand such heinous actions.    All evidences indicate that what has happened and is  happening in Lebanon is precisely a planned conspiracy, said the  editorial adding, "the Lebanese government on the one hand  disarms the anti-Israeli forces and renders them defenseless  against the aggressions of the occupiers and on the other leaves  the Zionists free to intrude the Lebanese territory". The daily  considered it possible that the Zionist regime carried out its  operation in coordination with Maronite communities and the  so-called security forces of Lebanon.    Under the circumstances, said the paper, no one is secure  even in his own house as long as the occupying Zionists continue  their heinous actions with impunity. The final solution is,  therefore, the elimination of the Zionist regime, it added. The  paper also said that the events of the past few months cast  doubt on the sincerity of the Lebanese officials towards the  resistance of southern Lebanon notwithstanding their occasional  support.    The contemporary history of Lebanon has taught the people  that they can defeat the brutal Zionists in their land if they  keep an eye on the infiltrated mercenaries of Tel Aviv in every  corner of the country. The editorial stressed that fighting  against the occupiers is not possible without identifying  lackeys.    Commenting on the same subject, another Persian daily  `ABRAR'  criticized international bodies for keeping mum towards the  abduction saying that they did not even condemn the explicit  Zionist encroachment upon the Lebanese sovereignty. It said  that the advantages the Zionost regime reaped from this  operation and its ensuing propaganda against Iran and other  progressive Muslim and nationalist forces in the Middle East  deserve contemplation.    The paper stressed that the Americans seemingly have no  problem in mending fences even with some of the anti-Zionist and  Muslim forces in the region. However, this is not the case with  Iran, it added. The editorial warned that if Damascus joins the  reconciliation trend of the so-called peace talks in the Middle  East, the western mass media and certain regional governments  will launch a propaganda to label Iran as a country who  endangers the security of the region. Washington envisages that  Iran would take a passive stance vis-a-vis the developments in  the Middle East once Damascus joins the reconciliation trend,  wrote the paper. The daily called for the mobilization of all  diplomatic potentials to avoid landing in such a situation and  called for adopting a strategy based on national security and  interests.    The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' referred to the statements  made by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin that the kidnapping  had been carried out under the direct supervision of his  government and asked what powers are behind the terrorist regime  whose chief of government shamelessly proclaim he had issued  orders for the operation. "The most interesting aspect of the  situation, if it is at all possible to find an interesting  aspect in this criminal act, is the new definitions the western  statesmen offer for some of the political terms, and then use  the vast network of the mass media they have at their disposal  to publicise those illogical definitions." According to the new  political terminology devised by the Americans, said the paper,  a nation that is fighting for the freedom of its land is a  terrorist nation, whereas a government that openly occupies  territories from other nations and kidnaps people is an  anti-terrorist government. "The Zionist regime's justifications  for engaging in terrorist acts is indicative of its irrational  aggressive attitude," stressed the editorial.    Turning to the Zionist regime's claims that Arad was  captured  when his plane was downed in southern lebanon during a  bombardment mission, it said that Hizballah should put the  airman on trial as a war criminal and punish him indeed if they  have him in their captivity. "The trial of this war criminal  will be a good lesson for other Israeli pilots who commit the  inhuman act of slaughtering women and children in southern  Lebanon," concluded the daily.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Investor returns to the black Investor, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family, rebounded into the black in the first quarter, with a strong recovery at Saab-Scania helping to compensate for a low level of capital gains. The group recorded a SKr222m (Dollars 28.8m) profit after financial items, recovering from a SKr559m loss in the same 1993 period. Saab-Scania, which is 100 per owned by Investor, made a profit after financial items of SKr448m after suffering a SKr109m loss. The vehicle and aerospace group has entered a more buoyant phase, with sales climbing to SKr6.7bn from SKr5.6bn and orders rising by 49 per cent to SKr7.9bn. Apart from reduced losses at the 50 per cent-owned Saab Automobile, the group has benefited from a much better performance from its Scania truck unit. A continued improvement in Saab-Scania's performance is expected. Investor, which has strategic shareholdings in a clutch of Swedish blue-chips, including Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux and Stora, said its net worth at the end of March amounted to SKr36bn, or SKr198 per share. This is down from SKr37.5bn, or SKr206 per share at the turn of the year, although there has since been a rally. The value of the group's strategic holdings at March 31 was SKr26.4bn, down 5 per cent since the start of the year while the broader market index was unchanged. Investor's net debt at the end of the quarter amounted to SKr5.2bn, against SKr4.85bn at the year-end. Capital gains during the quarter amounted to just SKr35m, following the sale of shares in the roller bearing group SKF. Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment specialist, has maintained an impressive profits development with a 20 per cent increase in first-quarter profits to SKr265m. Group sales rose by 14 per cent to SKr2.4bn, with underlying growth amounting to 10 per cent. Earnings per share rose 22 per cent to SKr5.46. Gambro will change hands if the SKr8.4bn bid by Incentive, a Wallenberg company, for the investment group Cardo is successful. Cardo has a 58 per cent voting stake in Gambro.</p>

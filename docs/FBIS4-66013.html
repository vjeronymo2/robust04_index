			<p>BFN     [Text] Here in the Netherlands, Justice Minister Ernst  Hirsch Ballin has resigned.    His decision followed a motion of no-confidence in the  Christian Democrat minister by the parliament in the Hague.  Yesterday a majority of the lower house ordered the justice  minister and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn to refrain from any  further involvement in combatting organized crime. Parliament  decided that the two ministers had made too many mistakes in  that area.    Both the motion of no-confidence and the minister's  resignation are unusual, since the entire cabinet has been  outgoing since the elections of 3 May. It's not known whether  Minister van Thijn will also resign.</p>

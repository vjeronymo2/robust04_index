			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Defense Agency Director  General Kazuo Aichi said Friday [21 January] that Japan should  prepare for the eventuality of war on the Korean peninsula, even  though there is no immediate danger.    "Although the Korean peninsula has not become particularly  strained, considering the fact that tension exists there we must  study how to respond to various situations arising from a  hypothetical outbreak of conflict," Aichi told reporters.    Aichi was believed to be alluding to possible economic  sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council against  North Korea over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program.    North Korea has warned that it will not stand idle if  subjected to an economic blockade.    On the question of Japanese support for U.S. troops based in  Japan were such a conflict to break out, Aichi said it would be  decided on a "case-by-case" basis.    "We would have to consider to what extent we could (lend  support) in the context of maintaining the Japan-U.S. alliance,"  he said.    Defense Agency officials said the United States has already  asked for Japan's support in such an event. They said the  request is being considered primarily by the Foreign Ministry.</p>

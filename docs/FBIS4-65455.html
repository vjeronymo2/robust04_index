			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by reporter </F> Jon Snow; Adams in Belfast, Snow in London, on 16 May; Adams'  remarks spoken by an actor; from the "Channel 4 News" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Snow] Are you encouraged that the British  Government would respond to your questions on Anglo-Irish  Declaration, but with comments?    [Adams] Well, I think it is gratifying that for five months  we were told that clarification wasn't necessary, that it was a  matter of take it or leave it, and now we are being told -- yes  there are issues that need clarifying, there are questions to  deal with, core issues. I do think on a personal level that the  British response was a little bit childish, a little bit  begrudging. I mean the real test would be in the answers that  they supply which need to be comprehensive, which need to be  honest. We are not dealing with clarification here as a matter  of formality, we're dealing with getting comprehensive, honest,  and unambiguous responses to detailed questions.    [Snow] What is the prize if you get the clarification you  seek?    [Adams] We are engaged in a peace process. I mean, there  aren't any quick fixes. Our response is dictated to a large  degree by what the British Government's clarifications and  elaborations are.    [Snow] Could be as strong as to say -- yes a permanent  cessation of violence is on my agenda under the right  circumstances?    [Adams] Well it was on my agenda from the very beginning.  When John Hume and I kick-started the whole peace process, an  end, a cessation, a complete stop to all armed action by the  IRA, by the British, by the loyalists was quite clearly on my  agenda. That's part of a peace settlement. We have to persuade  people engaged in armed actions to give up those actions, to be  part of a process, and that's why I said at the beginning of  this interview -- peace requires change and we have to move the  whole position forward -- the British Government responding in a  comprehensive way, engaging in the peace process. Providing  clarification allows the whole business, the whole search for  peace to move forward. I hope it would lead to cessation of  armed actions by those engaged in armed actions, but I'm not  going to raise expectations to have them dashed again. I want  to move forward building the bricks on which a solid foundation  for lasting peace can be established, and it's important also  that we want a lasting peace, we want a durable peace, we want a  peace settlement.    [Snow] All right then, what are you holding out to the  British people as something that they can cling on to? What is  the best expectation that we could see? Are you talking in  terms of weeks, months, years?    [Adams] Well, I don't know, I have always said that we are  into the conflict resolution phase of this struggle. I don't  know how long that phase is going to take. I want it to be as  short as possible, I want people around me, all the people of  this country and the people of Britain who deserve peace as much  as the people in Ireland to have a normal, political life, to  have a society which is just. So we are definitely in the final  phase. There will be unforeseen obstacles in the way. There  will be difficulties. It will be dangerous and risky. How long  will it take -- I don't know. The sooner and the shorter the  better.</p>

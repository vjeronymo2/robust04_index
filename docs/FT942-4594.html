			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / White elephant fails to take flight: Denver's ill-fated new airport Poor Denver. By now, the state capital of Colorado should have been the proud owner of the first new airport in the US for nearly 20 years. Instead, repeated delays to the opening have left the city with egg all over its face. Now critics are asking: Was the whole thing a waste of money? The Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) project looks like an exercise in magnificence. The 1.4m sq ft terminal building has a Teflon-coated fabric roof shaped into 34 peaks symbolising the nearby Rocky Mountains. Soft, shadowless light filters down through the roof to illuminate the Great Hall beneath, a 126ft-high atrium paved with Italian black granite and running the length of three football fields. The terminal incorporates more than Dollars 7.5m worth of fountains, sculptures and other works of art. The only trouble is, there are no passengers in it. The airport was to open last October, but the company that built the computerised baggage handling system - BAE Automated Systems, a Dallas subsidiary of BTR, the British conglomerate - cannot get it to work properly, and the opening has been postponed indefinitely. US news media are now compounding the city's embarrassment by asking why the airport was built at all. Never mind that it is late in opening and cost nearly twice the original estimate of Dollars 1.7bn, they say: it is a white elephant, planned at a time when traffic was growing more rapidly and when US airlines could afford higher landing fees. For the past 65 years, passengers flying in and out of Denver have used the handy Stapleton airport just outside the city centre. That airport was due to close when the new Denver International Airport opened 24 miles to the north east because the city said it was too small to cope with forecast traffic growth. But critics such as Mr Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in nearby Golden, Colorado, suggest that Mr Federico Pena, mayor of Denver in the mid-1980s, drove the scheme through more for political advancement than on the basis of any sound economic justification. (Mr Pena is now US transportation secretary.) Traffic forecasts were inflated to justify the new airport's construction, Mr Boyd suggests. With a bit of adjustment to the runway configuration, Stapleton could have accommodated the traffic for years. City officials concede that traffic declined between 1986 and 1990, but say it is growing rapidly again. Stapleton is operating close to its maximum capacity, they say, and there is simply no room for expansion. Just as important, federal regulations do not allow Stapleton's two main parallel runways to be used simultaneously in poor visibility because they are too close together. That reduces the number of flights it can handle from 90 an hour to 30 in bad weather, making the airport one of the worst in the US for delays. The new airport, with three parallel runways that can be used simultaneously whatever the weather, will solve that problem at a stroke. Even the project's severest critics tend to agree that Denver would have needed a new airport eventually. Their main argument is that the one it decided to build was too much, too soon. If they are right, who will pay the penalty? Not the taxpayer, it seems: the airport's construction was funded through bond issues that carry no government guarantees. Nor do the bondholders seem likely to lose their money: the extra costs of the project will be recouped through higher landing fees for the airport's users. Critics say the local economy will suffer because these higher landing fees  -about Dollars 15 a passenger compared with Dollars 7-Dollars 8 at Stapleton - will drive airlines away. These fears were reinforced when Continental Airlines, one of Denver's two biggest operators, announced recently that it was axing 24 per cent of its flights in and out of the city. Yet Continental says it is pulling back from Denver because it sees better business opportunities in the east coast market, not because of higher landing fees; and in any event, the gap is rapidly being filled by United Airlines, Denver's other big carrier. Meanwhile a fledgling carrier, Frontier Airlines, is about to adopt the new airport as its base in spite of the higher fees. Once a big operator at Denver until it went bankrupt in the 1980s, Frontier said it would not have been going back into business if the new airport had not been built. Meanwhile city officials console themselves with the thought that virtually every new airport is regarded as a white elephant when first built, but seldom stays that way for long. As to the suggestion that Denver's airport might have been built more quickly and cheaply if the private sector had been given the job, they murmur: 'Oh? Like the Channel tunnel?'</p>

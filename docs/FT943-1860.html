			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Howard warns of fire pay reforms Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is considering introducing performance-related pay into the fire service for those at assistant divisional officer level. In a move that seems likely to provoke widespread resistance, Mr Howard also said he was looking at fixed-term appointments and considering whether these might be introduced for chief fire officers. Speaking yesterday to the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association conference, Mr Howard went on to say that he was concerned about the growing cost of the firefighters' pension scheme. He added that a review team would identify ways in which the benefits and costs could be made more comparable to other public service schemes but gave an assurance that existing pensioners would not be affected by any changes. The home secretary's suggestions of change in pay determination is bound to arouse widespread anxiety across the entire fire service. Last year the Fire Brigades Union carried out a successful campaign in defence of their national wage agreement. The agreement is based on a 17-year-old wage formula that links pay to the upper quartile of male manual earnings. Although most fire fighters would not be covered by what Mr Howard is planning, union officials fear that any performance-related pay system and fixed-term contracts would eventually have to be extended to their members. The union has some members at assistant divisional officer level. The home secretary told yesterday's conference that performance-related pay could 'encourage greater efficiency in the public as well as the private sector of the economy'. He added: 'It is an important element in the results-oriented culture that is being developed in all our public services.' The planned shake-up of pay and working conditions in the fire service follows the row that Mr Howard started when he suggested that police officers should be covered by performance-related pay and fixed-term contracts. Eventually the government backed down in the face of strong opposition from the police force over the proposals, which were contained in Sir Patrick Sheehy's report on police pay.</p>

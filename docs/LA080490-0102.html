			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS ASK WORLD TO CUT OFF WEAPONS TO IRAQ  </P> <P> The United States and Soviet Union, moving swiftly in their first joint attempt  to end a post-Cold War international crisis, appealed to the world Friday for  an across-the-board arms embargo against Iraq and demanded that it cease its  "brutal and illegal" invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> In a dramatic episode showing the new and emerging relationship between the  superpowers, Secretary of State James A. Baker III cut short a visit to  Mongolia to fly the breadth of the Soviet Union to hammer out a common  U.S.-Soviet response to the invasion with Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> After meeting for 90 minutes in a second-floor room at Vnukovo-2 airport on the  outskirts of Moscow, both men emerged shortly after 9 p.m. local time (11 a.m.  PDT) to read a toughly worded statement accusing Iraq, a longtime Soviet ally,  of illegal and barbarous action. And they committed their countries to  coordinating a worldwide response.  </P> <P> "Today, we take the unusual step of jointly calling on the rest of the  international community to join with us in an international cutoff of all arms  supplies to Iraq," said the U.S.-Soviet resolution, whose English-language text  was read by Baker before a battery of TV cameras.  </P> <P> The superpowers accused Iraq of "blatant transgression of the basic norms of  civilized conduct" and warned its rulers that "governments that engage in  blatant aggression must know that the international community cannot and will  not acquiesce." It said Iraq's troops must be withdrawn "unconditionally."  </P> <P> The statement did not refer to possible military action, and Shevardnadze said  none was planned by the Kremlin. He said he understood from Baker that the Bush  Administration, which has imposed a trade embargo on Iraq and frozen its U.S.  assets, has no wish to intervene with armed force.  </P> <P> But Baker would not be drawn out on U.S. intentions.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's useful to speculate with respect to questions regarding  military action," Baker said as he and Shevardnadze fielded questions at the  VIPs-only airport, where Baker's Boeing 707 brought the weary American  entourage after a nearly 9-hour flight from Ulan Bator, Mongolia.  </P> <P> The Kremlin, which on Thursday broke off weapons supplies to Iraq, has been  Baghdad's principal arms supplier for more than 20 years. And Shevardnadze said  his country had been forced to make a conscious choice between longstanding  ties to the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the logic of  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foreign policy.  </P> <P> "We were forced to take such steps (to condemn Iraq) by the events in Kuwait,  in line with the new political thinking," Shevardnadze said. Baker replied that  the joint statement was "even more meaningful" because of the longstanding ties  between the Soviets and Iraqis, enshrined in the countries' 1972 treaty of  friendship.  </P> <P> In a larger sense, the joint declaration signaled that Third World countries  can no longer exploit superpower rivalry to win military and economic support  in quarrels with their neighbors -- an ingredient in world politics that made  the 1970s and early 1980s often seem like a global chess game played by the  United States and Soviet Union, from Ethiopia to Nicaragua.  </P> <P> A principal factor underlying Friday's extraordinary U.S.-Soviet statement was  the desire by both countries to avoid setting some sort of precedent of  appeasement, said a senior State Department official traveling with Baker back  to the United States.  </P> <P> "If you allow someone to engage in this kind of action and get away with it,  you're going to invite more of it -- and not only in this case, but maybe  others, not necessarily limited to Iraq and not necessarily limited to (the  Persian Gulf) region," he said during a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland.  </P> <P> Baker, who had met with Shevardnadze in the Siberian city of Irkutsk before  flying Thursday to Mongolia, had briefed his host then on the massing of Iraqi  troops near Kuwait. But Shevardnadze said he had nonetheless been surprised by  Baghdad's subsequent drive into the oil-rich emirate.  </P> <P> "I really didn't think that the Iraqis would engage in such aggression against  such a defenseless country, a country which is a threat to no one," the Soviet  foreign minister admitted.  </P> <P> The senior State Department official traveling with Baker confirmed that the  initiative for the joint statement had come from the United States.  </P> <P> Asked what might happen if the current U.S.-Soviet efforts against Iraq do not  work, the senior official replied, "Well, we've just begun this process."  </P> <P> In a scathing commentary Friday, the official Soviet news agency Tass also  expressed shock at the Iraqi action and indicated that the Kremlin was fearful  of military conflict boiling over in an area near its own southern border, just  as it had been during the long Iran-Iraq war.  </P> <P> Although there was no expectation that the U.S.-Soviet resolution would suffice  to end the crisis over Kuwait, representatives from both countries hailed the  document as proof of the new working relationship between the superpowers.  </P> <P> "I think it's natural today that the United States and the Soviet Union would  find themselves in agreement with respect to what's happened," Baker said.  "This would not necessarily have been the case at an earlier time, and we might  have been in earlier days viewing this very tragic action through an East-West  prism."  </P> <P> "Even if this joint statement does not stop the crisis, it sets an important  precedent for the future," said a Soviet Foreign Ministry specialist on the  United States, who accompanied Shevardnadze to the airport.  </P> <P> Reminded that his country had roundly condemned the Bush Administration for  last December's Panama invasion and that the Kremlin itself had withdrawn its  troops from Afghanistan only this past year, the Soviet diplomat said: "The key  word is 'past.' All that now is in the past. Now we absolutely oppose violence  as a way to solve international disputes."  </P> <P> The senior State Department official agreed that the joint statement is "a  measure of how the two of us (the Soviet Union and the United States) can in  fact deal with issues that in the past we would not have dealt with.  </P> <P> "And in my mind," he added, "it's symptomatic of how the agenda we have with  them is an expanding agenda. We face a situation where threats to peace don't  exist in Europe any more, but they exist elsewhere."  </P> <P> The statement on Kuwait was the first orchestrated U.S.-Soviet joint response  to a sudden international crisis, but in the past 12 months their positions on  protracted conflicts like Namibia and Cambodia have merged. Although the  Baker-Shevardnadze talks in Irkutsk failed to result in accord on Afghanistan,  the longest-running regional conflict dividing the superpowers, the two  countries are reportedly closer than ever to a solution.  </P> <P> Baker insisted that the United States and Soviet Union had taken "concrete  actions" and not just engaged in "simple rhetoric" on the Kuwait invasion, and  both he and Shevardnadze said the superpowers would stay in contact about  subsequent actions that might be needed.  </P> <P> They also called on the Arab League, the Islamic Conference and individual Arab  states to "take all possible steps" to obtain implementation of a U.N. Security  Council resolution demanding that "Iraq withdraw immediately and  unconditionally all its forces."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said there has not yet been any superpower contact with China to  win its approval for an international arms boycott of Iraq. He said, however,  that the Chinese would be approached.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze also warned that the maltreatment of their fellow  citizens caught up in the hostilities could have dire repercussions. According  to Baker, there are 3,800 American residents in Kuwait, and the Soviet foreign  minister said that a "big Soviet colony" of 7,000 to 8,000 advisers and other  personnel lives in Iraq.  </P> <P> "We expect the safety and welfare of Americans to be safeguarded, and there  would be very severe consequences if that were not the case," Baker declared.  Shevardnadze said basically the same thing about his countrymen in Iraq.  </P> <P> Dahlburg reported from Moscow; Mann reported from Moscow and Shannon, Ireland.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KUWAIT AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Geography: About size of New Jersey; in northeast corner of Arabian peninsula.  Hot, dry and almost entirely desert; only 0.05% of territory is arable. Flat  landscape relieved mainly by modern office buildings, apartment towers and  hotels.  </P> <P> Economy: A founding member of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Has one of world's largest oil reserves and one of highest per-capita incomes.  But decline of oil market by 1982 left it selling less than one-fourth of oil  it was shipping earlier.  </P> <P> People: Less than half of 2 million population -- 41% -- is native Kuwaiti.  Rest are mostly Palestinians, Indians, Pakistanis and Egyptians who have found  work on every level, from government executives and doctors to laborers. Islam  is official religion -- Sunni Muslims are dominant -- and Arabic the official  language, but English is widely used.  </P> <P> Government: Monarchy ruled by emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah. His family  has dominated Kuwait since 18th Century.  </P> <P> Recent history: British protectorate from 1899 until June 19, 1961. No sooner  had Kuwait become independent than Baghdad claimed emirate as its own, saying  it had been integral part of Iraq's Basra province under Ottoman Empire.  </P> <P> Baghdad massed troops on border but withdrew when Britain objected. British  force was sent in, followed by Arab League force, and two years later Iraq  recognized Kuwait's independence.  </P> <P> But border dispute remained. Twice, in 1967 and 1973, Iraq occupied small areas  of northern Kuwait. Despite history of hostility, Kuwait sided with Iraq in  1980-88 war with Iran.  </P> <P> Sources: Associated Press; Reuters  </P></p>

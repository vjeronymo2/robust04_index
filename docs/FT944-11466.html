			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Supermarket bargains Kwiksave supermarkets offer few frills but have taken care with their wine selection for the last year or so. Two stunning current bargains are Silver Hill South African blended white, so smartly labelled that one would never guess it cost only Pounds 2.79, and a Chilean Sauvignon labelled White Pacific at Pounds 2.69. Both are whistle-clean and refreshingly high in acidity. Safeway's best current buy is their South African white at Pounds 2.29, or another Chilean white, the Caliterra 1994 Chardonnay, which is reduced from Pounds 3.99 to Pounds 3.49 until November 12. The latter is better value than the Caliterra 1991 Cabernet. Progress in Chile generally means the younger the vintage the better the wine.</p>

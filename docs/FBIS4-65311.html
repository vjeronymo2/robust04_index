			<p>BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, May 13 (AFP) -- Danish Interior and  Immigration Minister Birte Weiss said Friday [13 May] she asked  Albania, Hungary and Slovenia for authorisation to set up  Danish-run camps for refugees from former Yugoslavia on their  territories.    In a note to parliament, Weiss said there was no agreement  so  far to the requests, made in April, but that the government was  continuing to seek an accord with the three countries.    Denmark runs a refugee camp in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  another  in Croatia but the Croatian authorities last month refused to  allow Denmark to set up another one there.    Denmark has also offered shelter for some 18,000 refugees  from ex-Yugoslavia but believes haven should be provided as  close as possible to home to facilitate return and to cut  government spending.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Observer: Patent nonsense Education secretary John Patten seemed deeply hurt this week when Sir Claus Moser's National Commission on Education published its report without tipping him off in advance about its contents. This caused a few raised eyebrows at the NCE since it had bent over backwards to try to ensure that Patten would be one of the first to get an advance peek. Problem was Patten's officials refused to give out their boss's personal address or phone number. Undeterred, the NCE agreed to bike an advance copy of the report to the home of Jim Coe, Patten's chief press officer, in leafy Hampshire. Coe is normally formidably efficient, but on this occasion, two days later, he had still not managed to press a copy of the report into his master's hands. So Patten was completely unable to comment. How inconvenient.</p>

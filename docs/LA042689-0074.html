			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF THE AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of a selection of today's screenings in the  American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex  Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Never Say Die'  </P> <P> New Zealand. 1988, 104 minutes  </P> <P> 7 p.m.  </P> <P>  This is no more than the usual two lovers-on-the-run car-chase thriller,  spiced up with comic paranoia, interracial lovers, a tongue-in-cheek attitude  toward violence, progressive jibes against the CIA and American big business,  zingy seacoast scenery and a few welcome twists and jolts. But New Zealander  Geoff Murphy ("Utu") is a contemporary action director in a league with  Spielberg, George ("Mad Max") Miller, James Cameron, and John McTiernan; he  keeps this wildly kinetic movie sizzling and popping, bouncing and roaring all  the way. Settle in, undemandingly, for the ride -- and you should have a good  time. RECOMMENDED.MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

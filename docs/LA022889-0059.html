			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL COST OF S&amp;L BAILOUT DEPENDS ON 'WHAT IF ?'  </P> <P> Pick a number, any number -- the larger the better -- and it has probably been  cited as the cost of President Bush's S&amp;L bailout plan.  </P> <P> In the beginning, there was the $90-billion estimate presented by the  Administration when it announced the plan early this month. That represents the  total cost of paying off all the depositors in roughly 200 savings and loan  associations that were shut down by the federal government last year and  perhaps 350 more that are still operating but currently insolvent.  </P> <P> Then the fun began. Numbers started flying: $126 billion, $157 billion, $200  billion, and, soaring into the stratosphere, $335 billion.  </P> <P> In hopes of sorting out some of the confusion, here are answers to several  questions about the costs of the S&amp;L bailout.  </P> <P> Q: So what's the bottom line for taxpayers?  </P> <P> A: Nobody really knows. It all depends on what economic assumptions are used.  If interest rates are higher than the Administration expects over the next  three years, if the assets owned by insolvent S&amp;Ls are worth less than  predicted and if surviving thrift institutions do not attract as many deposits  as forecast, the government will have to come up with more money to cover its  losses.  </P> <P> Relying on its own assumptions, the White House estimated that the Treasury  will have to fork over $39.9 billion during the next 10 years to finance the  bailout. That's money that taxpayers must pay, either through higher taxes or  by reduced spending on other government programs. The rest of the cash is  supposed to come from banking and thrift industry sources.  </P> <P> Many critics, questioning the White House assumptions, have challenged the Bush  estimates as inadequate. They're probably right. That's a problem federal  budget planners will have to face.  </P> <P> Q: What will the money be spent on?  </P> <P> A: Last year, when the federal government took over more than 200 failed  thrifts, there was not enough money in the federal insurance fund to pay off  all their depositors. So the government issued huge promissory notes and handed  out billions in tax breaks to lure outside investors into taking the  institutions off its hands. Although the government has not disclosed details  of most of those deals, it estimates the net cost of all of them at about $40  billion.  </P> <P> Another $50 billion is required over the next three years, the Administration  believes, to take over more than 350 S&amp;Ls that are currently operating even  though they are insolvent, which means that their assets are worth less than  their liabilities.  </P> <P> Q: Where will the money come from?  </P> <P> A: Surviving thrifts would keep paying into the existing deposit insurance fund  to help finance past and future expenses, and their premiums are supposed to  increase as well. Some additional asset sales would also raise money.  </P> <P> But over the next 10 years, the White House estimates, taxpayers will have to  contribute $37.9 billion, primarily to meet the cost of last year's bailouts,  to keep the federal savings insurance fund intact.  </P> <P> Q: But what about the additional $50 billion the Administration says it needs  to raise?  </P> <P> A: That will cost taxpayers an additional $22 billion in the next 10 years. But  getting there is complicated.  </P> <P> The government plans on issuing $50 billion in special bonds over the next  three years to finance the bailouts of the remaining insolvent thrifts.  </P> <P> To pay off the $50 billion when the bonds come due in 30 years, the government  would buy "zero-coupon" bonds. Those bonds, which pay interest only in a lump  sum when they mature, would require an up-front payment from the thrift  industry of about $5 billion.  </P> <P> Somebody would also have to pay the annual interest on the $50 billion in bonds  -- about $3.8 billion a year, according to the Treasury's optimistic estimate.  Some of the money is supposed to come from selling the assets of the bankrupt  S&amp;Ls. Some would come from the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which earn  interest on the money that all S&amp;Ls are required to keep on deposit there.  The rest would be paid by the Treasury -- that is, by the taxpayers.  </P> <P> Over the first 10 years, total interest is estimated at $36.4 billion, of which  taxpayers are expected to pay $22 billion.  </P> <P> Q: That sounds like a total cost to taxpayers of $59.9 billion.  </P> <P> A: That's right. But at the same time, about $20 billion in higher deposit  insurance premiums would be collected from banks as part of the bailout  package. Because that money flows into government coffers, helping to generate  offsetting receipts, it reduces net federal outlays. That is supposed to leave  a bottom line to taxpayers of $39.9 billion.  </P> <P> Q: So where do the higher figures come from?  </P> <P> A: They're all based on various estimates of how much interest the government  will have to pay to finance the cost of covering the losses at thrifts that  have already gone under, those that are insolvent today and those that might  fail.  </P> <P> Over 33 years, because of interest expenses, the Bush Administration estimates  total outlays at $175.4 billion. Of that total, taxpayers would have to pay  $94.1 billion.  </P> <P> Q: But has the Bush Administration, in presenting a $90-billion estimate for  the bailout, been misleading the public about its full cost?  </P> <P> A: Not really. The losses at insolvent thrifts, according to the  Administration's best estimates, won't exceed $90 billion. That's money they  know is gone. It was lost by thrifts on bad loans and wasted investments,  mostly because oil prices unexpectedly collapsed in the early 1980s, bringing  down with them a host of real estate and energy projects that had been built on  hopes that ever-rising oil prices would generate more wealth in Texas and other  Southwestern energy states.  </P> <P> But there was also widespread fraud and dangerous risk-taking as well, as  fast-buck operators took advantage of financial deregulation to pour money into  speculative ventures across the country. Since Congress has promised to  guarantee deposits at banks and S&amp;Ls to protect the nation's financial  system against collapse, it's the job of the federal government to cover those  losses.  </P> <P> Q: Why not pay all the costs now?  </P> <P> A: In effect, the government is taking out a mortgage on the bailout. Consider  a homeowner who buys a $200,000 house. Few home buyers have $200,000 in cash.  Typically, the buyer might make a $40,000 down payment and finance the rest of  the purchase by borrowing $160,000. If all the interest costs were added up  over 30 years, they would total much more than the purchase price. But few  homeowners worry about that.  </P> <P> Well, the government doesn't have $90 billion in extra cash. If it tried to pay  off all the depositors out of its current proceeds, it would have to decimate  existing federal programs or drastically boost taxes for one year, probably  plunging the economy into a recession.  </P> <P> Q: What will the financing scheme add to the cost?  </P> <P> A: About $22 billion in real extra costs. The interest payments will be spread  over the next 30 years. Government officials, like business managers who also  must finance certain capital investments, rely on a calculation called "present  value" to determine what it would cost in today's dollars to finance an  expenditure over time. Because money spent in the future is worth less than  money spent today, that calculation best represents the full cost of any  financing plan.  </P> <P> The Administration's estimate of the "present value" of its 30-year,  $175.4-billion spending plan is $111.7 billion in 1989 dollars, or roughly $22  billion more than paying the $90 billion immediately.  </P> <P> The taxpayers make relatively more of their $94.1-billion contribution toward  the end of the 33-year period. So the present value of their share of the bill  is only $26.6 billion.  </P> <P> Q: Could it get worse?  </P> <P> A: Sure. The worst case has been offered by House Banking Committee Chairman  Henry B. Gonzalez. Utilizing much more pessimistic assumptions than the  Administration, he came up with a total cost of $335 billion by adding up all  past and projected future expenses on S&amp;Ls over the next 30 years.  </P> <P> He forecast that the government would collect $152 billion from various  sources, leaving the Treasury with $183 billion in expenses that would have to  be paid out of taxpayers' pockets.  </P> <P> Q: Why shouldn't the government simply refuse to pay?  </P> <P> A: There are many valid questions that can be raised about whether the  Administration has proposed the best way to absorb the insolvent thrifts'  losses. But the problem can't be ignored.  </P></p>

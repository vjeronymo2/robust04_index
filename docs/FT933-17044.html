			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / New Bank head sees potential for lasting recovery BRITAIN HAS the potential for an economic recovery that could continue through the rest of this decade, according to Mr Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr George said the UK had a 'realistic chance of seeing rather well sustained expansion', although he admitted that the start of the recovery would be gradual because of the large overhang of debt in the private sector. While making clear his doubts about the European Community's plans for economic and monetary union, Mr George, who became governor today, said he believed Britain would be able to meet the convergence criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty 'over the Maastricht time scale'. His remarks suggested that the UK's ratio of annual budget deficit to gross domestic product would fall to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of the decade from about 8 per cent projected by the Treasury for this financial year, and that Britain would, as now, have an inflation rate in line with the best performing EC member states at the end of the 1990s. However, Mr George admitted that 'we could always throw it away, either through policy errors or in the economy at large through bad behaviour'. But he said he believed that Mr Kenneth Clarke, in describing himself as a 'political chancellor', would pursue 'prudent policies which offer the best chance of achieving sustainable recovery and sustainable expansion'. Mr George told the FT that he was content with the current level of UK interest rates and sterling's exchange rate. But yesterday afternoon, when giving testimony to the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee, he said 'some weight' could be taken off UK interest rates if the government succeeded in cutting its public sector borrowing requirement from the current level of Pounds 50bn a year. He added that another factor that would 'tend to ease pressure' on British interest rates would be a fall in German rates. Mr George told the FT and admitted to MPs that there were cases in the past when the tactics surrounding UK interest rate changes had been determined by political rather than monetary policy considerations. The results had been damaging for the UK economy 'for a little while,' he said. He indicated that the differences had not been so serious as to cause the Bank to 'make a song and dance' about the matter. In his comments to the Commons committee, Mr George promised that the Bank would be more open to outside scrutiny under his governorship and went further than in his FT interview in outlining the greater autonomy that he would like for the Bank of England. He said he would favour the Bank being given a 'mandate' from parliament which would set price stability as its objective and give it the tools to achieve this through the setting of short-term interest rates. But the Bank would have to be made accountable to parliament and he was reluctant to define how this should be done. However, greater accountability would make it easier to identify those responsible for economic policy errors in the UK, he said. The hearing in the Commons also threw more light on the role that Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea would play as deputy governor of the Bank. He would 'run the Bank', Mr George said. The new governor said he regarded Mr Pennant-Rea, who until recently was the editor of the Economist magazine, as 'a co-governor' rather than his deputy. Steady hand at the helm, Page 23</p>

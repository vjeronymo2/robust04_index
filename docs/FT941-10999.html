			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Quest for a benefactor - Sponsorship Perhaps the most distressing consequence of the Arts Council's debacle over the funding of the London orchestras was not the waste of the orchestras' time and money, but the cloud that the exercise cast over their quest for sponsorship for the 1994-95 season. With the Council apparently intent on dropping two internationally acclaimed bands from its client list, few potential business supporters were willing to show an interest. The LPO, the RPO and the Philharmonia, which, in the event were all reprieved and given roughly the previous year's subsidy, are now battling hard to make up for lost time, but it would be surprising if sponsorship revenue next season matches 1993-94. Traditionally, the orchestras enjoyed sponsorship income which often exceeded 10 per cent of revenue and, in some cases, outpaced Arts Council subsidy. But London is over-supplied with symphony concerts and sponsors are aware of falling audiences. They are looking for something 'fresh' and 'original' from classical music. So the orchestras are trying to devise packages for sponsors - 'seasons', 'festivals', or links which give the sponsor more prominence. Typical is BMW's backing for the English Concert Orchestra to play a 'mystery piece' at each concert. The regular attender who correctly guesses the most composers and their works during the season receives a substantial prize. Last Monday night conductor Raymond Leppard was talking about the competition from the rostrum, driving the BMW name home. Fortunately there is one area where orchestras offer sponsors a service not equalled by theatre or dance companies - international touring. Virtually every major overseas orchestral tour is now sponsored. As well as a guaranteed fee, the orchestra meets a new audience; flys the flag; and sponsors can entertain foreign contacts and wrap the prestige of an acclaimed British orchestra around their products. This week in Vienna the LSO signed its largest ever sponsorship deal, with Takeda, the leading drugs and chemicals company in Japan. Worth in excess of Pounds 500,000, it is taking the LSO around Austria and Germany; to the Salzburg Festival in August; and to the US and Japan in 1995. This is the third worldwide sponsorship between the LSO and Takeda. The key to the relationship is Hiroaki Yamataka, who heads the Japanese wing of Kleinwort Benson in London and is an international vice-president of the LSO. He arranged the initial contact in 1988, and is proof of how important it is for leading arts organisations to appoint influential members to their boards. Katsura Morita, chairman of Takeda, says that Japanese companies are keeping faith with the arts companies they sponsor during the Japanese recession. This is one of the advantages of working in a culture where losing face is a grievous failing. Takeda's support for the LSO stems from its belief that music can make the mind healthy. It is also alive to the advantage of using the LSO to accompany it into new overseas markets. ***** Thanks to sponsorship, art has a new prize to set against the Turner. The criticism that the Turner Prize is only awarded to 'cutting edge' artists, practitioners in abstract sculpture or conceptual art rather than to painters, has taken substantial shape in the form of the Jerwood Painting Prize. It is worth Pounds 30,000, making it the most valuable art award in the country. The inclusion of the unfashionable word 'painting' in the title confirms that it will go to an artist who is still working in a figurative way. The funding comes from the Jerwood Foundation, set up by the late John Jerwood who made his money from the Japanese pearl industry. Five British artists will be shortlisted on the basis of their recent work, and their paintings will be on show at the Royal Scottish Academy during the Edinburgh Festival and at the Royal Academy in London in September. The winner will be announced then. A painting by the winner will be bought and loaned to a public museum or gallery in the UK. The Jerwood Foundation's traditional concerns were limited to youth and music, but it has widened its interests and gives more than Pounds 500,000 a year to the arts. Among its beneficiaries are the National Youth Chamber Orchestra, the National Art Collections Fund Awards, and the Bush Theatre in London. ***** BT has re-asserted its position as the UK's leading corporate sponsor of the arts. It has donated Pounds 500,000, over three years, to the Association of British Orchestras, which will mastermind the commissioning and the performance of a new orchestral work. James MacMillan will compose the first piece which will be successively performed by 12 leading orchestras. The premiere will be at the Barbican on September 21 and feature the LSO. The next generation will be helped by a Pounds 60,000 BT sponsorship for London's young musicians. The money will enable gifted young people to study at the Centre for Young Musicians at Morley College. This does not affect the Pounds 60,000 a year that London Electricity provides for the London Symphony Schools Orchestra, produced by the Centre. ***** Panasonic Europe is to continue as exclusive sponsor of the European Community Baroque Orchestra, supporting young musicians with Pounds 335,000 over the next three years. ***** Thorn EMI has given Pounds 30,000 towards a recording studio at the Royal Academy of Music. It will be used in the Academy's full-time commercial music course.</p>

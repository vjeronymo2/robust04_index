			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (29): Charges may eat up what you save in tax - Managed PEPs / So these vehicles are most likely to suit those investors who regularly pay CGT A MANAGED Pep must sound like a tempting deal to many investors. The full Pounds 6,000 can be placed in a plan (unlike unit trust and non-new-issue investment trust Peps), and the tricky task of choosing the shares is left to the managers. The snag is that charges are likely to be higher than on other types of Pep. This reinforces the perennial danger of Peps: that the investor may pay out more in charges than he or she is ever likely to gain in tax savings. Measurement of performance is also difficult. A managed Pep is not like a unit or investment trust, with daily prices. Charging structures mean that an investor who puts Pounds 3,000, and one who puts Pounds 6,000, into the same Pep on the same day may get different returns. The manager may also select different shares for two different investors, depending on their income needs and tax positions. One guide is the performance of unit trusts run by the same fund manager. The Newton Income fund, for example, is the best performing of all unit trusts over five years. Newton offers a Pep based on the trust alone; one that mixes the trust with individual shares; and one that only invests directly in equities. Managed Peps fall into four rough categories: shares only; unit trusts plus shares; investment trusts plus shares; and unit and investment trusts plus shares. In theory, the inclusion of a unit or investment trust should give the Pep greater diversification (and thus reduce the risk) than is possible with individual share based Peps. Those who opt for share-only Peps should also look for the number of shares which the manager selects. A large number of shares will bring added diversification, but is likely to mean substantially higher dealing costs. Given that the investor can only back one managed Pep per financial year, and that there are almost 500 Peps to choose from, a certain amount of pot luck is inevitable. An invaluable aid to the selection process is the Pep guide published by Chase de Vere. This lists all those Peps which had been introduced by late 1991, with details of their terms and conditions. The guide illustrates the fact that charges come in all shapes and sizes - and that many of them are subject to Value Added Tax on top. An initial charge, similar to that imposed on unit trusts, is usually levied. This can take the form of a flat fee, say Pounds 25 or Pounds 50, or more normally a percentage, usually between 1 and 6 per cent. In addition, there will be an annual charge, usually a percentage: a rough norm would be around 1 per cent, with 0.5 to 2 per cent the range. On top of these charges, there can be penalties for partial withdrawal, transfer charges when investors want to move from one Pep to another, and even a Pounds 50 charge if the investor wants to attend annual general meetings. Then the manager will make a charge to cover the costs incurred every time he deals in shares - this could easily be 1 to 2 per cent a time. So the investor needs to be pretty sure that the scope for tax savings is considerable. This is most likely to be true for investors who regularly pay capital gains tax, and who will thus save 25 or 40 per cent of any gains the Pep makes. The calculations are more complex for those who are relying on the income tax savings alone. With equity yields of 5 per cent, the annual income on a full Pounds 6,000 Pep would be just Pounds 300; the tax saving for a top-rate taxpayer would be just Pounds 120, or 2 per cent of the full value of the Pep. On most managed Peps, the charges in the first year will be far higher than 2 per cent, and with the annual charge typically 1 per cent a year, the average investor may take a long time to catch up. Those seeking the income tax exemption should also make sure that the Pep has a yield orientation; the lower the yield, the lower the tax saving. And all Pep investors should ensure that the managers' investment philosophy is in tune with their own: for example, it would be foolish for the cautious to go for a high-risk vehicle such as Hill Samuel's aggressive growth Pep. *Pepguide, Chase de Vere Investments, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3JX.

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: Maxwell Davies's double bass concerto - London concerts on the South Bank Peter Maxwell Davies's set of Strathclyde Concertos for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, planned to be ten in number, is moving toward completion. (The series-name does honour to the enlightened action of the Strathclyde Regional Council in commissioning them.) Each one features a different instrumental soloist or concertante combination. Number seven - given its first London outing on Tuesday, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall - is for the double bass, and is perhaps the most fascinating yet. In these works a Maxwell Davies has been revealed quite different from the adventurer of youth, the confronter of angular, sometimes violently dramatic music-theatre conceptions. His musical mode here is a subtly woven web of discourse in which purely musical ideas - about the characterisation of solo instrumental voices, the relationship of individual and group strands, the movement forward of sonata-style argument - are examined and developed. Maxwell Davies has set out in each case to fulfil his proposition as fluently, and as 'continuously', as Bach or Haydn might have done. (It is probably for this reason that the concertos have already received some rather testy dismissals from former Maxwell Davies admirers.) The proposition, in this seventh concerto, is that the double bass should be treated not as a vehicle for rhythm, or weird animal-imitation effects, or lumbering comedy, but as a lyrical voice in its own right. The gently meditative opening, in which the that voice is musingly tested, with bare support from other low strings, is masterly. The particularly Klang of the concerto, at once warm, rather lean and full of internal variety, is achieved with a sobriety that can nevertheless run to quietly astonishing virtuoso effects of textural contrast. On a first hearing I also admired the self-effacingly expert way the work is moved forward, via gradually unfolding melodic devices and disgorging of consonant-sounding harmonies. The sheer functional intelligence of the music is disguised, as it should be, by all its many civilised surface qualities. The performance, by Duncan McTier and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra under the composer's baton, was excellently run-in. Not surprising: the concert - which also billed works by Edward Harper and Judith Weir and the (rather garish) first concert suite from Maxwell Davies's ballet score Caroline Mathilde - had been given in five British cities previously, as part of the latest Contemporary Music Network Tour. Final SCO performances this weekend, in Sheffield, Bath and Northampton</p>

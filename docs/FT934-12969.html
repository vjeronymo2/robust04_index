			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead BET, the business services group in the latter stages of a three-year restructuring, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 48m on Monday. The figures could include some profits on disposal, although the group has been selling businesses on modest valuations. Now the group is better managed, cash is being generated and its balance sheet is under control, investors will focus on whether it has formulated a plan to inject some more excitement into its portfolio of businesses - a necessary step if it is to approach the rating enjoyed by the likes of rival Hays. Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, reports full-year results on Thursday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to come in at between Pounds 640m and Pounds 690m, compared with Pounds 504m last year. The company will benefit substantially from favourable exchange rates, so attention will be focused on underlying sales growth. Of particular interest will be the progress of Zovirax, the best-selling shingles and herpes treatment. The impact of an unfavourable clinical trial on sales of AZT, the HIV treatment, will also be followed closely. Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports third-quarter results on Thursday and pre-tax profits of between Pounds 55m and Pounds 70m are expected despite a difficult three months. Demand on the Continent was slow during August, and recovery in the UK and US has been hesitant. The scale of the post-holiday pick-up in September will be important.</p>

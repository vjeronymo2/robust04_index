			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Rabin to stand by policy on deportees ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday dismissed suggestions that the government would privately welcome a High Court decision to overturn the mass expulsion of Palestinians to Lebanon. The court, which is expected to rule this week on the legality of the action, has become the focus of the crisis over the December expulsions, which were unanimously condemned as illegal by the United Nations Security Council and have thrown the future of Middle East peace talks into doubt. Opponents of the move, both inside and outside Israel, have suggested that a court ruling against the expulsions would provide the way out of the crisis for the government and for the new US administration, which is anxious to avoid disruption of the peace negotiations. Israel has sought to defer any further action against it by the UN until after the court's decision is given. But Mr Rabin said he did not want to be overruled. 'I am full of hope that the High Court will indeed approve this. I regret the voices that pretend there is supposedly a need for someone to rescue the government. The government does not need to be rescued, it needs to stick to its positions,' he said. The High Court's seven judges would no doubt be widely applauded in the international community if they did rule against the government. Such a ruling would lift the pressure for UN sanctions to enforce Security Council resolution 799 demanding the return of the deportees and meet Palestinian conditions for resuming peace talks. But it would also be a deeply damaging blow to Mr Rabin's political prestige at home, ironically undermining his ability to make concessions in the peace negotiations. It would also be regarded in Israel as an unprecedented rebuff to the powerful military establishment which justified the expulsions on security grounds. Civil rights lawyers arguing the case against the deportations, the largest number ever carried out at one time, say a dangerous precedent has been set of using expulsion as a collective punishment. But there is little confidence among Palestinians that the court will reverse the expulsions. It has only ever overturned one of hundreds carried out over the years, assenting to the state's contention that the Fourth Geneva Convention ban on such expulsions does not apply in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The court has previously insisted on the right of appeal prior to deportation. But the government argues that the right to prior appeal does not apply in the present case because the expulsions were not permanent, that they were only a 'temporary removal' for up to two years. Yesterday, in an effort to ensure the court's approval, the government said it would set up elaborate means for the 396 alleged Islamic militants still stranded in Lebanon to appeal against their banishment individually from their isolated campsite. The attorney general promised that telephone points and mail deliveries would be provided.</p>

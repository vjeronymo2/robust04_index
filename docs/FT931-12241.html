			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to raise domestic gas prices by up to 200% RUSSIAN DOMESTIC gas prices will be increased by up to 200 per cent on February 1 in an effort to make them catch up with past inflation, Mr Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of Gazprom, the Russian state production company said yesterday. Prices to consumers will rise to Rbs600 (about 79p at the present market) per 1,000 cubic metres from a current level of Rbs216. Mr Vyakhirev said internal gas prices must be raised closer to world prices to fulfil Gazprom's urgent need for investment capital to develop new gas fields. 'But as soon as you ask for a higher price, everyone thinks you're the enemy of the people, politically we are walking on a knife edge.' Mr Alexander Margulov, director general of Yamburggasdobuycha, Gazprom's production arm in Yamburg, western Siberia, believes that internal gas prices will have to rise to Rbs1,000 per 1,000 cu m to enable the company to cover its development costs 'with a very narrow margin'. Gas prices have been kept artificially low but Gazprom is lobbying for them to be raised more quickly in line with inflation, which last year in Russia was running at 2,200 per cent. Mr Vyakhirev said Gazprom needed Dollars 8bn to Dollars 9bn for new field development over the next five years - the company cannot calculate its capital needs in roubles as the rapid pace of inflation makes the figures meaningless. The company has secured Dollars 2.8bn in credit from western banks and is in discussions with a group of German banks including Deutsche Bank and Kommerzbank about a further Dollars 1bn. In addition to investment credits, Gazprom receives about Dollars 2bn a year in hard currency from gas sales to the west. The company said it could use this to buy equipment such as large diameter pipes and horizontal drilling equipment that was not available in Russia. Gazprom has plans to increase its production of gas by 50bn cu m by 1995 to between 690bn and 695bn cu m a year. Last year, Russia produced 640bn cu m of gas and Gazprom accounted for 94 per cent of that. This year the company plans to pump about an additional 8bn to 10bn cu me. Output will be increased mainly by a rise production from the Yamburg field in western Siberia and the recent start-up of new fields such as Yubilejnoye and Komsomolskoye to the south of the Urengoy region. Gazprom's Urengoy field in western Siberia - the world's largest gas field - produced 287bn cu m of gas last year and the company says it can maintain this level of production up to 1997. But Mr Reim Suleimanov, director general of Urengoi Gazprom, says it will be unable to maintain production beyond that date without additional investment to bring new fields on stream. Mr Suleimanov is looking at developing four new satellite fields to augment output from Urengoy. The satellite fields include Pitsovoye, Yen Yakha, North Urengoy and Zapolyarnoye to the north east of the Urengoi cluster. A feasibility study of the North Urengoy field has indicated an initial development cost of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 350m. Mr Suleimanov says he would like to explore partnerships with foreign companies for development of the four new fields. Bechtel, a US resources company, has drilled two test wells in North Urengoi. 'Without foreign investment, I can hardly see these fields being developed,' he says. Gazprom's Moscow headquarters is less eager, however, to see foreign investors taking stakes in new fields. 'We don't want to make the same mistakes as the oil industry,' said Mr Vyakhirev, yesterday. He pointed to the need for foreign involvement to provide technology or equipment not available in Russia, or for more exploration data on fields already discovered, but he expected no gas production or transmission joint ventures. Russia's gas industry is one of the country's great - perhaps the only  - success stories, western observers say. Mr Suleimanov believes this is because of a powerful inertia in the gas industry, which keeps on producing in spite of lack of investment. In addition, Mr Vyakhirev stressed: 'We've done nothing (in the way of investment) in the past three years, we need to make up for that in the next four years'.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Appointments: Edwards flies in to Lucas Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace group, has broken with its past by picking a non-automotive man and a relative newcomer to the group, Tony Edwards, to be group managing director. The promotion of Edwards, 47, to be heir-apparent to Sir Anthony Gill, who has headed the group since 1987, will be seen in the City as a signal that Lucas intends to shake up its rather inbred and conservative management team. Edwards, managing director of Lucas's aerospace side, has been with the group less than two and a half years and has leap-frogged Bob Dale, a Lucas veteran who heads the much bigger automotive side. Sir Anthony, aged 61, plans to stay on as chairman until the end of 1994 but will hand over the chief executive role earlier at a date to be agreed. Meanwhile, another Lucas veteran, Bryan Mason, 52, the personnel director, has been appointed to the board. Edwards, who started as a university apprentice with Rolls-Royce before spending 14 years with General Electric of the US, is a well regarded figure in the international aerospace industry. He has transformed Lucas Aerospace from three separate nationally-based companies into a leading player in Europe's aerospace components sector. Analysts are now hoping that he will be able to work the same sort of magic on the group's traditional automative side where progress has been slower. In common with many Midlands-based companies, Lucas Industries has been hit by the recession; pre-tax profits fell from a peak of Pounds 191.2m in 1990 to Pounds 83.6m last year. However, Edwards is being seen as the man who can make the most of Lucas's undoubted recovery potential. ***** Jennie Emerson, one of the few women to reach board level in the UK oil industry, has joined the government's Offshore Industry Exports Advisory Group. Emerson, 36, is director of international operations at Tristar Oilfield Services in Dundee where she has established new business ventures in Singapore and Nigeria. She becomes the first woman to be appointed to the OIEAG which is headed by Colin Moynihan, oil minister, and which promotes the export of UK oil services equipment.</p>

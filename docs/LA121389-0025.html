			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> DONOR'S ORGANS AID 6 PATIENTS  </P> <P> A young man who died in San Francisco over the weekend gave six people a chance  to live because he served as donor of seven separate major organs. Medical  officials said the man, whose name, age and cause of death were not released,  donated the following organs to patients in desperate need: His heart went to a  person suffering from terminal cardiac disease, and one of his kidneys aided a  patient with renal disease. His other kidney and his pancreas went to a patient  with diabetes and renal failure. The man's liver went to a patient whose own  liver was no longer able to cleanse toxic wastes from the blood. One of his  lungs helped a woman who had been awaiting a transplant for a year; the other  lung went to a woman who had spent five years with a lethal lung disease. The  lung transplants were performed at Stanford University Hospital, while the  other organs were transplanted into four patients at Pacific Presbyterian  Medical Center in San Francisco.  </P></p>

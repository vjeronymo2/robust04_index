			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAS VEGAS GOLF;  </P> <P> EAGLE FINISH GIVES IRWIN SHARE OF LEAD  </P> <P> Hale Irwin sank a 40-foot eagle putt on the final hole Wednesday to gain a  share of the first-round lead in the five-day, $1.25-million Las Vegas  Invitational.  </P> <P> Irwin's 18th-hole heroics completed a seven-under-par 65 and lifted him into a  tie for the lead with Billy Glasson, Gene Sauers and Mike Miles, who is making  his second try on the PGA Tour.  </P> <P> "The best I've ever played," said Miles, who competed on the mini-tours for a  couple of years after losing his tour playing rights for lack of performance in  1986.  </P> <P> Sauers, a winner at Hawaii earlier this year, Irwin and Miles all played at  Spanish Trail, one of three desert resort courses used for the first three  rounds of this 90-hole chase for a $225,000 first prize.  </P> <P> Glasson, who won at Doral in February, had his seven-under-par effort at the  Las Vegas Country Club.  </P> <P> The group at 66 included Steve Pate, Rocco Mediate, Tom Purtzer, David Peoples,  Chris Perry, David Canipe, Mark O'Meara and South African Fulton Allem.  </P> <P> Mediate, Purtzer, Pate, Peoples and Perry played at Spanish Trail. Allem,  O'Meara and Canipe were at Las Vegas Country Club.  </P> <P> Of the leaders, only Sauers and Glasson played in the afternoon when conditions  changed dramatically. Winds increased, temperatures dropped and some desert  showers developed.  </P> <P> John Mahaffey and Tony Sills, at 67, had the best rounds at the shorter Desert  Inn course.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The state delegation which participated in the  interstate talks on the withdrawal of the Russian army from  Latvia returned from Moscow yesterday evening. Our  correspondent Ainars Asaks spoke to the head of the delegation,  Martins Virsis, at Riga airport:    [Begin Virsis recording] We initialled four documents -- one  treaty and three agreements concerning army withdrawal. We did  not agreed on the question of payment for the use of the Skrunda  facility. This problem remains unsolved at this time. As far  as the contentious issue of military pensioners is concerned,  then the formula for a compromise is the following: The concept  [of military pensioners] comprises the people who lived in  Latvia until 28 January 1992. The amount of the pension is not  in the competence of the Republic of Latvia, because Russia pays  the pensions. We cannot instruct Russia about what pensions it  pays. That is not at the concern of the Latvian taxpayer.    The deadline for the [Russian] army's withdrawal will be 31  August 1994. This treaty will obviously have to be put forward  to the Latvian and the Russian governments. The Russian side  will put it forward to its government and we -- to our  government. The governments will then approve them [as heard]  and then they can be signed and after the signing naturally  follows the ratification procedure. [end recording]</p>

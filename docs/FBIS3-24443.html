			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov: "The Federation's Trojan </F> Horse"]    [Text] The statement of the chairman of the Council of the  Federation about the need to introduce emergency measures in the  economy has been highly surprising considering the comparatively  favorable results of the work of the renewed Chernomyrdin  government in January-February of this year.    The average rates of monthly inflation came to 17 percent  during this period while in February they fell below 10 percent  for the first time since the liberalization of the economy.    Most likely Shumeyko was shaken by data concerning the drop  in industrial production in February 1994 by 24.1 percent in  comparison with the analogous period of last year, as a result  of which the proposal to quickly change something in the  management of the economy has been born. But if the speaker of  the Council of the Federation would have had a bit of time free  from important state meetings then he would have, first, paid  attention to the regular January "collapses" in industrial  production constantly repeating in recent years.    Without regard to the causes of the fatal dislike of  industry  for the first month of the year (and they, of course, are not in  the large number of New Year celebrations, since the  average-daily January indicators also demonstrate the same  tendency to fall) precisely January exerts a decisive influence  on the entire annual dynamics of the gross indicators. All the  remaining months are characterized by an absence of jumps in  production and, based on the year's results, the gross economic  indicators produce a picture differing insignificantly from that  of January.    So that Mr. Shumeyko needed to propose emergency measures in  the economy a month earlier. Now his initiative looks  economically somewhat strange, especially based on the fact that  in February the volume of industrial production... grew by 2.3  percent in comparison with January. Well, if one is to be quite  precise, then proposals about introducing emergency measures in  the economy were more appropriate after the January drop of a  year ago. Then there also was another speaker, and the deputies  acted differently towards the possibility of abrupt movements in  the economy. Legislative support of emergency measures in the  economy would have been unquestioning.    How poorly does the speaker of the Council of the Federation  reflect economic reality, so well does he relay the lobbyist  moods of the masses--there cannot be another reason for  discussions about emergency measures in the economy. To the  typical deputy-dilettante, cries about the growth of  non-payments and the drop in production seem to be the most  favorable occasion for demonstrating concern about the domestic  economy.    It is unimportant that non-payments are the ordinary  situation of the lack of effective demand (and there exist  rather simple and well known methods for clearing up the  finances of bankrupt enterprises) and that the size of the drop,  not even touching upon the inadequacies of this aggregated  indicator, demonstrates the absolute need for structural changes  in the economy (this refers primarily to the military-industrial  complex), et cetera, et cetera. For the deputy-dilettante, the  chief thing is to declare threateningly about his feelings about  approaching catastrophe and to "offer proposals."    Since the deputy-dilettante knows no other "proposals"  except  emergency measures in the economy, the formidable weapon in his  opinion--the words "emergency," "urgent," and "freeze"--is  extracted from his vocabulary.    The lack of the habit of analysis does not permit such a  deputy to understand that, in initiating the introduction of  emergency measures in the economy, he not only condemns the  country to economic chaos but also digs his own political grave.  You see, the executive power (a government, president or simply  a dictator), having received the okay for emergency measures has  no more need for legislators and legislative supervision. It is  not to be ruled out that Mr. Shumeyko also will be able to carry  out in such a situation the third in his life  parliamentary-governmental game of musical chairs. But it is  hardly worth doubting that from the moment emergency measures in  the economy are introduced the remaining deputies will have to  seek new work.</p>

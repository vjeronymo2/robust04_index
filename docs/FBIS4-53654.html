			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["National Day of Cameroon" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Pyongyang-based papers  today observe the national day of Cameroon.    The Cameroonian people who have registered successes in the  endeavours to consolidate the national independence in the past  days are today making energetic efforts to promote the national  unity and the stability of the country against the interference  of outside forces and develop the economy, MINJU CHOSON in a  signed article says, and goes on:    Pursuing the non-aligned policy externally, the Cameroonian  Government is strengthening the friendly and cooperative  relations with many countries and striving for peace in Africa.    Though Korea and Cameroon are far away from each other  geographically, their peoples have long since forged and  developed the friendly and cooperative relations.    Believing that these relations between Korea and Cameroon  will further develop in the future, the Korean people wish the  Cameroonian people greater success in the work for national  unity and economic development.</p>

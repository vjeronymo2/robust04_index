			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SENATORS WEIGH RULES ON PHONE CALLER ID;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS: MARKETERS STRESS ITS DETERRENT EFFECT ON OBSCENE OR HARASSING  CALLS. CRITICS SEE IT AS A THREAT TO PRIVACY.  </P> <P> The Senate on Wednesday plunged into the growing controversy over caller ID,  the new technology that permits a telephone customer to see the number of the  person calling even before picking up the phone.  </P> <P> The service, which soon will be introduced in Los Angeles and San Francisco,  has raised new and complex privacy issues.  </P> <P> Telephone companies have marketed the service by stressing its deterrent effect  on obscene or harassing telephone calls. In one common advertisement, a woman  is able to frighten an obscene caller by telling him that she knows his  telephone number.  </P> <P> But in testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary's subcommittee on  technology and the law, proponents of federal legislation to regulate caller ID  say that the issues go beyond managing telephone obscenity.  </P> <P> In opening the session, subcommittee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked if  caller ID would "jeopardize the safety of desperate people seeking refuge from  domestic violence, or inhibit the drug addict or suicidal teen-ager from  seeking help."  </P> <P> The issues often involve balancing the rights of callers against those of  recipients.  </P> <P> "The competing privacy interests are most often held by the same people," said  Janlori Goldman, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in  Washington. "In fact, when they see themselves as receivers of phone calls,  most people are eager for caller ID. But, as makers of phone calls, most people  want the power to block the display of their numbers."  </P> <P> Caller ID is currently offered in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and West  Virginia. But earlier this year a judge in Pennsylvania blocked introduction of  the service there, saying that caller ID is unconstitutional under state laws  that ban wiretapping.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell plans to introduce caller ID in California next year, along with  other services using the same technology.  </P> <P> The federal legislation under consideration by the Senate would permit  introduction of caller ID only if telephone customers are also given the option  of blocking the display of their number. Customers who wished to make a call  without releasing their phone number could dial a code and the recipient would  only see "P" or "Private" on the caller ID display screen.  </P> <P> In addition to this type of "per-call" blocking, telephone companies also have  the ability to permanently block the display of a customer's telephone line  every time they make a call. This is usually referred to as "per-line"  blocking.  </P> <P> Telephone companies are divided over the issue. When Pacific Bell begins caller  ID service, the company also will offer "per-call" blocking to all telephone  customers without charge. John Stangland, Pacific Bell's assistant vice  president for product development and management, said that the company decided  that offering caller ID and blocking at the same time "is the most balanced  alternative for our customers."  </P></p>

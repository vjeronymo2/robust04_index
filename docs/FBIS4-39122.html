			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian fleet will definitely be located in  Sevastopol. However, it is necessary to draw up the legal basis  for this, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov told  an INTERFAX-UKRAINA correspondent in Sevastopol, commenting on  the results of a meeting between a Ukrainian governmental  delegation and a delegation of Russian experts on the division  of the Black Sea Fleet.    It is planned that the intergovernmental talks on the  division of the fleet will be resumed in Kiev on 8 June.    The Ukrainian governmental delegation today left for  Nikolayev, where it will visit the missile cruiser Ukraina,  which is under construction there. It is expected that the  cruiser, which will become part of the Ukrainian Navy, will be  launched later this year.</p>

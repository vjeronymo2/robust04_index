			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By China Editor Cary Huang in Beijing] </F>   [Text] A senior central bank official has hinted that  Beijing will allow the Hong Kong dollar to circulate in the  special economic zones (SEZ) bordering Hong Kong and Macao. The  decision--which seemingly contradicts China's basic policy of  banning foreign currency from circulation in China--is to  facilitate the increasing number of economic transactions  between border-based businesses, said deputy governor of the  People's Bank of China Zhou Zhengqing. Mr Zhou did not give  details of the proposals. According to Chinese sources, the  decision was made last year, but was not disclosed due to the  sensitive nature of the plan.    The People's Bank of China will work out measures to ease  problems faced by businesses in Shenzhen and Zhuhai SEZ, when  following the policy of allowing no foreign currency to  circulate in China, Mr Zhou said. He reiterated that Beijing  could not allow circulation, pricing, settlement and transition  of foreign currency in its territory. However, Shenzhen SEZ may  be an exception, he said, pointing to the fact that circulation  of the Hong Kong dollar existed, following rapid development of  business exchanges between the neighbouring communities.    "As for the SEZ of Shenzhen it has carried out a lot of  economic exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao. When implementing  the policy it has come across some specific problems and for  those specific problems, we will work out specific measures to  find solutions to them," Mr Zhou told a press conference  convened by the second session of the Eighth National People's  Congress yesterday. He said the basic principle for such  measures was to facilitate economic development in Hong Kong.    Another senior central bank official said Beijing was  against  China-funded companies in Hong Kong speculating on the property  markets. "China is a country short of foreign exchanges and  funds, so we are against the practice by some companies who are  carrying out speculative activities in the real estate industry  in Hong Kong," deputy governor Chen Yuan, the son of powerful  party elder Chen Yun, said at the conference.</p>

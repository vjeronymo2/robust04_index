			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- Some 500 students  staged a strong anti-U.S. demonstration at a park in central  Seoul on April 2, protesting the U.S. plans to deploy Patriot  missiles in South Korea, according to a foreign press report  from Seoul.    The students accused the United States of heightening  tensions on the Korean peninsula by ordering the deployment of  U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea.    The raged students burned a painting of U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry, models of Patriot missiles and U.S.  flags, shouting the slogans "Yankee go home" and "No Patriot  missiles". Black smoke billowed into the air as the students  burned the painting and models of Patriot missiles with the U.S.  flags drawn on the sides.    About 200 police were on alert to prevent the students from  marching into the streets. But they did not yield to it.    Upset by the anti-U.S demonstration of the students, the Kim  Yong-sam pro-American flunkeyist traitorous clique posted more  than 400 riot police in front of the U.S. Embassy, making  itself open to criticism.</p>

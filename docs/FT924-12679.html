			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC officials see Gatt breakthrough EC OFFICIALS yesterday proclaimed a breakthrough in the Gatt multilateral trade talks, declaring an outline deal with the US on agriculture and services could be reached within the next fortnight. After high-level talks in Ontario at the weekend, EC officials in Brussels abandoned their customary caution and talked up prospects for a successful end of the Gatt Uruguay Round before the November 3 presidential election. Despite continuing signs of French reservations about the proposed agreement to cut farm subsidies, the officials suggested the tide had turned in favour of a deal, largely because it is viewed in Europe and the US as the 'last best hope' for a world economic recovery. Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, also voiced optimism yesterday. 'We're hopeful. We're making a little headway but we're not there yet,' he said. 'We're trying to be flexible in these talks. We are not rigid but neither will we break.' Last week's warning by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, that the US and Japan faced the most severe recession since 1945, may have influenced the mood of negotiations as much as President George Bush's desire for a boost to his flagging re-election campaign. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, and Mr Madigan spoke on the telephone at the weekend and are expected to meet within the next week or so in an effort to crack outstanding differences: the extent to which the EC must cut its oilseeds output, and formulas for cutting subsidised exports by up to 24 per cent. The Madigan-MacSharry meeting was described yesterday as the chance to 'clinch the deal'. Optimism has risen after the US conceded that compensation to European farmers for price cuts agreed in last May's Common Agriculture Policy reform should be exempt from the Gatt requirement to cut overall domestic subsidies by 20 per cent. Officials said rapid progress had been made in services, though differences remain on the treatment of audio-visual equipment and maritime transport. On financial services, the US and EC are near a deal, but divisions remain with other countries, including Japan. At best, the US and EC should be able to produce a piece of paper in a fortnight which will proclaim both sides' confidence that a final text could be agreed by the end of the year, or early January. But questions remain about France's attitude to a deal so obviously desired by the US. EC officials say there is no point in forcing the Gatt issue to a vote in the Council of Ministers until a final text is agreed. Despite the widely-held view that France could be outvoted in the council, some legal experts in Brussels warn it is unclear whether all trade policy is subject to a qualified majority vote under Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Negotiations were being watched closely yesterday by the presidential campaign team behind Governor Bill Clinton, which is concerned that a final package be acceptable to Congress. A campaign spokesman stressed that no signal had been sent to Brussels to indicate the governor's support for unsatisfactory US concessions, particularly those made under pressure from the election.</p>

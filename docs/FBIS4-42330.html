			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Left-Wing Parties Won in Iceland"] </F>   [Text] The conservative Independence Party and the Social  Democratic Party, which together form the government of Iceland,  were the big losers in Saturday's [28 May] local elections. The  Independence Party lost its empire in Reykjavik, where the party  has more or less reigned supreme for 64 years. The winners are  the joint list of left-wing parties which won 53 percent of the  vote and had eight representatives elected. The Independence  Party won 47 percent of the vote and had seven representatives  elected.    Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir (Women's Alliance), who won a  great personal victory and is now Reykjavik's new mayor, said  the result shows that the voters in the capital have grown tired  of the one-party rule by the Independence Party and want changes  that place the individual in center stage.</p>

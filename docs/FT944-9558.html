			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo returns to the acquisition trail Kalamazoo, the Birmingham-based computer services and printed systems group, has made its second acquisition of the financial year with the purchase of WIS Computer Systems for up to Pounds 5.79m in cash and shares. 'There is more to come. We've been quite busy. There are a number of discussions in the pipeline,' said Mr Mike Langmore, chief executive. In August, Kalamazoo said it expected to spend up to Pounds 20m this year on expanding its computer services business. The initial payment for WIS, a privately owned Cardiff company, is Pounds 1.52m in cash and Pounds 270,644 in new Kalamazoo shares. A further consideration of up to Pounds 4m in cash and shares depends on the net results of WIS in the years to January 1998. The effect of the share issue, combined with the shares issued under employee share option schemes announced in January, will be to dilute the holding of Kalamazoo Trust to less than 50 per cent for the first time since it was set up in 1948. Earlier this year the trust, established to ensure that employees had majority ownership, agreed to accept dilution, thus giving the board the choice of using Kalamazoo paper to make acquisitions.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 2.8m acquisition by Prime People PRIME PEOPLE, the Manchester-based human resources group, is to acquire Bowford Engineering Services for Pounds 2.8m and meet part of the consideration via a rights issue. Bowford has six skills training centres throughout the UK. Consideration will be met by the allotment to vendors of 31m shares at 4 1/4 p, payment of Pounds 1.07m cash and the issue of Pounds 387,500 loan notes. The vendors, Mr Geoff Bowers and Mr John Ashford, will control a maximum 38.2 per cent of the Prime capital, and shareholders will need to approve the deal. The rights will be on the basis of 1-for-3 at 4 1/4 p each, and raise Pounds 530,000 before expenses. There will also be issued up to 2.5m warrants at the rate of 1-for-5 shares, entitling subscription to one share on March 31 in the years 1993-96 inclusive. For the year ended October 31 1992 Bowford is forecast to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 395,000, compared with Pounds 1m. The decline is largely attributable to costs incurred in preparing two projects for the Ministry of Defence and Mobil. Results from USM-quoted Prime for the half year ended June 30 show a loss of Pounds 161,000 (Pounds 121,000 after exceptionals of Pounds 86,000), from turnover of Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 595,000). Losses per share were 0.01p (1.5p).</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / How Bill and Hillary bit back and raised a healthy laugh: Jurek Martin enjoyed a video coup by the First Couple at a white-tie night out for the media grand panjandrums of Washington It is just possible that there are those in the darkest corners of America, where the light of television never shines, who have never heard of Harry and Louise. Such ignorance will no longer be possible. The actors who play H &amp; L in TV commercials paid for by the US insurance industry - an earnest middle-class couple who sit in their kitchen agonising over the costs of the Clinton healthcare plan, often for as long as the full minute allowed - have been usurped. They now stand revealed as Bill and Hillary. It could have been a tricky Saturday night live for the president and the first lady. They were guests of honour of the Gridiron Club, a 109-year-old Washington institution of media grand panjandrums. Its only activity is a white-tie annual dinner at which politicians are roasted alive - all off-the-record, of course, but relayed like lightning around the country (well, inside the District of Columbia Beltway.) The Clintons hardly needed to dress up to be skewered by the media. The Whitewater affair, stemming from the Clintons' financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s, has them on the rack and their resentment is sometimes palpable. On Saturday, there was a frisson of expectation that the First Couple, in the lion's den, might let it all hang out. Enter their inspired coup de video. The president commanded his audience to turn to the large screen at one end of the hotel ballroom. There, sitting demurely on a sofa, was Louise (aka Hillary) leafing through a vast tome. She was joined by a casually dressed, coffee cup-carrying Harry (Bill) and they agonised. 'Look,' she said, 'it says here on page 7,325 (or some such number) that we may actually get ill.' Big letters on the screen: 'Under the Clinton health plan you may actually get ill.' They agonised more: 'It says here on page 26,423 we may actually die.' More big letters. The sign-off had them rolling in the aisles: 'Brought to you by the scare-your-pants off coalition.' Yesterday, this private screening was all over the commercial networks. It bore the fingerprints of Harry Thomason, the Hollywood TV producer and FoB (Friend of Bill) who last week aired a spoof commercial killing off the insurance industry's Harry and Louise - she dies because her health insurance has run out, of course. Truth to tell, the real star turn of the evening was the reputed wooden man, Vice-President Al Gore. He was wheeled to the microphone on a delivery dolley, where he lay stiff as a board, and moved hardly a muscle beyond his lips during a very funny speech - 'I'm an inspiration to the thousands of Americans suffering from Dutch elm disease.' The president got in a good crack at the young Republican Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts, an ambitious patrician: 'His ancestors landed at Plymouth Rock in the Mayflower. Mine drove into Arkansas in a Plymouth truck and worked for Mayflower van lines.' Does an evening of laughter make a difference? Probably not, in the long term, given the media feeding frenzy over Whitewater, but it made a welcome break. And we have seen the end of Harry and Louise, for which small mercy, great thanks.</p>

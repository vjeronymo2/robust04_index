			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Lobbyists fight smoke with fire The latest anti-smoking campaigns in the US are setting a new standard for public health messages by using the imaginative treatments normally reserved for food, drink and perfume. 'We finally decided to attack the tobacco industry, not by throwing boring facts at the public, but by attacking them on their own battlefield - image,' said Paul Keye, chairman of Livingston and Keye, the advertising firm that put together a particularly successful campaign in California. One problem with public health campaigns in the US is that they have lacked the funds to hire top advertising talent. As a result, public health messages were often seen as dull, 'preachy' slots which viewers soon forgot. New laws in Minnesota and California, however, have added hefty taxes - around 25 cents a pack - to cigarettes, to fund an anti-smoking campaign. Massachusetts may soon follow suit. The California effort began with a Dollars 199m (Pounds 131m) anti-smoking budget in 1989 and 1990, Dollars 28m of which was spent on a media campaign. That may not be much compared with the Dollars 300m the tobacco industry spent on marketing in the state over the same period, but it allowed the anti-tobacco lobby to tap top advertising firms for the first time. Keye, who was chosen to head the campaign, admits there was a temptation to stick to the old formula of dishing out the facts. 'We tested one commercial in which we strung together images of famous movie stars smoking - like Humphrey Bogart and Joan Crawford. Then, at the end of the commercial we told the viewers: 'These movie stars all died of smoking'.' It did not work. 'When we tested the ad, all the viewers, including the non-smokers, seemed to walk out with the overwhelming urge for a cigarette. That's when we realised that the image factor completely outweighed the facts we were putting out.' A new strategy was obviously needed. 'We decided that if image is what matters, our main goal would be de-glamorisation,' said Keye. Central to the new campaign was an all-out attack on the tobacco industry to create a villain in the anti-smoking struggle. 'One problem in reaching young people through health service messages is that they tend to rebel against being told what to do,' said Jacquolyn Duerr, chief of the media unit at the California Department of Health's tobacco control programme. 'The new message was: 'These terrible, greedy people in the tobacco industry are trying to get you to buy cigarettes and make a profit at your expense. Are you going to let them do it?'' The result was a series of messages, one of which featured tobacco industry executives laughing in a smoke-filled room about how they were duping the public. Other commercials concentrated on the harm of second-hand smoke; one featured rap music and another an off-putting image of a woman smoking in reverse - with all the smoke being pulled into her mouth. The new approach yielded impressive results. Viewers' awareness of the campaign reached 87 per cent at its peak in some population segments. In two years smoking in California was reduced from 26 per cent of the adult population to just 21 per cent. Those involved in the campaign believe its success will encourage other public health lobbies to adopt the same formula.</p>

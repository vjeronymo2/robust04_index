			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: WEDDING BELLS  </P> <P> Roseanne to Tie the Knot?: Less than a month after announcing her wedding plans  were off, Roseanne Barr was spotted Wednesday taking out a marriage license at  the Santa Monica Superior Court, although her publicist said Wednesday that  Barr has not yet married. "I can't believe I'm doing this," Barr was overheard  saying as she walked in the door to the courthouse.  </P> <P> Barr will marry her long-time friend and collaborator Tom Arnold, but no  wedding date has been set, said Barr's publicist Alana Rothstein. "She's still  literally taking it day by day," Rothstein said. In December, Barr called off  her Jan. 20 wedding with Arnold, explaining in a statement that he was in an  alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic. Barr's divorce from husband Tom  Pentland was scheduled to become finalized Wednesday. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

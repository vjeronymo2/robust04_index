			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Desjardins puts price of CDollars 625m on Laurentian THE CDollars 50bn Desjardins financial services group has fixed a price of CDollars 11.57 a share or a total of about CDollars 625m (USDollars 466m) to complete the takeover of rival Laurentian Group. All Desjardins' financial services units, except its 1,300 credit union branches, mainly in Quebec, will be merged with the smaller Laurentian into Desjardins-Laurentian Financial, a holding company minority-held by the public. This holding company, together with the credit unions, will have corporate assets and assets under management of almost CDollars 80bn, placing it among Canada's top five financial services groups. It will also include Laurentian Bank. The CDollars 11.57 per Laurentian share being paid by Desjardins will comprise CDollars 6.22 cash plus stock or notes of the new holding company. The full offer goes out November 1. The biggest Laurentian unit, Toronto-based Imperial Life Assurance, with half its business in the US, now becomes part of Desjardins. Groupe Victoire of France, a minority holder of Laurentian, will retain a smaller interest in the merged group, taking cash and stock in the holding company. The merger is expected to close in January and the new holding company's stock will be quoted on the Canadian stock exchanges.</p>

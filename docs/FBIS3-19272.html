A strengthening of the Finnish economy is  mentioned as an advantage of EU membership, while the adaptation  of farming is regarded as a disadvantage. [passage omitted]    Only now is a special working group going to start drafting  a  detailed study on the effects of the EU settlement on Finnish  farming. [passage omitted]    The other studies published today see the advantages of  Finnish EU membership as greater than the disadvantages, which  is probably no great surprise. The advantages mentioned are an  increase in investments, participation in the EU's joint trade  policy and other decisionmaking processes, and a strengthening  of the foreign and security policy. But the latter is also  linked with great problems, in addition to farming, depending on  whether Europe is moving toward integration or division and on  what Russia's position in Europe will be.    With EU membership, Finland would say farewell to the policy  of neutrality. According to a study commissioned by the  Ministry of Trade and Industry, as a member of the EU, Finland  could not pursue the policy of neutrality as it did in earlier  years. According to the same study carried out by the Foreign  Policy Institute, outside the EU, the only alternative remaining  for Finland would be a policy of neutrality, whose pursuit,  however, would be more difficult than in the Cold War era. The  study stresses that as a member of the EU, Finland could expect  support for the security policy and solidarity from the other  member countries.</p>

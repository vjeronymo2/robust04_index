			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Shtorkh] </F>   [Text] Paris April 13 TASS -- "Fulfilling French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe's personal instruction, French Ambassador  to the Council of Europe Michel Lennuyeux-Commene officially  notified Chairman of the Russian Liberal-Democratic Party  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Tuesday about the impermissibility of  several of his pronouncements," official representative of the  French Foreign Ministry Catherine Colonna told ITAR-TASS here  today.    According to Colonna, the official notification was prompted  by Zhirinovskiy's pronouncements at the Charles de Gaulle  Airport in Paris and also in Strasbourg. It referred primarily  to statements made outside the Palace of Europe, where a session  of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe is now  under way. Zhirinovskiy came to France to take part in this  forum. "It is strange to hear such pronouncement from an  official representative, who should worthily represent his  country abroad. The Liberal-Democratic Party leader has already  provoked several incidents since he appeared on French soil,"  Colonna stated.    "Zhirinovskiy was told once again that his visa to France  was  of a limited nature," Colonna noted. "The French ambassador had  officially addressed the Liberal-Democratic Party leader, who is  deputy of the State Duma and member of the Russian parliamentary  delegation. Zhirinovskiy's claim that he knew nothing about any  official notification of the french Foreign Ministry is untrue,"  Colonna noted.    The non-government Movement Against Racism and for  International Friendship asked the Human Rights Commission of  the European parliament to assess Zhirinovskiy's pronouncements  at the session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of  Europe in Strasbourg. A communique issued here by the movement  expresses its astonishment that the commission "did not try to  oppose Zhirinovskiy's invitation to Strasbourg" at the time when  Germany, Bulgaria and France still regard the Russian  ultra-nationalist leader as a persona non-grata.    Chairman of the ultra-rightist National Front Jean-Marie Le  Pen told a press conference in Paris: "We regret the stand  assumed by the French Government and believe it is incorrect and  dangerous to treat a foreign political leader in this way. A  Russian politician, who is learning the art of democracy, should  not be condemned."</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Judge puts off decision in battle over Perrier THE outcome of the first round in the legal battle over the ownership of Perrier, the mineral water group, hung in the balance last night when a French judge said he would delay his judgment until later this week. Mr Gilles Ray, president of the commercial court at Nimes in southern France, is considering a case lodged by Nestle, the Swiss food group which is mounting a FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid for the French mineral water company in conjunction with Banque Indosuez of France. Nestle has asked the court to freeze the voting rights on the 35 per cent stake in Perrier controlled by Exor, the French property group for which the Agnelli family of Italy is in the throes of a FFr5.6bn friendly bid. Nestle, which last month secured a temporary injunction on the Exor votes, also wants the freeze to apply to Societe Generale, the French bank allied to Exor. Exor, whose chairman, Mr Jacques Vincent, also chairs Perrier, is fighting against the case which began yesterday in a court room packed with employees from the mineral water company. This is the first in a series of cases which could be critical in determining the final outcome of the battle for Perrier. Next week,the Paris commercial court will decide whether to invalidate the recent purchase of 13.8 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the French sugar group in which the Agnellis also hold a stake. Unless Nestle succeeds in invalidating the voting rights of either Exor or Saint Louis it has no hope of winning control of Perrier given that together the two French groups control nearly 49 per cent of its quarry. French food group BSN is to sell a 67 per cent stake in brewery Henninger Hellas to Greek wine company Boutari. Under the deal,Boutari will distribute BSN's beer and mineral water brands in Greece. BSN will keep a 19.5 per cent stake in Henninger.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 24, 1994, the Secretary of the Interior approved, with certain exceptions, amendments to the Wyoming program provisions regarding the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with administrative review proceedings under the Wyoming program. As a result of this decision, the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) was modified to require Wyoming to revise section 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 of the Wyoming Statutes (W.S.) to be consistent with the Federal requirements at section 525(e) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1275(e)) and 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295 concerning the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings (see 59 FR 3513). The amendment under consideration in the current rulemaking is intended to satisfy this condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Submission of Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated April 13, 1994 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;27&hyph;01), Wyoming submitted Enrolled Act No. 4, which was adopted during the 1994 Budget Session of the Wyoming Legislature and signed into law by the Governor on March 16, 1994, as a proposed amendment to its permanent program. The proposed amendment, which consists of statutory changes to the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (EQA), is intended to satisfy the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c), as modified on January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3513). Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 by (1) amending the introductory language of subsection (f) to change the word ``director'' to ``council,'' and add the phrase ``or subsequent judicial review proceedings''; (2) repealing paragraphs (f)(i) and (f)(iii) in their entirety; and (3) repealing subsection (g) in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the April 13, 1994, submittal in the May 2, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 22571), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the April 13, 1994, submittal. The public comment period closed on June 1, 1994. A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

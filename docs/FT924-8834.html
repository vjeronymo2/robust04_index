			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Demand for hepatitis drug boosts Takeda TAKEDA Chemical Industries, Japan's largest pharmaceutical company, has seen sales and profits rise due to brisk demand for its new anti-hepatitis drug. For the six months to September, Takeda posted a 1.8 per cent rise in non-consolidated sales to Y284.2bn (Dollars 2.3bn), while pre-tax profits rose 2.9 per cent to Y36.2bn. After-tax profits grew 16.1 per cent to Y16.3bn, as the company suffered extraordinary losses of some Y4bn due to typhoon damage the previous year. Takeda said a steady 4 per cent rise in drug sales offset the 7.5 per cent fall in sales of chemicals. For the full year to March, the company expects a 0.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y71.5bn on a 1.6 per cent increase in sales to Y570bn. Eisai, another leading drugs company, said profits were affected by rising costs, while sales were hit by official cuts in drug prices last April. Overall sales rose by a mere 0.6 per cent to Y111bn, while pre-tax profits fell 1.9 per cent to Y17.2bn.</p>

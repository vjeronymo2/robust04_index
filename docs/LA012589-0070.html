			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FIRM WILL ELIMINATE 120 JOBS;  </P> <P> AST RESEARCH HAS $8.9-MILLION LOSS IN QUARTER  </P> <P> AST Research Inc. in Irvine, buffeted by increasing competition in the personal  computer industry, Tuesday reported an $8.9-million loss for the quarter ended  Dec. 30 and said it is eliminating 120 positions.  </P> <P> AST handed out pink slips Monday night and Tuesday morning to 70 management,  marketing and assembly employees in Irvine. The layoffs took effect  immediately. AST said the dismissed employees would receive severance pay.  </P> <P> Twenty Orange County positions that were vacated last month through attrition  will not be filled, the company said.  </P> <P> In addition, AST said it is eliminating 30 positions in other areas of the  United States and overseas through a combination of layoffs and attrition,  bringing the total work force reduction to 120.  </P> <P> As of Dec. 30, AST had 1,234 employees in Orange County and 2,025 workers  worldwide.  </P> <P> Several workers on Tuesday said they expected the layoffs after AST announced  earlier this month that it would report a sizable loss for its fiscal 1989  second quarter.  </P> <P> AST said it lost $8.9 million on revenue of $110.9 million for the three  months. The company earned $2 million on revenue of $92.6 million in the  year-ago quarter.  </P> <P> "There have been rumors for the last three weeks to a month about layoffs,"  said Lloyd Allsopp, a worker at AST's manufacturing facility in Irvine. Allsopp  was not laid off.  </P> <P> AST's announcement did not surprise Wall Street, either. Several high-tech  firms have announced personnel cutbacks in the past few weeks, including  Western Digital Corp. in Irvine and Wyse Technology in San Jose.  </P> <P> AST President Safi Qureshey was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> About a third of AST's second-quarter loss stems from a writedown of the  recorded value of assets of the company's Camintonn division, which makes  products for systems compatible with Digital Equipment Corp. computers.  </P> <P> AST has said it would like to sell Camintonn. The company took the writedown,  said Finance Vice President Jerry Ulrich, because AST believes that the price  it eventually receives for Camintonn will be about $3 million below the stated  value of the division's assets.  </P> <P> Another $2.6-million loss reserve was booked in the second quarter to account  for the cost of employee severance packages as well as a drop in the value of  some of AST's inventory.  </P> <P> The remainder of the loss was attributed to costly marketing strategies adopted  by AST to try to keep its customers.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lucille Renwick contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / India speeds up moves to cut financial support to public sector THE Indian government is cutting financial support to the public sector  - once the keystone of Indian socialism - more rapidly than official policy pronouncements suggest. The administration of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is seeking, however, to minimise job losses that could lead to a confrontation with labour. He told parliament yesterday that as of now 'not a single worker has been thrown out of employment'. His statement came as the Janata Dal and left-wing parties called for a national strike to protest against what they call 'an anti-poor' budget. Senior officials disclosed yesterday that the government's net contribution towards capital spending by the public sector - steel, railways, fertilisers and other state-owned industries will drop next year by 16 per cent to Rs35.3bn (Pounds 768m). As a result the government's net share of capital spending by the public sector will have fallen to 9.6 per cent from 18.5 per cent only four years ago. The net figures, which are not normally made public, exclude foreign assistance to the public sector through bilateral or multilateral donors. Total capital spending by the public sector will none the less rise marginally next year, reflecting an improvement in the ability of state-owned companies to generate more funds internally. In addition to a smaller contribution to the public sector, last Saturday's budget also includes a 41 per cent reduction to Rs4.4bn in central government lending to cover public sector losses. Under an understanding with the World Bank, these loans are to to be phased out in three years - forcing closure or rationalisation of almost 50 companies which have been making persistent losses. The budget makes allowance for about 100,000 public sector workers to be made redundant this year - mostly textile workers employed by mills nationalised because the private sector was unable to finance their losses. The government wants to avoid large retrenchments in both public and private sector companies that are paying their way. Indicating this week that the government was in no hurry to push through legislation to make it easier for industry to reduce its labour force, Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said the government would proceed on a case-by-case basis. He said there was no need for the 'excessive publicity' and the 'fuss' that would go with an official policy on closures and retrenchments.</p>

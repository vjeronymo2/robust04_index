			<p>Beijing      Warns Hong Kong on Political Dissidents                         SUMMARY      Reflecting apparent Chinese leadership's sensitivity to the  potentially destabilizing influence on China of anti-Beijing  dissident activity in Hong Kong, a highly unusual editorial in  the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po suggested that Beijing  may be reconsidering its longstanding pledge to preserve Hong  Kong's capitalist system after the transition to Chinese rule in  1997.                         END SUMMARY      Signs that Beijing may be rethinking its policy of "one country,  two systems"--a concept associated with senior leader Deng  Xiaoping which calls for the retention of a capitalist economy in  Hong Kong for 50 years after the transition--came in a caustic  editorial carried by Wen Wei Po on 30 May.  The editorial warned  that this policy is "feasible" only if dissidents do not use Hong  Kong as a "bridgehead" to "interfere with, subvert, or sabotage"  China's socialist system.  It went on to assert that the  implementation of the principle will "suffer" if "one system"  tries to "bring down" the other.  The editorial also implicitly  associated this harsh message with the current Beijing  leadership, selectively quoting from a "well-known speech" on  Hong Kong policy delivered by party chief Jiang Zemin after  China's suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen prodemocracy movement.  The editorial referred to Jiang's use of the metaphor of "well  water not mixing with river water"--a warning against extending  Hong Kong's capitalism to the mainland--but did not mention his  assurances that "one country, two systems" would prevail.     The editorial's harsh warning flies in the face of repeated  assurances by Chinese leaders that capitalism will prevail in  Hong Kong after 1997.  In a major policy speech as recently as 6  May, Lu Ping, the State Council's Director of Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs, reaffirmed China's pledge to retain Hong Kong as a  capitalist "bridge" to the West even as he warned against  "movements" that "disrupt the Chinese economy" and efforts by  "Hong Kong people" to "exert pressure on the Chinese Government"  (Xinhua, 6 May).  The "one country, two systems" concept, he  said, is "truly China's longterm policy" and is "guaranteed by  law."  In an apparent effort to portray Lu's speech as consistent  with its own hardline theme, the Wen Wei Po editorial highlighted  Lu's warning that Hong Kong is not a "political city" that can  "influence the mainland politically" and his references to Hong  Kong's "economic value" as the basis of Beijing's policy.  It did  not, however, mention Lu's references to Hong Kong as a bridge to  the West.     The editorial's harsh rhetoric on Hong Kong may have been  prompted by anti-PRC dissident activity in Hong Kong in the runup  to the 4 June anniversary of Tiananmen and by fears that Hong  Kong authorities will tolerate such activity in the future.  Reflecting these concerns, the editorial was particularly  critical of the Hong Kong Government's widely reported decision  to allow exiled labor activist Han Dongfang to remain in Hong  Kong, complaining that Han intended to "organize a solidarity  trade union" and make "trouble out of nothing."  It also  expressed concern about efforts by other prominent dissidents in  the United States to "follow in the footsteps of Han Dongfang"  and return to Hong Kong to "put on a 'show' first" before moving  on into the mainland via the springboard of Hong Kong to "make  trouble."     While clearly meant as a warning to Hong Kong authorities, the  editorial was also critical of U.S. support for the dissidents.  It claimed that Han's "anti-China activities" were being funded  by "none other than the AFL-CIO."  It also purported to see a  U.S. hand behind the desire by other dissidents to make Hong Kong  their base of operations, saying that "one foreign country" has  provided political asylum for this "batch of so-called  'prodemocracy activists'" and that their "bosses" are now  "telling" them to return to the mainland to carry out "subversive  activities."

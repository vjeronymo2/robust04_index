			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Trade News: Pretoria seeks to revive trade with Asia A SOUTH African trade mission arrives in east Asia today in an effort to boost trade with the region. The delegation is keen to rebuild trade with Japan in particular. Japan was South Africa's largest trading partner until 1987 when it froze bilateral trade at 1987 levels. Japan banned steel imports, exports of arms, computers and certain vehicle types, new investment and loans to South Africa. None the less, Japan continued to export many goods not included in the ban. Japanese cars account for about half of all vehicle sales while National Panasonic is a market leader in consumer electronics. Japan has now lifted sanctions against South Africa and restored diplomatic relations. Few observers doubt that it will soon re-establish itself as South Africa's main trading partner. It has long been a major purchaser of South African raw materials. South Africa is also hoping to encourage Japanese investment in South Africa, particularly joint ventures. The mission, led by Mr Derek Keys, minister of Trade and Industry and Economic Co-ordination, will visit China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and India.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: Reality of being out of ERM Sir, It is naive for anyone to assume that we can copy the US and reduce interest rates to low single figures and let the currency float down. The US economy has only a 10 per cent exposure to external markets, Britain's is over 40 per cent. Apart from the inflationary implications, it would be an aggressive act of competitive devaluation that would jeopardise our trading relationships and particularly our participation in the single market. Can Britain expect its European partners to welcome a flood of cut-price Nissan cars from Sunderland next year? The devaluation that has already taken place provides ample short-term stimulus to the economy. The government must quickly define a new exchange rate target and re-establish its credibility. The best way of doing that is to rejoin the ERM at the earliest opportunity. Why the authorities allowed the foreign exchange market to pick off the currencies one by one, instead of acknowledging earlier that the unexpectedly high cost of absorbing east Germany was legitimate justification for a general realignment, remains a mystery. The ERM is, after all, designed as a fixed but adjustable system. Its purpose is to pave the way to a single currency. If we had had a single currency in Europe, monetary pressures would have been more evenly spread and last week's crisis would not have happened. Reality will inevitably require management of the exchange rate vis a vis the D-Mark and a higher risk premium, meaning higher interest rates, will apply if we are outside the ERM. We will not escape the Bundesbank by opting out. John Major has to recover the initiative in Europe while he is president of the Council. It will require great courage but he should use the events of last week as justification for accelerating the establishment of a monetary institution that is responsive to the monetary needs of Europe as a whole and not just to the perceived needs of one member country.

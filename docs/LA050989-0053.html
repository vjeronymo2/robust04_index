			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STONE SHOWS YANKEES AFTER LEACH IS A NO-SHOW  </P> <P> Jeff Stone worked hard before the game, not expecting to play.  </P> <P> When Stone, a late replacement for the missing Rick Leach, found himself in the  lineup, he still had the strength to drive in four runs as the Texas Rangers  trounced the New York Yankees, 13-2, Monday night at New York.  </P> <P> "I did about 100 pushups and about 16 laps in the outfield because I didn't  expect to play," Stone said.  </P> <P> Stone was not in the original lineup but was inserted as the designated hitter  when Leach didn't show up at Yankee Stadium. A spokesman for the Rangers said  Leach's whereabouts were unknown, although he made the trip to New York after  Sunday's game in Boston.  </P> <P> "I talked to Rick at about 2:30 (p.m.) and he asked me what time the bus was  leaving," Stone said. "He sounded fine and there was no problem.  </P> <P> "It was kind of strange, but I had a job to do."  </P> <P> Stone, who entered the game four for 19 this season, hit a three-run triple as  the Rangers scored seven times in the fifth inning and added a run-scoring  double in a four-run sixth.  </P> <P> Stone was released by Baltimore this spring and signed to a minorleague  contract by the Rangers. He was recalled from Oklahoma City on April 11 when  Buddy Bell went on the disabled list.  </P> <P> While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, Leach disappeared from Aug. 25-27,  1987, after an argument with his wife.  </P> <P> A Ranger spokesman said the club called Leach's wife when he failed to show up  Monday, but she didn't know his whereabouts. She also said she did not know of  any problem Leach might have.  </P> <P> Rookie Kevin Brown (3-1) pitched seven strong innings to beat New York for the  second time in a week. Brown beat the Yankees, 4-1, last Wednesday with a  two-hitter.  </P> <P> He allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings this time. Ken Rogers and  Jeff Russell each pitched one scoreless inning.  </P> <P> The Rangers, who had 16 hits, four by Ruben Sierra, sent 12 batters to the  plate in the fifth, when they had six hits.  </P> <P> Andy Hawkins (3-4) allowed nine hits and nine runs in 4 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Pete Incaviglia, who entered the game in a four-for-25 slump, hit his fifth  homer for Texas.  </P> <P> Oakland 6, Baltimore 1 -- At Baltimore, Mike Moore allowed four hits in seven  innings and Terry Steinbach extended his hitting streak to 15 games, longest in  the majors this season, as the Athletics handed the Orioles their fifth  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> The A's have won 31 of their last 48 games in AL East ballparks.  </P> <P> Moore (4-2) has allowed more than two runs only once in seven starts. Craig  Worthington spoiled his shutout bid with a home run in the seventh inning, his  second of the season. Greg Cadaret finished with two hitless innings.  </P> <P> Steinbach and Walt Weiss each had three of the A's 13 hits.  </P> <P> The Athletics took a 2-0 lead against Bob Milacki (1-3) in the first inning  when Luis Polonia singled and scored on a double by Dave Henderson, who scored  on Steinbach's single.  </P> <P> Stan Javier doubled home two runs, and Weiss singled home two more as Oakland  broke it open in the eighth.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was the 1,118th consecutive game played by the Orioles' Cal  Ripken, who moved past Billy Williams into fourth place on the all-time list.  Ripken's streak began May 30, 1982.  </P> <P> Toronto 10, Seattle 1 -- Dave Stieb scattered six hits over eight innings and  Tony Fernandez, Junior Felix and Fred McGriff each drove in three runs as the  Blue Jays trounced the Mariners at Toronto.  </P> <P> Stieb (3-0), who gave way to Tom Henke in the ninth, lost his shutout when  Harold Reynolds hit a run-scoring single in the seventh.  </P> <P> Toronto chased Mike Dunne (1-2) by scoring six runs on six hits and six walks  in 3 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Minnesota 4, Boston 2 -- Kirby Puckett, who had been hitless in 15 at-bats, had  a run-scoring double and Shane Rawley scattered eight hits in 7 2/3 innings as  the Twins downed the Red Sox at Boston.  </P> <P> Rawley (2-4) worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the second and ended a  four-game losing streak with his first victory since his debut with the Twins  on April 6.  </P> <P> Minnesota gave Manager Tom Kelly his 200th major league win.  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker (2-3) walked Al Newman to open the game and Puckett doubled him  home.  </P> <P> IRON MEN  </P> <P> The leaders in consecutive games played:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Player  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Games  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lou Gehrig  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,130  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Everett Scott  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,307  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Steve Garvey  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,207  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cal Ripken  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,118  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Billy Williams  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,117  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There is a threat of U.S. military intervention in  Haiti. The task would not be easy for the United States.  Everything would be a surprise. The president of the  Independent Drivers Union has unveiled a strategy to knock out  the great star-studded power. Pierre Malvoisin relies heavily  on the participation of the Haitians of the diaspora, Haitians  who do not spare their help. Haitians here and in the United  States will move in to attack at the first alert:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Malvoisin] Father Aristide has  asked for intervention, but 1915 and 1994 are not the same.  (?The circumstances are quite different). In 1915, there were  no Haitians in the United States; today, there must be 1.5  million Haitians in the United States. We have....[pauses]  there are many patriots in the United States. If the Americans  land in Haiti now...[pauses] I do not say...[pauses] Haiti is a  little country of 27,000 square km, but the United States has 16  million square kilometers. Haiti will perish; it will be the end  of Haiti. I believe it will also be the end of the United  States because once the Americans land, our patriots there will  blow up many U.S. buildings, in Los Angeles, Chicago,  California, San Francisco, Florida, New York, Texas. They will  lose many things. Even NASA will be attacked.    [Unidentified correspondent] Malvoisin, is there a true plan  to consolidate this work?    [Malvoisin] Yes. [end recording]    He added in a firm tone of voice: Everything is ready and  has been set up; it only remains to wait for the orders. The  leader of the independent drivers called the United States  ungrateful. He recalled the U.S. war of independence. He  insisted on Savannah. He is sorry about the fate of the great  neighbor that has (?shouted): Bound for nothingness! Malvoisin  does not understand that a neighbor has decided to solve the  problems of a friendly country with force. This statement or  firm position has come to support the argument of U.S. Professor  Jack Tyle. He said the withdrawal of the U.S. military forces  would be more difficult than the landing. This is a way to  repeat Jean de La Fontaine: One sees very well how to get into  this den, but one does not see how to get out of it. As for  union leader Pierre Malvoisin, he will get out of it with a  haughty head and proudly.</p>

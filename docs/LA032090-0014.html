			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: SANCTIONS LEAD TO LOUD CRIES OF FOUL BALL  </P> <P> There is no doubt that life is unfair. For many of us, life couldn't be more  unfair than when the NCAA declared sanctions against Rimshot Tech's basketball  team. Rimshot Tech, located in the heart of Maryland's low-ball country, had  one of the most outstanding records of any school in the Hurricane Zelda  Conference. There was even serious talk of the school going to New Orleans for  the Jambalaya Playoffs.  </P> <P> Brad Teicher, who rides shotgun in our car pool to Rimshot games, said, "You'd  think that the NCAA Committee on Sports Infractions would have something better  to do than look for recruiting violations in a university's athletic program."  </P> <P> Chili Kohlmeyer asked, "What's wrong with giving an incoming freshman a small  BMW if he needs transportation to get to and from practice at night?"  </P> <P> I was in the back seat of the car. "Here's what I think. If the alumni didn't  give them $600 weekly handouts, the players would go to school in another  state. All our alumni do when they subsidize a good player is guarantee that he  won't leave his Mommy and Daddy and go far from home."  </P> <P> Danny Hawke, who was taking it harder than the rest of us, said, "They  announced that Rimshot couldn't appear on television for two years since the  school had provided parents of players with free housing at the Trump Tower.  NCAA action like that only makes it tough on kids who are looking for a good  education."  </P> <P> Brad added, "They want to put Coach Savory on ice because a couple of players  shaved points in their last game."  </P> <P> "It's the NCAA's word against the coach's. He didn't see anything, he didn't  hear anything, and he says that he was making popcorn with a meter maid during  that particular evening," Chili told us.  </P> <P> I was really mad. "How can anyone have a good basketball team if they're going  to make a federal case out of every tiny infraction? I haven't heard of one kid  who was ever corrupted in sports because the school gave him a brand-new  Harley-Davidson motorcycle."  </P> <P> Brad tried to sound upbeat: "I like the way the president of Rimshot is  handling this. At the press conference this morning, he announced that the  school really got a raw deal. He vowed that he would stand by his team no  matter what penalties were meted out by sanctimonious members of the NCAA. In  order to make up for the loss of athletic scholarship funds that Rimshot Tech  had to return, the president said that he was going to give the team the money  originally set aside for a new science library. Now there's a man who knows his  priorities.  </P> <P> "What bothers me is that with all the heat, many high school recruits may  bypass Rimshot and go to another college that hasn't been caught yet by the  NCAA."  </P> <P> "No way," I yelled. "There isn't a university with the reputation of Rimshot  when it comes to basketball perks. We can match any school's recruiting program  and still have cash in the bank for someone who runs out of 'laundry money.' "  </P> <P> Danny chimed in, "The thing I hate about college sports investigators is that  they don't give a hoot about the fans. To the schools, we're nothing but warm  bodies that fill up seats, and buy franks and draft beer. Yet we're the ones  who support the teams and make sure that the school turns out winners.  Basketball and football are the keys to a university's reputation in the  community. The NCAA never cares about the pain they are causing the fans when  they rap a school's knuckles."  </P> <P> Brad announced: "Let the word go forth to the NCAA that, while we admire their  efforts to keep sports from corrupting the students, no school of higher  learning can maintain its scholastic reputation if the viewers aren't able to  see how well the basketball team is doing on television."  </P></p>

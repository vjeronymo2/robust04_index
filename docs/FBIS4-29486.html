			<p>BFN     [Text] The Export-Import Bank of Thailand says Chaiyaphon  Rice Co must ask the Iraqi government to earmark funds which  have not been frozen to pay interest every six months on a new  rice contract.    The company, the authorised representative for the purchase  of Thai rice for Iraq, had struck a deal for annual interest  payments.    It says the contract will be guaranteed by the Iraqi central  bank, which will open a letter of credit to ensure payment.    Further negotiations between the bank and the buying  representative are set for today.    According to the deputy managing director of Ex-Im Bank,  Somphan Iamrungrot, the company has proposed a two-year  extension of interest payments, but the condition could not be  accepted because of the risks of the transaction.    It could not be sure when the United Nations would release  Iraqi assets. Mr Somphan learned that Iraq's Bank of  International Settlements (BIS) has only US$100 million in hand,  which may not be enough for the rice payment.    Iraq is set to buy about 500,000 tons of 10 percent and 15  percent white rice worth about five billion baht from Thailand  this year through Chaiyaphon Rice.    The Ex-Im Bank has been asked by Commerce Ministry to  finance  local exporters on the deal.    Phaibun Khuansongtham, the managing director of Chaiyaphon  Rice Co, said he wondered why the bank has taken such a long  time to examine the deal when Iraq's central bank has  acknowledged payment.    He was also informed that the assets will be released by the  end of next month and that it is urgent that the Thai Government  makes a decision, as the released assets may not be earmarked  for the rice.    The rice price will be quoted in line with market prices  plus  15 percent interest, which Mr Phaibun says is a risk worth  taking.    Iraq still owes about 1.8 billion baht to Thai rice  exporters, who sold about 200,000 tons of rice to Iraq before  the Gulf War.</p>

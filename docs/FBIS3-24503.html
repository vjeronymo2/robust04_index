Lagarkov, Moscow; UDC 621.] </F>   [Abstract] The proliferation of today's composite materials  consisting of heterogeneous mixtures of various particles bound  by a common matrix in aerospace engineering, modern microwave  devices, nonlinear composite resistors, and high-temperature  heaters necessitated an investigation into the electrophysical  properties of such materials in RF fields. To this end, the  behavior of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability is  examined in greater detail; in particular, the random frequency  variance of the dielectric constant, the dependence of the  static conductivity of a nonordered mixture of insulator and  conductor particles on the relative bulk concentration of  conducting particles, the behavior of the dielectric constant  and conductivity as a function of concentration, the frequency  dependence of the effective dielectric constant and magnetic  permeability and their real and imaginary parts, etc., are  plotted. Attention is focused on the behavior of these constants  near the conductivity threshold in electromagnetic fields  allowing for the electromagnetic field skinning. The use of  quasicritical systems for attaining high dielectric constants in  RF fields is addressed. It is noted that the scope of the paper  makes it virtually impossible to describe numerous properties  inherent in composite structures in the RF spectrum since there  are no natural materials capable of even marginally meeting the  broad range of today's needs. It is speculated that the  development of future materials will require further development  of both a comprehensive body of theoretical data and adequate  practices which realize complex spatial structures.

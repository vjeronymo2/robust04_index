			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Halla plans vehicle production HALLA Engineering and Heavy Industries, the South Korean group, is seeking government permission to join the nation's highly competitive vehicle industry, Reuter reports from Seoul. 'We plan to submit the application to the government for the production of commercial vehicles next week,' the company said. Halla plans to invest Won55bn (Dollars 70.6m) to produce about 12 kinds of large commercial vehicles such as cement mixers, dump trucks and fork-lift trucks at an annual rate of 5,000 units, beginning in 1993 or in 1994. It plans to import technology from Iveco Fiat of Italy to produce the vehicles of 11 tonnes or more. In 1990, Halla tried and failed to win government approval to enter the vehicle market. The deal between Halla and Iveco Fiat is expected to last for five years after the government gives its approval. Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), a part of the nation's largest conglomerate Samsung Group, won government approval in July to produce commercial vehicles in technical co-operation with Nissan Diesel Motor of Japan. Halla Engineering and Heavy Industries is a unit of The Halla Group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung, younger brother of Hyundai Group ex-chairman Mr Chung Ju-yung.</p>

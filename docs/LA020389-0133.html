			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRVINE;  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER WILL QUIT IF IRVINE COUNCIL ORDERS  </P> <P> City Manager William Woollett Jr. said in a letter that he will resign if  ordered to do so by the City Council, Assistant City Manager Paul Brady Jr.  said Thursday.  </P> <P> The 60-year-old Woollett, who became Irvine's first and only city manager 17  years ago, was responding to a letter he received Tuesday from Mayor Larry  Agran, who asked for his resignation, Brady said.  </P> <P> "It is a very basic tenet . . . that the city manager serves at the pleasure of  the City Council," Woollett wrote in his response, according to Brady. "I  believe in that tenet and certainly support it."  </P> <P> According to the mayor's letter, City Council members will discuss Woollett's  proposed resignation at a Feb. 14 meeting because, Agran wrote, "my sense of  the City Council is that its members believe the time is at hand to make a  transition to a new city manager."  </P> <P> However, Council Member Sally Anne Sheridan disagreed. "I think we have a fine  city manager," she said.  </P> <P> Asking for the resignation is a political move that would allow the mayor to  broaden his authority, she said. But Agran denied Thursday having political  motives in calling for Woollett's resignation.  </P> <P> In Agran's letter, he also proposed that Brady become acting city manager and  be considered for the position permanently. But Brady said he would not  consider serving as interim city manager.  </P> <P> "I don't need a 3-month trial basis," Brady said. "If they are interested in  me, they ought to say so."  </P> <P> Woollett could not be reached for comment Thursday.  </P></p>

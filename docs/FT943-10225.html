			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Company insolvencies fall by 10% Ten per cent fewer companies in England and Wales failed in the second quarter of the year than in the first three months in a further indication of economic recovery, according to official figures released yesterday. The seasonally adjusted number of company insolvencies for April to June was 4,077, compared with 4,513 in the first quarter. This represents a decline of 12 per cent from the figure of 5,198 in the second quarter of last year. The figures are compiled by the Department of Trade and Industry's Insolvency Service and published by the British Chambers of Commerce. They show that 2 per cent of active companies became insolvent in the 12 months to June this year, down from 2.2 per cent when measured at the end of the first quarter. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the chambers, said: 'This fall is welcome news and because business order books are filling up and capacity utilisation is rising, we have every reason to believe that the trend will continue.' He stressed, however, that one in 50 companies still failed every year and that certain sectors such as retailing remained particularly badly affected. The DTI figures show that the seasonally adjusted number of personal insolvencies also fell slightly - by 1 per cent to 7,961 in the second quarter of the year, compared with 8,096 in the first quarter. This represents a decline of 10 per cent from 8,799 in the second quarter last year. Without seasonal adjust-ment there were 4,078 company insolvencies and 7,984 personal bankruptcies and individual voluntary arrangements in the second quarter. Separate figures released yesterday by the Lord Chancellor's department echoed the trend of declining insol-vencies, with the number of company winding-up petitions down 11 per cent to 3,504 in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. The number of creditors' petitions for winding up companies declined by 12 per cent to 6,447 over the same period while debtors' petitions for personal bankruptcy fell 5 per cent to 3,418. The figures are based on petitions lodged in the courts, not all of which are ultimately granted. There may also be a considerable delay between the petition and the resulting insolvency being recorded in official records.</p>

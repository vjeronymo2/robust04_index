			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / High insurance losses feared on mortgages INSURERS may face further heavy losses as a result of continuing high levels of default on mortgages, analysts believe. Earlier this year hopes were high that claims from domestic mortgage indemnity policies, which cover lenders against losses on sales of repossessed properties, would tail off as the economy moved out of recession. However, the continuing depression in the housing market is leading many analysts to revise earlier forecasts. Mr Derek Elias, analyst with Paribas Capital Markets Group, said: 'The problem is not going to to decline fairly rapidly in the tidy way that most of the lenders and the insurance companies are suggesting.' Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, Legal &amp; General and Eagle Star, which together control about 70 per cent of the mortgage indemnity market, are worst affected. Last year insurers made pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.2bn, with mortgage indemnity claims an important contributing factor. Overall mortgage indemnity losses for last year and this year were expected to amount to Pounds 2bn, but could now climb even higher and continue next year, undermining the prospect of a return to profitability. Analysts expect repossessions to stay at around the level of 75,540 reached last year for the next two years. Mr Youssuf Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley, expects repossessions to total 80,000 in 1992. 'People got too excited by the prospects of the government and building society rescue schemes,' he said. There are also fears that insurers could face claims on insurance policies covering securitised mortgage pools. According to one analyst, the UK industry's exposure on mortgage-pool business is about Pounds 10bn. Another said he expected claims could amount to as much as Pounds 100m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Norberto dos Santos, minister for assistance </F> and social reintegration, by People's Television of Angola  announcer Ana Lemos in the TPA studio in Luanda--live]    [Text] [Lemos] Humanitarian aid could be suspended yet  again if the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] continues to endanger World Food Program, WFP, aircraft.  After UNITA and the WFP had reached an agreement concerning a  suspension of hostilities to allow people to receive food aid,  Jonas Savimbi's men proceeded to shoot at a WFP aircraft  yesterday, shortly after it had taken off from Malange Airport,  where it left food aid for the local people. Today Malange was  again the target for shelling, preventing the arrival of more  food aid for the people.    The decision to suspend humanitarian aid naturally rests  with  the government. Norberto dos Santos, minister for assistance  and social reintegration, is here to comment on that. Good  evening, Mr. Minister.    [Dos Santos] Good evening.    [Lemos] To begin with, thank you very much for saying yes to  our invitation. We would like to know what the situation is now  concerning humanitarian aid?    [Dos Santos] Yes, we were in touch recently with the  director  for the unit responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid. He  is just back from Huambo. He has informed us that he has  received guarantees from UNITA that flights to Malange could  resume tomorrow in safety. I would like to let you know here  that we tried a flight to Malange at about 1400 today. Though  we had received a report from Huambo that UNITA had already  given the aforesaid guarantees, unfortunately the aircraft had  to return to Luanda because it was shot at as it prepared to  land at Malange Airport. It did not land.    Coincidentally, WFP Coordinator Aranda da Silva was still in  Huambo at the time and he proceeded to get in touch with UNITA  officials yet again. Mr. Aranda da Silva arrived this evening  and I was in contact with him less than 10 minutes ago. He came  back with the guarantee that flights to Malange can resume  tomorrow. We said we were in agreement that flights should  resume at 0700 and the government will decide on this matter  depending on what happens to that flight tomorrow. So, let us  see what will happen, so we can test the truth of the promises  UNITA has made to Mr. Aranda da Silva.    [Lemos] That means, then, that aid will continue normally?    [Dos Santos] Tomorrow, we will conduct our first test flight  to Malange and, depending on what happens with that flight, all  other flights may or may not take place.    [Lemos] How many flights have been scheduled for tomorrow?    [Dos Santos] There were flights to Saurimo, Dundo, Luena,  Cazombo, (Lumbalanguimbo), Mavinga, Uige, Negage, Huambo,  Malange, Menongue, Cuito, and M'banza Congo scheduled for  tomorrow. Flights are also supposed to be leaving Catumbela  tomorrow for Huambo, Cuito, Malange, and Luena.    [Lemos] Mr. Minister: Are there no forecasts concerning  increased flights to areas in need? For instance, the people of  Cuito complain about the number of flights to that city.    [Dos Santos] Yes, I would like to say that 17 flights have  been planned for Cuito this week, meaning that 102 tonnes of  food will be leaving from Luanda for that city. Another 17 such  flights are also planned for Catumbela, making up a total of 153  tonnes of food. Added to the aid to be flown from Luanda, a  total of 255 tonnes are scheduled for Cuito. We are concerned  about Malange because there have been no flights to that city  for the last four days and, as everybody knows, the situation  there is dramatic. That means that some 500 tonnes of food aid  have not been flown to that city, so we are concerned and we  hope that things will turn out well tomorrow.    [Lemos] May it be so. Once again, thank you for granting us  this interview.    [Dos Santos] Thank you and good night.</p>

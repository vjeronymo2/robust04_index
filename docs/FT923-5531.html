			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / BA and USAir seek closer ties: Airlines could fly under common colours within three years of deal BRITISH AIRWAYS and USAir, the ailing US carrier in which the UK airline wants to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 379m) for a minority stake, could be flying under common colours within three to four years of the deal taking place, according to documents filed in the US. In New York yesterday, BA confirmed that, from a user's standpoint, the two airlines could look almost identical within three or four years. The formal investment agreement between BA and USAir, now filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, spells out the extent to which the two airlines plan to integrate their operations if the transaction wins regulatory approval. Leading US carriers have seized on the document, arguing that BA will effectively control USAir's business even if legal ownership is within US rules. Under the proposed deal, BA would have an initial 21 per cent voting stake in USAir and about 44 per cent of total equity. Foreign interests are limited to 25 per cent of voting control of a US airline, although total equity ownership may reach 49 per cent without automatically being deemed 'foreign control'. The document says 'harmonising the brand identities' of the two carriers 'shall be an immediate priority'. Initially, they plan to have three regional brands - intercontinental, European and North American - with BA in charge of the first two and USAir handling the North American brand in a 'consistent manner'. These could take a year to develop, but would be implemented as quickly as possible. Within three years of the regional brand introduction, a new 'global master brand' is due to be introduced - with BA in charge of development. The agreement makes clear that by 'branding', the two companies are talking about all aspects of their public identities. In some areas, the integration might be swifter still. The plan says 'immediate co-ordination and subsequent full integration of pricing and inventory control (including yield/capacity management) is a priority'. It says USAir 'agrees to undertake changes to the organisation of these functions as recommended by (BA)'. The three largest US airlines - United, Delta and American - and two leading air cargo operators claim the agreement gives BA a whiphand over USAir's business, because certain matters required 80 per cent of the board to be in favour and BA would have four out of 16 directors. According to the investment agreement, these areas include: 'any operating or capital budget plan', other annual capital expenditures over Dollars 10m, any investment exceeding Dollars 10m, the appointment or dismissal of any senior USAir executive, the purchase or sale of route authorities and any material marketing agreement or joint venture. BA claims the opposition is anti-competitive. The US lobby argues that BA is entering the US market by a backdoor route. Southwest Airlines, Page 10</p>

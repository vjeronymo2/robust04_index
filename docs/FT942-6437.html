			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / World News in Brief: Britain may stem import of cut-price building steel Regulations to stem imports into Britain of cut-price subsidised construction steel, mainly from Italy and Spain, are being considered by the UK government. Companies including British Steel have become increasingly irritated that foreign rivals find it easy to win work in the UK while, they say, many continental European markets remain heavily regulated. They are particularly concerned at a rise in the number of British bridge contracts awarded to Italian and Spanish companies which, they claim, use cheap subsidised steel produced in their own countries.

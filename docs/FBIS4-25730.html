			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Interview" with Wang Qun (3769 5028), secretary of the </F> Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region CPC Committee, by special  correspondent Song Xiaoming (1345 2556 2494): "Emulate Deng  Xiaoping's Truth-Seeking and Realistic Spirit" -- place and date  not given]    [Text] [Song] In studying The Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, what are your deepest impressions?    [Wang] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking and realistic  spirit made the deepest impression on me. Emancipating the mind  and seeking truth from facts is a proposition full of  dialectical materialistic spirit. I believe that it is  difficult to grasp this way of thinking but it is even harder to  adhere to this ideological line in practice. Whether one can  succeed in being "true to the end" is a real test of the level  and awareness of every leader. It not only tests our  comprehension and ability to solve problems but, in particular,  it tests our party spirit, work style, and personal character.    [Song] What is your connotation of Deng Xiaoping's  truth-seeking and realistic spirit of which you speak?    [Wang] I think it has three aspects, that is, to be an  honest man, an intelligent man, and a brave man. The first is  to be an honest man. "One has to be a man before being a  writer." This saying tells us that one's writings reflect one's  character. Without a certain character, it is impossible to  produce first class work. Similarly, I believe that "one has to  be a man before being an administrator." Compared with writing  articles, a person's character is more directly significant for  an administrator. A person without a first class character as a  foundation will never make a good official. To emulate the  truth-seeking and realistic spirit, the number one priority is  to do things honestly according to scientific and objective  laws, keep in constant touch with reality, maintain extensive  links with the masses, find out the changes in the objective  situation in a timely fashion, accurately tune in to the pulse  of the masses, and grasp the opportunities which our time gives  us, so that our decisions are in keeping with reality. Here,  one must resolutely overcome the bureaucratic work style that is  detached from reality and resolutely abolish the attitudes and  ways of playing petty tricks or acting upon assumptions. We  must try to be the kind of honest persons that Chairman Mao  often praised. In Chairman Mao's eyes, Marx was an honest  person, Lenin was an honest person, and scientists are honest  people because they act honestly according to a scientific  attitude. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is exactly such an honest  person. He has always advocated a realistic spirit and has  always put it into action himself. His writings and speeches  are of the simple style, without empty talk that is detached  from reality. His decades of political practice and his  simplicity and diligence are even more of a glorious model and  vivid textbook of the realistic spirit.    There is now a very bad trend and that is, taking an  attitude  of copying and mechanically transplanting, without change, a  superior's instructions or experience from other places. When  documents arrive, some people carelessly read them once without  serious studies, discussions, and thinking. They don't know to  ask a few "whys" and "hows," nor do they come up with ideas for  implementation that suit the reality in their localities and so,  they are only able to copy and mechanically transplant them  without change. People who take this kind of irresponsible  attitude will always fail, 10 times out of 10.    [Song] This phenomenon still exists today.    [Wang] Since the reform and opening up, the economic and  social features of many places have seen great changes. In some  places, it is a new plateau every two or three years. It makes  one excited to watch. However, some places have seen very  little change; up to today, some still haven't found the right  way to develop their local economy but only repeat formalistic  slogans. This kind of irresponsible attitude by leaders is a  manifestation that their party spirit and enterprising spirit  are weak. If they do not change their attitudes quickly there  will be no hope for these places. In actual work, of course it  is important to come up with realistic decisions but it is  equally important to turn correct decisions into people's  actions through actual hard work. Without the latter, no matter  how good the decisions, they will never materialize. Actual  hard work is both a work style and a basic method to implement  policies and it is even more so a test for the party spirit and  sense of responsibility of each leader. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  has always advocated actual hard work. In recent years he has  repeatedly demanded that we "squeeze time to do more practical  things and do more and talk less"; "do a few solid things,  accomplish something, make oneself credible to the people";  "concentrate and do a few things that will make the people  satisfied and happy"; and "quietly immerse ourselves in work and  do our own business well." He has especially emphasized:  "Leaders must do more practical work. The bad work style of  passing one's days by giving orders and spouting empty words  must be changed." The teachings and models of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping are the force that impels us to do solid work.    [Song] What is an "intelligent man?"    [Wang] Modern society is very complex. Especially in China,  which is in a transitional process moving towards a socialist  market economy, the society is unsettled and there are many new  problems, new situations, and new contradictions. Under such  circumstances, a leader will never make it without a certain  level of intellect. For a leader to establish the scientific  attitude of seeking truth from facts and being truthful and  realistic, an important issue is to learn to analyze and handle  problems dialectically and overcome one-sidedness or thinking in  absolute terms. This is both an important theoretical problem  and a practical problem which occurs often in leading work. I  believe that the higher one's position in the leadership, the  more important this problem becomes.    [Song] Please elaborate on this in specific terms.    [Wang] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made a very important  point, that is, "take the overall situation into account,"  "yield to the interests of the whole," "minor principles should  be subordinated to major ones," and consider issues from the  perspective of the whole. Here, the "overall situation" and  "major principles" are none other than the "reality of the  whole," while partial considerations are no more than "partial  reality." To start from the perspective of the whole means to  start from the reality of the whole. Most people acknowledge  this principle but, when concrete problems occur, not everyone  can keep a clear head. During the 15 years since reform and  opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has handled many complex  problems with his political wisdom and set up a glorious model  for us.    [Song] Please give an example.    [Wang] For instance, the handling of the "fools' seed" case.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping recalled: "At that time, many felt  uneasy, saying that he [a person who became rich by selling  `fools' brand pumpkin seeds] had made a million. And they  wanted to take him down. I said we cannot take him down. If we  do, people will say that policies have changed and what we gain  is not worth what we lose. There are many similar problems. If  we don't handle them properly, they will very easily deflect our  policies and affect the whole reform." In Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's perspective, failure to handle the "fools' seed" case  did no harm to the whole situation; if we had handled the case  it would have been detrimental to the whole situation.    [Song] The outstanding significance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's analysis of the "fools' seed" case lies in its  exemplary role. In the process of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, complex problems will certainly often  occur and our leading cadres will certainly be often tested in  whether they can correctly handle complex problems or not. The  demonstration by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is no doubt classic for  all levels of leading cadres.    [Wang] Political experience is accumulated gradually. The  political experience which comrade Deng Xiaoping provides for us  is very precious. Not only in the "fools' seed" case but in  many other problems, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has provided  classical models for us. For instance, in both taking our own  road and opening to the outside world; in both paying attention  to the construction of material civilization and to the  construction of spiritual civilization; in both opposing the  right and opposing the "left"; in diplomatic strategy, his "we  still have to make friends but must keep a clear head," etc.  Whenever faced with important problems and crucial moments,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping is always so clear-headed; his analysis of  things is always so profound, comprehensive, and to the point;  his handling of problems is always so appropriate,  differentiating the important from the unimportant and the  emergency case from nonemergency ones. Without the skilled  dialectical thinking of a politician, and without the  penetrating vision and tactics of a strategist, this would be  impossible. We must emulate comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking  and learn to consider and handle problems with materialist  dialectics. Many things in the field of politics indicate that  once the leader's way of thinking goes wrong, his mind will not  be clear before major issues of right and wrong and he will lose  direction, leading even to political mistakes and bringing  irreplaceable losses to our cause.    [Song] It seems to me that what comrade Deng Xiaoping  advocates is a spirit of political reasoning. From his theory  of "white cat and black cat" to his analysis of the "fools'  seed" case, his rational spirit permeates his career of  political practice.    [Wang] You have a point.    [Song] Apart from "being an honest man," and "being an  intelligent man," why does comrade Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking  and realistic spirit also contain "being a brave man"?    [Wang] The spirit of innovation and risk-taking is the  character a modern leader must have. The theory of socialism  with Chinese characteristics is the most creative theory; the  ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from  facts contains in itself the content of creating new things all  the time. The achievements in reform and opening up and in the  modernization construction of China in the past dozen years or  so are exactly the result of the constant creation and  aggressive advancement of the hundreds of millions of people  under the leadership of the party. Without a brave spirit, we  will be unable to accomplish anything, unable to advance even a  single step.    [Song] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always encouraged  innovation.    [Wang] That senior leader once made a very encouraging  statement: "Without a little spirit of breaking through, without  a little spirit of `risking,' without a little energy and force,  one cannot find a good road, or a new road, and cannot  accomplish new things. Who dares to say that their business has  a 100 percent guarantee with no risk at all." He repeatedly  emphasized: "We certainly have to have innovation." What  Comrade Deng Xiaoping advocates here is a spirit of innovation  and risk-taking. The "energy" and "force" he mentioned is a  kind of revolutionary courage, heroism, and boldness. It  originates from lofty ideals and infinite loyalty to the people.  In the practice of reform and opening up, the spirit of  innovation and risk-taking is very precious and needs to be  advocated. People with a lot of prudence and who do not dare to  take responsibility cannot do it; people who do not seek  accomplishments but only seek to make no mistakes cannot do it;  as for those who have no people, no ideals, and no enterprising  spirit but only themselves in their minds, they not only cannot  do it, they can't even understand this spirit of innovation and  risk-taking.    [Song] Brilliant!    [Wang] The ideological line of the party is a thoroughly  materialist one. Only thorough materialists can completely  understand it and adhere to it to the end because adherence to  this line is risky, requiring people to pay a price and make  some individual sacrifices. Those who lack the sense of  responsibility towards the prosperity and happiness of the  people, and those who lack enthusiasm towards the vigorous new  cause, will be unwilling to pay this price. In reality, many  things demand that leaders have the courage to persist in  seeking truth from facts. For instance, the masses are very  critical of unhealthy trends, corruption, and of the serious  political liberalism which exists within the party. However, it  is very difficult to correct. One of the major reasons is that  some leading comrades lack the courage to seek truth from facts  and they are unwilling to shoulder individual risks. These  comrades don't understand that if we ourselves are unwilling to  pay a small price, our party will have to pay a high price.  Again, we often face the following situation in leading work  whereby two diametrically opposite views and evaluations arise  concerning the same thing, the same person, the same history, or  the situation in the same region and where both sides claim that  they are seeking truth from facts. This can be due to many  factors. Perhaps there is a problem of ability and the level of  comprehension, or a problem of different degrees of  understanding the situation, or different perspectives in  looking at things. Often there are problems of different  ideological viewpoints and the criteria of right and wrong.  This should be called normal. The problem is, as a leader of a  locality or unit, one must take the party standpoint. On the  basis of seeking truth from facts, one must talk and act justly,  correct the prejudices of some comrades, and encourage those  comrades who persist in seeking truth from facts. This is  nothing like "life and death" issues but, if we cannot even do  this, then how can we handle it when real "life and death"  situations occur?    [Song] The question of placing our individual "self" in  which position is indeed a crucial one.    [Wang] The basis of the party's ideological line, the soul  of the truth-seeking and realistic spirit, is to place the  people's interests above all else. The source of courage and  strength in upholding this ideological line lies in the people.  In his long revolutionary career, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  considered himself a "son of the Chinese people." He has always  respected and loved the people and has paid constant attention  to the people's interests and wishes. He places the starting  point and goal of all policies and criteria for judging right  and wrong on "whether the people are happy or not," "whether the  people agree," and "whether the people support it." It is  exactly because of this that he is equipped with great courage  in theory and practice, his correct decisions naturally become  the willing actions of the hundreds of millions of people, and  he himself can lead the people fearlessly in battle in the great  process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    [Song] It seems that whether one can be truth-seeking and  realistic and whether one can uphold truth is inevitably linked  to the level of character of the individual.    [Wang] This is indeed so. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's rough and  ragged experience, his revolutionary character of paying no  attention to personal fame and safety, or gain and loss, but  constantly upholding truth and principles, truly reflects his  lofty awareness of unswervingly seeking truth from facts.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great experience educates us that  Communist Party members who view the people's interests as  higher and weightier than anything else, are not afraid of  anything. In his article commemorating Comrade Liu Bocheng,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a moving statement: Comrade Liu  Bocheng "exerted himself to the utmost, despite 10,000 deaths,  in order to realize that in which he believed.... Whether in  successful times or in difficult times, irrespective of time and  place and changes in the objective environment, he consistently  contributed his all to the party, submitted his all to the needs  of the party, and immersed himself in the cause of the party,  without the slightest consideration for personal fame and gain.  He truly reached the realm of selflessness." I often think if  all our leaders, generation after generation, could reach this  "realm of selflessness," then the leading bodies of the party at  all levels would certainly become the strong battle  headquarters, create a good trend, and carry forward the  truth-seeking and realistic spirit. Thus, in the course of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our ship will  be able to advance along the correct path toward the glorious  goal in any kind of turbulent sea.</p>

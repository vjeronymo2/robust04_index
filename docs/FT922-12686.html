			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Letter: EC no part of fish crisis Sir, Mr Eaton (Letters, April 8) misleads your readers by comparing EC North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation quotas with total EC catches to illustrate over-fishing, without mentioning that the latter figure includes all stocks for which fishing is free and there is no NAFO quota (because they are either commercially uninteresting or not subject to conservation policies). The EC indeed accepts and complies with every single recommendation by the NAFO Scientific Council. It does not 'ignore important NAFO conservation decisions including a moratorium' on fishing for offshore cod. The truth is that this moratorium is not the result of a scientific recommendation by NAFO; it does not apply to the Canadian fleet, whose own quota for this area in 1991 was 185,000 tonnes. Mr Eaton further implies that EC vessels are using illegal undersized nets. In fact, EC nets fully comply with NAFO regulations. Canadian authorities claim that there is a crisis in the offshore fishery for cod. The EC simply responds that if that is the case, one should not automatically blame foreign fleets but rather assess the situation and act on the basis of independent scientific advice. This is why the EC has already formally requested an extraordinary meeting of the NAFO Scientific Council to study the cod stock. Unfortunately, Canada has so far rejected this request saying that its own opinion is enough. If an independent scientific opinion suggests that the EC fleet is the one 'responsible for the depletion of fish stocks off Newfoundland', the Commission will be the first to support a moratorium in that area. In response to a Canadian press campaign, not only the EC but, for the first time, the EC Council of Ministers has unanimously declared that 'it cannot accept that the poor state of cod stock . . .be presented as a consequence of' EC fishing activities. The Community thus shows its unity, its political goodwill, and its hopes to establish a constructive dialogue with Canada, not through the press but with a serious effort to find solutions agreed by all.

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mr Zedillo starts well Modern Mexican presidents are accustomed to taking office in the midst of economic crisis. Unlike his predecessors, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, who assumed the presidency yesterday, has the luxury of inheriting an economy which, while not without problems, is in reasonable shape. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Mexico's political system. This year two political assassinations, repeated allegations about the involvement of drug traffickers in politics, and a peasant revolt in the southern state of Chiapas have undermined confidence in the Mexican political system. The year has shown that authoritarian methods of political manipulation used by presidents in the past are less effective than they were. Yet Mexico is a long way from replacing this creaky old political system with reliable government institutions. Reform of the political system is the most urgent task of Mr Zedillo's six-year term. It is needed because political shocks upset foreign investors, who will be necessary to sustain Mexican economic growth until the low rate of domestic savings rises. It is needed because what it would secure - the rule of law - is essential to a well-functioning market economy. It is needed to improve the lives of ordinary Mexicans, who suffer daily the arbitrary actions of those supposed to enforce the law. In his inauguration speech, Mr Zedillo started well. His task is to place the institutions of government - in particular its corrupt judiciary, its police and its electoral system - above political controversy. Yesterday, he committed himself to 'profound reform' of the judiciary, electoral reform, continued tight control over public finances and a peaceful solution in Chiapas. Opposition figure In choosing his cabinet, he resisted the temptation to reach into the ranks of the political old guard in an attempt to repress political opposition. His decision to appoint an opposition figure - Mr Antonio Lozano of the National Action party - as attorney-general sends an important signal that he is serious about the long-overdue separation of the judiciary from politics. The appointment of one man, of course, cannot guarantee the rule of law. It remains to be seen if the new attorney-general can function effectively within a political system dominated by the same party for 65 years. But an important signal will be sent if he can effect progress in the investigation into the assassination in September of the PRI secretary-general, Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Public confidence To build public confidence in justice, much more needs to be done, including an overhaul of the judiciary from the supreme court down and reform of the police. Mr Zedillo should also resist directly intervening in the affairs of Mexico's states. Too often his predecessor, Mr Carlos Salinas, used extra-constitutional powers to replace elected state governors of the ruling party in efforts to calm opposition protests at apparently fraudulent state elections. Although electoral fraud has been a serious symptom of Mexico's political ills, the president's arbitrary actions merely compounded the problem. The answer instead is to build public confidence in the electoral system - by ensuring, as he has promised, it is run by independent officials and by stopping the ruling party's egregious outspending of its rivals and the parties' unequal access to the media. Mr Zedillo will face the first test of his attitude in Chiapas, where the guerrillas who fomented the new year revolt are threatening violence if Mr Eduardo Robledo takes office as governor next week. The new president has appointed a cabinet largely of technocrats, educated in the US, hugely capable technically but lacking obvious support from within the ruling party. His only nod in the direction of the party's old guard was his appointment as energy minister of Mr Ignacio Pichardo, who has been accused, and denies, obstructing the investigation into Mr Ruiz's murder. The president clearly believes first that a group of relative political novices can guide political reform; and second that there will be no backlash from the traditionalists. It is a risk, but one worth taking. Mr Zedillo has got off to a good start. Now he must make his words count.</p>

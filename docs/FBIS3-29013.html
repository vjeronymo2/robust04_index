"At last, spring came to U.S.-Vietnam relations," Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "I  perceive it as a very hopeful development."    The top government spokesman also said, "I hope the improved  ties between the two nations will not be restricted to them  alone but contribute to the peace and prosperity in the broader  Asia-Pacific region."    Takemura issued the comment shortly after U.S. President  Bill  Clinton announced he is lifting the 19-year-old embargo against  Vietnam.    Clinton also said the United States and Vietnam have decided  to exchange liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to  facilitate more progress on the missing Americans issue.    He removed the sanctions a week after the Senate voted  overwhelmingly in favor of lifting the embargo in recognition of  Vietnam's cooperation in accounting for the fate of 2,238  Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam, and also in the  hope that Hanoi will cooperate more on the issue.    The United States imposed an economic embargo on  communist-ruled North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the  whole country when the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to  communist forces in April 1975.</p>

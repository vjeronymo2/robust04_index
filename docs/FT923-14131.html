			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Bosnia president appeals for help to end civil war PRESIDENT Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia yesterday took advantage of a lull in the fighting in Sarajevo and flew to the CSCE meeting in Helsinki, where he will appeal for international help to end the civil war. Bosnia's mostly Moslem government has appealed for foreign military intervention in Bosnia. Mr Fikret Abdic, a member of the Bosnian presidency, yesterday told journalists: 'If he (President Bush) is really ready to defend his new world order, here is his chance. It will either rise or fall with Sarajevo.' Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, left aboard a departing relief flight. Eighteen international relief flights yesterday arrived in the Bosnian capital, the largest number since the air-lift began last week. Some 811 tonnes of food aid and medical supplies had arrived in Sarajevo as of Tuesday, most of which had already been distributed to local charities. Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, yesterday was in Sarajevo to meet Bosnian leaders and UN officials. Meanwhile, in Serbia the introduction of new dinar bank notes has wreaked havoc in the economy and government officials this week set up a commission to investigate who is responsible for the monetary chaos. Serbians have been franctically scrambling to get new bank notes since the weekend, with people packing into banks. Few shopkeepers in the Serbian capital have bank notes below 5,000 dinars (Pounds 8). Mrs Dragana Markovic, a 65-year-old pensioner, yesterday bought one litre of milk and a loaf of bread. She received her change in chewing gum and sweet cream. Townspeople in Leskovac, southern Serbia, yesterday gave their identity cards instead of dinar notes to buy bread. One man went to a market to buy tomatoes and received his change in pears. Toll-booth operators on the Serbian motorway, once a major international thoroughfare, now wave every other car through because they have no change. Belgrade economists say the shortage of dinar notes may be a heavy-handed attempt by the federal government to squeeze the monetary supply.</p>

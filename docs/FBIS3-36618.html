			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 07, BNS -- Russian police in the  disputed region of Petseri/Pechory on Saturday [5 February]  detained a group of Estonians that included a government  adviser, the leader of a lobbying group for reunification of the  region with Estonia, and a video team of the Estonian television.    The group was taken to a police office in the town of  Petseri  and kept there for two hours.    Reet Tobre, the head of the Petserimaa movement, said  Russian  officials had said the arrest was due to filming. The Estonian  television team had filmed a local church, industrial buildings  in the town, as well as the railway station and local  headquarters of a Russian border guard unit.    The police had told the group that Petseri is located in a  border zone where filming is allowed only for holders of special  permits, which can be obtained for a fee. "The police very  carefully examined our documents. We had the Russian visas and  we had crossed the control line legally," Tobre added.    Tobre's Petserimaa (Petseriland) group advocates the rights  of the legal Estonian citizens in the region and stands for  reunification of the region with Estonia.    The police had also tried to examine the material filmed by  the video group, but had failed to do so because of not having  the necessary equipment.    Aino Leppik, adviser to the government, in an interview  today  said the issue was being dealt with by the Estonian Foreign  Ministry.    "It is absolutely inadmissible that Russian police detain  Estonian citizens in Petseri without any charges. This, under  the constitution, took place on the Estonian territory," said  Leppik, who was among those detained.    The television team and Aino Leppik were visiting Petseri  for  celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the local Estonian  school.    The area, an Estonian territory under the 1920 peace treaty  with Russia, was annexed and named a region of the Russian  Federation shortly after World War II, when the Soviet Union was  occupying the country.</p>

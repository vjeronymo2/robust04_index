			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Franz Sommerfeld report: "Against False Normality"] </F>   [Text] In 10 days the federal convention will elect a new  president in the Reichstag in Berlin. In an interview with  BERLINER ZEITUNG North Rhine-Westphalian Minister-President  Johannes Rau, Social Democratic Party [SPD], discussed the  internal climate in united Germany.    Johannes Rau said that eastern Germany not only needs an  investment offensive; equally important is the exchange of  people. Rau recalled the tears of joy on 9 November 1990 and  drew up a sober balance sheet: In many places to the western  German call: "Now pay us a visit!" there has been added: "But  not all the time." The Germans must live with the intellectual  and material differences much longer than they expected. The  politician spoke of the "long way" Germany has to go "until  people again meet and understand each other without any  problems."    At the same time he warned against "blurring all regional  and  historical peculiarities." Johannes Rau cited the example of  the United States, where, under rather similar economic  conditions, the different characteristics of northerners and  southerners can still be clearly felt.    Rau wants to intensify the exchange of teachers, pupils, and  athletes between eastern and western Germany. He calls on young  people in the west to study in Leipzig, Dresden, or  Frankfurt/Oder. In particular for western Germans it is  important to go to Weimar and Erfurt to learn that "one might  perhaps have a few marks less in one's pocketbook" there, but  one would not be poorer but richer -- for instance in cultural  terms. The candidate appeals: "We must never and will never  resign ourselves to the wall in the minds and the isolation in  the hearts in Germany."  <H5>  Their Own Lives </H5>   Johannes Rau, who since the 1950's regularly visited friends  in the GDR, wants "much more understanding" for the people "who  now suddenly feel that they have not lived their own lives, and  this at an age when they no longer have any chance of a  `western' career simply because they will not find work."    Johannes Rau thinks it is quite natural that,  four-and-a-half  years after unification, the Germans feel internal insecurity  and are "not sufficiently sure of themselves." Rau recalls that  other industrial states, such as Japan, France, and Britain, are  also going through crises of orientation at the moment. He  finds it very encouraging "that our democracy has been so stable  over the past four-and-a-half years."  <H5>  Do Not Forget </H5>   Nevertheless, by pointing to the neighbors, Rau does not  want  to relativize German problems: "In our country xenophobia and  racism are of worse significance than in the other countries,  because this has happened before to us." The SPD politician is  worried about the trend toward saying: "Let us be normal." And  he retorts: "We, with our special German history, cannot afford  this self-imposed normalcy. Because of our deficit in democracy  in the Weimar Republic we brought misery to the world. This was  unique. Denying it would be fateful. In my view, Gustav  Heinemann's words apply: `The only chance that the others will  forget is that we do not forget.'"    Rau wants to bring the debate about the past to the present:  "I think that the discussion about the normalcy of our present  is more important than a controversy among historians about the  alleged normalcy of German history."</p>

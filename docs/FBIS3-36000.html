			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eduard Kotenko] </F>   [Text] A meeting between Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman  Ivan Plyushch and Scandinavian diplomats has been held at the  request of the latter. The meeting was attended by Danish  Ambassador Christian Faber-Rod, Norwegian Ambassador Oyvind  Nordsletten, Finnish Ambassador Erik Ulfstedt, and Swedish  Ambassador Martin Halquist. The Swedish ambassador presented  the Ukrainian legislative speaker with a letter reporting on a  25-26 February meeting of foreign ministers from Scandinavia and  Iceland in Stockholm. The ministers discussed a number of  issues, including European security. In the communique adopted  on the results of the conference, the ministers hailed the  tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. declaration signed on 14  January 1994 and the appendix to the declaration stipulating the  dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. The ministers pointed  out that the implementation of these documents will  significantly contribute to strengthening European security and  the nonproliferation of nuclear arms. The ambassadors were  instructed to inform the Ukrainian legislative chairman about  that declaration and the unanimous support for the tripartite  accord on the part of the governments of their states and  Iceland. The governments also hope that the accord will be  implemented soon. It was underlined that Ukraine should sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the immediate future.    In his turn, Ivan Plyushch provided an in-depth analysis of  Ukraine's current economic and political situation, pointing out:    [Begin Plyushch recording] Ukraine has been facing three  global problems -- Chernobyl, conversion of the Army and the  military-industrial complex, and the structural reshaping of the  economy. [end recording]    The Supreme Council chairman answered his interlocutors'  questions regarding, in particular, dates of practical  implementation of the agreements reached with Russia and the  United States. Ivan Plyushch emphasized that it is vital for  Ukraine that the provisions of the declaration and its appendix  be observed by all sides. This would correspond with the spirit  of every document adopted in Moscow.    [Begin Plyushch recording] For me, the problem is: When will  we begin receiving practical compensation? Thus far, we have  not received a cent; thus far, these documents are just pieces  of paper and simple discussions. [end recording]    At the end of the meeting, the Danish, Norwegian, Finnish,  and Swedish ambassadors expressed hope that Ukraine's nonnuclear  course will remain unchanged and asserted that their governments  are ready to grant Ukraine multifold support.</p>

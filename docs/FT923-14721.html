			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (2): Extent of problems starts to sink in - The Economy FROM OPTIMISM this time last year that it might escape the economic downturn already affecting most of its industrialised partners, the mood has swung to pessimism that Italy may find it harder than most to emerge now that recession has finally struck. The full effects of the downturn were felt in the final quarter of last year. In spite of signs of a pick-up in industrial production recently, it is still unclear whether recovery will come before the end of 1992. As a result, the chances of the economy meeting even the revised target of a 1.8 per cent rise in real gross domestic product look negligible. Last September, the government was still forecasting real GDP growth of 2.5 per cent for 1992. Economic policy in Italy remains complicated by the need for tough action on the budget deficit, which continues to swell beyond control. After rising steadily ahead of the April general elections following a flood of new spending measures, the delays in choosing a president and forming a new government after the poll exacerbated matters. Last month, the effects of the drift became dramatic. After remaining isolated from the crisis of confidence that had already hit the stock market earlier this year, both the lira and the government bond market came under severe pressure under the impact of the Danish 'No' vote on the Maastricht treaty. The Danish decision raised uncertainties about achieving greater economic and monetary convergence in Europe. With the Maastricht process at risk, Italy's own commitment to EC policy on convergence was immediately put under scrutiny. The results were traumatic. Only repeated interventions by the Bank of Italy and a two-stage rise in interest rates by commercial banks quelled speculation against the lira, which was further weakened by sharp outflows on the back of devaluation fears. Although the situation has calmed, the markets remain edgy. In a discussion paper released a fortnight ago, Mr Giuliano Amato, Italy's new prime minister, put action to curb the ballooning deficit at the top of his agenda. Mr Amato called for reduced welfare spending, tougher control of public sector pay and greater accountability at local authority level to limit the drain on state finances. And he pressed for further action to curb tax dodging. But Mr Amato's was just one of many warning voices in recent months. European Community finance ministers issued the first jolt in May, when they made an unusually strong call for Italy to take 'drastic and immediate' action to get the budget back on track. Failing remedial action, the deficit is now expected to reach L165,000bn this year against L152,000bn in 1991 and an original 1992 target of L128,000bn. Days later, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, demanded a rigorous austerity package to tackle the deficit and help Italy meet the targets for convergence with other EC countries as laid down at the Maastricht summit. In what was seen as his b l e a k e s t statement since taking office 10 years ago, Mr Ciampi called for a major fiscal package to cut the projected 1992 deficit by an amount equivalent to 4 per cent of GDP on an annual basis during the second half of this year. Only such harsh measures would help the economy get back on the right path to meet the EC's convergence c r i t e r i a for economic and monetary union. As matters stand, Italy passes just one of the five criteria. Moody's, the US debt rating agency, fired a further shot across the government's bows last month. Having already downgraded Italy f r o m its top-notch AAA borrowing status - the only G7 country to have been relegated  -Moody's warned that the country's AA1 debt ranking was now itself under review on account of insufficient progress in reducing the deficit and and obstacles in the way of increasing fiscal receipts. Fiscal packages introduced in 1991 have managed only to keep the public sector deficit at 10.7 per cent of gross domestic product - the same level as in 1990 - warned Moody's. Meanwhile, current income and spending patterns suggest that f u t u r e deficits will continue to rise in proportion to GDP. The deficit looks set to exceed the 11 per cent level this year, while overall debt now totals 103 per cent of GDP. It will be up to Mr Amato to convince the markets that the political will to address the country's glaring economic problems is now in place. Privatisation and pensions reform remain stalled, while state aid to industry and to the economically-depressed south are still highly contentious issues. To some extent, he is starting at a disadvantage. The rise in interest rates to protect the lira has pushed up the government's own debt charges, adding a further twist to the d e f i c i t s p i r a l. Meanwhile, higher rates, reaching just above 20 per cent for some smaller corporate customers, will exacerbate the economic slowdown and postpone recovery. Most observers doubt that GDP growth will exceed 1.6 per cent this year. Neither have other economic indicators given much g r o u n d s for optimism. May consumer prices climbed by 5.7 per cent on the year - a welcome fall from the 6.7 per cent level in the same month last year. But after having dropped to 5.6 per cent in the two previous months running, thanks partly to stable or declining oil and raw material prices, inflation now seems to be picking up again, casting doubts on official year-end forecasts of a 4.5 per cent. Labour costs, even if now growing more slowly than before, remain the major source of concern. Unaffected by the employers' decision to block interim payments due in May under the now-frozen scala mobile indexation system, wage rises continue to outpace the increase in the cost of living. After Mr Ciampi argued that incomes policy should be one of the priorities for the new government, the Confindustria employers' federation wasted no time in picking up his call, stressing the need to lower the number of factors which influence the growth in wage costs. Among its proposals were that indexation should be retained for only the lowest paid, and that wage growth should be brought into line with European countries where inflation is lowest. Tripartite negotiations between the government, unions and employers on reforming wage bargaining, which began this time last year only to be suspended within weeks, are being resumed. However, it remains to be seen whether the talks will be any more fruitful the second time around. Meanwhile, Italy's trade balance has deteriorated sharply this year as imports have outpaced exports. The development has been clouded in nominal terms, but, adjusted for inflation, exports have been broadly static while imports have continued to rise. The worsening of the non- energy trade balance has been particularly worrying, as it implies that domestic demand has been growing ahead of the EC average - which may not be surprising in view of Italy's delayed economic slowdown c o m p a r e d with many EC partners - and suggests a clampdown may eventually be necessary. Meanwhile, the current account deficit climbed to L26,200bn l a s t y e a r, equivalent to around 1.8 per cent of GDP, against L17,600bn in 1990. The overall economic outlook is hardly rosy. But among the few bright points are steps being taken to improve at least the technical side of the government's economic policy management. Following the 'divorce' of the central bank and the Treasury earlier this year, the Treasury has taken steps to build up its skills in economic policy forecasting and management as part of its first big reorganisation in almost a century. The changes include the appointment of outsiders to two of the Treasury's five most senior bureaucratic positions. Bringing in academics and lawyers to beef up the ministry will not solve Italy's economic problems overnight. But it should at least give the new government a clearer idea of how serious its difficulties now are.</p>

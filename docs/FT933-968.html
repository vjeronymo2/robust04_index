			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Classic time in Ontario The Stratford Festival began in a tent in 1953 with Alec Guinness and Irene Worth in All's Well That Ends Well and Richard 111, directed by Tyrone Guthrie. The plays ran for six weeks. Forty-two years later the Festival is the largest repertory company in North America producing classics, modern classics and Canadian writing. It has three theatres and the season runs from May to November. The Festival bings Dollars 100m every year into Ontario, yet its subsidy from Provincial and Federal Government is only 10 per cent. The public, hit by the recession, is no longer booking ahead and so word of mouth has become absolutely essential. The word of mouth for Joe Dowling's irreverent and erotic production of A Midsummer Night's Dream has been excellent. Deliberately aimed at a young audience who does not norma11y go to Shakespeare, Keith Thomas's music embraces rock, reggae, rap, honky-tonk and doo-wop ballad, the latter sung by raunchy Titania (Lucy Peacock) and her back-up group of fairies. Design is by Haydn Griffin, the real world painted in Fascist black and red, the supernatural a riot of colour dominated by a hugely phallic oak tree, up and down which tattooed Oberon (Colm Feore) and frizzy Puck (Frank Zotter) clamber. The lovers, on entering the forest, are immediately stripped to their underwear. What the production loses in poetry it makes up for in comedy, energy and sex. Shakespeare's rarely seen King John is a satire on political expediency in which kings enter into cynical alliances only immediately to abandon them. Robin Phillips's production, excellently acted and attractively designed by Ann Curtis, brings the history play into the 20th century. Elegant chairs line the sides of the thrust stage. The men wear frock-coats, top hats and uniforms, the women tea-gowns. King John might be Edward VIII; the Bastard wears a kilt. Queen Eleanor is in dowager-black, Lady Constance in dove-grey. The tete-a-tete John (Nicholas Pennell) shares with Hubert (Scott Wentworth) when he arranges for Prince Arthur's murder is chillingly underplayed and the stylised battle scenes all have the unmistakable Phillips stamp. This is the best King John since John Barton rewrote the play for the RSC in 1975. Stratford regularly gives audiences an opportunity to go to classics they would not otherwise see in North America. A Greek play is a rarity. The strength of David Williams's production of Euripides's Bacchae lies in the acting of the two leading roles and in Alan Barlow's design. The set is simple: female genitalia half-disguised as gnarled, blood-red gates. The actors are heavily masked and robed. Ted Dykstra's Pentheus, a humourless prude unable to sustain his macho image, wears a huge thick-jawed, thick-set mask. He sounds like a college boy and looks like a member of an American football team. His humiliating transformation into drag queen in shocking pink, after Dionysus has persuaded him to spy on his mother's orgies, is both risible and pathetic. Colm Feore's god, a perfumed transvestite, has a huge doll-like mask with a sweet-sneering smile worn at a capricious angle; the body language is riveting. The weakest aspect of the production is the chorus, whose writhing on the ground in grass skirts is not enough to suggest mass hysteria and orgasm. Stratford, very properly, is committed to staging modern Canadian writing. Sharon Pollock's Fair Liberty's Call attempts to understand present day English Canada by exploring her past. The setting is New Brunswick in 1785 and deals with a reunion of Loyalists to celebrate the end of the American Revolution. I did not always follow this flawed but intelligent and powerful play about coming to terms with the atrocities of civil war, but I admired Guy Sprung's production and the acting of the whole company enormously. There are no longer any plays which can automatically guarantee good houses, but Oscar Wilde is a safer bet than most. The comedy plays to continuous laughter and Lucy Peacock's Gwendolen Fairfax enunciates her lines so clearly that I thought she must have been directed by Professor Henry Higgins. The Festival needs a musical to balance the books. This year it has two. There are people who come to see Gilbert and Sullivan and nothing else and Brian Macdonald's tired revival of The Mikado has done good business. But Gypsy, which was meant to be a popular money-earner, has been a box office disappointment. Though attendances have been up this year, a major priority for next season will be to get more bums on seats. One route Richard Monette, the new artistic director, may take is to import stars from abroad - which would not be popular with Canadian actors; but it will be difficult to find stars capable of playing classical roles and willing to come for the whole season.</p>

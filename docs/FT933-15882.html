			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Ecuador boost from World Bank THE WORLD BANK has approved a Dollars 75m credit to 'reactivate' Ecuador's private sector, particularly agriculture and construction. The aim is to invest in labour-intensive but profitable industries, said government officials. Mr Leonardo Stagg, director of the Ecuadorian National Finance Corporation, said the Dollars 75m credit was part of a 'Dollars 200m joint loan from the Inter-American Development Bank, the Andean Corporation for Development and the World Bank.' Mr Shahid Husain, World Bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean, said the World Bank was committed to support programmes of economic growth and development in countries such as Ecuador, which had engaged in serious and responsible projects. As well as providing desperately needed funds to revitalise the economy, the new credit is aimed at boosting confidence among foreign investors. 'This is a clear indication of the confidence that international credit institutions now have in Ecuador,' emphasised President Sixto Duran Ballen. The new credit comes as Ecuador is struggling to renegotiate Dollars 6.5bn in commercial debt with creditor banks.</p>

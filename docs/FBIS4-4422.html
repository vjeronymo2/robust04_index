			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Neutrality"; part one of </F> a continuing series entitled "Beleaguered Myth of the  Bureauracy"]    [Text] Kasumigaseki [the center of ministerial bureaucracy  in Tokyo] maintains its silence.    "Two years ago, the ministries would be excited about a  forthcoming election. The neutrality of the bureaucracy would,  of course, be forgotten, and endless requests for money,  personnel, office space, cars, and name lists would come from  officials of the bureau director general rank. Right now,  nobody is saying anything."  <H5>  Ministries Cannot Now Engage in Organized Election Campaigns </H5>   A bookkeeper at a leading general contractor which deals in  the construction of ports and similar public works projects,  testified to the change in the Ministry of Transport in the  above terms. This is true not only of the Transport Ministry.  The same thing is happening in the Ministries of Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries, Posts and Communications, Construction,  and Education, and the Defense Agency. Even officials at  ministries and agencies where former colleagues are now members  of the upper house, elected from the proportional representation  districts, tend to shut up when the topic of conversation turns  to the election next year.    Former Administrative Vice Minister of Transport Toru  Nakamura told a senior bureaucrat at the bureau director-general  level last August, "your candidacy will not be possible."    This was soon after the inauguration of the Hosokawa  administration. Former Transport Ministry officials were  planning to have the senior official run as a Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] candidate. However, an incumbent lower house member  with Transport Ministry links, Shinya Izumi, had defected from  the LDP to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and in view of the  change in political regime, the atmosphere was considered  unsuitable for his candidacy.    The situation is even more serious for ministries where  former officials are incumbent LDP Diet members. The National  Land Improvement Political Alliance, which traditionally  supported former officials from the Agricultural Structure  Improvement Bureau of the Agriculture Ministry stopped short of  endorsing lower house member Ryotaro Sudo at its regular general  meeting in February. The reason was officials of land  improvement groups nationwide were defecting from the LDP, and  it was not possible to reach a consensus on which candidate to  endorse. Shinseito leaders are also applying pressure on  ministries and agencies unscrupulously, saying "do you still  want to supply candidates to the LDP?"    There are currently 69 members of the House of  Representatives, and 42 members of the House of Councilors who  are former bureaucrats. In the first decade after the war,  bureaucrats not only joined the conservative parties; some even  joined the Socialist Party. However, after the founding of the  LDP, the bureaucracy became an exclusive source of candidates  for this party. Particularly in the proportional representation  elections, close links between the bureaucracy and businesses  traditionally produced hundreds of thousands of new LDP members,  together with their membership dues. It was an impregnable LDP  fortress. However, this fortress is also disintegrating.    During upper house elections two years ago, the LDP put up  six new former bureaucrat candidates, and five were elected.  Hideyuki Aizawa, director general of the LDP Election Bureau,  says that now, however, "lavish election spending, and the  recruitment of party members through the mobilization of entire  business sectors will not be allowed."  <H5>  "Ozawa Scheme" Seen as Threatening </H5>   Last December, Minister of International Trade and Industry  Hiroshi Kumagai forced Masahisa Naito, director general of the  Industrial Policy Bureau and number-two man in the Trade  Ministry's bureaucratic hierarchy, to resign over preferential  promotions for ministry officials intending to run in elections.  The repercussions of this incident are still being felt three  months later.    Unlike in the United States, where officials above the  rank of bureau chief are replaced in the change of  administration, the Japanese bureaucracy is more permanent.  However, since the unwritten rule that "bureaucratic personnel  matters are sacrosanct" has been violated, officials now fear  politicians may have the last say on personnel appointments  every time there is a change of administration. Such a sense of  crisis is not wholly groundless because the incident coincided  with a plan by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa to  appoint more than one parliamentary vice minister to each  ministry, and to send more than 150 political councilors from  the ruling parties to participate in policymaking.    The objective of the "Ozawa scheme" was to do away with  "bureaucratic control of the administration," and to allow  politicians to regain the initiative. Ozawa believes that  bureaucrats should be "politically `neutral' and assist the  politicians." That is, he wants bureaucrats merely to indicate  the policy options, and let politicians make the decision.    As a matter of fact, when the plan was presented to the  ruling coalition parties last October, senior government  officials wrote a paper opposing the scheme, claiming they  represented the general consensus in Kasumigaseki. The gist of  the document was that "if policies are formulated through  lobbying by politicians for various interests, there can be no  `neutrality.'"    In the name of "neutrality," Ozawa wants to tighten control  on the bureaucrats, while the bureaucrats are trying to keep the  politicians from interfering. The idea of dispatching political  councillors met with particularly strong resistance from the  bureaucrats, and was eventually scrapped.    Admittedly, in a parliamentary cabinet system, where  policies  are decided through consultations between the cabinet and the  ruling parties, these policies are inevitably influenced by  partisan interests. The question is: How far the bureaucrats,  who are not directly responsible to the people, should be  involved in policymaking, and to what extent the policy process  can be made open.  <H5>  Leading Role in Policymaking </H5>   After the change of regime, the old pattern under which  bureaucrats supplied information only to the LDP has been  interrupted. In place of this, there are an increasing number  of cases where bureaucrats themselves, rather than politicians,  have spoken out publicly.    According to a former finance minister, this signifies not  only that bureaucrats are overexerting themselves, but also that  "politicians are losing influence."    During the briefings prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks,  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa often asked the bureaucrats  briefing him, "What am I supposed to do then?"    This has become the talk of the Foreign Ministry.  Essentially, the old pattern of policymaking has not changed  since then.</p>

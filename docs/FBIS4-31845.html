			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serious Macedonian Border Violations"] </F>   [Text] Elizabeth Baldwin, chief of the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] press service, officially confirmed the  Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  border has been violated on several occasions by Serbian border  patrols. The newly appointed Yasushi Akashi's representative in  Macedonia, Hugo Ansen, in his statement for NOVA MAKEDONIJA,  pointed out the Macedonian Government and UNPROFOR should  consider such border violations as serious. Indeed, he said,  there are no dramatic incidents, but these are clearly cases of  border violations. Serbian troops have entered into a territory  which we regard to be Macedonian by all means, Ansen said. He  also confirmed the reports of a Serbian plane having flown over  Macedonian territory a fortnight ago, intercepting an UNPROFOR  helicopter. No shots have been fired thus far. Sometimes,  Serbian soldiers do point their guns at targets on this side of  the border, but that is all there is to it, Ansen said.</p>

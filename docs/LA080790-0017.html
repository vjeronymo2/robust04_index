Christopher  (Kid) Reid and Christopher (Play) Martin, stars of the movie "House Party,"  were arrested after appearing as an opening act for Public Enemy at the  Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center, and were freed after paying fines of $550  each.  </P> <P> Amy Bennick, vice president of creative services for Select Records, described  the actions that led to the arrests as "making love to the stage," and said it  is a regular feature of the duo's show. Neither Augusta police nor Kid 'n Play  was available for comment Monday. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

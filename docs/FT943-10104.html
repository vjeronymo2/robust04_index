			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Knussen's knack As Tuesday's BBC Symphony Prom reminded us, it seems a palpable waste that Oliver Knussen is called upon to conduct only his contemporaries' works - and his own. He is a searching practical musician, unlike many one could name; there is no reason to doubt that his wide-ranging gifts could be lavished fruitfully upon a lot of older repertoire. Here, his account of Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements was terrific: from the opening flourishes (to which he refused any rhetorical indulgence, but held strictly within Stravinsky's unrelenting rhythmic terms), through a graceful, well-sprung Andante, to a final Con moto that finally dazzled. It is years since I heard it so satisfyingly performed. Alexander Goehr's Colossos or Panic, inspired by Goya's painting 'The Colossus', was having its British premiere. In two solid movements, it is as suavely assured as it is distinctly odd. It does indeed begin with some colossal ritual howls, and the first movement rises to menacing peaks several times later. Yet the tone and manner are basically those of a Mahlerian dance-movement - playful, gracious, mock-neo-classical; there is even a sweet, Straussian violin. All that is truer still of the second movement, ingratiating and elegant: tuneful, in fact, and touched with pathos despite some hefty surges with minatory brass. Like the first, it finally dwindles and fades, this time to celesta and pizzicato strings, with poignant solo phrases. The public face of the music is 'accessible' as could be, the construction superbly polished. It was very warmly received. The overall sense of the piece remains quizzical; as with Mahler, it will doubtless reveal itself on further acquaintance. Knussen also conducted, and Lucy Shelton sang, his own recent, exquisite (Walt) Whitman Settings. Marvellous orchestration, neo-Impressionist and beyond (there is some candid Britten in the first song); ingeniously wrought vocal lines; formal economy, unerring point. We have heard little new from Knussen lately, but the skill and originality of these Whitman studies - more than studies - promise splendid things to come. Miss Shelton was impeccable.</p>

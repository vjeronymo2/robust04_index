			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Xiao Hang (4562 5300): "Public Security </F> Steps Up Operations Against Drug Trafficking"]    [Text] Stepped-up antidrug operations by public security  organs across the country since early this year have resulted in  the solving of more than 2,000 drug cases--almost double the  number in the same period last year--and the seizure of more  than 2,000 kg of drugs.    Guided by identified drug-trafficking patterns, public  security organs in southwest border provinces and regions, and  those along the southeast coast--such as Yunnan, Guangxi,  Fujian, and Guangdong--stepped up reconnaissance and border and  coastal interceptions, thereby solving cases, boosting the  number of cases solved in the first quarter, and achieving a  greater rate of crime-busting than the same period last year.  Yunnan solved 900 drug cases in the first quarter, seizing more  than 700 kg of heroin; and solved a major drug case involving  over 10 kg of heroin on each of six days from late March to  early April.    Guangxi and Guangdong public security organs solved more  than  400 drug cases and arrested a number of drug traffickers from  outside the borders in the first quarter. Aimed at stopping  criminals from taking advantage of the increasing social  intercourse between the two shores of the strait to traffic  drugs, Fujian public security organs increased efforts at  cracking these cases, solving 22 drug-trafficking cases in the  first quarter, seizing close to 40 kg of drugs, and arresting 57  suspects, some of them of Taiwan origin.    In their struggle against drugs, public security organs made  a point of mobilizing and relying on the masses to launch a  people's war against drugs. On 22 February, a peasant in  Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, picked up a bundle of sugar  cane on a road and found in it 51 g of heroin wrapped in a  plastic bag. He reported this immediately to the public  security organ, which investigated and followed the lead,  thereby solving a major drug case.    The Ministry of Public Security recently issued notices  commending public security organs for the brilliant results they  have scored in the battle against drugs.</p>

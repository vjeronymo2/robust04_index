			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Ratners A term immortally associated with Mr Gerald Ratner himself might well sum up Christmas trading in his jewellery group. But though the market responded yesterday by marking the shares 9 per cent lower, it is not clear that the provisional trading statement leaves investors much the wiser. A 15 per cent fall in sales in the crucial six week period up to December 25 was certainly worse than expected, as was the break-even trading forecast for the year about to end. The key issues, however, are Ratners' financial position and its relationship with the banks. In this latter respect the message of support from Barclays and Midland was hardly overwhelming, being chiefly confined to welcoming the appointment of a Scottish chartered accountant as Mr Ratner's boss. As for the balance sheet, Pounds 217m of net debt is a rather lower figure than might have been feared, and one that suggests the process of squeezing out working capital is reasonably well advanced. Borrowings nevertheless are seasonally depressed. And though the looming put option on the convertible bonds is mainly provided for, it will still cost around Pounds 55m in cash come October. Though Ratners gave no information about its lending covenants yesterday, one can only assume in the current climate that the banks hold the key. For the moment a Saatchi-style restructuring does not look to be necessary. But mention of Saatchi is a reminder of a general truth; when they fall this far, they generally do not come back.</p>

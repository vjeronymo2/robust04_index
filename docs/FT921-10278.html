			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Egyptian rebuff for Moslem Brotherhood EGYPT'S banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood has again been denied legal status by an Egyptian court, in a decision which comes at time when the government is edgy about an apparent upswing in Islamic militancy across the Arab world. The Brotherhood, which was outlawed in 1954 after President Gamal Abdel Nasser accused it of plotting his overthrow, has been pressing unsuccessfully for registration as a charitable organisation. Egypt's constitution would prevent, in any case, the Brotherhood gaining acceptance as a political party since it bans political organisations based on race or religion. Egypt's Administrative Court gave no reason for rejecting the Brotherhood's latest application. It intends to appeal. Mr Mohammed Selim, lawyer for the Moslem Brotherhood, declared after the ruling: 'All we can do is resort to the Higher Administrative Court.' The Moslem Brotherhood, the country's mainstream Islamic force, is allowed a fair degree of latitude to organise, canvass politically and operate schools and clinics. It has gained seats in parliament in partnership with the tiny Liberal and Socialist Labour parties, but along with other main opposition groupings boycotted the last election held in November 1990. Brotherhood supporters argue that continued denial of legal status makes no sense since the organisation is allowed to operate openly, although it may not contest elections in its own right. Two Israeli Arabs arrested earlier this week in Egypt on suspicion of spying are being interrogated in a maximum security prison in Cairo, according to the Cairo official press. The two are described as a 41-year-old man and his daughter. Egyptian newspapers reported that illegal communications equipment and official documents were found in their suburban home in Heliopolis. This is believed to be the first case of Egypt arresting suspected Israeli spies since the two countries signed their peace treaty in 1979.</p>

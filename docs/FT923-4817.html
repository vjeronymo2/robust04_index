			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A matter for debate IN VICTORIAN times the British parliament usually rose in July or early August and did not reconvene until the following February. This fact is well known to readers of Anthony Trollope, who depicts the rulers of the time spending the autumn in their own and each others' country houses, some of them working away conscientiously at official papers but all confident that the longer the recess lasts, the better the Queen's government can be carried on. Mr John Major is known to be a keen admirer of Trollope, and it would seem that he has imbibed this point of view. This year he sent parliament home for its summer holidays in mid-July, earlier than any of his predecessors have done in recent years. Normally it would not reassemble until October 19  -September and early October being nowadays the season, not so much of grouse and pheasant shooting as of party conferences. But parliament can be recalled when important events require its attention. Mr John Smith, the new leader of the opposition, feels that recent developments in the international situation - notably in the former Yugoslavia, in Iraq and in Somalia - are sufficiently grave to justify that. Mr Major feels otherwise. His decision to reject Mr Smith's request is not unprecedented, but it can only be justified if the opposition's request appears merely mischievous. Perhaps there was a hint of mischief in Mr Smith's suggestion that parliament should also debate 'the current condition of the domestic economy'. This, as he says, 'remains in deep recession'. It has not (alas) significantly changed since parliament last sat. But the very continuance of that state of affairs, combined with uncertainty over the French referendum result, has raised widespread doubts about the viability of the government's economic policy, especially in relation to the exchange rate. Mr Smith personally has not so far advocated a different exchange rate policy; but any leader of the opposition would be bound to relish the prospect of seeing the prime minister questioned by his own backbenchers on that subject, or indeed about his hopes and fears concerning the Maastricht treaty. Mr Major's desire to avoid such questions for the time being is understandable. But it is not a sufficient reason for refusing Mr Smith's request. Nor is the statement (which Mr Smith himself disputes) that they had agreed last month that a recall of parliament was 'not appropriate', presumably meaning not necessary, to discuss the situations in Yugoslavia and Iraq. The fact is that in both those cases the government has taken very serious decisions, putting the lives of British servicemen at risk. In the Yugoslav case, especially, there are real grounds for anxiety, both about the exposed position of the UN troops and about the fact that this half-baked 'humanitarian' military intervention does nothing to reverse the forced population movements or to discourage would-be 'ethnic cleansers' elsewhere in eastern Europe. Mr Smith should be given credit for considering the position carefully, rather than calling for the return of parliament as a mere knee-jerk reaction. His request should be taken more rather than less seriously for that reason.</p>

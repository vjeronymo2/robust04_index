			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Dollar dilemma There remains something baffling about last week's concerted intervention to support the dollar. The currency closed in Europe on Friday at DM1.4675, not much changed from the level of DM1.4610 at which the intervention occurred. At least the central banks seem to have put a brake on the dollar's fall towards its historic low of DM1.4430. Were it to slip below that point the dollar could begin a seemingly unstoppable decline. Yet the intervention was all the less convincing since it flies in the face of interest rate factors for which the central banks are also responsible. Recent dollar weakness stems above all from the market's belief that the interest differential between Germany and the US may be set to widen. Continuing economic disappointment may prompt the US to cut rates: money supply worries may provoke an increase in Germany's internationally sensitive Lombard rate. Granted the German economy is slowing and wholesale prices are falling, but the Bundesbank drained liquidity from the money market last week, a move which could signal concern about the volume of Lombard borrowing by the banking system. Perhaps the intervention was motivated by the fragile state of world stock markets earlier in the week. The dollar's fall was also putting the D-Mark under upward pressure within the ERM. Still more significant may have been the Federal Reserve's desire to ward off a rise in US long rates which are every bit as important to economic recovery as short rates. Doubtless US bond yields, which are already being pushed up by election worries, would move smartly higher if the dollar did breach its previous low. The intervention came in the middle of a quarterly US Treasury funding programme in the bond market. It offered at least some comfort to foreign investors worried about the exchange risk in holding US bonds. But, if that is a serious preoccupation for the Fed, it is hardly likely to provoke the exchange market by cutting short rates further. On the US side at least, the market's worry about a wider transatlantic interest differential may be overdone.</p>

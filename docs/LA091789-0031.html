			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE JIM BAKKER SAGA  </P> <P> Congratulations to Garry Abrams on his excellent article "Amazing Disgrace."  </P> <P> Who says the theater is dead? Jim Bakker has had many years of success in his  ongoing role as a telecharlatan minister's telecharlatan minister. He is an  experienced actor who could've given the great Olivier lessons.  </P> <P> I hope Bakker's judge and jury view his apparent "psychological deterioration"  with the eye of a skeptical theater critic. With Bakker's "sense of drama and  staging," he just may be attempting to give the greatest performance of his  life.  </P> <P> BOB CANNING, Los Angeles  </P></p>

He was addressing a joint  meeting of the Press Advisory Council and the Consultative  Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Islamabad today. The  meeting adopted a resolution condemning the Indian Government's  ban on the entry of representatives from the human rights  organizations and the mass media into occupied Kashmir. The  resolution says the ban has been imposed to cover up the brutal  activities of Indian forces in the occupied area. The meeting  called on the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] to convene a  special meeting on Kashmir and also urged the Pakistani  Government to make a formal request to the ICO in this regard.    The meeting welcomed the UN secretary general's annual  report  calling for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute and U.S.  President Bill Clinton's reference to Kashmir at the UN General  Assembly, which, the meeting hoped, will greatly help the  implementation of UN resolutions on Kashmir.</p>

Oil moved into the Gulf of Alaska, along the Kenai coast to Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula_some 600 miles from Bligh Reef. Massive clean-up and containment efforts were initiated and continued to 1992. On October 8, 1991, an agreement was approved by the United States District Court for the District of Alaska that settled claims of the United States and the State of Alaska against the Exxon Corporation and the Exxon Shipping Company for various criminal and civil violations. Under the civil settlement, Exxon companies agreed to pay to the governments $900 million over a period of 10 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council was established to manage the funds obtained from the civil settlement of the EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill. The Trustee Council is composed of three State of Alaska trustees (Attorney General; Commissioner, Department of Environmental Conservation; and Commissioner, Department of Fish and Game) and three Federal representatives appointed by the Federal Trustees (Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture; the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Advisory Group was created by Paragraph V.A.4 of the Memorandum of Agreement and Consent Decree entered into by the United States of America and the State of Alaska on August 27, 1991, and approved by the United States District Court for the District of Alaska in settlement of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States of America <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of Alaska, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Civil Action No. A91&hyph;081 CV. The Public Advisory Group was chartered by the Secretary of the Interior on October 23, 1992, and functions solely as an advisory body, and in compliance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. (1988)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Advisory Group was established to advise the Trustee Council, and began functioning in October 1992. The Public Advisory Group consists of 17 members representing the following principal interests: Sport hunting and fishing, environmental, public-at-large (5), recreation users, local government, science/academic, conservation, subsistence, commercial fishing, aquaculture, commercial tourism, forest products, and Native landowners. Members were appointed to serve a two-year term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To carry out its advisory role, the Public Advisory Group makes recommendations to, and advises, the Trustee Council in Alaska on the following matters: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All decisions related to injury assessment, restoration activities, or other use of natural resource damage recovery monies obtained by the governments, including all decisions regarding: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

The Council continues, stating their desire that ``*&blank;*&blank;* a wide spectrum of views and interest are available for the Council to consider as it evaluates, develops, and implements restoration activities. It is the Council's intent that the diversity of interests and views held by the Public Advisory Group members contribute to wide ranging discussions that will be of benefit to the Trustee Council.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure that a broad range of public viewpoints continues to be available to the Trustee Council, and in keeping with the settlement agreement, the continuation of the Public Advisory Group for another two-year period is recommended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I hereby certify that the renewal of the Charter of the Public Advisory Group, an advisory committee to make recommendations to and advise the EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council in Alaska, is necessary and in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties mandated by the settlement of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of Alaska <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , No. A91&hyph;081 CV, and is in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended and supplemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bruce Babbitt, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of the Interior. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29982 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;10&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

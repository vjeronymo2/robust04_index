			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Oded Granot: "The Glue Is Beginning to Come </F> Unstuck"]    [Text] The Arab countries managed to rally around the  pronouncement that Israel is the Arab nation's staunchest enemy  for 50 years, until something happened in Cairo yesterday: For  the first time in the history of the Arab League, the foreign  ministers decided that henceforth each country would identify  its own enemy.    This does not mean that the Arab League's friend-or-foe  detection system went haywire or felt a sudden surge of love  toward Israel, but it is yet another indication of the collapse  of inter-Arab solidarity.    The Gulf war blew Arab unity to smithereens. The  disagreements among the Arab countries worsened in the wake of  that war and became more acute as a result of the absence of a  charismatic and influential Arab leader. For years hostility  toward Israel was the only glue that kept all their conflicting  interests together, and now that glue is beginning to come  unstuck.    Not so much because of our beautiful eyes but because of  interests: The Syrians see a chance of getting back the Golan  Heights in the context of a peace arrangement and play down  their outrage in reaction to the Hebron massacre; 'Arafat sees a  rapid implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement as the only  chance for his survival; the Gulf states see no reason not to do  business with Israel at a time when the "direct confrontation  states" -- Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon -- sit around the table to  negotiate with Israeli representatives.    Although this is a welcome shift, one should not indulge in  illusions. It is still a long way between inter-Arab  disagreement over the definition of Israel as "the common enemy"  and accepting Israel as an observer in the Arab League. A  decrease in hostility toward Israel definitely hinges on the  rate of progress in the peace process.</p>

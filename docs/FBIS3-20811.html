			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roman Strzemiecki: "Walesa for Everyone"] </F>   [Text] As early as the middle of December 1993, President  Lech Walesa readily and frequently granted interviews, thereby  turning up the pressure on the West and gaining what was not to  be had through diplomatic channels. The greatest splash was  produced by the interviews granted to THE WASHINGTON POST, the  renowned BBC, and French television. Lech Walesa warned that  "life may cause us to wind up making military arrangements with  Ukraine if we do not get into NATO," stating that "it is not  possible to be a partner without being a participant," and  ultimately, just before the meeting in Brussels, described the  U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace" as blackmail.    In December, Minister Andrzej Olechowski held many talks in  Washington, trying (unfortunately, with little result) to have  the "proposal for nonrejection," as the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs terms Partnership for Peace, turned into an  institutional precursor for entry into NATO. Recently [in  January], Olechowski proceeded to Bonn, hoping for a warm  response from the Germans. There, as well, unfortunately, he did  not have much luck, and his reception by Klaus Kinkel was  downright frosty. Despite this, he visited the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, clarifying Poland's position through the  publication of several articles in the opinion-molding  foreign-affairs press. On 1 December, IZVESTIYA carried an  article by Olechowski entitled "Poland's Concerns." Just before  the NATO summit in Brussels, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU carried  another article by the chief Polish diplomat in which Olechowski  gave assurances that "we are not afraid of Russia but, rather,  of the objective situation that may push it to behave in a  manner that is threatening to Poland. This situation is the  security vacuum that now exists in Europe." The Polish-U.S.  lobby took up the call to action in the United States.    The result of Lech Walesa's efforts was the trip made before  the Brussels summit by Ambassador [to the UN] Madeleine Albright  (a Czech by extraction) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, General John Shalikashvili (born in Warsaw), to the  "Visegrad" capitals. The trip by the two politicians showed that  "four" are not only going at different speeds but that the  Czechs clearly indicate that they do not feel any commonality of  interests with their neighbors.    Lech Walesa's closest ally turned out to be the president of  Slovakia, Michal Kovac, who as early as the first part of  January proposed that our countries immediately be granted "full  political membership in NATO and security guarantees." The  Hungarians, who did not share Walesa's angry reaction to the  proposal from Albright and Shalikashvili, did not make life easy  for Walesa.    Just before the Brussels summit, a real contest developed.  The parliament of Bulgaria demanded that NATO treat that country  the same as the "Visegrad" countries, Romania officially asked  for accession to NATO, and, several days later, Algirdas  Brazauskas, the president of Lithuania, submitted a similar  petition. In response to the Polish offensive, Moscow recently  launched a counteroffensive. Vyacheslav Kostikov, spokesman for  President Yeltsin, stated That admitting the countries of  Central Europe into NATO would bring the Russian reforms to a  halt. The Russian Army "would be furious," and Russia "would  have to form its own military-political bloc."</p>

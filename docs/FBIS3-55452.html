Spokesman of the Union  Vladimir Yefimov invited the persons attending to use all means  against the Estonian authorities, including civic disobedience.  A letter will be sent to the UN and the CE [Council of Europe],  he announced, adding that a major meeting in central Narva is  intended for January.    The unemployed held a meeting in Jaanilinn (Ivangorod)  yesterday, demanding that all inhabitants of Narva be dismissed  from the enterprises in Jaanilinn and the jobs provided for the  locals. Approximately 15 hundred of those present had been  dismissed from the firms in Narva as a number of major  enterprises cut jobs late last year. Mayor of Jaanilinn Viktor  Dmitriyev announced that the Russian laws would not allow such a  move.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / ECGD restores cover for Brazil The British Export Credits Guarantee Department said yesterday it had resumed export credit insurance cover for Brazil, after a gap of 11 years, Reuter reports. The decision followed a successful restructuring of Brazil's commercial bank debt and 'encouraging progress with its economic stabilisation programme', an ECGD statement said. 'ECGD's restoration of cover for Brazil will represent a whole new area of opportunity for British business,' said Mr Michael Heseltine, UK Trade and Industry Secretary. 'Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world and will be opening up even more now that the effects of the debt crisis are receding,' he said. Cover was withdrawn in 1983 after substantial payment delays. Limited cover was resumed in 1989 but was suspended almost immediately when Brazil again stopped honouring its debts. ECGD said cover would concentrate on business with the Brazilian private sector. Some public sector organisations will be eligible if they can show their receipts of foreign exchange will cover payments. The ECGD activities will be concentrated on business which promotes Brazil's economic rehabilitation. 'Brazil is the 14th country for which ECGD has resumed cover over the last two years. The significant increase in the number of markets on cover, together with increased availability of cover for major markets and reductions in premium, is giving British exporters greater opportunities to compete for business overseas, and demonstrates this government's commitment to support UK companies in their export efforts', the UK minister said. In Sao Paulo: Brazil's inflation fell to 44.66 per cent in May, compared to last month, an official at the Economic Research Institute said. The index, calculated by the University of Sao Paulo, measures inflation at weekly intervals.</p>

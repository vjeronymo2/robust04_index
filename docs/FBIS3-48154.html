Australia is encouraged by the approach, but it is insisting  there be firm progress on the nuclear issue before ties could be  resumed. Linda Mottram reports from Canberra:    [Begin Mottram recording] Australian officials have  confirmed a report in the national newspaper THE AUSTRALIAN  about the approach made in recent weeks by a senior North Korean  diplomat to the Australian Embassy in Bangkok. An Australian  Government spokesperson says Australian diplomats have returned  the sounding-out. The spokesperson said the approach is being  seen as encouraging, but says Pyongyang has been told any  further development depends on North Korea allowing full  international inspection of its nuclear facilities where nuclear  weapons development is feared, and on progress in talks between  North and South Korea and North Korea and the United States.    The spokesperson described the situation as talks about  talks  and very, very preliminary. Australia has informed South Korea  of the approach which appeared to have been made to Australia  only.

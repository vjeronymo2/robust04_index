			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Pristina, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- The public  prosecutor's office in Pristina today requested the district  court to begin an investigation into the activities of six  ethnic Albanians charged with undergoing military training in  Albania for several months and with preparing to join Albanian  paramilitary units in Kosovo and Metohija with the objective of  forcefully seceding from the Republic of Serbia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and joining with Albania. [passage  omitted] They have all been remanded in custody.    For several months during 1992 and 1993, the group took part  in military training in the village of (Ljabinot Fus), near  Elbasan [in Albania], organized by the Tirana office of the  self-proclaimed "government" of the phantom "Republic of Kosovo."    Albanian Army officers organized military training for the  arrested group, in addition to a large number of other persons  of the Albanian national minority from the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. They  were trained how to handle all sorts of infantry weapons,  armored vehicles, tanks, explosive devices, and how to carry out  sabotage actions.    Having completed their training, these future members of the  paramilitary formations of the Albanian separatist movement in  Kosovo signed declarations saying they would, immediately upon  receiving call-ups and after the break up of armed clashes  between ethnic-Albanians and Serbs, report to the barracks where  they were trained.    According to a statement by the deputy district public  prosecutor in Pristina, Jovica Jovanovic, representatives of an  "office" of the self-styled "Republic of Kosovo" in Tirana, Ali  Alija, Mehmet Kraja, and Zumber Berisa, mediated the sending of  this group to be trained in Albania. They subsequently visited  them in the training center and instructed them on the goals of  these activities.    One of the arrested, Nedzmedin Sadriju, completed his  intelligence training which is being carried out in the Albanian  center of Ljac.    Our bodies of prosecution, Prosecutor Jovanovic says, are in  possession of indisputable details about several dozen  ethnic-Albanians from Kosovo and Metohija who completed military  training in Albania. A group of eight people who were arrested  and sentenced in mid-1992, after completing their military  training in the village of Surela near Tirana, smuggled into  Kosovo and Metohija 74 automatic rifles with 14,000 bullets and  a large quantity of military equipment.

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Total falls by 1.6% on capital increase THE Bundesbank's cut in the repo rate, followed by the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway, had minimal effect on yesterday's activity on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was busy digesting the elements of Total's FFr4bn reserved capital increase and while the shares fell to a day's low of FFr262 in early trading, they recovered a little, closing down FFr4.20 or 1.6 per cent at FFr265.10. The CAC-40 index gained 15.10 to 1,942.51 in turnover of some FFr2.7bn. Mr Michael Drozd, oil analyst at UBS in London, commented that Total's announcement appeared 'quite clever' in that it did not bring new equity onto the market and was unlikely to be earnings dilutive in 1993. However, he added, it remained to be seen if the capital increase, under which Lyonnaise-Dumez, SocGen and Cogema, the nuclear fuels group, will jointly own 7 per cent of Total, will be enough to compensate for the cash drain arising from its development projects. Lyonnaise-Dumez rose FFr3.70 to FFr455.80 and SocGen improved FFr5 to FFr617. Elf also benefited, up FFr5.20 at FFr379.20. Accor fell FFr18 or 2.8 per cent to FFr646 after an analysts meeting at which it said that it was unable to make an earnings forecast for 1993; while Euro Disney, off FFr4.35 or 5.7 per cent at FFr71.65, continued to be effected by Tuesday's earnings news. FRANKFURT fell for the seventh straight session as the market continued to be dominated by futures trading. One analyst noted that the repo rate cut had had no impact on activity since it had been anticipated. The mood had turned negative over the last week or so, he said, after the DAX index had failed to break through and hold the 1,700 level. The index closed 11.91 lower at 1,628.87. Bayer went against the trend on better than expected first quarter results, closing up DM2.10 at DM271.40, while Basf, due to report today, edged 90 pfg ahead at DM235.30 but Hoechst, which has already released its figures, lost DM8.60 to DM232.90. 1 MILAN played a waiting game, anxious for details of prime minister designate Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's new cabinet, but many shares picked up as the day progressed from lows seen after an early round of profit-taking. The Comit index eased 3.32 to 543.93, although analysts noted a continuing firm undertone to the market. Turnover was estimated at below Tuesday's record L656bn. Fiat again saw profit-taking, falling L160 to fix at L6,875 before edging back up to L6,930 after-hours. Other blue chips showing a recovery in late business included Mediobanca, the merchant bank, which settled down L60 at L15,590, but then rebounded to L15,850 on the kerb. Against the trend, Benetton showed gains throughout the session, firming L264 to settle at L18,354 and then rising to L18,409 after-hours. ZURICH put in a firmer performance after the weaker trend seen earlier in the week but trading remained slow. The SMI index added 13.6 to 2,138.3. Ascom bearers continued under pressure, giving up another SFr115 or 8.3 per cent to SFr1,265, after Tuesday's 11.5 per cent fall. CS Holding rose SFr50 to SFr2,430 in delayed response to Tuesday's results. Sandoz certificates added SFr50 to SFr3,000: the group reported higher sales the previous day. ISTANBUL surged 4.4 per cent to its ninth all-time high close this month. The index rose 341.86 to 7,570.97, bringing gains over the last three sessions to 9.5 per cent. OSLO ended at a year's high with the market index 8.96 ahead at 470.16. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index rose 11.7 to 1,020.5 with Astra B shares up SKr19 to SKr689.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 28                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1152.65      1151.88      1151.58      1152.38 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1218.50      1217.12      1215.37      1213.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1151.09      1150.44      1152.22      1154.98 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1211.04      1207.82      1210.56      1212.69  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 27    Apr 26    Apr 23    Apr 22    Apr 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1149.08   1152.81   1156.50   1164.35   1157.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1213.85   1218.66   1223.66   1234.50   1224.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1154.98; 200 - 1219.00 Low/day: 100 - 1149.67  200 - 1208.17.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

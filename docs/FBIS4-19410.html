			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "Rwanda -- The New </F> Barbarians"]    [Text] Rwanda is now in the clutches of horror. The only  reason the Europeans and the Americans have been paying any  attention, however, is that white soldiers have gone there to  evacuate white expatriates under the gaze of television lights.  Once the operation is over, viewers will forget quickly that the  slaughter in the former Belgian colony is only one example of  many others on the African Continent.    Ethnic cleansing is cause for scandal only in Yugoslavia. In  Africa, it has become too commonplace to hold our attention  beyond the first pictures of bloodshed and arson. In Liberia,  Zaire, Angola, and Sudan the killing goes on every day. The  Americans and their allies had made a great show of trying to  save Somalia from starvation, only to leave in a hurry as soon  as the military showcase turned into a real war. And that  country reverted immediately to the law of the jungle.    As in precolonial times, entire regions seem to have  vanished  from the map. Diplomats and businessmen from the industrialized  north are paying no attention to landlocked countries racked by  tribal conflict and concentrate on coastal areas. This is a  return to the bygone era of mercantilism.    Academic Jean-Christophe Ruffin compares the current  situation with that faced by the Romans when, having destroyed  Carthage, they were faced with a power vacuum. According to Mr.  Ruffin, democracies deprived of their Communist foe since the  collapse of the Soviet Union are now confronted by "new  barbarians."    But Europe can ignore this historical upheaval no more than  the Romans could. Because, under the combined blows of  fundamentalists and the army, Algeria is sinking further into  bloodshed every day; Marseille, Barcelona, and Palermo may soon  be submerged by "boat people," as were Thailand, the  Philippines, and Hong Kong when thousands of Vietnamese began  fleeing their country's Communist regime. The rift is not  limited to North Africa. The civilization of the Old Continent  is being threatened by a large ring of instability: from the  republics of the former USSR, in the throes of nationalist and  religious conflicts; to Turkey, whose regime's legitimacy is  being challenged both by Kurds and fundamentalists.    Mousy talk of human rights will not solve anything. Neither  will the unabashed indifference of mercantile types, whose  perspective on the world at large is restricted to market terms.  A new solidarity must be invented to save the south while  preserving the north. It is a paradox that the best way to  maintain employment levels in industrialized nations is to  create jobs in the Third World, through a distribution of tasks  based on technology.    Unless an original strategy is implemented, no European  border will be able to contain the invasion of the wretched  hordes. Because, says Senegal President Abdou Diouf, "extending  one's arms will not turn the tide."</p>

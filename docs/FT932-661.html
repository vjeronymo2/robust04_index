			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Gravani resigns from Rifondazione Comunista One of the founders of Italy's far-left Rifondazione Comunista, the rump of the country's once-powerful Communist Party, resigned yesterday as its secretary, Reuter reports from Rome. 'My motivations are purely political,' said Mr Sergio Gravani, indicating he was not involved in any of Italy's corruption scandals. Mr Gravani, 67, helped found the party when it broke away from the more mainstream Democratic Party of the Left in 1991.</p>

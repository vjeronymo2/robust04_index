			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg extends its three-year advance - Philip Gawith analyses the South African climb The first few weeks of 1992 have seen the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) continue the onward march which has made it one of the best-performing stock markets in each of the last three years. The all-share index closed at a new record of 3,713 on Wednesday, a rise of 8.9 per cent since December 23, and 39 per cent higher than a year ago. The financial and industrial index, which has made most of the running over the past year, closed at 5,016, 9.7 per cent up on December 23, and 54.5 per cent higher than a year previously. Although the market has weakened slightly over the past two days, the gains remain mostly intact. Analysts agree that the main explanation for the JSE's strong advance in recent weeks lies in the strong performance of world stock markets, particularly Wall Street following the pre-Christmas cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve. The JSE closely tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The JSE has also been boosted by the unexpected firmness in the gold bullion price which is trading at about Dollars 356 per ounce. This fed over into the prices of gold shares, with the All Gold index rising by 12.8 per cent from December 23 to close at 1,324 on Friday. The index is close to its year-ago level but is still a long way from the 2,250 reached in early 1990. Mr Paul Beachy Head, general manager for investments at the Southern Life insurance company, says the view that share prices rarely fall when interest rates are on the decline is the cause of positive sentiment in the market. Local brokers, who hold this view about the US market, believe it also applies in South Africa. Although the bank rate has not been cut for nearly a year, there is unanimity that a cut in rates will come within the next few months. This view received further support earlier this week from the news that producer price inflation had fallen to 7.9 per cent in November, the lowest level in eight years. Money market rates on short-term paper have also come off quite sharply in recent months. Mr Beachy Head also believes that the JSE is enjoying a political re-rating. 'Political developments continue to be perceived as favourable and hence the risk premium demanded on shares is seen to be declining.' Although JSE industrial shares were considered to be in expensive territory even before the latest increases, Mr Beachy Head does not consider valuations to be 'frothy'. He said he would not rule out a speculative bubble developing on the JSE over the next few years, similar to 1969 when the market's price/earnings ratio reached 25 (the overall index is currently on a multiple of 13.3). Whether this bubble appears or not, it is already the case that the JSE is discounting earnings prospects further ahead than used to be the case. Mr Roy McAlpine, fund manager at the Liberty Life insurance company, expresses the popular view when he says he is not expecting earnings from industrial companies to improve in 10992. 'Company profits are going to be under enormous pressure this year. In many cases earnings will be flat or down. Off this base, the possibility for a further favourable re-rating is very limited.' He also points out that South Africa cannot kick-start its economy on its own. The economy has a strong export orientation, so growth will remain slow until world economies pick up. For this reason, Mr McAlpine is doubtful whether, this year, mining counters will experience the sort of price increases which industrial stocks have been enjoying. 'Activity will only happen if you get favourable price movements in the underlying metal.' Few analysts are predicting significant price rises for South Africa's large commodity exports like gold, platinum and ferrochrome. Mining houses, however, have already enjoyed a considerable upward re-rating over the past year. The bellwether stock here, Anglo American, traded this week at R131.75, 57 per cent up on its 1991 low of R84. Although sceptical of the extent to which economic fundamentals justify the market's optimism, Mr McAlpine points out that cash or gilts have been very poor alternatives to equities over the past 25 years, and there seems little reason to expect a change in the near future. This is the familiar 'hothouse' effect on the JSE, whereby exchange control prevents institutions investing their enormous cash flows abroad, with few favourable alternatives to equities at home. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors, a local financial institution, argues that although the market is high by South African standards - the financial and industrial index is on a p/e of 14.7 - it can be justified if the country achieves its growth potential (3-5 per cent per annum growth in GDP) over the next three to four years. He does not, however, see the financial and industrial index repeating last year's re-rating until improved earnings start coming through, probably next year. Despite the stock market's record-breaking advance, Mr Lee believes there is still value to be found. The good performance of the index reflects institutional buying of a limited number of blue chip stocks like Barlows, SAB, Richemont, Rembrandt and Anglo American. Second-tier stocks not included the index have not enjoyed similar upward re-ratings are likely to attract increasing attention from investors.</p>

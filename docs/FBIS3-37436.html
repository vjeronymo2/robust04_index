Mr. Chikvaidze  arrived to Baku with a short-term visit on his route to Tehran.    Mr. Chikvaidze said that his meetings with President Aliyev  and Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov were aimed to  ascertain each others approaches to some issues. Such contacts  are necessary, he said, because both the countries would like to  appear with common position at various international forums.    According to the foreign minister of Georgia, issues  concerning international conflicts in the region were discussed  in the first place at his Baku meetings. We did not discuss  measures that should be taken to stop conflicts, but pointed out  that it was necessary to take efforts on resolution of the  conflicts over Karabakh and Abkhazia, Aleksandr Chikvaidze  stated. He appreciated the idea, of arranging a tripartite  Transcaucasian summit, which was supported by Azerbaijan party.  It is expected that the Russian party would be invited to take  part in the summit. Now, he said, we should take measures to  realize this idea and make concrete proposals.    Aleksandr Chikvaidze also informed that the parties agreed  to  open a Georgian embassy in Baku and an Azerbaijani one in  Tbilisi.    The Georgian diplomat tendered an invitation of Eduard  Shevardnadze to Geydar Aliyev to visit Georgia whenever it would  be convenient.</p>

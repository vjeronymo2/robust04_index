			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Japan's envoy asserted  Thursday that his country would not go nuclear even if North  Korea possessed atomic weapons.    ``This (North Korean) nuclear issue has become a top  priority  issue and a symbolic issue for Japanese-Korean cooperation in  the international society,'' Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Toshio  Goto said at a luncheon hosted by the Korean Council on Foreign  Relations.    ``I would like to assure you, new Prime Minister Hata stands  firm on this issue,'' he said.    Asked about the possibility of expanding bilateral military  cooperation through such means as conducting joint drills, the  ambassador said it could happen but first required careful  consideration.    South Korea's defense minister visited Japan recently and  agreed on exchange calls by naval vessels, an important symbolic  gesture for two countries whose history is stained by more than  three decades of colonial rule that culminated with the end of  World War II.    ``...It's a matter requiring delicate consideration from the  standpoint of the sentiments of the Korean people,'' said Goto,  referring to the colonial years.    He voiced hope that a time will come when people on both  sides can cooperate ``without prejudice.''    Certain media reports were raising ``unfounded suspicions''  that Japan might change its non-nuclear policies should North  Korea develop nuclear weapons, the envoy pointed out.    ``There is no such possibility that Japan would decide to go  nuclear... I would like to stress here that nuclearization  would run counter to Japan's national interest,'' said Goto.    The ambassador highlighted regional stability and three key  tasks involved--encouraging coordination to settle regional  conflicts, cooperating in promoting region-wide political and  security dialogue, and enhancing the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum as the region's economic engine.    On bilateral terms, he agreed with South Korean President  Kim  Yong-sam's view that an accurate recognition of history is the  only way to point their ties in a future-and world-oriented  direction.    ``I fully share the view that the Japan-Korea relationship  is  moving beyond the bilateral framework and has reached the phase  of promoting cooperation in the Asia-pacific region and,  moreover, in the international community,'' he said.</p>

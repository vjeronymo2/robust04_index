Urgency and Necessity of Reorganizing  State-Owned Assets    When we refer to reorganization of state-owned assets, we  mean this to contain, chiefly, the following three levels of  reform: first, carrying out reorganization of state-owned assets  concerned with the enterprise property organization system,  which means incorporating the great majority of state- owned  enterprises, converting them into joint stock enterprises with  state single capital, state-controlled capital and state-shared  capital; the second is to reorganize state-owned assets within  the scope of an industry, which means putting support for pillar  enterprises at the center, and perfecting the organization of  state-owned enterprises' assets within the same industry, to  form a "national class group" of enterprises within that  industry which will have competitive strength in international  markets; the third is to reorganize assets among industries,  which means allowing state-owned assets to be withdraws from  ordinary industries, while gathering in the domestic pillar  industries and other major industries through transfer of  property rights.    The necessity of accelerating reorganization of state-owned  assets is determined by the inappropriate contradictions between  the state-owned economy's competitiveness in the current period  and the missions it should undertake, and the circumstances  surrounding these missions.    First, after 14 years of reform, up to the beginning of this  decade, there has been a fundamental change in the traditional  Chinese economic pattern which was characterized by state  monopoly. The nonstate-owned economy developed rapidly, and  especially with a great deal of foreign capital coming in over a  wide scale. This brought competitiveness in international  markets not only to ordinary manufacturing industries, but also  to the raw materials and excavating industries. It even had this  result for the backbone industries of the domestic economy which  were originally regarded as natural monopolies, ones which  should be state monopolies, such as railways, aviation, finance,  insurance, electric power, etc. State-owned enterprises must be  highly efficient and high profitable in order to survive. If the  state-owned enterprises lack the ability to compete, not only  will they be unable to play the key role in the domestic  economy, they cannot become China's main force for joining in  the international market competition, and they will even lose  what positions they already hold in the domestic economy, and  will not demonstrate the superiority of the socialist  state-owned economy. Therefore, strengthening "commercial  battle" knowledge and "competition" knowledge should become the  principal idea in the 1990s for state-owned property rights  management in China.    Second, the practical situation of China's state-owned  economy is very unsuitable to the heavy assignments it is  undertaking and the conditions of serious competition. Looking  at the world wide picture, about one-third of the state-owned  enterprises are obviously losing money, one-third are of  potential losers, and assets operations never get themselves out  of the difficult position of low efficiency. Looking at the  industrial scale, big enterprises are not really big, small  enterprises are specialized, and there is serious competition  and regional and production separation as well. Compared with  overseas competitors, the state-owned enterprises are obviously  quite distant from being a powerful force. What is especially  deserving of attention is this kind of distance among our pillar  industries. Taking automobile manufacturing as an example, the  16 overseas automobile manufacturing enterprises which occupied  over 70 percent of the world's gross output had an average scale  of assets of $45 billion, with an average yearly output of over  2.5 million cars, while the entire fixed assets of China's  automobile industry was only 18 billion yuan (RMB). In addition,  this industry was scattered over 2,600 enterprises, among which  the fixed assets of the eight major automobile manufacturers  occupied only 30.5 percent of the entire industry. It is  forecast that by the end of the Eighth Five-year Plan, the gross  assets of these eight major enterprises will be up to 50 billion  yuan, which is still less than $10 billion. Our industry's  average assets scale is even less than the amount major overseas  enterprises invest annually in scientific and technical research  and development. Looking at the distribution of output, the  output of over 95 percent of the enterprises in our automobile  industry is less than 50,000 cars, with 80 percent of the  enterprises having an annual output of less than 10,000 cars.  Obviously, if we do not soon alter this situation of scattered  resource distribution and increase enterprises' economic power,  joining the competition in the international market will be  merely an illusion.    How to change the inappropriate situation between China's  economic competitive ability and its mission, given its  circumstances? One way is to rely on the state's investment.  This is doubtless necessary, but presents considerable  difficulties. Some concerned experts estimate that if before  2000, we can form two to three pillar enterprises in China's  automobile industry, making their output occupy over 80 percent  of the gross national output, the production capacity of each  pillar enterprise should be at least one million cars, and the  gross assets should be over $6 billion, which is about 35  billion yuan RMB, and this will be 10 times again the net assets  of the No 1 Automobile Group--the largest automobile  manufacturing enterprise group at present. Our state finances  have no way of assuming such a huge investment increase at the  present time. Another way is to rely on the enterprises  themselves, aided by the market operation system, going the way  of association and merger. This is the basic means of remolding  the state-owned assets under the market economic operation  system. But it will be a long process for the market economy  operation system to come into full play. At present, the market  economic operation system in China imperfect, so this process  will be a very long one. Another way is by using the state-owned  assets property rights controlled by the government,  reorganizing state-owned assets. This method can compensate to a  certain degree for shortcomings in financial capacity, as well  as speed up perfecting the enterprises' self-reorganization. We  believe that under the conditions of the socialist market  economy, it is not necessary that the state- owned economy must  be manifested in the industries to the same degree as state  ownership, but function chiefly as the state-owned enterprises'  competitiveness and play the lead role in the domestic economy.  Thus, we must change our thinking, conscientiously adjust the  operational scale and structure of the state-owned economy,  strengthen pillar industries and increase their competitiveness  ability, and bring the state-owned economy's leading role more  efficiently into the domestic economy.  <H3>  II. Difficult Points, Countermeasures in Reorganizing  State-Owned Assets </H3>   To reorganize state-owned assets we must smash the old  pattern of making regional and production distinctions in asset  allocation for industrial economic development, perfecting  reorganization. Because each industrial management department  undertakes a "united management" (industrial management)  function for enterprises of their entire industry and  simultaneously a "responsibility" (state-owned assets property  rights management) function for its attached enterprises, in  practice, it is usually the case that "united management" is  false, "responsibility" is genuine, as industrial plans and  policies are often difficult to implement efficiently due to  interference from the departments responsible for enterprises.  This can be regarded as the major point of difficulty in current  state-owned assets reorganization work.    How to ease the contradiction between "responsible" and  "united management" in the process of industrial management? Our  conclusion from the past 14 years' experience and lessons from  reform is that in order to reach a basic resolution of the  contradiction between "responsible" and "united management" in  the process of industrial management, to guarantee and promote  successfully the reorganization of the state-owned assets  system, we should set out to support reform from multiple  directions, including the following major six aspects:    First, accelerate establishment of a modern enterprise  system. The contradiction between "responsible" and "united  management" comes first from the undivided responsibility for  administration and enterprise activity in the state-owned assets  operational activities. The state-owned enterprises cannot  become merchandise producers and operators of enterprises which  are self operated, responsible for their own profits and losses,  self restricted, and self developing. Through defining  enterprises' property rights, establish a modern enterprises'  legal person system. Remolding state-owned enterprises by  incorporation will aid in correcting the property rights  relationships between the state and state-owned enterprises,  will achieve the separation of enterprises from administration,  will permit state-owned enterprises to become genuine  merchandise production operators and independent principal  entities in market competition, and will establish a good  foundation for resolving the contradiction between government's  "responsible" function and "united management" function.    Second, government management of industries gradually tends  to be synthesized. The finer the division of labor among  industrial management departments, the more specialized will be  their management, the more numerous will be the number of  responsible departments, and the easily will there occur the  contradiction between "responsible" and "united management." In  determining the management departments, there must be attention  to letting the scale of their management be suitably wider, so  that the number of responsible departments will be fewer; this  will help to weaken the contradiction between "responsible" and  "united management," which will be favorable to reorganizing the  state-owned assets.    Third, have different patterns for state-owned asset's  property right management for different industries. For ordinary  industries, such as food processing, beverages, etc., which are  regular daily consumption producing industries and some service  industries, the state-owned assets can by plan be gradually and  automatically withdrawn, and the contradiction between  "responsible" and "united management" will disappear with it.  For competitive domestic economy pillar industries, such as  automobile manufacturing, the oil and chemical industry, heavy  machinery, electricity, etc., we should cultivate and develop a  state-owned enterprise group which is centered on pillar  enterprises. This will more densely concentrate the state-owned  assets in that industry, as well as handling well the  relationship between "responsible" and "united management" by  making pillar enterprises the intermediary. As for domestic  economy pillar industries which are natural monopolies, e.g.,  railways, posts, electric power, etc., which have such technical  and economic characteristics as constituting a high proportion  of the state-owned economy, with large scale enterprises, single  products, little crossover between industries, etc., these can  take on the state-owned assets' property rights management  pattern of taking industrial management departments as dominant  factor.    Fourth, establish an organic combined organizational pattern  and system which will be favorable to state-owned assets  property rights management and industrial management. Looking at  the current situation, one task is to establish an  interdepartmental coordinating committee for remolding  state-owned assets, to strengthen leadership. A second is to  establish an industrial or comprehensive state-owned economy  strategic study center. This will strengthen research on  strategy and tactics for the state-owned economy to compete in  the market, and provide reference service for industrial  management departments and management of state-owned assets. A  third is to establish work relationship between the branch  organs of state-owned assets property rights management inside  industrial management departments and state-owned assets  management departments. These branch organs should also make  policy suggestions concerning the scale of state-owned assets  operations and the structural readjustment and operational  policies for the industry.    Fifth, change the concept of state-owned property rights  management, to improve the quality of managers. The  qualification of managers is the key to whether the management  system can operate regularly. However, if we do not completely  abandon the state-owned property rights management concept which  formed under the traditional system, it will be impossible to  establish a new type of state-owned property management system.  So, we must further liberate our ideas, study and grasp market  economic theory and the operating regulations for state-owned  property under the conditions of the socialist market economy.    Sixth, vigorously cultivate and develop a market for  enterprises to exchange property rights. Although state-owned  assets reorganization is a planned governmental property rights  management activity, we absolutely cannot look upon it as  identical to the "close, stop, merge, and exchange" of  enterprises under the traditional system. We should build a base  on enterprise self operation, provide appropriate intervention  and policy guidance to accelerate necessary concentration of  state-owned assets. The formation of an enterprise property  rights exchange market is a necessary condition for reorganizing  state-owned assets and propping up pillar industries and  enterprises under the market economy.</p>

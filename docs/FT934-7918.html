			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Vauxhall's joint union deal may go VAUXHALL, the motor manufacturer, is threatening to abandon its joint negotiating agreement with unions and introduce a single union deal for its 9,000 manual workers. The company is furious at the decision taken by the TGWU general union locally to start an overtime ban from today at the company's Ellesmere Port plant on Merseyside. Postal voting has not yet been completed among Vauxhall's manual workers at Luton - nor among members of the AEEU engineering and electrical union at Ellesmere Port, where the TGWU held its ballot earlier. The unions are balloting members on whether they would back industrial action against the company's two-year 'final' pay offer of 2.5 per cent this autumn with a further 3.0 per cent plus 1 per cent lump sum in September 1994. In a letter sent earlier this week to the TGWU's regional office on Merseyside, Mr Bruce Warman, Vauxhall personnel director, said that the union's unilateral action suggested that it wanted to abandon the joint union machinery. Mr Warman said: 'If it is your intention that from now on separate union groups at each of our locations will take industrial action unilaterally without any co-ordinated or formal response to Vauxhall through the joint negotiating committee, then we on the management side must seriously question the role and need for a joint negotiating committee.' He added: 'Recent actions would indicate that it is not your intention to follow joint negotiating committee procedures in future and therefore it can only be assumed that you wish this structure to be disbanded.' In response the TGWU on Merseyside has told the company that the early action at Ellesmere Port is starting with shop steward approval because of what the union calls 'unavoidable delays in collecting the information required by the ballot scrutineers' in the rest of the company which prevented co-ordination of the voting across the Vauxhall plants. Officials of other unions believe the majority of manual workers will accept the pay offer, which is in line with the rises agreed at Ford last week which appear to be winning rank-and-file support.</p>

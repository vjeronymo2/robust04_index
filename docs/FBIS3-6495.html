			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter An Song-kyu] </F>   [Text] It has been revealed that early in 1992, the final  year of Former President No Tae-u's Sixth Republic, the North  and the South made active moves to hold inter-Korean summit  talks, dispatching their emissaries--the South's director of the  Agency for National Security Planning and the North's Workers  Party of Korea [WPK] secretary--to Pyongyang and Seoul  respectively and exchanging presidential messages between them.    North Korean President Kim Il-song proposed summit talks to  former President No Tae-u in April 1992 through Yun Ki-pok, WPK  secretary in charge of southward operations, who visited Seoul  secretly. Former President No dispatched Yi Sang-yon, then  director of the Agency for National Security Planning, to  Pyongyang as his emissary around 15 April that year, and the  emissary delivered his message congratulating President Kim  Il-song on his birthday and expressing his willingness to hold  summit talks.    This was confirmed as Pak Yong-su, the North's senior  delegate to the inter-Korean working delegates' contact,  mentioned it at the sixth round of contact and confirmed by  those who had been involved in the preparation for summit talks  at that time.    The former highest-level person in authority who was  actively  involved in the inter-Korean issues at that time said: I know  that presidential emissaries made trips several times to each  other's capital, apart from the then-ongoing North-South  high-level talks, in an attempt to hold summit talks.    Another former high-ranking person in authority who had been  involved in the inter-Korean dialogue at that time also  confirmed this and said: I understand that emissaries who made  trips between the North and the South were the director of the  Agency for National Security Planning from the South side and  Yun Ki-pok, WPK secretary in charge of southward operations,  from the North side.</p>

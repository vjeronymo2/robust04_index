			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Management: The struggle to breach the Whitehall Wall - Government and industry must both play their part When Geoffrey Morgan was plucked from the ranks of the civil service as a potential high-flyer and seconded for two years to Guinness's brewing operations, his arrival at the company's reception desk set the alarm bells ringing. His induction into Guinness 20 years ago provided him with his first experience of the mutual suspicions which separate Whitehall from the world of business. 'I turned up with my official briefcase and the gate-keeper immediately alerted the staff that Customs and Excise were on the premises. The company was not up to anything but it liked to be prepared when officialdom called. I was quickly given a less formal-looking briefcase.' Though Whitehall-wise, Morgan was naive when it came to the business world and jumped at the opportunity to see it from the inside. He was astonished at the lack of paperwork and what he saw as the simplicity of the company's objectives - 'selling more beer'. By contrast, helping to run a country, he suggests, without any attempt to belittle the daily challenges confronting industry, can be quite complicated. His remarks offer an insight into the cultural differences which have long separated public service and private enterprise and which many believe could, if more effectively bridged, help improve Britain's economic performance. By spending time with Guinness, Morgan climbed over what the Public Policy Unit has just dubbed the 'Whitehall Wall' - the barrier between government and industry. According to PPU, which monitors and advises on government policy, the wall is built squarely on lack of understanding, poor explanation and invariably unhelpful attitudes. A PPU report, published by the Bow Group, the centre-right think tank, concludes that the government's outlook remains steadfastly inward. It claims that Whitehall, despite the phased introduction of private sector disciplines into its revenue-raising operations, has barely started to comprehend the needs of the enterprise culture which its recent political masters have tried to spread. Industry, on the other hand, is accused of paying scant attention to the process of policy-making and of invariably leaving responsibility for dealing with government in the hands of unsuitable employees. Companies are urged to regard the task of enlightening government about their activities as a duty and social responsibility. The system of civil service recruitment does not help. The Civil Service Selection Board, which interviews all the most promising entrants, has no brief to foster either commercial disciplines or greater empathy between government and governed. Only one in a thousand of those officials entering a Whitehall department at the first level of middle management has any working experience of a commercial environment. The PPU says that the 'bottom line' to businessmen is financial; their frustration is with officials who draft policy without fully appreciating the market consequences of their actions. Top-ranking civil servants are portrayed in the same mould as judges, almost exclusively receiving their training in a cloistered environment both technically and culturally removed from the world over which they may exercise profound influence. Lord Young, the former Trade and Industry Secretary, criticises the lack of two-way traffic: 'Where are the very best of civil servants, who leave and go into industry in their early forties, as the French do as a matter of course? How many in our great companies have the faintest idea how government really works? One or two, not more. 'We practice a doctrine of separation of experience that appears absolute. Then we wonder why it is that government has an imperfect understanding of the needs of commerce and industry.' Progress towards overcoming the ghetto mentality between public and private sectors has been more marked in other, often more vibrant, economies. In Japan, for example, large numbers of 'Amagari' - or high-flyers - are continually seconded from companies to spend up to two years in government ministries, which command a far greater status in the eyes of businessmen than is the case in Britain. In France, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration provides civil servants with contextual training intended to provide them with appropriate industrial and business skills. Critics even suggest the system has gone too far, with the development of equally critical political skills invariably neglected. Sporadic attempts in Britain to enhance co-operation and understanding between both sides have been under way since 1968. The initiative was revitalised in 1989 by Lord Young as Trade and Industry Secretary with the launch of the Bridge programme. After his spell in the brewing industry, Geoffrey Morgan is now an under-secretary in the Cabinet Office and the man primarily responsible for secondment. The British programme is essentially intended for 'rising stars' on both sides. Larger, better-resourced companies tend to dominate the programme but smaller companies are now being encouraged. While many civil servants opt to join companies, as opposed to business support organisations or financial institutions, they rarely express an interest in manufacturing businesses. Among the most popular Whitehall destinations for corporate employees are the 'economic' departments like the Treasury, DTI and Energy. In 1989, the Department of Trade and Industry, which employs 12,000 people and is charged with 'assisting the process of wealth creation', despatched 41 people to join the wealth-creators. The DTI played host to 46 businessmen. The total secondment programme during 1989 saw a total of 627 longer-term placings on both sides of the Whitehall Wall, along with another 550 short-term attachments. At the same time, 69 civil servants took up non-executive directorships with companies. A separate, 'short-stay' arrangement, operated by the Whitehall and Industry Group - a joint venture between industrialists and the Cabinet Office - enables high-calibre civil servants to spend up to three weeks with companies, participating at the highest levels of decision-making. But the strong emphasis placed on quality rather than quantity for the overall secondment programme cannot fully disguise some disappointment within government and beyond over the still-limited scale of the initiative. The Royal Institute of Public Administration, which is concerned with policy making and administration in the public sector, has joined calls for the secondment programme to be expanded and given a higher status by both sides and deplores the sort of attitude which means some companies leave the job to their community affairs or charity sections. Chris Bright, a competition lawyer with Linklaters &amp; Paines, the solicitors, recently finished a two-year spell with the Department of Trade and Industry and enthusiastically supports the initiative. 'My view of the civil service changed markedly. I got fed up being accused of working from ten o'clock until four; the reality was that I had never worked harder in my life.' Though full of admiration for the expertise and dedication of the senior civil servants with whom he worked, Bright has some kindly criticism. 'There is a tendency for people within government departments to over-focus on particular issues. They do not always get the broader picture and fail to appreciate the wider impact of the decisions they take.' Bright also believes that too many civil servants remain over-sensitive about publicly imparting information and are suspicious of any scheme which lifts the veil: 'The inbuilt perception among some public servants that the people should not know certain things is a mentality that must be addressed and overcome.' Susan Gardiner left Customs and Excise to spend two years with P&amp;0 Containers and says the experience broadened her entire approach to decision-making. She says she is 'far more willing to be optimistic' about resolving problems. She does not believe, however, that the ethos of private sector management can necessarily be transferred into the civil service, where a wider, political perspective is necessary. Gardiner would like to see the secondment programme extended but says industry, too, has to be willing to participate. Businesses might not, she suggests, always demonstrate the sort of broader, long-term view such a commitment demands. Given a civil service more than half a million strong, the Cabinet Office hopes the current rate of secondments can be stepped up. In the meantime, one of its biggest challenges is to find companies prepared to take Inland Revenue staff; the quest for mutual understanding does, apparently, have some boundaries.</p>

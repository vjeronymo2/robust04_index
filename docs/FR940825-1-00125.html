			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 107(d)(3) of the CAA EPA would notify eligible Indian Tribes that EPA has information indicating that an air quality designation for an Indian Reservation should be revised. Then, as with the Governor of an affected State, the relevant Tribal leader would have 120 days to reply to EPA. In addition, eligible Indian Tribes would on their own initiative have authority to submit a redesignation request to EPA for approval in the same way that States and the relevant Governors are authorized to under section 107(d)(3)(D) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to add explicit definitions of Indian Reservation, Indian Tribe and State to 40 CFR Part 81. EPA is also proposing revisions to subpart C of Part 81 to reflect the authority that eligible Indian Tribes may have to initiate revisions to designations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future air quality designations for eligible Tribes will be codified under an entry for the affected Indian Tribe in subpart C, Part 81 that is the same as State air quality designations under Part 81.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Federal Financial Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Sources of Funding Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Financial assistance for Indian Tribes under the Clean Air Act is available via two principal authorities: grants for the support of air pollution planning and control programs under section 105 (42 U.S.C. 7405); and grants for investigations, demonstrations and studies into the causes, effects, extent, prevention and control of air pollution under section 103 (42 U.S.C. 7403).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these potential sources of funds under the Clean Air Act, EPA can provide Tribes funding assistance for air quality work under the Agency's Indian Environmental General Assistance Grants Program (40 CFR part 35, subpart Q). These grants provide funds to Tribes for planning, developing and establishing the capacity to implement environmental programs on Indian lands, regardless of the program's environmental media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of these assistance and fee programs carries various statutory and/or administrative requirements which are discussed and explained in this portion of the preamble. Proposed regulatory revisions are set out at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Tribal Eligibility for Air Grant Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's action, EPA is proposing to modify certain regulatory and administrative limitations on the manner in which Indian Tribes qualify for and obtain financial assistance under the Act. EPA also seeks comment from interested parties on options in meeting the non-Federal matching requirements for grants obtained under section 105 authority. The financial assistance options are described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 103 Air Assessment Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tribes may apply for grant assistance to assess reservation air quality conditions under authority of section 103(b)(3) of the Act. Section 103(b)(3) allows EPA to fund investigations, research, surveys, and studies concerning any specific problem of air pollution in cooperation with any air pollution control agency. Tribes may undertake specific projects to assess Tribal air quality conditions at any time. Typically, Tribes will undertake such projects as an initial step, prior to initiating development and adoption of Tribal regulations to control air resources. Section 103(b)(3) grant funds are not available for developing Tribal capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds provided under section 103 are available to Tribes at up to a 95% Federal share. Thus each recipient must contribute at least five percent of the total allowable project costs. The Agency believes that the five percent cost sharing requirement should be retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA rules limit award of section 103 grants to a maximum of five years for any one project period. 40 CFR 40.125&hyph;1. This should allow a reasonable amount of time for Tribal recipients of assistance to assess the nature of their air quality and determine the extent of any air quality problems. However, the Agency will carefully consider requests for deviations under 40 CFR 31.6 for extensions of grant project periods. Further, section 103 is available for multiple project periods. Finally, Tribes that have received previous section 103 grants will remain eligible for future grants to fund appropriate projects at any time. The determination of each Tribal applicant's continued eligibility and the appropriate authority of award will be the responsibility of the appropriate Regional Administrator. As this suggests, Tribes not establishing eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States under section 301(d) will remain eligible, as they are currently, for assistance under section 103(b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 105 Air Program Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency encourages eligible Tribes to apply for continuing environmental assistance under authority of section 105 and 301(d) of the Act, particularly after a comprehensive assessment of reservation air quality conditions. Section 105 allows EPA to make grants for implementing programs for the prevention and control of air pollution or implementation of air quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

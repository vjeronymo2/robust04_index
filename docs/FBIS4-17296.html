			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report "based on data from the Department for </F> Price Analysis and Forecasting of the Economic Conditions Center  Under the Russian Federation Government": "5-12 April: The  Week's Prices. Train Tickets, and Everything Else Along With  Them, Become More Expensive"]    [Text] The overall index of inflation for the week was  102.7 percent, and since the beginning of the year it has  increased 50 percent. From 5 through 12 April the inflation  rate was 2.7 percent.    The increase in charges for paid consumer services continued  to considerably outstrip price increases for food products and  industrial goods. Food and nonfood product prices went up 1.2  and 2.4 percent respectively. On the whole paid consumer  services, mainly because of a twofold increase in the cost of  railroad travel, became 18.4 percent more expensive.    The biggest increase in prices for goods and services was  noted in the cities of the Urals, East Siberia, and the Far  East. They changed least of all in the Northwest and  Volga-Vyatka Economic Regions.    Food prices increased without any particular surges --  slowly  but surely. Vegetables prices went up 5.1 percent and fruit  prices went up 4.3 percent, which was not to the same extent as  before but still more than other things. The price of salt  continued to increase -- by 4.1 percent. Hulled and pasta  product prices went up 2.7 percent, bread and flour product  prices went up 2.3 percent, and the price of flour went up 2.1  percent. Prices for dairy and fish products, butter and  vegetable oil, eggs, and sugar changed by less than 1 percent  during the week. Vodka became 1.6 percent cheaper than a week  ago. The biggest price increases were for food products in the  Volga (2.3 percent) and North Caucasus (2.2 percent) regions.  In the North Caucasus region the biggest increases were for  fruit and vegetable produce -- 12-14 percent -- and bread and  flour products -- 3 percent. In the Volga region fruit prices  went up by 11 percent and prices for dairy products and butter  went up 5-8 percent.    As of 12 April the average cost of the basket of the 19 most  important food products was 46,000 rubles [R] calculated on a  monthly basis, an increase of 1.1 percent during the week and 50  percent since the beginning of the year. This basket cost  R44,400 at official trade prices and R57,500 at unofficial trade  prices. The Far East Economic Region is still the most expensive  in terms of the basket's cost -- R80,900. The Central Chernozem  Economic Region has been the cheapest for two and a half months  at R35,200. On 12 April the basket cost R50,000 in Moscow and  R49,700 in St. Petersburg. Moscow is in 33d place and St.  Petersburg is in 36th place in terms of high prices in the list  of cities being monitored.    Industrial goods went up in price more than food products.  Prices for certain types of fuel and medicine continued to  increase -- by 8-10 percent during the week. The average price  increase for wallpaper was 4 percent and that for knitted  articles, synthetic detergents, and matches was 3 percent.  Prices for tobacco products and cultural and domestic goods  went up 1 percent. Besides fuel, in the past week knitted and  sewn articles have become considerably more expensive in the Far  East region. At 3.6 percent the increase in prices for  industrial goods in the Central Chernozem region was higher than  the average Russian increase.    For a long time now there has been a large gap between the  maximum and minimum prices for identical goods in various  Russian cities. Thus, since the beginning of the year there has  been a fivefold to sixfold difference in footwear prices, a  fivefold difference in tobacco product prices, and a threefold  to fourfold difference in television prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] New Democracy [NYD], the noisy opposition party  in the Swedish parliament, has dismissed its leadership of less  than two months. The dismissed leadership does not accept the  decision, hence there are two competing heads and two party  boards. At this rate, NYD will drop out of parliament in this  fall's elections, Timo Seppaenen reports.    [Seppaenen] Harriet Colliander is a name that will go down  in Sweden's political history. Colliander will ensure the  inclusion of her name in records as her country's shortest-lived  party leader. Less than two months ago, she was elected  chairwoman of New Democracy. Yesterday, an extraordinary party  congress dismissed her from her post, together with the entire  party board. During Colliander's short term of office, NYD's  parliamentary group was entirely split. The process of firing  the party chairwoman was started by a farce in the voting in  parliament on subsidies for home care, in which the party group  was split three ways.    Because of its internal wrangling, New Democracy has lost  its  excellent position in Swedish politics. The party is no longer  able to swing the government despite its position of holding the  balance, which it gained in the elections. [passage omitted]    The party chairwoman, dismissed yesterday, and the party  board do not regard the decision by the extraordinary party  congress as legal and will not give up their posts. The newly  elected leaders admit that they will stay in their posts for a  couple of weeks on a temporary basis. In that period, the  party's 3,000 or so members will have to vote on whether they  support the new leadership. [passage omitted]    There is some basis for NYD remaining in parliament.  Vivianne  Franzen, who has been elected new chairwoman, is a skillful  demagogue. She is seeking votes by expressing anti-immigrant  views, scaring the Swedes with the growing influence of Muslims.  Franzen's chances are also boosted by the fact that she is  supported by Ian Wachtmeister and Bert Karlsson, NYD's two  charismatic founders. [passage omitted]</p>

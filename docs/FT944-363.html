			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope still trying to avoid receivers Stanhope, the property developer headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, yesterday resumed its efforts to avoid receivership six days after its banks decided not to renew its credit facilities. Last Thursday 16 banks, led by Barclays, voted not to extend further credit and asked for repayment of loans totalling about Pounds 148m. Sources close to the company admitted yesterday that Stanhope had been in limbo since its bank facility expired, but said the company would not call in the receivers while it thought a deal could be struck with the banks. Rescue proposals from British Land, the property investment company, and from PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund, were rejected by the banks last week. However, Stanhope resumed talks with British Land last Friday in an attempt to find a solution.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names win freeze on cash call A GROUP of Lloyd's Names yesterday won a partial victory in their attempts to prevent the insurance market's authorities drawing on their deposits to meet the terms of cash calls. Lloyd's says the money is needed to pay insurance claims. But following talks between solicitors representing the Names, agents and Lloyd's, a High Court judge agreed to freeze the eight Names' funds until a full court hearing takes place. This is expected in March or April. The Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting on the market - claim that the terms of their agreements with agents have been breached by the cash calls, which they allege are technically flawed and legally improper. They had issued motions seeking injunctions against Lloyd's to prevent the insurance market drawing from the deposits that all Names must lodge with their agents when they join Lloyd's. Hearings on the injunctions had been expected next week but the case was complicated by the decision of Lloyd's itself to apply to join the litigation as a defendant. It is determined to resist the injunctions and said yesterday that it would fight 'inch by inch and uphill if necessary'. The eight are part of a group of more than 600 Names taking action. According to Mr Michael Freeman, their solicitor, other Names who are now simply providing financial backing for what were intended to be test cases are likely to issue their own separate motions seeking injunctions. The Names were members of loss-making catastrophe reinsurance syndicates which suffered losses of more than Pounds 500m between 1988 and 1990.</p>

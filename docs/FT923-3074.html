			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn reduces Gola sportswear interest PORTER CHADBURN is selling Gola Footwear, which has been blamed for Porter's poor profit performance since April 1991. It is being bought by William Lamb (Holdings) one of the companies from which Gola was purchased in September 1990. Porter will retain the Gola brand name giving Lamb an initial four-year licence. The consideration, receivable in cash as the stock is sold with a cut-off date of September 1993, is expected to total Pounds 2m. The licence carries a 3 per cent royalty fee with a minimum Pounds 650,000 over the four years. Lamb has the option to acquire the brand for Pounds 1.35m cash at any time during the term. Porter can require Lamb to buy the brand for Pounds 800,000 if the option has not been exercised by the fourth anniversary of completion. Porter is withdrawing from the other Gola businesses. Directors expect that an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.6m will be needed. However, as Pounds 3.3m relates to goodwill written off to reserves at the time of the acquisition the net effect would be to reduce reserves by about Pounds 2.8m. The company said that since April last year Gola Group had incurred losses, substantial in relation to its size and to that of Porter Chadburn.</p>

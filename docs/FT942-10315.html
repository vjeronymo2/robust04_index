			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Observer: Liberal aid Nazmu Virani, the convicted Asian property entrepreneur and former boss of pubs-to-property group Control Securities, has been calling in his IOUs from the Liberal party. Sir David Steel and his successor as Liberal party leader Paddy Ashdown were among those submitting character references for Virani. The Ugandan Asian was a familiar figure on the Liberal party circuit, although he never joined the party. Sir David's office said Virani was 'kind, considerate and helpful'. Just how helpful Sir David has been will emerge when Virani is sentenced today.</p>

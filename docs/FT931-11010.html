			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: European majors reflect squeeze on oil margins - - Weak share prices LOW OIL prices, and the economic recession in much of Europe, have hit the profit margins of leading European oil companies. Share prices for many companies have been languishing. The weak financial position of some European majors has been exacerbated by chronic overcapacity in refining and marketing, as well as petrochemicals. Profit margins at European oil refineries dropped late last year to as low as Dollars 2.30 per barrel. This means that no companies are making money from their refining operations, since margins would have to be above Dollars 3 a barrel for them to do so. OMV, the Austrian oil company, has warned that it will report a loss of Sch300m for last year and be forced to cut its dividend. Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group saw profits fall by 36 per cent last year, causing it to announce cutbacks in investment. Petrofina, the Belgian group, has already said that it will halve its dividend after a sharp drop in profits. The company is due to report its results in the next couple of days. Total, the French oil company, is also expected to report a drop in profits next week. 'The companies realise that there is little chance of a recovery this year and maybe not even next year, but I'm not sure investors have realised that yet,' says Mr Alan Marshall, associate director of equities research at Swiss Bank. 'There are too many deep-seated problems in the industry for there to be a quick recovery.' Mr Marshall points to severe overcapacity in European refining, as well as a proliferation of service stations which has kept margins in the business extremely low. 'The business is just at the worst point in the cycle - profit margins are entirely dependent on demand since no-one is losing enough money actually to close any capacity down.' European demand has been depressed by economic recession in many countries. The International Energy Agency, the west's oil monitoring body, points out in its latest monthly oil report that European oil demand declined by 2.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year. First quarter demand this year is expected to be 14m barrels a day (b/d) - unchanged from the same period last year when it was also low. European oil companies are suffering in a similar way to their counterparts overseas from low oil prices and the downturn in demand. But some companies are managing to weather the storm better than others. The Spanish oil group, Repsol, has maintained earnings during a difficult period chiefly because of its strong position in the Spanish energy market. The company's debt to equity ratio is expected to have risen at the end of last year from 3 per cent to 23 per cent, but this still leaves it with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Repsol's financial strength is reflected in its share price performance. The shares showed a sharp drop when the peseta was devalued last September, but since then the price has recovered. Smith New Court, the London brokerage house, says that the problems being encountered by other oil companies such as British Petroleum, Elf, Total and Petrofina has led to a certain amount of switching by investors into Repsol. Many European oil companies are looking to eastern Europe. OMV, in particular, aims to build up a network of service stations in central Europe which will take the cleaner products provided by its Austrian refineries. Elf has bought into the East German refining market where it could use plant for processing oil it may discover in its exploration acreage in Kazakhstan. However, Mr Marshall points to the risks in these strategies and stresses that investment in eastern Europe is not likely to pay dividends in the short term. An additional problem looming for European refiners will be the renewed emphasis on environmental regulations in Europe which is likely to prompt the EC Commission to introduce tough new standards for refineries in the same way as the US has done. The estimated cost of bringing refineries up to new environmental standards in the US has been put at over Dollars 14bn for the industry. It could prove almost as costly in Europe.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> WHEN COUPLES WRITE A PACT FOR PARTING;  </P> <P> CONSUMERS: KNOWING THE FACTS ABOUT PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS CAN HELP COUPLES AVOID  UNNECESSARY FRICTION.  </P> <P> For better, for worse. For richer, for poorer . . . 'til the prenuptial pact do  us part.  </P> <P>  That may well be the official marriage vow of the 1990s. Just ask Donald and  Ivana Trump, who last week announced their plans to divorce -- and to duke it  out over an amended prenuptial agreement that has him gloating and her  steaming.  </P> <P> The Trumps are not alone. Other notables who were at loggerheads over such  agreements last year included:  </P> <P> * Convicted hotelier Leona Helmsley, who at one point was accused of violating  the terms of her prenuptial agreement by trying to gain control of her  husband's estate.  </P> <P> * Actor William Hurt, whose former live-in lover unsuccessfully alleged that  they had entered into a prenuptial agreement.  </P> <P> * And Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, who unsuccessfully contested  his prenuptial agreement during divorce proceedings.  </P> <P> On a less controversial note, Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and Kimberly Conrad  signed an agreement before they strutted down the aisle. And designer Mary  McFadden, 51, married 22-year-old Kohle Yohannan sans a prenuptial agreement,  although the couple reportedly vowed that a 20-pound weight gain would be  grounds for divorce. Several months later, their marriage was over.  </P> <P> Might a prenuptial agreement have affected McFadden's assets? Will Trump's  protect his?  </P> <P> The answers rest in the terminology of the agreement, the circumstances  surrounding its signing and the laws of the particular state. As a general  rule, a prenuptial (sometimes called "premarital" or "antenuptial") agreement  is a binding contract unless the person contesting it can prove that it is  legally defective.  </P> <P> "In general, judges like to see people living with the consequences of their  own decisions," said Commissioner Robert Schnider, who presides on the family  law bench in Los Angeles County Superior Court and who teaches a course in  family law and marital property at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "There is  an ethos in our society that people ought to be responsible for themselves and  their decisions. If a party had an agreement presented to him, it was up to him  to say no and not sign it."  </P> <P> Often, Schnider said, the decision to marry involves a weighing process.  "Frequently, it's a woman without assets marrying a man with substantial  assets. He's promising her a nice life if things work out. It's going to be a  big change for her, a big step up. Now he's making demands on her to protect  himself or to protect his children from a previous marriage. She has to decide:  'Is it worth it taking a chance, going for this and giving up my rights, or  should I just say no?' "  </P> <P> A woman faced with that situation can turn it into a benefit, suggests Stuart  Walzer, a partner with the family law firm of Walzer &amp; Gabrielson in  Century City.  </P> <P> Walzer, recently deemed "one of the deans of family law" in California Lawyer  magazine, said: "When a young woman in that situation comes to me and says, 'My  fiance gave me this agreement and I want to sign it,' I say, 'No, you've got  some bargaining power and you should use it.' The man wants her. She's never  really going to be quite in the same position again."  </P> <P> Schnider said court battles over prenuptial agreements are uncommon. In his 8  1/2 years on the bench, he has presided at trials involving contested  agreements "on the average, about one per year."  </P> <P> The most common ground for contesting a prenuptial agreement is duress, said  Schnider, who typifies it as: "Shortly before the wedding, your fiance puts a  piece of paper in front of you and says, 'Sign this or I won't marry you.' It's  the emotional pressure put on by having the invitations out, the gifts in, the  guests coming, and having to embarrass yourself in front of all your friends by  saying 'It didn't work out.' "  </P> <P> But duress, like any legal concept, is open to interpretation. Daniel Jaffe, of  the elite Beverly Hills family law firm Jaffe &amp; Clemens, settled this case  last week:  </P> <P> Twenty-one years ago his wealthy client lived with a woman for five years. He  insisted they would never marry and often pointed to a laminated check on the  wall (his payment to a former wife), mounted above a sign bearing the word  Think. When his live-in partner developed a serious illness, he offered to  marry her -- as long as she signed a prenuptial agreement. She did so, against  her attorney's advice. "Every time (guests visited), the man would wave the  agreement around, saying, 'This is the best thing God and lawyers ever  created,' " Jaffe said.  </P> <P> Now entangled in a divorce, the wife claims the agreement is invalid because  she signed it under duress. "If 'I won't marry you without a prenuptial  agreement' is duress, then there are no (prenuptial) agreements that are any  good," Jaffe said. But rather than run the risk of trial, the man gave his ex  more money than the agreement provided.  </P> <P> In the Trump case, there are similar concerns, Walzer said, adding that what  Ivana Trump's lawyer is contending "is that Mr. Trump is so rich that he ought  to give her more than what the agreement provides. But that would make all  prenuptial or postnuptial agreements meaningless, absolutely meaningless."  </P> <P> If couples won't honor prenuptial agreements, what's the point in having them?  Said Schnider: "Probably 50% of these agreements aren't challenged. Of those  that are challenged, 60% or more are upheld. So over three-quarters of them are  doing the job they were supposed to do."  </P> <P> In prenuptial agreements he drafts, Jaffe often includes an incentive to abide  by them: a clause stating that if a spouse contests the agreement and loses, he  gets nothing.  </P> <P> But it often doesn't get that far. Many people who consult lawyers about  prenuptial agreements never end up going through with them. Schnider, who  practiced family law for 11 years before becoming a judge, said he "spent more  time talking about (prenuptial) agreements than drafting them."  </P> <P> Why do people get cold feet about prenuptial agreements? "It's just not what  people are thinking about when they're getting married," he said. "Even if a  person has been married previously, he tends to be thinking, 'I made a big  mistake before, but this time I've finally found the right person. I'm doing  the right thing.' So if I'm getting an (prenuptial) agreement, does that mean  I'm doing the wrong thing? Maybe I shouldn't be getting married."  </P> <P> Negotiations over prenuptial agreements can raise havoc with partners'  emotions. "Ice water on romance" -- that's how Walzer characterized the  agreements.  </P> <P> The document can, he added, chill a romance, because it sets a pattern for  endless renegotiations. In a long agreement, such as a 55-page document he  recently drafted, Walzer said, "it can get to the point where the couple is  reading (the agreement) all night to determine whether they're going to go out  to lunch together the next day. Marriage just isn't susceptible to a lot of  lawyering -- it's too intimate a relationship."  </P> <P> His son, Peter Walzer -- also a family law specialist with his own practice in  Century City -- agreed. The younger Walzer, president of the Century City Bar  Assn.'s family law section and treasurer of the Assn. of Certified Family Law  Specialists, said such agreements can be "very difficult for newlyweds. . . .  Basically one spouse is saying, 'Do you trust me?' and the other is saying,  'No, I don't.' "  </P> <P> Peter Walzer said he usually tries to arrange so couples marry without an  agreement because "there always seems to be mistrust after that, and it's a  difficult way to start a marriage." Were Walzer in that position, would he sign  a prenuptial agreement? "No, I don't think I would."  </P> <P> Although prenuptial agreements have long been a part of life for the rich and  famous, Stuart Walzer said they are not always necessary, even in a  community-property state like California. Through prudent financial planning, a  person may be able to keep assets as separate property without a prenuptial  agreement.  </P> <P> For example, he said, consider a man who inherited large family investments and  lives off the passive income from them but does not manage them. "Even if the  husband gets $1 million a year income from it, after a 10-year marriage the  wife may have accumulated nothing because it is not community property," Walzer  said.  </P> <P> In that context, the wife would want a prenuptial agreement. "If she is  marrying a very wealthy man, she may want to carve something out for herself.  Her feeling may be, 'I'm putting aside opportunities for other marriages,  opportunities to advance my own career. I should be compensated for that,' "  Walzer said, adding, "You hear young women sometimes saying, 'I'd never have a  prenuptial agreement; I'm so offended by the thought.' A mistake.  </P> <P> "If she marries a high-roller, do-nothing kind of person who lives off his  passive investments, she may end up with nothing except alimony at the end of a  long marriage," he said.  </P> <P> Who else would benefit from a prenuptial agreement? An enormously successful  business person like Donald Trump, who has acquired a "trophy wife" -- a  beautiful, glamorous partner to enhance his public image -- would want an  agreement "very badly," Walzer said. Because Donald Trump's efforts directly  contribute to the increase in his business profits, under California law his  wife could have a community property claim to part of those profits.  </P> <P> What about the less-moneyed? "Most people should think long and hard before  they decide to have a prenuptial agreement. In a first marriage, for a young  couple just starting out together, it's insanity. They're going to try to build  a life together based on mutual sharing and trust. They have to learn to deal  with each other as best they can. If they can't make it, they can't make it,"  Walzer said.  </P> <P> "Even in relationships where there is a substantial disparity of money and  power, I still wonder whether it isn't an undue burden on the marriage" to have  a premarital agreement, he said. "It's important to be very careful of whom you  marry and get to know them as well as you can. But to say that the agreement is  going to solve the kind of problems that arise after marriage, I just don't  think so."  </P> <P> Couples who negotiate a prenuptial agreement must realize they are "negotiating  the divorce in advance of the marriage," Walzer said. "A lot of people don't  want to face that."  </P> <P> Jaffe likens a prenuptial agreement to a scalpel -- "in the hands of a skilled  surgeon, it's a wonderful instrument. In the hands of a butcher, it can chop  somebody up."  </P> <P> An agreement that virtually shuts one spouse out, Jaffe said, always gives that  partner the feeling he's not really part of a marriage. "Some wives have told  me that their premarital agreement has been the bane of their existence every  day of their marriage. Every day they hear 'This is my house, that is my  painting on the wall.' "  </P> <P> When the couple tires of living that way -- or when one spouse wants to change  the rules -- the marriage ends, he said, "because that's who he bought -- he  bought her, just like he bought the painting. And when she decides she wants to  stand up and be a participant in the marriage, he says, 'You're changing our  deal, this isn't what I bought. . . . I don't want to share and I'm not about  to start now.' "  </P> <P> And if the emotional costs aren't high enough, the financial considerations may  make a couple pause at pursuing a premarital agreement. Legal fees for such  agreements vary widely, depending upon their complexity and length and the  lawyer's expertise. Highly experienced family law specialists, such as Jaffe,  often charge a minimum of $7,500, even if evaluating an agreement drafted by  the other spouse's counsel. General practitioners or younger lawyers may charge  much less, often in the $2,000 range for a fairly simple agreement.  </P> <P> Judy Warren, an attorney with Cummins &amp; White in Los Angeles, drafts  prenuptial and postnuptial agreements as part of her estate-planning practice.  Her fee is lower than that of a family law specialist, depending largely on the  extent of the property involved and how much research she has to do. "If you  have a good accountant who can provide an up-to-date financial statement, then  the lawyer's fee will be considerably less because some of the work has been  done," Warren said.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, she drafted what she terms a "fairly typical" 16-page prenuptial  agreement. Another client brought in a one-page agreement for her to evaluate,  but she said it is probably unenforceable.  </P> <P> "It takes a lot of paper to set forth each person's rights, what they're giving  up, what property is involved," Warren said. "Without all that, the agreement  isn't worth the paper it's written on."  </P></p>

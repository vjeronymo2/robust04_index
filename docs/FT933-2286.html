			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Manchester aims to win even in defeat: The race for the 2000 Olympic Games will be decided on Thursday / A look at the prizes to be won MANCHESTER IS going to celebrate even if it loses on Thursday. Unlike its bid for the 1996 Olympic Games - when there was little to show for its efforts afterwards - the campaign for the 2000 games will leave a tangible legacy. Mr Tim Johnson, a KPMG Peat Marwick accountant in Liverpool who has led the economic analysis of the bid, said Pounds 200m of expenditure, supporting 480 jobs, had already been created by the bid alone. More than Pounds 70m had come from the government. Most of the money is for two big capital projects and environmental improvements which are well under way. A velodrome on the main Olympic site in Manchester's Eastlands will give Britain its first international-standard indoor cycling stadium. This will become the national cycling centre and the sport's training and administrative headquarters. The other big facility is a Pounds 49m indoor arena which is spearheading redevelopment of a bleak area around Victoria Station. The project will extend and enhance the city centre. A 20-year contract to run the arena from its opening in 1995 was given in June to Ogden Entertainment Services, the US leisure management specialist, which will use it as its European flagship. Ogden sees it as a principal international venue for gymnastics, ice skating, ice hockey, concerts, conferences and a range of entertainments. Having these buildings under construction has been crucial to convincing visiting International Olympic Committee members of the seriousness of Britain's bid for the games. The projects would be mere pump primers should Manchester win on Thursday. Mr Johnson's team calculates that the games would bring Pounds 4.1bn of extra spending power into the north-west region, creating 11,145 jobs. Manchester would have to build a main stadium and a second, smaller arena to go with the velodrome and city centre arena. Liverpool, which would stage the boxing, would build an arena next to the Albert Dock on the waterfront. Swimming facilities would be built in Wigan. The Olympic village would be needed anyway. Greater Manchester has four universities, a postgraduate business school, a conservatoire and many other colleges. After the games the village would ease chronic accommodation problems for students. One bonus for Manchester is that its telecommunications and road, rail and air transport infrastructure is already largely in place. It would not require the scale of investment seen in Barcelona - about half the Dollars 6.7bn Spain spent was put into capital projects. Manchester's direct capital budget would be about Pounds 1.5bn. This is about the same as the aggregate investment by the north-west's manufacturing sector in a non-recession year. The bidders believe the most long-lasting returns would come from inward and more general investment retained in the region. Mr Johnson believes an extra Pounds 400m of tax revenues would be generated overall.</p>

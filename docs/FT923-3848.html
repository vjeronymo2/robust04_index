			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Greater accountability for regulators urged THE TUC made its first serious contribution to the national debate on the regulation of utilities yesterday by calling for greater accountability for the regulators and less favouritism for business customers. Moving a motion on the regulation of public-service industries, Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the NCU communications union, said: 'For too long we have ignored the role that regulators have to play. We've seen them as agents of the Tory government, instead of realising that they could just as easily work for the country as a whole.' The call is a response to the government's sale of about 25 per cent of British Telecom shares last year which ruled out the prospect of a return to state control of the company under any future Labour government. Hitherto, the possibility of renationalisation has prevented the NCU from entering the regulation debate. The motion urges new responsibilities for the regulators which would protect the needs of all regions of the country, promote training and research and ensure that both business and individual customers benefit from new technology. Mr Young criticised bodies such as Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, for focusing on promoting maximum competition in public-service industries and ignoring the national public interest. He said that BT had reduced prices for business after privatisation, but that average domestic bills had fallen very little. The NCU also believes regulators should be made more accountable, through more open decision-making and effective scrutiny by parliamentary select committees.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Channel tunnellers aim for alpine projects British companies which built the Channel tunnel will today meet the Swiss transport minister in a bid to win a share of vast tunnelling projects planned through the Alps. The Swiss, who last month voted in a referendum to ban transit lorries through the Alps from 2004, plan to invest about SFr60bn (Pounds 28bn) in public transport projects over the next 15 years. A presentation to the minister, Mr Adolf Ogi, and senior Swiss transport officials has been arranged in London by Mr Richard Needham, British trade minister. He wants UK companies to take advantage of the successful construction of the Channel tunnel to capture work on large transport projects overseas. The presentation will be led by Mr Haro Bedelian, chief executive of Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French consortium which built the tunnel. Mr Bedelian will represent the five British members of Transmanche Link: Balfour Beatty, Costain, Tarmac, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey. Mr Ogi will later meet British executives of Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, to discuss the problems of privately financing and managing large construction projects. At the heart of the Swiss government proposals are plans to expand trans-Alpine rail capacity to ease the strain on roads crowded with lorries passing through the country to other destinations. The project, known as Neat (new alpine transversal tunnel), would involve two low-altitude rail tunnels through the Alps allowing trains to pass through them at high speed. One 57km tunnel under the St Gotthard Pass would be the world's longest rail tunnel. Another 30km tunnel would run under the Lotschberg between the Berne and Valais cantons. A cost of SFr14.9bn for the Neat project was approved in a referendum in 1992, although the final price is widely expected to be at least double that figure. Test borings have begun and the first tenders for large-scale exploratory work were published last August. A few British companies are believed to have prequalified to bid for the work and contracts are due to be awarded late in the spring. The scale of the project means that Swiss companies, which are likely to dominate management and construction, will need to sub-contract some of the work to foreign companies. British groups have been advised that they should join consortia led by Swiss companies.</p>

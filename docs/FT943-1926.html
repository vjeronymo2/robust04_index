			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / US and EU remain split on OECD chief The process of filling the job of secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development began as a routine, humdrum affair. But a transatlantic tussle for the top job at the Paris-based OECD is rapidly becoming the cause of new economic policy tensions between European Union countries and the US. The race between Mr Jean-Claude Paye, a French civil servant who has held the post for 10 years, and Mr Donald Johnston, the former Canadian minister who is his main challenger, has resulted in deadlock. Although the OECD exists as a forum for international understanding, ambassadors of the 25 member states failed on Tuesday for the second time in six days to reach consensus on a candidate. The ambassadors have postponed further consideration until September 28, when they meet informally. The OECD council, the organisation's decision-making body, is due to consider the succession on September 29, the day before Mr Paye's contract expires. According to diplomats following the tussle, Mr Paye, who is supported by most EU countries, now has a small overall majority in the 25 member organisation. Mr Johnston, who three months ago was the front-runner, is thought to have fewer than 10 countries supporting him. Under the OECD system of decisions by consensus, Mr Paye's present backing could normally be expected to cause a shift of support in his favour by the deadline. But the US, its officials confirmed yesterday, has no intention of budging in its determination to veto a third five-year term for Mr Paye. Some European diplomats are furious. The US stance, they say, threatens to undermine the whole system of decision-making by consensus in the OECD. They claim that the US has not provided any clear reason for opposing the man who is now supported by a majority of OECD members and stress that there is nothing in the rules of the organisation to prevent Mr Paye seeking a third term. Supporters of the US, however, say that the Clinton administration made clear over a year ago that Mr Paye would not be acceptable to Washington and that the Europeans should have produced a more suitable candidate. Officials backing Mr Johnston say that the countries opposing the Canadian contribute only 40 per cent to the OECD's budget. They also say that France has put very heavy pressure on smaller European countries and the EU states to support Mr Paye. The US wants Mr Johnston to give the OECD a higher profile and direct the organisation to serve the Group of Seven leading industrial countries which do not have a secretariat of their own. The deadlock means that the issue will now be taken up in national capitals. It is possible that member governments will now start looking at other compromise candidates for the post. For this reason, Britain is keeping the name of Lord Lawson in play as a candidate even though the UK ambassador abstained at Tuesday's meeting. A week ago, Lord Lawson was supported by one solitary British vote. If the OECD council is deadlocked at the end of this month, one of the OECD's three deputy secretary-generals may be asked to administer the organisation on a temporary basis. Ambassadors discussed this possibility on Tuesday. It is thought that the choice would be between Mr Robert Cornell, a US citizen, or Mr Pierre Vinde, a Swede. Mr Matoko Taniguchi, a Japanese, is thought not to be in the running as acting secretary-general.</p>

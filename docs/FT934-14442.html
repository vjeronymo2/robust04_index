			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fails to consolidate morning gains Wall Street AFTER POSTING strong early gains on higher bond prices and good inflation news, US stocks lost ground during the afternoon amid expirations-related selling to end a busy session only slightly firmer, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.10 at 3,629.76, below its high for the day of 3,642.30. Other indices set new record highs for the second straight day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.67 at 469.50, the Amex composite up 1.58 at 483.23, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.02 at 787.43. Trading volume on the NYSE was 360m shares. Following Thursday's good news on producer prices, which rose only 0.2 per cent in September, it was the turn yesterday of the consumer prices data to cheer up bond and stock markets. The labor department reported that its consumer prices index was unchanged last month, and that 'core' consumer prices (excluding the volatile food and energy components) rose by only 0.1 per cent. Both sets of data pleased fixed-income investors, and lifted bond prices sharply. The benchmark 30-year issue rose almost a full point, lowering the yield to 5.781 per cent. The good news on inflation, and the subsequent decline in bond yields, lifted stock prices in turn. Some positive quarterly earnings reports from leading companies also helped prices and sentiment. Prices slipped back in the mid-afternoon, however, on selling related to the monthly expiration of derivatives contracts, before recovering slightly at the end. Among individual stocks, technology issues were in demand. Texas Instruments, which has been moving up and down lately in line with the fluctuating fortunes of the semiconductor stocks, jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 65 3/4 after the company announced a big improvement in third quarter earnings to Dollars 146m. Also higher in the sector were IBM, up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 44 5/8 , Hewlett-Packard, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 70 1/8 , and Motorola, Dollars 1 5/8 firmer at Dollars 106. Kellogg jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 56 after the foods group unveiled quarterly profits of Dollars 209m, up from Dollars 199.7m a year earlier and above analysts' forecasts. Navistar International was the NYSE's most heavily traded stock, rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 in volume of 8m shares after the truck and diesel engine manufacturing company issued 22m new shares of its common stock at Dollars 21 7/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer climbed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4 in volume of 8.5m shares after the company announced a fiscal fourth quarter profit of 2 cents a share and said Mr John Sculley, its long-time chairman, was resigning. Mr Sculley's departure had been expected. Canada A WAVE of positive sentiment swept Toronto stocks to a sharply higher close and pushed the TSE-300 index to a record level. It closed 37.62 points up at 4,182.58 in turnover of 60.7m shares valued at CDollars 765m. Earlier it hadreached 4,183.82, breaching Thursday's intraday record high. Toronto's key index rose 2.8 percent in four days.</p>

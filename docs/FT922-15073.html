			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown warns against minority government MODERATE Conservative and Labour voters should deny both Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock the opportunity to form a minority government after the election, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said last night. He told a rally in Eastbourne, East Sussex, that neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock would have the right to try to go it alone in a hung parliament, and that pressure from within the Conservative or Labour party could ensure a coalition government, involving the Liberal Democrats. He reaffirmed that such a coalition would have to introduce a bill authorising the introduction of proportional representation as a replacement for the present first-past-the-post voting system in the first session of the new parliament. Mr Ashdown's speech came after a visit to Cornwall and Devon produced evidence that Mr Major's warning that a vote for the Liberal Democrats could put Mr Kinnock into 10 Downing Street could rebound on the Tories. There were indications of Conservative candidates fearing that Labour supporters could interpret the warning as encouragement to switch to the Liberal Democrats. As soon as Mr Ashdown crossed the River Tamar into the Cornwall South East constituency, Liberal Democrat activists assured him that they were poised to repeat their February 1974 victory, when a combination of Tory defectors and tactical voting by Labour supporters defeated Mr Robert Hicks, the sitting Conservative. Mr Hicks regained the seat in October 1974 and has held it since, but his confidence that he will beat off the Liberal Democrat challenge next Thursday does not appear to be shared by some of his party workers. Buoyed by favourable reports from other Cornish conmstituencies, Mr Ashdown brushed aside statements by Mr Major that he would never be a party to introducing proportional representation - the Liberal Democrats' key objective. Mr Ashdown, buoyed by the findings of recent opinion polls and the response he has received on his nationwide election tour, told a rally in Eastbourne last night that a vote to replace Mr Major with Mr Kinnock would not be enough. He dismissed Labour's slogan 'time for change' and said Mr Kinnock was not seeking 'real change'. Mr Ashdown added that a Labour victory would be a return to the old system with a 'gang of playground bullies' using their strength to grab Buggins' turn to do whatever they like. It would be a return to so-called 'strong government' which refused to accept the verdict of the ballot box and told people they had wasted their votes. Mr Ashdown described the poll tax as a 'cocktail of mishap, miscalculation and mayhem' dispensed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher because 'the lady loved her power - and loved it absolutely'. He warned that a Labour government would also be likely to abuse unfettered power. Mr Ashdown called on Mr Kinnock to stop 'wobbling on the fence' and make it clear whether he would support the introduction of proportional representation. He declared that the Liberal Democrats would insist that next week's election would be the last to be held in Britain on 'our unfair, out-of-date and inefficient voting system'.</p>

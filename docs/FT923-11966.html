			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Foreign Affairs: The real issue in Iraq - Any new military action against Saddam Hussein must be part of a political strategy 'Saddam is staying for ever,' chanted thousands of Iraqi demonstrators who marched past the UN inspection team outside the agriculture ministry in Baghdad on Monday. The Ba'ath party organisers who coined that slogan understood correctly what the real issue in Iraq is. Not that the weapons programmes which the UN team is investigating are unimportant. The thought that Iraq is probably still producing and developing weapons of mass destruction is deeply worrying, and the Security Council is right to take a serious view of the regime's continued prevarication on that issue. Moreover, its refusal to co-operate with the UN inspectors is a clear breach of the ceasefire terms enshrined in Security Council resolution 687, and therefore provides member states with legal justification for any action, including military action, that they may decide to take in response. But the crisis over the UN inspection team is only part of a broader crisis in which the issue is the continuance of President Saddam Hussein's regime; and his refusal to admit the team to the agriculture ministry is only one of a number of recent defiant gestures towards the UN: He has rejected UN terms for limited sales of Iraqi oil to finance imports of food and medicine. He has failed to renew the memorandum of understanding with the UN under which international humanitarian agencies are working in Iraq. He has stepped up harassment of UN and other agency staff, using agents to throw grenades or place car bombs in the northern Kurdish area which allied air cover has put outside his direct control. He has withdrawn his representatives from the UN commission which is tracing the Iraq-Kuwait frontier. He has continued military operations against Shia refugees in the marshes north of Basra. As well as constant shelling, these operations include the deliberate pollution of the marshes with containerised sewage, and preparations to drain them with a view to bringing in armoured vehicles. Since an Iranian air attack on the base inside Iraq of an Iranian opposition group in early April, the Iraqi air force has resumed flights by fixed-wing aircraft - another breach of the ceasefire terms. There are two interpretations of this behaviour. The gloomy one is that Mr Saddam feels increasingly confident about his hold on power, and therefore able to defy the UN with impunity. The optimistic one is that his defiance is a desperate attempt to overawe an increasingly restive population which sees his authority gradually weakening, and to restore the morale of his supporters and subordinates. Probably both are partly true. There is plenty of evidence that sanctions are biting, and the fact that Mr Saddam's writ does not run in the north of the country, while some Shia resistance continues in the marshes, must tend to undermine his authority in the rest of it. But he probably also calculates that another serious international effort to deal with him is unlikely. There are many good reasons for not wanting Mr Saddam to get away with it, ranging from the welfare of the Iraqi people through the stability and security of the Middle East to the global interest in stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction. But those who do not want him to get away with it, including the governments of Britain, France and the US, need a clearer strategy for dealing with him. Their policy since the ceasefire on February 28 last year has been too reactive. After failing to support the March insurrection in both north and south, at a moment when the regime was reeling from its defeat in the war and might easily have disintegrated, they intervened in extremis, and under strong pressure from public opinion, to secure a 'safe haven' for the Kurds in the north, while the unfortunate Shias in the south, being largely out of sight of TV cameras, were left to their fate. The Security Council did pass resolution 688, urging the regime to desist from repression throughout Iraq and to co-operate with UN humanitarian agencies, and instructing the secretary-general to monitor compliance and report back. But that resolution, unlike those concerned with the Gulf war and the ceasefire, has no coercive force unless or until it is backed up with further resolutions aimed at enforcing it. To get a majority for such resolutions might be difficult, given the direct interference in Iraq's 'internal affairs' that would be involved; but not necessarily impossible if the US exercised the leverage over other member states of which it has shown itself capable when it wants something badly enough. Anyway, in the Kurdish case the western powers did not trouble themselves with legal arguments: they simply acted. More action is needed now. It would be tragic if it took the form of bombing raids, aimed presumably at targets believed to be connected with Iraq's weapons programme, but with no strategic aim other than to demonstrate western governments' displeasure and so make them 'feel better'. Instead, any military action should be part of a political strategy whose clear aim would be the deposition of Mr Saddam and his replacement with a regime chosen by the Iraqi people. The relative success of the 'safe haven' in the north shows that air power can be used effectively to undermine the regime's authority by interdicting its use of military force for the purposes of repression. The danger of that tactic as used so far is that it has created a quasi-independent Kurdish state, contrary to the declared aim of all the governments concerned to respect Iraq's territorial integrity. Luckily, the Kurdish leadership has realised the risks involved. Although free elections held in Kurdistan in May gave it an unquestionable authority and legitimacy, it did not use them to declare independence, but instead sent representatives to the Iraqi National Congress, held in Vienna last month, which 'endorsed the total equality of all citizens including the people of Iraqi Kurdistan, recognising their right to self-determination short of secession (my italics) and within a unitary Iraqi state'. The two main Kurdish leaders, Mr Masoud Barzani and Mr Jalal Talabani, are expected to form a pan-Iraqi delegation, with two Shia and two Sunni Arabs, to meet Mr James Baker in Washington next week. His willingness to receive them is an important signal that the US supports a democratic alternative for the whole of Iraq, and not only for Kurdistan. He should follow it up by promising to support a provisional Iraqi government, based initially in the north, and to help it expand its authority southward by using air power to neutralise any armed forces that Mr Saddam tries to use against it. The ultimate objective must be the extension of the 'safe haven' until it includes the whole country. Meanwhile, it should be clearly recognised that the target of sanctions is not the Iraqi people but Mr Saddam's regime. The present absurdity of applying the sanctions to the 'safe haven' which the allies themselves created should be ended at once.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Sweden's main energy taxes affecting industry FROM JANUARY 1991 a tax was imposed on sulphur dioxide in coal, peat-based fuels and oil. This tax amounts to SKr30 (Pounds 3) for every kilogram of sulphur in coal and peat and SKr27 per cubic metre of oil. At the same time a carbon dioxide tax was introduced and levied at a rate of 25 ore per kilogram on natural gas, oil, coal, liquified petroleum, gas, petrol and kerosene emitted. Last month a nitrogen oxide tax was introduced on furnaces and gas turbines used for electricity and heat production. Here actual emissions will be measured with a levy imposed of SKr40 per kilogram. Sweden also charges a 25 per cent value added tax to energy use on industrial and domestic consumers.</p>

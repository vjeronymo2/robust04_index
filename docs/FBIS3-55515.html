Thoughts Inspired by the Results of the  `Lima-93' International Naval and Aerospace Exhibition"]    [Text] Dozens of arms exhibitions are held in the world  every year. It is symbolic that the largest of them (the Abu  Dhabi exhibition of arms and military hardware) was held at the  beginning of 1993, while the second most important one (the  "Lima-93" international naval and aerospace exhibition on the  Malaysian island of Langkawi) marked the end of the year.    For Russian defense industry workers both exhibitions were  landmarks and were even unprecedented, above all because  practically all our leading enterprises, scientific research  institutes, and design bureaus engaged in designing and  producing weapons were represented there for the first time,  along with their latest products, including those stemming from  conversion. It was these exhibitions that gave specialists an  opportunity to judge the place that Russia holds on the world  arms market and how successful our attempts have been to counter  such arms suppliers as the United States, Britain, and France in  a very fierce competitive struggle.    In recent years Russia, in the grip of political  confrontation, has lost many of its priorities, including those  in the sphere of arms production and the arms trade. Since 1990  we have seen an almost fivefold reduction in arms exports.  Market laws are particularly severe in this specific sphere of  trade: Russia has reduced arms sales, and other countries have  sharply increased production and at once filled the vacuum. The  United States today controls more than 50 percent of world arms  exports. So under these conditions the Russians' decision to  participate so extensively in exhibitions was justified  politically and economically, although to a considerable degree  it was also risky. Russian defense industry workers -- above  all, the organizers of our exhibit -- felt the tough pressure  from competitors back during preparations for the exhibitions.    Tribute must be paid to the specialists of the  "Oboroneksport" Russian State Foreign Economic Association for  Exports of Military Products and Services who, working in close  contact with representatives of the Ministry of Defense, made a  thorough study of the regions where exhibitions are held and of  the interests of potential buyers. The best of what we have was  shown both in the Emirates and in Malaysia. The S-300PMU-1 and  S-300V, Igla, and Tor-M1 antiaircraft missile complexes and  systems, the Piranya and Triton small and miniature [malyy i  sverkhmalyy] submarines, and the Ka-50 combat helicopter were  the real sensation of the exhibitions.    The aviation section of the Malaysian exhibition was  probably  the most interesting. Some 300 major aviation companies  presented their products -- everything that holds leading  positions in the aviation world. The Russian exhibit appeared  highly impressive against this background.    Whereas our country demonstrated just one Ruslan and one  MiG-29 fighter at the previous exhibition in Malaysia, we took  four MiG-29's, two Su-27's, and also the MiG-31 long-range  fighter-interceptor to "Lima-93." At the same time all the  aircraft and airmen arrived straight from the ranks, as it were  -- from combat air units -- and had not made any special  preparation for the exhibition. Under a blazing sun (up to 40  degrees in the shade) our military engineers and technicians  prepared the MiG's in just two days, exceeding all existing  norms.    The demonstration flights began right after the official  opening of the exhibition, and our military airmen participated  in each of them: Colonels Aleksandr Kutuzov and Vladimir  Bazhenov, Lieutenant Colonels Boris Grigoryev, Vladimir Gryzlov,  and Aleksandr Lichkun, and Majors Aleksey Sherstnev, Andrey  Makarenko, and Aleksandr Katashinskiy, displaying brilliant  skill in very complex aerobatics figures and eliciting the  admiration of onlookers and specialists and the envy of foreign  colleagues. "Selfless work by airmen with excellent hardware."  This is not my assessment -- this was what the foreign press  wrote about our airmen.    Among the conversion output of defense enterprises  specialists and businessmen showed special interest in the  passenger surface-effect vehicles developed by the Central  Design Bureau for Hydrofoils (Nizhniy Novgorod), in the  underwater excursion craft created by St. Petersburg's "Rubin"  Central Design Bureau for Marine Equipment, and in helicopters  and launches which can be used for sea patrols, rescue  operations, and services to island resorts. It is only to be  regretted that for purely economic reasons these exhibits were  shown in the form of models and photographs and not in real  life. Incidentally, all the recreational vessels were sold out  at the previous "Lima-91" exhibition before it ended.    Journalists expect sensations from exhibitions. The  Emirates' purchase of a large consignment of French Leclerc  tanks was named as the sensation at "IDEX-93 in the United Arab  Emirates, and at the "Lima-93" exhibition it was the contract to  supply Malaysia with eight F/A-18 fighters, whereas the contract  with Russia, which has long been in preparation, to supply the  Malaysians with 18 MiG-29's was not signed. In my view the  reasons for this are not commercial but purely political. This  is particularly obvious in the context of the results of the  conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  Organization held in Seattle before the exhibition itself. We  know that the ASEAN countries are the fourth largest source of  imports to the United States and stand in sixth place among  America's export markets. In 1992 the volume of U.S. trade with  them amounted to $60 billion, while U.S. investments in these  states topped $16 billion. The Americans held the conference  with great pomp, making it their main aim to turn APEC into a  disciplined organization capable of ensuring the expansion of  trade and investments in the Asia-Pacific region. The first  major obstacle to face them on this path was the refusal by  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed to participate in the  Seattle meeting. The main reason for the boycott was the  reluctance to turn APEC into a means of U.S. domination over the  countries of Southeast Asia. In the opinion of experts,  Malaysia's purchase of U.S. fighters is a kind of goodwill  gesture or an attempt at reconciliation with the United States.  According to other assessments, Malaysia deliberately acquires  military hardware from different countries, so "limiting these  countries' opportunity for dictating terms and influencing  Malaysia's policy."    The contract with Russia for MiG-29's is still at the  elaboration stage. "There is only a small holdup," Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamed assured journalists, "and the  champagne can already be ordered." I would like to hope that  the skill of the Russian military airmen and the quality of our  combat hardware demonstrated at the Malaysian exhibition will be  a weighty factor in the competitive struggle with Western  aircraft companies and a good argument in favor of signing the  contract. But its birth pangs demand a thorough analysis and  exacting assessments. The BROOKINGS REVIEW, published by the  Brookings Institution in Washington, carried an analysis of  Russian arms exports. It describes with heavy irony the history  of the preparation of the MiG-29 contract. It reports, in  particular, that representatives of 18 different intermediary  organizations, each of which claimed to have the right to sell  these aircraft, visited Malaysia within a short space of time.  The competition that developed among the Russians created chaos  and substantially undermined their positions in the negotiations.    Until recently "Oboroneksport" was the head organization  with  the right to sell Russian weapons. With offices in 40  countries, it supplied abroad almost 90 percent of all the  weapons exported by Russia. Recently the "Spetsvneshtekhnika"  GVK [expansion unknown], the Main Administration for Cooperation  and Collaboration, and "Promeksport" have been trading in  weapons. Other organizations, including the manufacturing  plants, have also sought the right to sell weapons, frequently  competing but more frequently hindering each other in the  conclusion of contracts. Shortly before the opening of the  Malaysian exhibition the Russian Federation president signed an  edict setting up the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company for Exports  and Imports of Arms and Military Hardware on the basis of  "Oboroneksport," "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and the Main  Administration for Cooperation and Collaboration. The ink on  the edict was not dry before a mighty wave of criticism crashed  down on it in the press in full accordance with our Russian  traditions. A group of very famous arms producers even proposed  suspending the president's edict.    Be that as it may, a desire to instill order in the arms  trade and to elaborate a state concept of military exports can  be seen behind the new presidential act. Only it is important  that all the innovations do not end in an elementary shakeup of  the former systems in order to satisfy somebody's ambitions, and  that the tremendous experience accumulated by "Oboroneksport"  over the 40 years of its existence and the unique cadres it has  reared are fully employed when the new mechanism is created.    We have only just realized the importance to Russia of arms  exports and learned to ignore the preaching about the immorality  of the arms trade which only recently was issuing both from the  pages of the press and from parliamentary rostrums. I remember  how Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation minister of  defense who headed the Russian delegation at the Abu Dhabi  exhibition, was forced to explain to our own Russian journalists  that we do not seek to sell weapons to just anyone to be used in  combat operations of an offensive nature or in order to upset  the balance of forces in a region. We offer military output in  strict accordance with international laws for defensive  purposes. "Commerce will not conflict with politics but will  ensure the achievement of Russia's political and economic ends."    It is not only the destinies of millions of working people  in  the military-industrial complex and our economic revival that  depend on whether our country returns to the world arms market  and on how successful our arms business is -- the fate of Russia  itself also depends on this.</p>

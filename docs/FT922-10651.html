			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Bank of Scotland profits rise 5% BANK OF SCOTLAND yesterday reported annual pre-tax profits 5 per cent ahead, from Pounds 134.1m to Pounds 140.7m, and said it was continuing to increase its share of the UK banking market. Operating profit rose 16 per cent to Pounds 393.3m from Pounds 339.4m - reflecting success in increasing core business - but this was reduced by a rise from Pounds 202.3m to Pounds 256.8m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. The result for the year to February 29 matched market expectations but the shares eased 1p to 117p. An analyst said the bank was 'doing better than other clearers but not better than expected'. The withdrawal of some capacity from the banking market which reduced excess competition meant improved margins on new lending and leasing, and higher fees and commissions. Earnings per share dipped to 6.4p from 7.56p. The final dividend is 2.65p to give a total 7.1 per cent ahead at 4.35p. Operating profit was Pounds 247.9m, up 10 per cent 'against a backcloth of very difficult trading conditions'. Pre-tax profit was Pounds 99.2m, a 16 per cent rise. Lending to customers rose 10 per cent to Pounds 12.3bn. About half the bank's UK lending stemmed from England and Wales. Mortgage lending on residential property rose from Pounds 3.8bn to Pounds 4.5bn, the largest component of the bank's lending portfolio. Bad-debt provisions on mortgages rose as a percentage of total mortgages but were not significant because of the geographical spread of lending and the use of mortgage indemnity insurance. Among its subsidiaries, NWS Bank, the finance house, raised pre-tax profits 15 per cent to Pounds 55.1m. However, British Linen Bank, the merchant bank, moved from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6m to a loss of Pounds 8.9m reflecting property-related provisions in banking. Countrywide Banking Corporation of New Zealand saw pre-tax profits fall to NZDollars 17m (Pounds 5.1m) for the year to June 30 1991 from NZDollars 20.7m, though they rose from NZDollars 6.7m to NZDollars 8m in the first half. Group operating expenses rose 13 per cent compared with 17 per cent in 1991, and the bank shed 335 jobs. Its cost-income ratio was 54 per cent. It is committed to cutting the ratio to 50 per cent within the next few years. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Barahona on the weekly news conference by </F> Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani after a ceremony marking  the deployment of National Civilian Police units at the  Unicenter Commercial Center in Soyapango on 3 January; from the  "El Salvador Telepress" newscast; passages within quotation  marks recorded]    [Text] [Cristiani] "We have decided to discontinue  demobilizing the National Police [PN] for as long as this change  in the deployment plans for the National Civilian Police [PNC]  requires. This will not modify the general timetable, however.  The PNC transfer and deployment plans will be completed by  October 1994. Our intention now is to transfer those units being  discharged from the PN to other places requiring a greater  security force presence."    This plan will have other consequences in San Salvador, such  as the reorganization of the city's layout. President Cristiani  said that this will be done gradually, as the PNC is deployed  throughout the city. The president explained this as follows:    [Cristiani] "Instead of the nine or 11 sectors into which  the city was divided before, we will now have 45 sectors in the  metropolitan area. We have evaluated the city's physical  structure--meaning streets, neighborhoods, municipal limits and  other aspects of the terrain--and reached this distribution.  Each sector will have a person who will be responsible for the  sector's public security. He or she will be at least an officer  or a deputy commissioner, which the PNC will explain later in  greater detail, regarding Soyapango and Ilopango. Each sector  will have at least 50 public security units. If we can do this,  we will have more than the initial 2,000 units we had with both  public force institutions."    This again leads to another important question: When will  the PNC be completely deployed in San Salvador? The president  apparently has a set timetable that he presented during the news  conference.    [Unidentified reporter] "Mr. President, under this new  direction of the public security plans, when will the PNC be  deployed to all these areas you have described?"    [Cristiani] "The deployment plan is a gradual one. The next  two municipalities are not yet defined. These next two will be  determined in January, basically because there are several  variables that must be considered. These elements include  terrain extension, the number of criminal cases, the graduation  rate at the public security school, the reenlistment of PN  personnel, and so on. We have completed this study for  Soyapango and Ilopango, and we are making further evaluations to  determine which municipality will follow. We believe that the  PNC will be deployed in the metropolitan area in approximately  four or five months."    That is basically what President Cristiani said today about  completing the PNC deployment in San Salvador. One might ask  why Soyapango and Ilopango were selected for deployment. The  government reports that 339 crimes are reported here in  Soyapango. A majority of 57 cases are car thefts, while 53  percent are muggings.</p>

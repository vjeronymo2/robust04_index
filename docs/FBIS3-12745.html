Their discussion dealt with bilateral relations and the  existing cooperation between Jordan and the EC countries, ways  of enhancing them, as well as the most important issues in the  international arena.    In a press statement on the most important ideas he  communicated to the Israeli leaders on behalf of the Palestinian  president, Papoulias said: These ideas revolve around calming  the atmosphere and creating a new atmosphere that would  facilitate things, provide security for the Palestinians, and  lead to disarming the settlers and resuming the dialogue between  the two sides. He said that the Israeli side has promised to  take these ideas into consideration and will reply to them  later. He said: Efforts will be exerted in the future and the  EC hopes that the peace efforts will produce good results and  will not reach a dead end.    The meeting was attended by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister  of state for foreign affairs; Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, minister  of state; the Jordanian ambassador to Greece; the Greek  ambassador to Jordan; and the EC representative in Amman.</p>

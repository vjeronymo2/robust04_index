			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTHER MCCOY, 85, RENOWNED WRITER ON ARCHITECTURE, DIES  </P> <P> Esther McCoy, considered the dean of local architecture writers for a  collection of books and articles that chronicled the rise of design and  designers in California, died Saturday at her Santa Monica home after a long  illness. She was 85.  </P> <P> The author of "Five California Architects," which since its publication in 1960  has become a classic of the genre, McCoy described the people of vision who  came to California and took advantage of the freedom and lack of tradition to  create ingenious living spaces.  </P> <P> "By the force of her writing and personality," said her publisher, David  Travers, "Esther McCoy brought Southern California architecture to the  attention of the world."  </P> <P> "There's this 'plunger' attitude here that gives architects their freedom," she  said in a 1985 interview in The Times. "No one's watching, really, so you can  write better. You can design better. You can try out something and no one will  really know that you're trying it out."  </P> <P> Born Nov. 18, 1904, in Coffeyville, Kan., McCoy moved to California in the  1930s and eventually went to work for Southern California architect R. M.  Schindler.  </P> <P> Among her duties in Schindler's studio was answering requests for information  about his buildings, and out of that grew her career as an architecture writer.  Eventually, she completed six books and numerous newspaper and magazine  articles, including one scheduled for publication in January, Travers said.  </P> <P> Through her efforts, the architects and architecture she wrote about became  world-renowned.  </P> <P> "These men were not well-known, but now they're by-words," Travers said. She  wrote about Schindler, Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck and other ground-breaking  designers. Because of her work, a London-based association of architects began  scheduling trips to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Her honors included the American Institute of Architects' Award for Excellence  in 1985, the Star of the Order of Solidarity from the Republic of Italy and the  Los Angeles County Museum of Art award for Distinguished Achievement in 1982.  </P> <P> She is survived by a stepson, Forrest Tobie of Crescent City.  </P> <P> A memorial service is scheduled for Friday at 2:30 p.m., at the Pierce Brothers  Westwood Village Mortuary Chapel in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

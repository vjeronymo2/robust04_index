			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Year-end options So far, this has been a remarkably poor year for equities. The FT-SE 100's efforts at a rally petered out yesterday, leaving the index down nearly 10 per cent since the start of the year. The total return on equities has been minus 6 per cent, only the third time in 20 years the rate has been negative. The average return on gilts during the past five years is now higher than for equities. But the year is not yet over. Last December, the index achieved a 6 per cent rally, posting a 50 point rise in a single day between Christmas and New Year. The surprise holiday period increase was caused by the expiry of a series of over-the-counter option contracts. The contract writers and their clients can make significant profits if the index ends at a certain level. Given the traditionally low volumes during the holidays, it is easier for them to drive the index where they want. Hence the surprising volatility. That does not mean the market will move sharply upwards - it could equally fall. But the year-end could yet prove interesting. The forces driving this month's short-lived rally - merger and acquisitions  -will not disappear. Companies, holding ever greater quantities of cash, are on the hunt for targets. The market's fall this year make these look decidedly cheap. The favoured sectors include merchant banks, electricity and water, and the second-oil stocks following Premier Consolidated Oilfields' disclosure it was interested in Pict Petroleum. Little is likely to happen until the new year, but further M&amp;A activity should support the market in the coming months.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> It's Garry Shandling's Wrap: Saying that he wants to "explore new directions in  my career," Garry Shandling confirmed Tuesday that he will fold "It's Garry  Shandling's Show" this spring. The offbeat comedy series has been running on  the Showtime pay-cable channel since September, 1986, and later was picked up  for over-the-air broadcasts by the Fox network. The series will have completed  72 episodes when it wraps production with a special "final" installment, and  negotiations are under way to syndicate a rerun package. Beth Kleid  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL;  </P> <P> SLOW START BY METS GIVES EXPOS AND RODGERS SOME HOPE  </P> <P> Though the 1989 season is only two weeks old, the New York Mets' staggering  start has brought new encouragement to Manager Buck Rodgers of the Montreal  Expos.  </P> <P> "Ninety-five wins will be good enough this year," Rodgers said of the race in  the National League East.  </P> <P> "The Mets won 100 last year, but they have question marks now. I'm not saying  they're not the team to beat, but they're like the rest of us now."  </P> <P> The Mets' 2-5 start through Thursday left them last in the East and was their  worst since '83, when they went on to lose 93 games.  </P> <P> In the wake of an opening-day victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, the Mets  (now 3-6) scored 13 runs in their next six games, batted .186 and went 56  innings without a home run.  </P> <P> The middle of the lineup -- Gregg Jefferies, Keith Hernandez, Darryl  Strawberry, Kevin McReynolds and Gary Carter -- was a combined 23 for 127 in  that span, a .181 average.  </P> <P> Frustration? Though early, the Mets were already doing some finger-pointing,  and Manager Dave Johnson seemed on the verge of contradicting himself.  </P> <P> It happened like this: When cross-town counterpart Dallas Green of the New York  Yankees said at the start of the week that the Yankees stink, Johnson was asked  what he thought.  </P> <P> "I don't understand how you can say something like that, especially in a media  market like New York," Johnson said. "If it works for some people, fine, but  it's just not me."  </P> <P> Not, at least, until a couple days later when the Mets lost consecutive games  to the Pittsburgh Pirates for the first time since 1985 and Johnson seemed  ready to say the Mets stink as well.  </P> <P> Informed that he was managing a last-place team for the first time in his  career, Johnson said: "I know that and I'm not handling it too well. My  patience is wearing thin. I don't like to have meetings, but I'm bearing down  on one quickly.  </P> <P> "I mean, you don't want to be overly concerned, but you do have to be  concerned. There's a lot of changes I'd like to make, but I don't have enough  guys on the roster to make them. After starting like this and a (lousy) spring,  I have questions now.  </P> <P> "It's time for soul-searching."  </P> <P> It was time for Howard Johnson to blame second baseman Jefferies for not  catching a throw in the two-run eighth inning of a 4-2 loss to the Pirates  Thursday, the latest in a series of throwing errors that were expected to send  third baseman Johnson to the bench.  </P> <P> "The ball should have been caught," Howard Johnson said. "It wasn't that bad of  a throw. Several teammates agreed with me. Ask Tuff."  </P> <P> Said Tim Teufel, who was playing first base: "I don't know. I didn't have a  good angle on it."  </P> <P> Said Jefferies: "I guarantee you I'm not going to let a ball go by if I can get  it. From where I was, there was no way I could reach it. You know, there's a  lot of frustration on this team. I'm not saying it's Howard or anyone else. But  sometimes someone catches a person the wrong way."  </P> <P> A rookie of the year candidate at 21, Jefferies figures to age rapidly in the  Mets' self-detonating atmosphere.  </P> <P> How do the Yankees stink? Dallas Green could count the ways. Sloppy  baserunning. Poor location by pitchers. Even worse logic by pitchers.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Green has stopped short of the wall-shaking outbursts that earned  him the name of Mr. Bluster in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure this club has an understanding of what I'm trying to preach yet,"  Green said of the Yankees, who are 3-7.  </P> <P> "That's part of the frustration. It's also partly why I haven't busted loose.  It would be like spanking your kids and they don't know what you're spanking  them for."  </P> <P> One of the players Green singled out for poor baserunning the other day was  former Dodger Steve Sax, a player whose spring aggressiveness Green had  applauded.  </P> <P> Sax was thrown out attempting to take an extra base on an overthrow against the  Cleveland Indians, the third time in a non-steal situation that Sax has been  thrown out. Green called it a mistake.  </P> <P> The next day, Sax refused to respond to the urging of third-base coach Lee Elia  and remained at third on Don Slaught's fly to medium center, depriving the  Yankees of a possible run in a game they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in extra  innings.  </P> <P> Sax later paced through the clubhouse, mumbling about his new uncertainty on  the bases to the extent that coach Frank Howard had to settle him down.  </P> <P> Larry Bowa, who played under Green, knows how it can be and knows that Green  will have to repair some bridges with Sax.  </P> <P> "Some guys will fight back, some will resent it," Bowa said of Green's style.  "Other guys will put their tails between their legs and crawl into their  lockers. Then Dallas could lose them."  </P> <P> Said Green, more concerned with the overall play: "I ain't too sure we could  beat Peoria right now."  </P> <P> After his team started 1-6, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was quick to  provide a vote of confidence, saying Green would be there all year.  </P> <P> Said Green: "If we go 1 and 161 I'll be here all year?"  </P> <P> Former Dodger Pedro Guerrero, through eight games, has driven in 14 runs for  the St. Louis Cardinals, including the game-winner in the 10th inning Saturday  against the Mets. Seven of Guerrero's eight hits came with runners on base, six  with the runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> Said the modest Guerrero:  </P> <P> "Probably 90% of the time I come through, especially with men in scoring  position. I love to go out there with the pressure of men on base. There's  pressure on me, but there's pressure on the pitcher, too."  </P> <P> The latest of Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson's "can't miss" rookies is  former UCLA infielder Torey Lovullo, who put Keith Moreland on the bench but is  2 for 27.  </P> <P> "I'll die before he comes out of the lineup," Sparky said of Lovullo.  </P> <P> The Tigers lost 12 straight games to the Minnesota Twins before winning, 3-0,  Thursday night. Said Detroit pitcher Jack Morris:  </P> <P> "People say they're surprised the Twins beat us 12 times. Hey, they're the  better team."  </P> <P> Pitcher Danny Jackson of the Cincinnati Reds, winless after his first two  starts, used a bat to demolish his Riverfront Stadium locker, claiming later it  was the work of termites.  </P> <P> Teammate Kent Tekulve responded by buying Jackson a stand-up plastic punching  bag called "Whammo," labeled as an "anti-stress device . . . a high tech answer  to low tech problems."  </P> <P> Jackson said he would share it with the team.  </P> <P> Advice for the lovelorn?  </P> <P> The Kansas City Royals' George Brett says Wade Boggs of the Boston Red Sox will  never escape reminders of the affair with Margo Adams.  </P> <P> "It'll never end. Look at me," Brett said. "It's been nine years since the  hemorrhoid thing in the World Series and I still hear about it. The pine-tar  incident was in 1983 but I still hear fans yell about it every time I put on a  uniform."  </P> <P> First baseman Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs, who hit all seven of his home  runs on the road last year, hit his first ever at Wrigley Field in Tuesday's  5-4 victory over the Cardinals.  </P> <P> Said the relieved Grace:  </P> <P> "Every time I picked up a magazine or newspaper it was, 'incredibly, Mark Grace  did not hit a home run at Wrigley Field last year.' King Kong is off my back  now."  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Brewers' Terry Francona, who broke up Nolan Ryan's latest bid for  a no-hitter, was surprised to hear Ryan describe him as one of the toughest he  faced in the National League.  </P> <P> "If I'm one of the toughest, I'd sure hate to see the guys he owns," Francona  said. "Let's put it this way . . . when I see his name in the pitching  probables, I don't exactly run to the ballpark."  </P> <P> Add Ryan: It was the 23rd time he has struck out 15 or more batters in a game.  He did it all with fastballs, throwing only 11 curveballs and only one for a  strike.  </P> <P> Said Milwaukee's Rob Deer: "He couldn't get his curveball over. When he does, I  hear he's nearly unhittable."  </P></p>

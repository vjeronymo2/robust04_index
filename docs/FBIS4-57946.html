			<p>BFN     [Text] Mobilization for National Development [MDN] formed a  special consultation committee. From 19 to 22 May 1994, MDN  President Dr. Hubert De Ronceray received three delegations from  the provisional government of Emile Jonassaint. The  conversations focused on the MDN General Secretariat's press  release, dated 17 May, and the measures to be considered for a  better balance of relations between the party and the  provisional government. This special consultation committee is  in charge of immediately meeting with the incumbents of the  various ministerial departments as well as the officials of the  other sectors to collect information on the following points:  measures by which to meet Resolution 917 of the UN Security  Council, threats of foreign military intervention, and the  political timetable of the provisional government. Let us listen  to the explanations of Hubert de Ronceray.    [Begin de Ronceray recording] Well, I believe [previous  three  words in Creole] it is rather a sort of active observation,  given that the government made a gesture that we greatly  appreciated, that is, government figures came to meet with us  and discuss a number of problems. Then, we thought we were also  duty-bound to take those conversations into account, to continue  them, and to carry on with them. This is the reason we formed...  [pauses] the party formed this special consultation committee in  charge of meeting with the various (?ministers) and other  officials, listening to them, taking note of their projects and  programs, and seeing to what extent their objectives agree with  those of the party.    Once the committee gives us its report, we will see know  where we stand, according to what is being done and what will be  done. [end recording]</p>

Klyuchnikov, Moscow Energy Institute; UDC </F> 658.511.2.004.18]    [Abstract] In all stages of production and conversioN of  primary sources of energy, transport, and final use of the  energy potential of primary energy sources there are  considerable energy losses. It is crucial to determine the  actual losses and quality of use of primary fuels. This paper  presents an estimate of energy loss in the complete cycle of  using the energy potential of primary fuel in material  production. Examples of the quality of use of fuel-energy  resources in various thermal technological systems in  energy-intensive areas of industry are examined. A particular  example presented is cast metallurgy. Schematics are presented  to organize the consideration of energy conservation measures so  that no options are overlooked. The principal possibilities for  large-scale reduction of fuel-energy use are established based  on intensive energy conservation measures. Figures 7.</p>

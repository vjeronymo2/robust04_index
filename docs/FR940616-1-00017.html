ATCA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to implement regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations of ICCAT. The authority to implement ICCAT recommendations has been delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parties to the Eighth Special Meeting of ICCAT held in Madrid, Spain, on November 8&hyph;12, 1992, adopted a recommendation to implement a statistical documentation program to collect more complete information on the catch of, and trade in, Atlantic bluefin tuna. That recommendation, which this proposed rule would implement, requires Contracting Parties to implement a statistical documentation program whereby any bluefin tuna imported into the territory of a Contracting Party or at the first entry into a regional economic organization must be accompanied by an appropriately completed BSD. The ICCAT recommendation is based on the need to improve the reliability of statistical information on worldwide harvests of bluefin tuna, particularly western Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is an overexploited stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without statistical documentation and differentiation with respect to ocean area of catch, ICCAT cannot determine the total harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna. While the primary market for bluefin tuna is Japan, which is a member country of ICCAT, the origin of all bluefin tuna on the international market cannot be ascertained without documentation of the flag state of harvesting vessels and ocean areas of catch. Some vessels that harvest bluefin tuna are registered to nations not affiliated with ICCAT and are not subject to ICCAT quota constraints; some of these nations have difficulty in obtaining information on the catches of vessels under their flag and therefore do not report catches to ICCAT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documentation requirement would facilitate accounting for all fresh or frozen shipments of bluefin tuna into Japan and other ICCAT countries, by both member and non-member ICCAT countries. This information would be used by ICCAT for Atlantic bluefin tuna stock assessments, to develop management policies, and to help determine compliance with its conservation program for Atlantic bluefin tuna. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the proposed BSD requirement, NMFS proposes to require a Federal permit for each dealer who exports Pacific bluefin tuna. NMFS also proposes to require these dealers to complete a biweekly report on bluefin tuna exports and to affix a tag on all fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna sold for export. When combined with the existing permitting and reporting requirements for Atlantic bluefin tuna dealers, this would give NMFS the ability to track all bluefin tuna shipments imported into, exported, or re-exported from the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has determined that these additional requirements would bring the United States into compliance with the 1992 ICCAT recommendation that all bluefin tuna (Atlantic and Pacific) imported into ICCAT countries be required to be accompanied by a BSD. ICCAT has determined that inclusion of Pacific bluefin is necessary due to the similarity of appearance of the two subspecies. Without Pacific bluefin tuna dealer permits, bi-weekly reports and tags for exports, the United States could not assure compliance with the documentation requirement for Pacific bluefin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would require a completed, approved BSD as a condition for the import, export, or re-export of all bluefin tuna shipments into or from the United States. The BSD would be required to accompany each fresh or frozen shipment along with other shipping documentation ordinarily required for international trade. Consistent with the ICCAT recommendation and subsequent agreements with Japan and Canada, the BSD would be required for all bluefin tuna beginning June 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BSD would be required for all fresh or frozen bluefin tuna products that are exported from or imported into the United States and identified by Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers for fresh or chilled bluefin tuna, excluding fillets and other fish meat_0302.39.00.20; and frozen bluefin tuna, excluding fillets_0303.49.00.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Contents of Document <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to modify the FCO (NOAA Form 370) so that it can also serve as the BSD. Interested persons may obtain copies of the proposed combined form from NMFS (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to be considered appropriately completed, the approved BSD accompanying each shipment would have to provide all of the required information indicated in the proposed regulatory text for &sect;285.202 and be certified by the exporter, importer, and government official, as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Validation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The completed, approved BSD would have to be validated by a responsible government official of the country whose flag vessel harvested the tuna regardless of where the bluefin tuna is first landed, unless the AA waives the validation requirement for that country because the AA finds, based on information from ICCAT, that: (1)&blank;All fresh or individually frozen bluefin tuna available for sale from that country are tagged, or included in an ICCAT-accepted logbook or ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system; (2) all information relating to the tag, the ICCAT-accepted logbook, or the ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system is compiled by the government of that country and includes the name of the country issuing the document, the name of the exporter and the importer, the name of the harvesting vessel and the area of harvest, the gear utilized, the type of product and total weight, and the point of export; and (3) the compiled information is provided in a timely fashion to ICCAT. Validation requirements would be waived for all but bulk-frozen shipments upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a finding and waiver by the AA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Dolphin-Safe Tuna Designation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Marine Mammal Protection and International Dolphin Conservation Acts and their implementing regulations, only dolphin-safe tuna may be purchased, sold, transported, or shipped in the United States after June 1, 1994 (16 U.S.C. 1417). All shipments of tuna and tuna products, except fresh tuna, from all countries must be accompanied by an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370). As proposed to be revised, NOAA Form 370 would serve as an FCO/BSD and appropriately completing the form would satisfy both FCO requirements and, if bluefin tuna, BSD requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All fresh tuna and other fresh fish products are presumed to be captured by dolphin-safe methods and do not require an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370) for lawful importation to the United States. In addition, imports of certain fish and fish products other than tuna, except fresh fish, as specified at 50 CFR 216.24(e), from countries having registered vessels that use large-scale driftnets (no countries so designated at this time) must be accompanied by an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370). Although an FCO is not required for fresh tuna or any other fresh fish products, under the proposed rule an appropriately completed BSD (NOAA Form 370 as proposed to be revised) would be required for all bluefin tuna, fresh or frozen, that enters or exits the United States. Exhibit 1 below summarizes when a completed FCO or BSD, that is, an appropriately completed NOAA Form 370, as proposed to be revised, is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,i1,s50,r50,r50,r50 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Exhibit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Requirements for the Proposed Revised NOAA Form  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 370 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Product form  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Bluefin tuna  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Other tunas  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Certain other fish <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Fresh  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Imports_BSD; Exports_BSD  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Not applicable  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Not applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Frozen  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Imports_BSD/FCO; Exports_BSD  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Imports_FCO  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Imports from countries using large-scale driftnets_FCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canned  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> No HTS code for canned bluefin; requirements for other tunas apply  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Imports_FCO  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Imports from countries using large-scale driftnets_FCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any non-fresh form labeled ``Dolphin-Safe''  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Exports_FCO  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Exports_FCO  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Not applicable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Responsible Parties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of the exporter's certification, the exporter would be considered the person or company that first exported the shipment from the country where the fish is first landed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of the importer's certification, intermediate country importer(s) would be the person(s) or company(ies) that transship(s) the product through an intermediate country(ies). An intermediate country would be a country from which bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products that were previously imported (i.e., not harvested or landed) by that country are exported to the United States. An intermediate country for the purposes of these proposed 50 CFR part 285 regulations is distinct from an intermediary nation as defined in section 3 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 216. Shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products through a nation on a through bill of lading, or in any other manner that does not enter the products into that country's customs territory as an import, would not make that country an intermediate country under this definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of the importer's certification, the final destination importer would be the person or company that is the recipient of the product at its final destination (i.e., country of consumption). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pacific Bluefin Tuna Dealer Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Permit Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dealers purchasing or receiving Pacific bluefin tuna for export would be required to possess a valid bluefin tuna dealer permit and comply with all applicable reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Tagging Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would require that identification tags be placed on all bluefin tuna, except bulk-frozen bluefin, landed by U.S. vessels and exported from the United States, regardless of ocean area of catch. Similar to the NMFS Northeast Region program for dealers purchasing Atlantic bluefin tuna, the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director) would issue numbered tags to each person receiving a dealer's permit for exporting Pacific bluefin tuna. Such tags would not be transferable. A dealer or agent would be required to affix a tag to each fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna purchased, or received, for export, except bulk-frozen Pacific bluefin tuna, immediately upon its offloading from a vessel. The tag would be required to be affixed between the fifth dorsal finlet and the keel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual Pacific bluefin tuna carcasses that are landed in bulk-frozen form would not be required to be tagged for export. A tagging requirement for individual fish frozen in bulk would be difficult to implement and enforce, and would require a drastic change in current handling practice. However, exported bulk-frozen shipments would be accompanied by a completed BSD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tag affixed to any Pacific bluefin tuna would have to remain on the tuna until the tuna is cut into portions, which NMFS understands may occur on occasion. If the tuna or tuna parts subsequently are packaged for transport for domestic commercial use or for export, the tag number would be required to be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of any package or container. Tag numbers would be required to be recorded on any document accompanying shipment of bluefin tuna for U.S. commercial use or export. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pacific bluefin tuna dealers would be exempted from the requirement at 50 CFR 285.29(a) to record and report bluefin tuna landings via the Daily Dealer Report Card. However, they would be required to submit biweekly reports on exports of bluefin tuna to the Regional Director. The report would have to be postmarked and mailed within 10 days after the end of each 2-week reporting period in which Pacific bluefin tuna were exported. The biweekly reporting periods would be defined as the first day to the fourteenth day of each month and the fifteenth day to the last day of the month. Each report would have to specify accurately and completely for each tuna or each shipment of bulk-frozen tuna exported: Date of landing or import; any tag number (if so tagged); and weight in pounds (specify if round or dressed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dealers would be required to allow an authorized officer, or any employee of NMFS designated by the Regional Director for this purpose, to inspect and copy any records of transfers, purchases, or receipts of Pacific bluefin tuna. Finally, the dealer would be required to maintain a copy of each biweekly report for a period of 6 months from the date on which it was submitted to the Regional Director. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ports of Entry <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To facilitate enforcement, the AA may, in the future, designate ports of entry. If ports of entry are designated, all bluefin tuna shipments entering the United States would be restricted to the designated ports of entry, which would be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any fresh or frozen bluefin tuna product identified by the HTS item numbers referred to previously that is unaccompanied by a completed, approved BSD would be considered unlawful for importation into the United States. If the AA has designated ports of entry for shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products, any shipment arriving at non-designated ports of entry would be considered unlawful and the importer would be subject to penalties under ATCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a bluefin tuna is presented for entry into the customs territory of the United States and is found to be without a completed, approved BSD, U.S. Customs would suspend entry authorization, notify the importer of record of the documentation deficiency, notify NMFS enforcement agents of the deficiency, and offer the importer of record the opportunity to cure the defect. If the importer of record cannot cure the defect within 8 hours (justified by perishable nature of product), the importer could withdraw the product from U.S. Customs territory (i.e., re-export within 24 hours under Customs supervision); place the product into a bonded warehouse; post a bond to release the product; or abandon the product (Customs takes custody), whereupon the product would be disposed of under Customs laws and regulations, as long as that disposition does not result in its introduction into the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event the importer can cure the defect within 8 hours, the fish would be released for importation and no penalties would be incurred under ATCA. If, within 10 days of fish being placed into a bonded warehouse, the Regional Director notifies the District Director of Customs that complete, approved documentation for that fish has been received, the fish would be allowed to be entered into the United States; otherwise, it would be disposed of as allowed under Customs laws and regulations. If, within 10 days of fish being released under bond, the Regional Director does not receive complete, approved documentation for that fish, the importer or consignee would be notified to redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the District Director of Customs those fish that were released under bond. In the event that any such fish is not redelivered within 3 days following the notification, without impairment in value, liquidated damages would be assessed in the full amount of the bond given. The importer would remain liable for any expenses incurred in the storage and/or disposal of bluefin tuna refused admission under these regulations. In addition, if the fish is refused entry into the United States or if the importer abandons the product, the importer would be subject to the civil and criminal penalties and the forfeiture provisions provided for under ATCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scenarios <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following are five examples of use of the BSD under the proposed rule in which shipments of bluefin tuna are imported into and/or exported from the United States: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Exports from a country for which the AA has not waived validation requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A BSD from a country for which the AA has not waived validation requirements would have to be validated by a responsible government official for that country. The export, exporter certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. The exporter then would submit the original of the BSD for validation by the designated government official. A copy would be submitted to the domestic fisheries agency and the original BSD would accompany the shipment into the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD, with the importer's entries and certification, would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a United States state and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer.

Export of U.S.-caught bluefin tuna: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the United States has a tagging requirement for individually exported Atlantic bluefin tuna, and this proposed rule would implement such a tagging requirement for Pacific bluefin tuna exported from the United States, the BSD would not have to be validated by a government official (except for bulk-frozen shipments, which would not be tagged and would be accompanied by a validated BSD). The export, exporter certification, and description of shipment (including the country-coded tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. The original BSD with the exporter's entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of export. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Import of bulk-frozen shipments to the United States: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a bulk-frozen import, the export, exporter's certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the foreign exporter. The exporter would then submit the BSD to a responsible government official of the country of the flag vessel harvesting the tuna for validation, even if validation requirements have been otherwise waived for that country.

Approximately 230 bluefin dealers would be affected. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule contains new and revised collection-of-information requirements subject to review under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

The public reporting burden for completing an application for a Federal permit for dealers that export or re-export Pacific bluefin tuna is estimated at 0.08 hours (5 minutes) per response. The public reporting burden for these dealers for collection-of-information on dealer reports is estimated at 0.20 hours (12 minutes) per response for the biweekly dealer reports and affixing tags, and 0.33 hours (20 minutes) per response for all bluefin tuna dealers for completing a BSD. These estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

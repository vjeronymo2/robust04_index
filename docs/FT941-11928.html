			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Consumer confidence at 19-year low in Japan Japanese consumer confidence ebbed to its lowest level for 19 years in the final quarter of 1993, it emerged yesterday. Release of the figures increased the urgency for long-awaited income tax cuts, expected tomorrow. The seven-party coalition appeared yesterday to have settled an internal row over how to fund the tax cut, the main point of an economic stimulus package estimated to be worth at least Y14,000bn (Pounds 83.83bn). Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said ministers had agreed the principle that an income tax cut must include a commitment toraise consumption tax later, to compensate for the drop in revenue. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and three senior cabinet ministers hope to put the finishing touches to the package, at a meeting today with Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The meeting is the first in the coalition's new policy of seeking the LDP's co-operation on important matters, a consequence of last weekend's compromise on political reform. Mr Hosokawaand Mr Kono will also discuss the prime minister's meeting next week with US President Bill Clinton, at which Mr Hosokawa is under domestic pressure to defuse US demands for numerically measured increases in the share of imported goods in the Japanese market. The problems the government faces in encouraging demand for any kind of product were underlined yesterday by the Economic Planning Agency's consumer confidence index for the three months to December. On a scale from zero to 100, the index sank to 35.6, down from 38.4 in the third quarter. The index is the only official survey of consumers' spending plans on durables and leisure in the six months ahead; it also covers people's general feelings about financial security and standard of living. Sentiment continued to be gloomy in the New Year, on the strength of a 6 per cent fall in vehicle sales from January 1993 to last month, the tenth monthly fall running.</p>

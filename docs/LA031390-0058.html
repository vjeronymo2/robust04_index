			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PERCEPTRONICS TO LAY OFF 50 AFTER LOSING CONTRACT  </P> <P> Perceptronics Inc. in Woodland Hills said it plans to lay off 50 workers in the  next few months because it lost a defense contract.  </P> <P> The company, which makes simulators and other training equipment, said it was  not selected to provide continued support of SIMNET training sites. SIMNET,  which Perceptronics helped develop, enables simulators of tanks, helicopters  and other defense equipment to fight one another over a computer network.  </P> <P> However, Perceptronics said, it was awarded a separate, $1.7-million contract  to provide battle-training simulators to the Taiwanese army. The 1-year  contract, Perceptronics' first with Taiwan, calls for the company to install a  system that trains commanders in simulated battlefield situations.  </P></p>

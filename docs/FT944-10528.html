			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / People: Ross Goobey puts his words into action Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel Investment Management and one of the most forceful advocates of property as a financial asset, is taking over as president of the Property Investment Forum. The Forum was set up seven years ago to debate and comment on issues relevant to the property investment community. It now has around 700 members drawn from the property, legal, actuarial and other professions. Ross Goobey's involvement is sure to raise the profile of the group. In addition to running the UK's largest pension fund, he is a former Treasury adviser to Normant Lamont and author of Bricks &amp; Mortals, a readable history of the last boom-to-bust property cycle. Yet he takes the helm of the IPF at a time when many of his peers are losing interest in property. The average pension fund now has only around 6 per cent of its assets in commercial property, against 20 per cent at the start of the 1980s. Ross Goobey believes part of the answer could be new forms of property investment, which could mean another look at ways of unitising property to appeal to fund managers.</p>

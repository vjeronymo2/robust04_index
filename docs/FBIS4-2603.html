			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- In a meeting with  M.P. Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces  of Russia, here at noon today, vice-chairman of the Central  Military Commission Liu Huaqing said he was pleased with the  smooth development of the relations between the two countries.    The commission attaches much importance to Kolesnikov's  visit  to China, and the visit will enhance understanding between the  Chinese and Russian armies, Liu said.    "The People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people have  always held deep sentiments toward their Russian counterparts,"  Liu said. "We are very glad that since their normalization, our  bilateral relations have been growing smoothly and our  friendship has been deepening."    China and Russia are two big countries, both with a long  history and ancient culture, Liu said, adding that as close  neighbors, they should develop good relations between them.    "We believe the Russian people will overcome the  difficulties  facing them presently, as the Russians are a great people and  Russia is bestowed with a good economic foundation, a huge  territory, abundant resources and wise and well-educated people.    "We believe the Russian people will build up their country  by  implementing proper policies and travelling on the right track,  and we respect the Russian people's choice."    Kolesnikov said: "We are very glad to have this opportunity  to visit our great neighbor China. Seeing is believing. After  arriving in Beijing, we have observed the huge achievements the  Chinese people have made in building their country.    "Our visit is aimed at improving friendship and  understanding  between the two armies. We wish that the friendly relations  between the armies will be further strengthened."

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Don't Look: Barbara Bush says President George Bush "spoke for all the family"  when he made a spirited defense of son Neil Bush's integrity in a savings and  loan bankruptcy case. The First Lady stopped reporters questions by telling  them: "You don't want to see a grown woman cry, do you?" She spoke on Air Force  One on the way home Wednesday night from the economic summit in Houston.  </P> <P> Look: Audrey Stevenson, 20, enters the Miss New York State Pageant in  Watertown, N.Y., Saturday night as its first deaf contestant. Stevenson, a  civilian postal clerk for the Army, stole the talent preliminary by signing the  words to "I Hear Your Hands." "I want hearing people to understand better the  world of a deaf person," said Stevenson, who speaks clearly and has been deaf  since she had meningitis when she was 18 months old.  </P> <P> Birthday, Part 1: More than 200 guests are expected when Rose Kennedy,  matriarch of America's most famous political family, celebrates her 100th  birthday Sunday at her home in Hyannisport, Mass. Her actual birthday is July  22 and will be celebrated privately. Sunday's guests include Gov. Michael  Dukakis, Cardinal Bernard Law of the Boston Catholic archdiocese and many of  Kennedy's remaining four children, 28 grandchildren and 22 great-grand-  children.  </P> <P> Birthday, Part 2: Michelle McKenna's new baby boy has great timing -- John  Patrick McKenna was born 12:34:56 7-8-90. Michelle and Brian McKenna's son was  delivered at 12:34 and 56 seconds on Sunday morning, July 8, '90 -- giving him  a string of consecutive numbers. McKenna said she lost track of time around 11  p.m. because "I was in too much discomfort really to be thinking about it."  </P></p>

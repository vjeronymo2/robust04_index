			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Court orders Tapie to pay Pounds 40m to bank Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician and businessman, yesterday lost his fight to keep control of some of his most ostentatious assets in a long-running legal dispute with his principal bank. A Paris court ordered Mr Tapie and his wife to pay FFr339m (Pounds 40m) to Credit Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making state-owned bank, because an agreement reached with them in March was no longer valid. The judgment, by Mrs Jacqueline Cochard, president of the Tribunal de Grande Instance, could trigger a rapid sale of assets controlled by Mr Tapie and pledged as security against a five-year plan to repay loans believed to total about FFr1.2bn. The Hotel de Cavoye, his luxurious mansion in the fashionable seventh arrondissement in Paris, could be up for sale by the middle of December, with some valuations putting its worth at FFr100m-FFr160m. His yacht, the Phocea, which is moored in Marseilles, his company shares, and his collection of antiques and paintings could also be sold. Credit Lyonnais said it planned to proceed with attempts to realise the assets as quickly as possible. However, Mr Tapie has said he would appeal against the judgment if it went against him, as one of a number of outstanding legal actions currently in train. In the run-up to yesterday's verdict, Credit Lyonnais had argued that Mr Tapie had failed to keep his side of the accord in March by not producing independent valuations of his assets to the deadlines previously agreed. It is likely that his assets are less than half his debts to the bank. Credit Lyonnais is still searching for some of Mr Tapie's assets, including antiques smuggled out of his Paris house over the summer. Mr Tapie has instigated a series of legal battles which will come to court over the next few weeks, but which Credit Lyonnais described as 'a strategy to win more time'. In his next appearance tomorrow, the tribunal de commerce will determine whether his companies are bankrupt.</p>

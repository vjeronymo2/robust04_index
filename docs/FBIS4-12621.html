			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz -- live]    [Text] [Gay] It will be 13 April in two days. Target  date or not, it seems to be farther away than before. A closure  has been imposed on the territories after a wave of terror  attacks, and we do not seem to be making any progress.    [Rabin] I disagree. The government has decided to opt for a  political solution on the basis of the Declaration of  Principles, signed in Washington, and the Cairo agreement, which  settled the main security points regarding Gaza and Jericho. It  states precisely that the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip  will remain there in blocs and details the travel procedures for  the Israelis there. We should remember that there are 5,000  Israelis and 750,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The  agreement also settled the problem of the border crossings, as  well as responsibility for external security on land, at sea,  and in the air. Naturally, at the same time we are dealing with  those Palestinians who fight the agreement through terrorism,  primarily against Israelis. We suffered a severe blow in the  ruthless murder in 'Afula by a suicide terrorist who activated a  car bomb near a bus stop there. We suffered many fatalities in  that instance. This war, conducted primarily against the Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad terror  organizations, continues. One of their men attacked passengers  at the Ashdod Junction. We are aware of this, and we will fight  them with all our might. I believe we will defeat them,  although we have witnessed terror attacks in the past, and I  fear that there is no hermetic solution to the problem of  terrorism. We have not achieved this in the 46 years of the  existence of the State of Israel.    Our effort today is directed at attaining a compound  solution, one aspect of which is political -- that is, getting  rid of Gaza. I would be very glad to see the moment when  Israeli soldiers, in the framework of an agreement -- not a  withdrawal without agreement -- will no longer have to move  around Greater Gaza, with its 750,000 residents, and suffer  casualties as we did during the seven years of intifadah.    [Raz] Mr. Rabin, you speak of a political effort. Will the  indefinite closure that is part of the war on terrorism, as you  announced at the cabinet session yesterday, not harm the effort  to attain an agreement with the PLO? Cabinet ministers warned  yesterday that it might make 'Arafat refuse to assume  responsibility for the territory.    [Rabin] I do not think so. I believe 'Arafat and his  followers will opt for the political solution and take charge of  the Gaza Strip -- with the exclusion of those matters we agreed  on in the Cairo agreement and the accompanying map, of course.  I believe we have the right to protect ourselves, especially  when there is a political opening and the option of reaching an  agreement. We did not suspend the discussions following a  Palestinian terror act against us; he did, after the Hebron  massacre. Therefore, we are not to blame for lost time.    The government must provide for maximum security, and this  is  not easy. For example, the car bomb that resulted in the  deplorable crime in 'Afula was stolen in Tel Aviv and bore an  Israeli license plate. Some 10,000 cars with Israeli license  plates cross from Judaea and Samaria into the territory of  Israel daily. The soldiers and policemen make every effort to  check them. Let us not forget that there are dirt roads they  can take. A suicide terrorist who is willing to die may succeed  here and there. We will do everything possible to prevent this,  but there have been five car-bomb attacks by terrorists. We are  dealing with terror organizations the likes of which we did not  know three years ago. The method of operation of Hamas and the  Islamic Jihad and their readiness to commit suicide is  reminiscent of Hizballah in Lebanon, which caused us serious  damage and many fatalities in the past. Yet we will deal with  and overcome this problem in a compound move consisting of a  political solution and military activity.    [Raz] Perhaps the best way to deal with those  organizations is not by imposing a closure but by stopping the  political process because it is causing more Israeli fatalities?    [Rabin] I believe you cannot compare the situation today  with that in the past. Stopping the negotiations would be a  victory for the enemies of peace, on the Palestinian side  primarily, as well as the opposition to peace in Israel. A  loathsome murderer who committed the crime in 'Afula should not  be rewarded by our stopping the political process.    [Gay] Are we not rewarding those who refuse to condemn it or  at least openly stand up to those who are trying to kill the  process?    [Rabin] I believe 'Arafat made a grave mistake when he did  not condemn the attack; however, his conduct is no yardstick for  the Israeli Government. Therefore, I do not believe that  stopping the negotiations is the right thing to do. It would be  giving a prize to those who kill Israelis and want to kill the  peace.    [Gay] We have heard a lot about the need to consider  'Arafat's domestic difficulties, but it seems that support for  the agreement among the Israeli people is waning.  Demonstrations against it are staged every evening at main  crossroads. Does this not worry you?    [Rabin] Allow me first to address the Palestinian side of  the issue. The fact is that I suggested imposing a closure  because, first of all, we must take every step to provide more  security for the 97 percent of Israelis who reside within the  boundaries of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem.  Naturally, we have an obligation to protect the 3 percent of  Israeli citizens who live in the territories of Judaea, Samaria,  and Gaza.    As for the opposition here, as long it is within the  boundaries of the law and is reasonable, it is legitimate in a  democratic state. I believe the extreme right has crossed red  lines. I do not recall that when the terror attack in which we  suffered the most fatalities since the State of Israel was  established took place -- I am referring to the 1978 attack on  the bus on the Coastal Road, between Herzliyya and Tel Aviv --  any of us called the government bloody or turned the blood shed  there into a tool for political gains. The time has come for  the extreme right to stop rejoicing over spilled blood.    [Raz] Let us turn to the other negotiating track: Syria.  Has there been any development there? The negotiations are to  resume at the end of this month.    [Rabin] The negotiations with Syria will resume, and I  believe that, following the new framework we discussed during my  meeting with President Clinton in the United States, we may find  a way to get the negotiations onto more reasonable tracks than  those along which they have been conducted so far in Washington.    [Raz] Is any preparatory work being done? Are there any new  tracks?    [Rabin] The problem is that there are no additional tracks  at this time. I feel, however, that the shape of the  negotiations as we knew them in Washington is no longer  appropriate. There, the Syrians demanded that Israel pledge a  full withdrawal in return for full peace, which the Syrians have  not defined. I will not accept a demand for total withdrawal as  a precondition for negotiations. Negotiations should deal with  every aspect: the nature of peace; the extent of withdrawal,  since Israel had agreed in principle to a withdrawal on the  Golan Heights; the linkage between peace and withdrawal;  security arrangements; timetables; the normalization steps to be  taken at every stage and the duration of the examination of the  normalization before we withdraw to the agreed upon line -- as  is well known, we oppose total withdrawal; and, naturally, the  U.S. contribution to fortifying Israel and to supervising the  arrangements that will be made with the Syrians in the framework  of a peace agreement. These issues will have to be examined in  a comprehensive framework and not as the Syrians have been  trying to do by saying: First say total withdrawal, and then we  will talk. This will not serve as the basis for negotiations  with Syria.    [Gay] Another issue on our agenda today: Will you make one  last move to prevent Knesset Member Hayim Ramon and his friends  from announcing that they will run on a separate list in the  Histadrut labor union elections?    [Rabin] I held quite a few discussions with Ramon in which I  did my best to convince him not to run on a separate list. I  have a lot of regard for Hayim Ramon. He was a very good  minister and a loyal partner in the last Knesset elections  campaign. I believe he will be making a grave mistake in terms  of his cause and his personal career. At the same time, he is a  big boy now and can make his own decisions. Naturally, as party  leader I believe it is a mistake to quit the party. All past  examples show this does not work: Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan,  Shim'on Peres, and many others quit MAPAI [Israel Workers Party]  in 1965, certain they could score an impressive achievement.  They won 10 Knesset seats and returned home four years later.  It would be a shame to try this again.    [Gay] Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.    [Rabin] Thank you.</p>

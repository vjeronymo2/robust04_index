			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom fights Stet for Hungarian stake Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned telecoms company, and Stet International, its Italian counterpart, were last night battling it out for the 30 per cent of Hungarian operator Matav on sale in eastern Europe's biggest privatisation. Stet, with it's consortium partner, Bell Atlantic, the US regional operator, is understood to have made the highest offer of more than Dollars 910m. Deutsche Telekom, the German state telecoms provider, and partner Ameritech, a regional Bell operating company (RBOC), are understood to have taken second place with a bid that rivals believe amounts to Dollars 860m. But Telekom and Ameritech will make up much ground in the evaluation by charging a much lower 'management fee' than the Stet alliance. Trailing is the duo of France Telecom, the state monopoly, and US West, another RBOC, which has put forward the figure of Dollars 830m. In the previous round of the tender, Stet put in by far the highest preliminary 'indicative' bid and competitors believe that backing by Simest, the Italian state investment agency, has sweetened the Italian financial calculations. Telekom and Ameritech have raised their price the most since the last stage and the increase contributed to the withdrawal earlier this week of the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless from their consortium. Observers believe, though officials deny, that nationality is a factor as well as price. Germany, home to Telekom, is Hungary's closest western friend. Alitalia, the Italian national airline, last year took a stake in Hungarian carrier Malev and Budapest is reluctant to see Italian involvement in another strategic company. Budapest will also give weight to the technical quality of the submissions and US West had banked on a vision of bringing broadband, multi-media networks to Hungary. Rival contenders nevertheless claim equal if not greater technological expertise and most observers doubt whether the prospect of services like video-on-demand has much appeal in a country where 700,000-800,000 of a population of 10m are waiting for a telephone line.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- The economic  returns for China's manufacturing sector improved markedly last  year as its industrial production continued to grow fast,  according to an official report.    The comprehensive economic returns index for China's  manufacturing industries reached 96.6 in 1993, an increase of  about 7 percentage points over the previous year, said a report  jointly issued by the State Statistics Bureau, the State  Planning Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission.    The report, which was released here today, said that profits  and taxes made and handed over by industrial firms at and above  the township levels increased by 36.8 percent last year over the  previous year. Profits made by the firms totalled 145.2 billion  yuan (about 16.68 billion U.S. dollars), up 62.4 percent over  the previous year.    The comprehensive economic returns index for China's large  and medium-sized enterprises climbed to 106, about 9 percentage  points above the country's average.    The report said that this shows the advantages of those  firms  in production scale, management, technology and equipment.    The comprehensive economic returns index for industrial  enterprises of other ownerships including foreign-funded firms  is 134, 37 percentage points higher than the country's average.    In comparison, collectively-owned industrial firms in China  are still falling behind in economic performance.    According to the report, heavy industry performed better  than  light industry and the gap between them has been gradually  narrowed.    Driven by excessive investment in fixed assets and growing  demand, heavy industry recorded better production performance  and sales of products. Its economic returns are much better  than light industry.    Statistics show that the comprehensive economic returns  index  for heavy industry is about 103, compared with 93 for light  industry.    About one quarter of heavy industry is operating at a loss,  compared with 36 percent of light industrial firms in the red.    The State Statistics Bureau said that industrial growth is  still characterized by extensive development, low economic  returns and imbalance. The improvement of economic returns  depends on the expansion of production scales and price rises.    Officials attributed the low economic returns to increasing  expenditure by industrial firms and their decreasing profits.    They said that irrational industrial structure is still an  outstanding factor affecting the improvement of economic returns  since at present the country's total supply meets the total  demand.    Excessive investment and irrational investment structure and  revenue distribution systems are responsible for the problems,  the officials said.    The report said China should maintain a reasonable  industrial  growth rate and pay more attention to the improvement of  economic returns so that industrial production will grow in a  sustained, fast and healthy way.</p>

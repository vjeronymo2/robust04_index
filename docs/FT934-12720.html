			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Canada's Liberals set to gain power CANADA'S Liberal party led by Mr Jean Chretien early today appeared headed for a landslide victory in the country's general election. Partial results indicated a resounding defeat for the Progressive Conservative party of Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's first woman prime minister. The Conservatives, who had held power for nine years under Mr Brian Mulroney and then Ms Campbell, suffered a sharp drop in popularity because of recession and high unemployment. Soon after polls closed in the eastern and central parts of the country, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation predicted the Liberals would have enough seats in the 295-seat House of Commons to form a government without having to rely on a coalition partner. Liberal candidates were elected or were leading in as many as 170 seats as counting went on early today, with the Conservatives ahead in only three. The Liberals were expected to fare less well in western Canada, where the polls closed three hours after those in Quebec and Ontario. In Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois, whose main aim is to take the French-speaking province out of Canada, won about 50 of the 75 seats. The final outcome of the election was expected to hinge on results from the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Support for the Conservatives in these provinces has been heavily eroded by the right-wing Reform party, which was expected to end up with several dozen seats in the new parliament. The Reform party also split the vote in Ontario, allowing the Liberals to sweep nearly all of the province's 99 seats. Mr Chretien, 59, a Quebec lawyer, campaigned hard for the Liberals with a pledge to create jobs with a public works programme. He also promised to try to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico. A passionate believer that Quebec should stay within Canada, he easily won his own constituency in the province, fighting off a challenge from a separatist opponent. A veteran politician, he has held cabinet posts under three prime ministers - Lester Pearson, Pierre Trudeau and John Turner. With the Conservatives facing humiliating losses, it was not clear which party would form the official opposition. The Bloc Quebecois appeared well placed to take on this role - ironically, in view of its aim of breaking away. Picture, Page 6</p>

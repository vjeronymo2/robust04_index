Borovskaya; place and date not  given: "It Is Easier To Win in Elections With Numbers; as Well  as in Life"]    [Text] [Borovskaya] To begin with, I would like to  congratulate you on the occasion of being elected a deputy to  the Council of the Federation.    [Matochkin] Thank you.    [Borovskaya] How do you assess the results of the elections  to the Council of the Federation in our oblast?    [Matochkin] The situation in the Kaliningrad Oblast is  similar to that in Russia. However, we should study this  situation, make conclusions, and weigh our mistakes.    The distribution of political forces during the elections in  Kaliningrad Oblast is not so gloomy. In my opinion, despite a  high percentage of voters who had supported Zhirinovskiy, the  majority of our people favor reforms. The majority of the  population have voted for democrats. They number some 75  percent of the entire electorate.    [Borovskaya] How can you explain why Kaliningrad citizens --  despite all the complexities of our life -- traditionally  support democratic trends?    [Matochkin] I would not speak about our democratic  traditions. If you remember, during the presidential elections  our citizens voted not for Yeltsin but for Zhirinovskiy?    However, after August 1991, public opinion began to change.  That means that reforms began to work. The results of the  April referendum in 1993, as well as the December elections in  1993 proved this change.    [Borovskaya] Maybe our geopolitical localization is a  factor.... Kaliningrad citizens see how the surrounding world  is living, they believe that their life cannot be worse. Maybe  this factor differentiates us from outlying Russian provinces?    [Matochkin] In my opinion, you are right. In fact, we see  how people in other states, where radical reforms are  implemented, live. This affects the state of mind, gives the  impression of the irreversibility of changes.    [Borovskaya] Before the elections, you were hesitant either  to run in the elections or to quit this idea. You do not regret  your decision....    [Matochkin] I am used to working with numbers. I am not an  emotional person. Speaking sincerely, we -- the heads of the  local administration -- have found ourselves in a dubious  situation. If, according to the Constitution, only one  representative of legislative and executive branches could run  in the elections, how should the acting leaders of the  administration behave? If the electorate does not elect me, how  can I remain in the same position?    Yes, I was hesitant. I understood that I was taking risks,  and some of my colleagues persuaded me not to participate in the  elections. Therefore, I studied the situation through poll  results. When in the last decade of the elections I understood  what category of population supports me, I felt more confident.  I understood that I had a moral right to represent our oblast  in the new Russian legislature.    [Borovskaya] I have heard that your people had facilitated  your elections by neutralizing your opponent Leonid Gorbenko and  by pressing our Duma Deputy Yuriy Voyevoda....    [Matochkin] From the start, we -- Leonid Gorbenko and I --  were in tandem. At that time, Shumeyko was not yet running in  the elections and Gorbenko's rating was high. Over the last  decade, everything changed. However, Leonid Gorbenko matched  this situation perfectly well, and I had no reason to put him  out of the elections.    On 7 December, I met with him and discussed the situation.  All of a sudden, I received a phone call informing me that he  had withdrawn his candidacy. It was a surprise to me. He had  destroyed the planned situation. We knew who would receive his  votes.    This turn of events was undesirable and sudden. I did not  authorize anyone to talk to Leonid Gorbenko and if someone has  taken the initiative, this is another case. In addition, I did  not ask anyone to persuade Yuriy Voyevoda to withdraw his  candidacy in exchange for my chair in the local administration.  It is nonsense. How can you appoint an officer on active duty  to a civil position?    [Borovskaya] That is clear. What about Shumeyko? We elected  him according to his official post. We required a person in the  government who could patronize the entire oblast. However, he  can currently head the Council of the Federation. What will the  oblast get from his election?    [Matochkin] He would be of greater use to us if he became a  member of the government. However, if he becomes the chairman  of the Council of the Federation, he could aid us in resolving  the status of our oblast.    [Borovskaya] In my mind, we owe the rapid adoption of the  edict "On Kaliningrad Oblast" to Shumeyko. Does this edict  summarize our achievements in this sphere?    [Matochkin] Yes. Despite the fact that the edict has no word  combination "free trade zone," it contains elements of "free  trade zone" regulations, in particular, the lifting of  export-import duty limitations and the introduction of tax  breaks.    [Borovskaya] This edict has come into force from the moment  it was signed, has it not? Is it currently being implemented?    [Matochkin] Yes, the edict has come into force. However, the  mechanism for its implementation has not yet been developed.  For example, what about customs duties? The value-added tax  has been lifted, however, there are no regulations on how it  should be lifted.    [Borovskaya] Who develops this mechanism: Moscow or  Kaliningrad?    [Matochkin] All the documents are being drafted here.  Later, they are sent to Moscow. We have to do a lot of work.  For example, the issue of earmarking a tax credit for  investments. What documents are required, who issues this  credit, and so on. Such questions are arising on each and every  issue. Each paragraph should be thoroughly developed, and the  initiative is always in our hands.    How has the federal program for development of Kaliningrad  Oblast appeared? I met with Chernomyrdin and said that we badly  needed such a program. The Economy Ministry has allocated 170  million rubles to its draft. Researchers from the Central  Research Institute for Economic Issues, who had been charged  with drafting this program, have already visited Kaliningrad.  By the end of March 1994, we should present this draft program  to the government.    [Borovskaya] What does this program give Kaliningrad?    [Matochkin] We want to provide centralized financing to the  sites that are of all-Russian importance, such as airports,  seaports....    [Borovskaya] Under the former Supreme Soviet, attempts to  receive our "own" law were enviously met by the representatives  of other regions. Similar people will come to the Federal  Duma....    [Matochkin] We hope for the wisdom of the new Duma. We are  going to explain our position. Currently, we are working on  holding an international forum of Baltic states. It will be  held in March in Sopot [Poland]. We invite representatives of  all the oblasts of the North-West region and Central Russia to  participate in this forum.    [Borovskaya] However, if your explanations do not help, what  will happen then?    [Matochkin] Then, we will hold a referendum in Kaliningrad.  The Council of the Federation will have to consider the  viewpoint of the Federation. However, I am not a pessimist.  Not a single initiative was left without the support of the  president and the government. Deputies will debate this issue  but the issue should be positively resolved.    [Borovskaya] Does this edict give our free trade zone any  advantages before the other free trade zones of Russia?    [Matochkin] Are there any other zones? In the opinion of the  international community, there are two such zones in Russia --  in Kaliningrad and Nakhodka. We are in a more advantageous  position than Nakhodka is. However, it has more natural  resources and a larger territory. We have a bigger foreign  investment sector -- 9.5 percent of the total sum of Russian  foreign investments.    Our ports are processing 4.5 million tonnes of freight (St.  Petersburg -- 15-20 tonnes of freight). We can increase this  figure to 10 million tonnes, and our final goal is to process  30-40 million tonnes of freight.    [Borovskaya] Recently, Pavel Globa [famous CIS astrologist]  has published his terrible prognosis of our near and distant  future. What are your predictions at the beginning of the new  year?    [Matochkin] I am not an opponent of Globa. Each of us has  his  own profession and earns money the way he can. However, we  should become realists: If we begin to consider modern trends in  the development of production, the tempos of collapse will  decrease. I foresee the lowest critical level in 1994-95. We  will not have worse times than we have already lived through.  At the same time, two menacing specters are currently alarming  me -- the rise of unemployment and the bankruptcy of  enterprises. We should take some measures, in particular, to  protect small- and medium-size business which must create new  jobs for the unemployed. We are establishing a fund to protect  these small- and medium-size businesses so that people are able  to get credits for building their own workshops. However,  bankruptcy is not as alarming; it just means changing the owner.    By the way, I have data showing that Kaliningrad citizens  not  only look at consumer goods in our shops but they buy them. In  nine positions out of 20, Kaliningrad consumption indexes are  higher in 1993 than in 1992.    It is important not to frighten ourselves with various  troubles. Then our life will become better. This is my New Year  wish.</p>

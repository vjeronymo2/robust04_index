			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 18, BNS -- A meeting of Estonia's  rightist forces yesterday in the south Estonian town of Voru  adopted the statutes of the Parem-Eesti (Rightist Estonia or  Better Estonia) national alliance. Juri Estam, head of the  Estonian Association of Owners by Law and a well-known  television personality, was unanimously elected chairman of the  organization.    Parem-Eesti unites right-of-center parties and organizations  that intend to go to the next parliamentary election on a  coalition platform. Under the statutes, former members of the  Communist Party and employees of repressive organs like the KGB  cannot belong to the leading bodies of the alliance or run in  election on its ticket.    The eight-member board of Parem-Eesti includes, besides  Estam, representatives from the Estonian National Progress  Party, the Estonian National Party, and four other rightist  groups and associations.</p>

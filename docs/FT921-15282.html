			<p>920110 FT  10 JAN 92 / Algerian militants defy ban SEVERAL hundred Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) supporters marched chanting through central Algiers yesterday, despite a ban on marches during election campaigning, agencies report from Algiers. The FIS militants chanted support for Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, two of the party's leaders detained by the military last June when unrest forced the postponement of Algeria's first multiparty general election. The FIS seized a commanding lead in the first round poll last month and appears set to win a parliamentary majority in the ballot for undecided seats next Thursday. The Tunisian government, alarmed at the prospect of an electoral victory by Algerian fundamentalists has told its security forces to be on the alert and ready for sacrifice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] One of the last remnants of the Iron Curtain which  Russia inherited from the Soviet Union has fallen. Strict  control of foreign vessels is no longer being implemented by  border guards of the Nakhodka independent control and entry  point. Their squads are no longer being posted on the decks of  foreign freighters tying up at moorings in Nakhodka and  Vostochnyy ports.    Lengthy round-the-clock watches in any weather monitoring  foreigners in all Russian ports hardly corresponds with the  democratic principles of the country's development. Besides it  was quite costly, so the command of border guards in Maritime  Kray decided to relinquish the old methods of monitoring  arriving vessels. Their crews will now carry out their own  watch on the gangway in accordance with the rules of maritime  service. They will also decide for themselves who to permit or  not permit on board. The border guards detachments that carried  out this work will now be used to guard the state border --  their primary task.</p>

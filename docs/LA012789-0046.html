			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF PARKING TO BE ADDRESSED LATER;  </P> <P> TOWN CENTER CHOSEN FOR PLANNED PENASQUITOS LIBRARY  </P> <P> Libraries should be built in the center of things, where youngsters and  oldsters can visit on foot, city planning commissioners unanimously decided  Thursday in voting to put a proposed library in the Rancho Penasquitos Town  Centre.  </P> <P> An alternate library site on the rim of Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve was  championed by city librarian Bill Sannwald, who pointed out that parking in the  commercial center would be nearly impossible, but commissioners decided to  solve that problem later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Debate Over Need  </P> <P> Though nearly all of Rancho Penasquitos' 33,000 residents favor construction of  a larger library for the community, the issue of where the building should go  has split the San Diego suburb for nearly two years, since Councilwoman Abbe  Wolfsheimer proposed the alternate site on city open space at the preserve's  edge.  </P> <P> The issue won't be settled until the City Council makes the final ruling at a  hearing expected to be held before April 1.  </P> <P> Newland California, a major Penasquitos developer, has promised to donate the  1.5-acre town center site for the library if a site decision is made by April  1. If not, the land will be granted to the YMCA for parking for its proposed  building and day-care center, the developer said.  </P> <P> The alternate site, half a mile south of the town center, drew opposition from  some nearby residents because of added noise and traffic it would bring. It was  also opposed by some environmentalists, who felt that the site was part of the  canyon preserve and that the library would set a precedent for further  intrusion.  </P> <P> Sannwald conceded that the town center was more accessible for pedestrians and  motorists, but he stressed that an earlier approval of the YMCA building meant  that there would not be adequate parking for either facility.  </P> <P> The alternate site, near Calle de las Rosas and Salmon River Road, contains 5.3  acres, adequate for the library, parking and natural landscaping to tie the  library in with the preserve.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Matter of Convenience  </P> <P> Commissioner Lynn Benn echoed the comments of several planning board members  when she commented that the library should be near schools and elderly housing  so residents without cars can reach it on foot.  </P> <P> "There are many latchkey children nowadays, and they should have positive  places to go after school," Benn said.  </P> <P> Kathleen Zaworski-Burke, a Penasquitos activist, said the community  "desperately needs both the library and the Y." She argued that the remaining  vacant land within the town center could not accommodate the space needs of  both ventures. She favored relocating the library to the canyon rim as the best  solution for the situation, which, she said, resulted from "poor planning."  </P> <P> City planner Mike Westlake said his department favored the town site because  putting the library on the canyon would harm the neighborhood by increasing  density, raising traffic to 38% over rated street capacity and damaging the  view with grading on the canyon rim.  </P></p>

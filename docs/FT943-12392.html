			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Kok coalition would cut social spending The Dutch caretaker finance minister, Mr Wim Kok, yesterday put forward a government coalition plan that emphasises 'stiff' cuts in social spending and a determined focus on creating jobs. The proposals, which Mr Kok described as painful but necessary, are designed to break a political deadlock that has prevented the formation of a new government since general elections in May. The government impasse is partly the result of the inconclusive election, but the search for a coalition has also been complicated by sharp differences over social security reform between Labour and the right-wing Liberals. Mr Kok called on the country's four main political parties to respond to his proposals by midnight tonight. He then hopes to be able to advise Queen Beatrix within a week on which parties should launch detailed negotiations on forming a government. He declined to say which coalition he thought most likely. 'This is not a betting shop,' he said at a news conference. 'I'm not going to make predictions.' However, Mr Kok is likely to be the next prime minister provided his own Labour party approves his programme and agrees to take part in the coalition. His 59-page document, written at the request of the queen, is the second serious effort to form a government. A previous attempt to put together a coalition between Labour, the Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 party failed in late June after a disagreement on the specifics of social spending policy. Mr Kok's new proposals call for nearly Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in total spending cuts, about the same volume as agreed loosely by Labour, Liberals and D66. However, his suggestions on social spending reductions are detailed, meeting an objection raised earlier by the Liberals. His proposals cover many types of 'cradle to grave' expenditure that are bound to be controversial. Child benefit would fall in real terms, student grants would be lowered, early retirement for government officials would be curtailed, and funds for widows and orphans would be reserved for those in genuine need. Nevertheless, Mr Kok has remained loyal to his Labour roots by shying away from cutting the amount of money paid to social welfare recipients or shortening their period of eligibility for payments. He also proposed cuts in taxes and social security premiums totalling around Fl 9bn. The goal of the next government should be to get as many people back to work as possible, he said. According to his calculations, some 350,000 jobs could be created over the next four years, more than compensating for the expected entry of 300,000 people on to the labour market in the same period. The country's budget deficit would remain stable at around 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product next year but would fall to at least 2.9 per cent by 1998. It is not yet clear whether the outgoing Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' Christian Democrats will become part of a new government. If not, this will mark the first time that the party has been relegated to the opposition benches in modern Dutch politics. Mr Lubbers had said at the beginning of his current term that he would not seek re-election.</p>

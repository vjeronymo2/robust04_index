			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 May, the regional party committee and people's  government held a regional family planning work meeting in  Nanning to relay and implement the spirit of the Fourth Central  Discussion on Family Planning Work, analyze the present  population situation, unify understanding, exchange experiences,  and to study and make arrangements for family planning work in  our region this year. Regional party, government, and military  leaders who attended the meeting included [provincial party  Secretary] Zhao Fulin, [provincial Governor] Cheng Kejie,  [congress head] Liu Mingzu, Ding Tingmo, Li Zhenqian, Peng  Guikang, Li Enchao, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang, Zhi Zhaotang,  Chen Ren, Huang Yuyang, Mao Guobin, Rui Qingkai, and others.    The meeting was presided over by regional party Deputy  Secretary Ding Tingmo. Regional Chairman Cheng Kejie first  relayed the spirit of the Fourth Central Discussion on Family  Planning Work and made arrangements for family planning work in  our region this year. He pointed out: Leaders at all levels  must fully understand the current population situation in our  region and further grasp family planning work in a firm and  effective manner. Last year, thanks to the concern and  leadership of the party committees and governments at all  levels, our region fulfilled the population control plan  assigned by the state. This was not an easy job. However, we  must realize soberly that the present population situation in  our region is still grave as is mainly reflected in the  following:    1. Our population base is large and comprises many young  people with a rapid population growth rate;    2. Our foundation for family planning work is weak;    3. There are new situation and problems arising in family  planning work in the course of establishing a socialist market  economic system; in particular, an increase in the floating  population in cities and towns has made our family planning work  more difficult.    We must seriously deal with these problems. We must  persistently and unswervingly treat control over population  growth as a fundamental task in economic development. Cheng  Kejie continued: Our region's targets for population control  this year have been examined, discussed, and approved by the  Second Session of the Eighth Regional People's Congress. In  other words, our natural population growth rate must be  controlled within the range of 14.04 per mill. The birth rate,  population natural growth rate, and additional births rate must  be lower than last year. The birth control rate must be  increased to over 80 percent. To fulfill the abovementioned  targets, the regional people's government urges leaders at all  levels to truly grasp family planning work. This problem must  be handled seriously. Leaders must do a solid job of paying  attention to the grass-roots levels, laying a good foundation,  and constantly helping to enhance grass-roots units' capability  to control population growth. It is necessary to strengthen the  building of the family planning contingent at the grass-roots  level and put effort into improving the quality of the cadres'  contingent and closely linking propaganda and ideological work  with management according to law. It is necessary to compile  population statistics properly. Starting from this year,  regional authorities will organize forces to examine and check  population statistics. In places where population statistics  are grossly inaccurate, the relevant leaders and the specific  persons in charge will be held accountable in a serious manner.  Under the new situation, we must persist in carrying out  reform, explore the way forward, and work in a down-to-earth  manner to raise our region's family planning work to a new level.    At the meeting, Secretary Zhao Fulin aired his views on  grasping our region's family planning work properly this year.  He stressed: Leaders at all levels must conscientiously study  and resolutely implement the spirit of the central discussion on  family planning work. They must make an overall analysis of the  population situation and family grasp planning work in a strict  and unshakable manner. At present, we must particularly grasp  family planning work in rural areas. We must assign cadres  responsible for family planning work and their remuneration,  duties, and responsibilities must be clearly defined. Births  not covered by the state plan, or additional births, must be  resolutely banned. Additional births must be controlled within  the range of less than 5 percent. In addition, we must attach  importance to family planning work in areas inhabited by  minority nationalities.    Zhao Fulin pointed out: Under the new situation of  establishing our socialist market economic system, we must  actively explore and expand new methods of family planning work.  The foothold of family planning work must be shifted to the  center of serving economic construction. In this regard, the  Guilin area has accumulated some excellent experiences. Facts  prove that the three-way combination in family planning work is  beneficial to coordinate the development of the population,  economy, and society. The whole region must sum up and  popularize the advanced experiences of the Guilin area. As far  as strengthening leadership is concerned, we must insist that  those number one men in the party and government personally  grasp family planning work and take full responsibility for it.  They must put family planning high on their important work  agenda and personally preside over party and government meetings  to specially discuss family planning issues. They must listen  to work reports regularly, investigate implementation of the  population plan, and ensure that work is carried out in a  planned way, arrangements are properly made, investigations are  conducted, and plans are implemented. Prefectural, city, and  county leaders must include a population plan in the local  overall plans for economic and social development and see to it  that the plan is implemented. Family planning work must be  regarded as an important factor determining party and government  cadres' achievements, awards and commendation, and promotion.  In a word, as long as those number one men in the party and  government truly attach importance to family planning work, and  grasp it personally, family planning work can definitely be  carried out well.    Lan Siqi, chairman of the regional family planning  commission, briefed attendees on the family planning situation  in our region last year and on work plans for this year. At the  meeting, the Guilin, Yulin, and Nanning areas and Beihai City  passed on their experiences in three-way combination, helping  counties attain their targets, and carrying out family planning  work well.    Party and government leaders from various prefectures,  cities  and counties, as well as relevant departments directly under the  regional authorities also attended the meeting.</p>

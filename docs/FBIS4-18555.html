			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "J.F.": "Call for Majority Unity"] </F>   [Text] Edouard Balladur is moving closer and closer to the  presidential election, without wishing to say so clearly.  Yesterday, in the National Assembly or, briefly, on the FR3  television news, he tried to step up his little declarations of  intention, showing that he was in the race but without  committing himself any further. "I accept the presidential  risk," he said on camera. "We (the French people) feel a need  for unity and cohesion." The majority needs to unite on clear  and coherent ideas to steer France out of the economic impasse  and avert a damaging leadership struggle. "Have I not always  said that we could only succeed together? Otherwise...."    Otherwise chaos will ensue. Once again, yesterday, the prime  minister reaffirmed in less and less veiled terms, that it is  his policy which will be judged by the French people next year.  And he is hinting more and more that if this policy succeeds,  the majority will remain in power, whereas, if it fails, it will  have to return to the opposition. In this hypothesis, who would  be in a better position than him to defend "the government's  policy" before the voters in the presidential election?    With regard to the CIP [Job Training Contracts] issue, Mr.  Balladur, who has been given a rough ride by his political  friends in the National Assembly, explained on television in the  evening that the role of a prime minister was not to impose any  reform, but to ensure that it was understood and adopted by the  people. "There has been a misunderstanding between some young  people and the government," he said. On that basis, the crucial  thing was to find areas of agreement among the French people  rather than cultivating "pointless divisions." The CIP was  withdrawn to avoid aggravating this social tension, although the  prime minister remains convinced that it could enable large  numbers of young people to find their first job. Other more  flexible provisions will be adopted to achieve the same goal:  the reduction in unemployment.  <H5>  Convincing </H5>   "My approach, which is primarily to listen, is the right  one," Mr. Balladur said. "Violence is unacceptable," he added,  and the demonstrations, in his view, were merely a pretext for  some people. They are the sign "that we have problems of moral,  social, and national cohesion to be tackled." But France's  economy is doing better and these problems should be settled in  turn. But this does not mean calling into question the  five-year law on employment, as some deputies are demanding. To  make progress, Mr. Balladur said, it is necessary to consult,  explain, and convince.    The prime minister is warning the majority but without  wishing to enter into personal disputes. "I am in the habit of  never judging the statements of others." But, he added, my task  has been "the most difficult since the war. Today, things are  going better. A great deal remains to be done, and we will not  achieve anything if we spend our time fighting among ourselves."</p>

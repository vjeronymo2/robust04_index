			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Laidlaw and ADT reach agreement PUBLIC feuding at ADT, the security and car auctions group, ended yesterday when Laidlaw, its largest shareholder, withdrew its litigation alleging fraud in return for a board-room shake-up and the establishment of an independent audit committee. The agreement gives the Canadian waste-management company four seats on an expanded ADT board and allows for four independent board members to review the allegations Laidlaw made in its New York case on April 1. In a joint statement from New York, Mr Donald Jackson and Mr Michael Ashcroft, the chief executives of Laidlaw and ADT respectively, welcomed the agreement as an opportunity to work together for the benefit of shareholders. ADT's share price, which fell to a low of 64p in London earlier this month from almost 200p a year ago, rose following the announcement in New York where it is quoted on NASDAQ. The agreement brings to an end the public phase of the board-room struggle that began when Laidlaw alleged in a New York court that ADT and some directors had manipulated its share price by manufacturing an illusory profit stream through asset transactions. Mr Peter Widdrington, non-executive chairman of Laidlaw, said the establishment of an audit committee met in full the company's worries about the corporate governance of ADT. 'You have a consideration of getting on with the business at hand while not whitewashing the issues,' he said. The agreement, which is encapsulated in a contract, specifies that ADT is to allow Mr William Stinson, chairman and chief executive of Canadian Pacific to join ADT's board. Canadian Pacific has a controlling interest in Laidlaw which has seen the book value of its ADT investment fall Dollars 450m over a year. Three Laidlaw directors willjoin the ADT board immediately, ahead of an annual general meeting on June 3 in Bermuda, where ADT is registered. Until yesterday's agreement Laidlaw had no board representation despite having a 28.4 per cent stake. The agreement calls for an application to be made to the New York Stock Exchange for a full listing. The audit commitee will be able to look at whether ADT fairly represented and reported past transactions and whether they accord with UK accounting standards.</p>

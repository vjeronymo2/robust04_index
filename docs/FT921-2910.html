			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Deluge of Mozart to hit the airwaves LATER this year the airwaves will be alive with the sound of Mozart and Beethoven, as Britain's first national commercial classical music station goes on air. Classic FM, which won the first of three new national commercial licences, hopes to launch in September with an unashamedly popular schedule of classical music aimed at members of the ABC1 social group aged 25 to 54. There will be plenty of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, Lalo's Spanish Symphony, Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik and, of course, Beethoven's greatest hits. The music will change subtly during the day. During the peak periods for radio - the drive to work and return-home hours  - will be lots of Mozart. The pieces will have to be short to fit in with regular news, traffic and weather bulletins, plus advertisements. In the evenings there will be time for concerts. Mr Ralph Bernard, chief executive of GWR, the Bristol-based group of commercial radio stations, said: 'The music has to fit. There are commercial considerations which have to be met to make the station successful.' GWR is an investor in Classic FM and will manage it on behalf of the other investors, Sir Peter Michael, chairman of Cray Electronics, Time Warner, the US media group, Mr Brian Brolley, former managing director of The Really Useful Group, and Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail. Classic FM, which bid Pounds 670,000 a year for the franchise, and must also pay Pounds 1m a year for the licence and 4 per cent of qualifying advertising revenue, does not see the BBC's Radio 3 as its target. Research suggests it is more likely to take listeners from Radio 4 and upwardly mobile sections of the Radio 1 audience. Mr Bernard suggested, however, Radio 3, which broadcasts classical music and speech, could face a dilemma in deciding how to respond to the competition. 'They will have to walk carefully between retaining their very, very loyal listeners, who will go potty if changes are made, and meeting the commercial challenge,' the GWR executive said. Classic FM, which has raised Pounds 6.5m, is already broadcasting trial transmissions in six parts of the country. It is likely to cost between Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m a year to run, including transmitter costs and music royalty fees, but Mr Bernard believes that providing a national service of popular classical music, plus regular news, will turn out to be a lucrative business.</p>

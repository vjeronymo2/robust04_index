			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION  </P> <P> Abortion is a surface solution to a root problem. The root problem is the  unwillingness of men and women to accept the consequences of their choice to  have sex. The exercise of one's free choice to have sex has social  consequences, be it babies or sexually transmitted diseases. With freedom comes  responsibility. Any exercise of personal rights must be balanced against the  rights of others, including the unborn. I applaud the court's move to correct  the self-centered mentality of this "me-first" generation.  </P> <P> DEANNA CURLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

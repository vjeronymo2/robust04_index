			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by J.P.C.: "Minister of Defense Wants To Make up </F> for Rafale Delays;" introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Text] Francois Leotard wants to include money in the  next Military Planning Law to make up for delays in the Rafale  program.    Last Saturday, while coming down the accommodation ladder  from the Rafale B01 on which he had just spent nearly an hour in  the air, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard took pains to  reassure the Air Force, which is worried about delays in the  Rafale program. He announced that the next planning law,  covering the period from 1994 to 2000 and due to be submitted to  Parliament at its spring session, would provide funds for  bringing the Rafale program up to date.    He also confirmed that he had decided to release the  purchase  orders covering 37 Mirage 2000-5's for the Air Force. Their  delivery will begin at the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997.  That decision is borne out by Jacques Vedel, director of  aeronautical construction, who has just officially announced  those contracts, which have an estimated value of from 4 billion  to 5 billion francs. This project for modernizing the existing  Mirage 2000's (replacing their radars with RDY radars and  improving their countermeasures) will reduce the losses suffered  by manufacturers due to delays with the Rafale (see AIR &amp;  COSMOS  No. 1449) and enable the pilots to hold out until the Rafales  arrive in their units.    Following his 55-minute flight, the minister found it hard  to  conceal his satisfaction. "It is a wonderful aircraft that seems  very simple to pilot," he said. "One feels as safe there as one  does in one of Air Inter's Airbus aircraft." With Captain  Philippe Rebourg, a Rafale test pilot at the Flight Test Center  (CEV), as his pilot, the minister got a general idea of the  aircraft's flight characteristics as it flew at sharp angles of  incidence, engaged in supersonic flight at Mach 1.4, and then  made a pass at low-altitude (2,000 meters) over the town of  Frejus, where he is mayor. Although this 59th test flight by the  Rafale B01 was somewhat out of the ordinary, it was nevertheless  followed from the real-time test control center at Istres by  Marc Tourtoulon, the engineer responsible for the Rafale at  Istres.    Francois Leotard's flight at Istres marks the second visit  by  the minister of defense to the test base headed by Francois  Naville. He was also able to assess the Rafale's flight  characteristics last 17 May, but on that occasion he did so only  through a simulator. This time he went all the way by actually  flying on the B01. The flight was rated exceptional by Weapons  Inspector General Herve Groualle, director of the CEV. "To my  knowledge, this is the first time that a minister has flown on a  prototype fighter aircraft with scarcely 50 flying hours to its  credit," he said. "That is additional proof that the program is  progressing smoothly." Francois Leotard also acknowledged his  admiration for the links in "the chain that developed this  aircraft: the DGA [General Delegation for Weapons], the CEV, the  manufacturers, and the military who have achieved one of French  industry's finest successes."    Actually, the minister had not come to Istres solely to fly  on the Rafale. He also wanted to convey a message of confidence  in and support for the manufacturers present for the occasion:  Serge Dassault, president of Dassault Aviation and Gifas; Gerard  Renon, president-chief executive officer of Snecma; and Noel  Forgeard, president-chief executive officer of Matra Defense.  "The reason I am taking this step is that I believe in this  program and want to show my belief to those outside France," he  said, reaffirming the fact that providing political support for  French export products is part of his job as a minister.</p>

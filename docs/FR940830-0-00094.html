HUD will also review an IHA's progress against the implementation schedules for purposes of determining whether the IHA has carried out its modernization activities in a timely manner;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Carried out its activities under the CGP program, as well as the CIAP, in a timely manner, taking into account the level of funding available and whether the IHA obligates its modernization funds within two years from the execution of the ACC amendment and expends such modernization funds within three years of ACC amendment execution, or such longer period where approved by HUD or where extended by the IHA for reasons outside of its control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) *&blank;*&blank; *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) With respect to the management condition of the IHA, whether the IHA has achieved, or is making reasonable progress in implementing, the work items (specified in its Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan), which are designed to address deficiencies identified in its management needs assessment or through audits or HUD reviews; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In determining whether the IHA has made reasonable progress, HUD will take into account the level of funding available and whether the IHA obligates its modernization funds within two years from the execution of the ACC amendment and expends such modernization funds within three years of ACC amendment execution, or such longer period if approved by HUD or extended by the IHA for reasons outside of its control in an implementation schedule. The IHA must demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that any lack of timeliness (beyond the time periods specified in this paragraph or date specified in a HUD approved implementation schedule) has resulted from factors beyond the IHA's control. If the IHA fails to obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the IHA may be subject to an alternative management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function. HUD would only require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under this section and the IHA failed to comply with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a correction action order. An IHA may appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within 30 calendar days of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on an IHA's appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of its receipt of the IHA's appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Submit detailed schedules for completing the work identified in its Annual Statements and report periodically on its progress on meeting the schedules;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Submit additional material in support of one or more of the statements, resolutions, and certifications submitted as part of the IHA's Comprehensive Plan, Five-Year Action Plan, or Performance and Evaluation Report;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Submit to an alternative management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function (see &sect;905.669(d)); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

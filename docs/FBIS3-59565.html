			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is no specific EC funding program for  aeronautical research and the aeronautical industries have been  far from privileged in the Fourth Framework Program for  research. This is the underlying theme of a series of meetings  that Germany and Italy are conducting with the European  Commissions. As a result of these meetings, a letter has been  sent from the European Aerospace Industry Council to the vice  presidents of the European Commissions. This issue of AIR PRESS  refers to the aforementioned letter.  <H5>  A Text that is Worse than the Last </H5>   In particular, it has been pointed out that despite the fact  that the aeronautical sector is of strategic importance, the  Fourth Framework Program has continued to privilege computer  science, telecommunications, and information systems. Our AIA  (Association of Aerospace Industries) has also underlined this  fact in memoranda that have been delivered, after meetings in  Brussels, to Vice Presidents Antonio Ruberti and Vanni  D'Archirafi, to the plenipotentiary minister and deputy  permanent representative Rocco Antonio Cangelosi, to Ambassador  Enzo Perlot, who is Italy's permanent representative to the  European Community. These three sectors absorb 36 percent of  the ECU10.9 billion in funding budgeted under the so-called  "first action." ECU1.8 billion have been set aside for  industrial technologies listed in descending order of priority.  However, while it is true that under this item there is a  section dedicated to advanced propulsion technologies that could  also have some aeronautical interest, there also seems to be  very little space dedicated to activities and research that are  not closely tied to propulsion. It would be very fragmentary  for the aeronautical industries to carry out research programs  that were dedicated solely to propulsion, as emerges now from  the original test produced by the Commission.    The Fourth Framework Program could also involve the  aeronautical sector, although it does not do so specifically.  Not only is there no section entitled "Aerospace," but as the  AIA pointed out during their meetings in Brussels, as far as  they are concerned the text of the fourth program is even worse  than that of the Third Framework Program. This must be  considered within the context that Europe is spending almost two  percent of its gross internal product on research, whilst the  United States and Japan are spending three percent.    What, basically, is being asked for? Approval of structural  community funding is being requested to maintain and develop  capacities, both in the high technology areas and for the "dual  use" technologies and production methods. This is not all.  These funds could also contribute to the improvement and  reinforcement of the structure of the aeronautical industry,  supporting such initiatives as the definitive integration of the  EC reconversion program (Konver) with funding during the coming  years. At the same time, the provisions that have been made to  improve the technological level and to create adequate  infrastructures and training, should not be forgotten.    Increased collaboration between the national aerospace  research bodies of the nations forming the European Community  was called for at Aerodays, the meeting held in conjunction with  the EC conference on aeronautical research held in Naples at the  beginning of October. The structural funds should also provide  an incentive for this increased collaboration. The goal should  be a single European body aiming to exploit aeronautical  research, a sort of "European NASA" that could work alongside,  or even become part of, the European Space Agency without  excluding a possible unification that would also involve the  technical certification bodies and the air traffic control  authorities. The European certification norms (JAR), were  mentioned during the meetings and in the Brussels memorandum, as  a good example of coordinated EC action and as a hopeful symbol  for further movement toward a single European authority that  would avoid the useless duplication of costs for construction  companies.    Industries that are above a national level are nothing new.  For example Italy is involved in the Tornado, ATR, and EFA  [European Fighter Aircraft] programs. These have provided an  experience that has been consolidated and can serve as an  intermediate step to programs that will promote EC technologies.  The nucleus of industrial restructuring and of research at a  European level, could be based on these, making it easier to  breech the gap between basic research and development  activities. All this should be regarded as a response to the  technological challenges of the near future that will come  primarily from across the Atlantic.  <H5>  And Us? </H5>   From Europe to Italy. How does Italian industry present  itself in this context, and what possibilities does it have in  Europe at this time when it is fighting for its own survival?  Still on the subject of the Brussels meetings, it is to be  noted that, no plans have yet been put forward for the revision  of the funding mechanism for research. On the contrary, for  example, such revision has already been started in France, where  there has been a noteworthy increase in the funding for research.    The problem of the exportation of military materials, that  is  serious for Italy, could be resolved by the EEC. The effective  results of the automatisms of Law No. 185 of 1990, which  regulates the exportation of defense products, seem to have been  greater than were intended by the legislator, and have placed  Italy in a position of net disadvantage when compared with other  democratic countries, starting with those of Europe. Here is an  opportunity to adopt export restrictions based on decisions that  have not been taken nationally, but at a community level, with  reference to Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore,  the extension of the regulations that the EEC is applying to the  exportation of "dual use" materials, to all defense products,  would give Italian industry the same support that the other  European nations have.</p>

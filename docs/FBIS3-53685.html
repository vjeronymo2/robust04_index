			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan. 17, IRNA -- Iran's President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani here today underlined the significance of the  development of human resources in the Third World countries and  said no economic development could be achieved in the absence of  human development.    The president's remark was part of his message read at the  inaugural session of the international seminar on development in  Central Asia and the Caucasus. Foreign ministers and academy  heads of the Central Asian and Caucasian countries as well as  academicians from 17 countries are attending the seminar.    Unfortunately, the message read, the unsuitable economic  situation in the world and financial and economic bottlenecks  among the majority of the developing nations have hindered  process of the development of human resources. President  Rafsanjani deplored that the outbreak of civil wars between some  of the newly-independent Central Asian republics, in addition to  imposing heavy arms expenses, had created obstacles for the  economy of certain regional counties.    "In the contemporary era when the so-called new world order  is taking shape, there are still drastic and growing economic  imbalance between the developed and the developing nations," the  message said. Such a deep gap would not only have its adverse  impacts on eonomic relations, it would also threaten  international peace and tranquility, the president noted in his  message. He expressed hope that the seminar could take  effective steps in consolidation of diplomatic, economic and  cultural ties among Central Asian and Caucasian countries and in  further upgrading living standards of their nations.    Experts and statesmen from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Tajikistan,  Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Britain, U.S.,  Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, India, China, Lebanon, Cyprus,  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and U.N. Development  Program (UNDP) are attending the 3-day seminar.</p>

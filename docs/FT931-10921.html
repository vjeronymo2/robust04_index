			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Rembrandt's Girl at a Window's claim to fame - The exhibition at Dulwich Art Gallery Dulwich Picture Gallery's small-scale exhibition framed around Rembrandt's 'Girl at a Window' examines the fame of a painting. Like WF Yeames' 'And When Did You Last See Your Father?', similarly investigated at the Walker Art Gallery, the Rembrandt remains an enduringly popular image. The young girl is to be found gazing out of anything from the cover of a National Gallery day book sold in museum shops to leaflets promoting skin-care products. Yeames' painting entered the national consciousness through its translation into textbook illustration, cigarette-card picture and waxwork tableau. The tale of how successive generations in various countries have responded to and interpreted Rembrandt's somewhat ambiguous 'Girl at a Window' is both more typical and more subtle, and it begins in the master's studio. Part of a young artist's training in Rembrandt's studio, as elsewhere in the Netherlands, was to make literal copies of the master's paintings, and copies with variations. The ability to paint in the manner of Rembrandt was a prerequisite of a successful artistic career in Amsterdam. Moreover, guild rules forbade pupils from working in a manner other than their master's, or from signing their works. 'Girl at a Window' is signed and dated 1645, when the size of Rembrandt's studio rivalled that of Rubens in Antwerp. The artist was not the first to paint a figure leaning out of an open window; he had also drawn Saskia in comparable pose some 12 years before. Characteristically, however, he was to make a conventional formula entirely his own. The girl is too young to be Hendrickje Stoffels, as has often been suggested. She is more likely to be a servant or even a prostitute, given her direct gaze and gaping bodice. A pool of water gathers around her left elbow: is she straight from her bath or the washing? The painting is not so much a portrait as a genre study of disarming naturalness and freshness. Alongside it at Dulwich we find a 19th century copy of Chicago's famous 'Girl at a Half-Door', recently attributed to Rembrandt's pupil Samuel van Hoogstraten but which must remain one of the more problematic demotions of the Rembrandt Research Project. From Woburn comes a studio adaptation, 'Girl at an Open Door', also attributed to Hoogstraten, which is indebted to the two paintings but is notably inferior to both. (One of the unexpected treats of the show is a thoroughly contemporary portrait by John Opie of his second wife which pays homage to the Woburn picture, then celebrated as a Rembrandt masterpiece.) 'A Kitchen Maid', on loan from Stockholm, shows the master himself returning to the subject in 1651. It is fascinating to see this small group. If only Dulwich had also been able to secure the original 'Girl at a Half-Door' and Washington's 'Girl with a Broom', now deemed to be by Carel Fabritius, this exhibition would have proved far more revealing of the relationship between master and pupils, and of the Research Project's distinction between masterpiece and studio work, than last year's blockbuster Rembrandt show. The show takes us on to 18th century France, where the vogue for 17th century Dutch genre painting is reflected by the presence of the Dulwich, Stockholm and Washington pictures. One of the canvases - probably 'Girl at a Window' - belonged to the art theorist, painter and spy Roger de Piles and would have been easily accessible to the artistic community for most of the century. Certainly the Dulwich picture was to prove the most influential and widely imitated. One of the first to pursue the formula was Antoine Pesne, later painter to the Prussian court. His girls at a window of 1706 and 1708 (illustrated in reproduction) are pretty and simpering, and their expanses of bare bosom make explicit the implicit sexuality of Rembrandt's painting. A few years later Jean-Baptiste Santerre attempted a far more faithful, albeit sentimentalised version. Here the girl's status is clarified by a basket of onions, and she is as sweet and virtuous as any Greuze charmer. Her impact on British art, after her arrival in the 1770s, is less pronounced. Sadly we cannot see the the copy apparently painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, although a replica in the Hermitage shows it to be accurate but still sugar-sweet. We can see Reynolds using it as a point of departure in the 'Laughing Girl' from Kenwood, a full-blown essay in the master's sombre rich tonality and clotted-cream impasto. Frances Grace's painting of 1878-79 and Simon Edmondson's recent interpretation using a local schoolgirl as model are witness to the continuing popularity of copying the Rembrandt at Dulwich, which was not only Britain's first public art gallery but doubled as an informal art school. It obviously had its copying uses, too, for the infamous 'Sexton Blaker' Tom Keating, who is shown to have cut his crooked teeth on 'Girl at a Window' in the 1950s. The exhibition, sponsored by Martini &amp; Rossi, Sunley Holdings and Williamson's Electrical Company, continues until April 25. While the Clore Foundation's donation of Pounds 200,000 offers a temporary reprieve for the gallery an additional annual income of Pounds 250,000, or an endowment of Pounds 5m, is still needed</p>

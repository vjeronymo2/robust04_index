			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / British music market sees first decline since 1980 THE UK music market shrank last year for the first time since 1980 with suppliers and distributors' revenues falling by 2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m, the British Phonographic Industry said yesterday, Michael Skapinker writes. Sales of compact discs continued to grow, however, and the number of CDs sold last year exceeded sales of cassette tapes for the first time. The BPI, which represents UK music companies, said sales of CD albums were now greater than those of cassettes and long-playing records combined. Deliveries of CD albums to record dealers totalled 70.5m units, an increase of 12.2 per cent. That was a smaller rise than in 1991, when deliveries were 23.4 per cent higher than in 1990. Consumer groups have criticised music manufacturers for charging too much for CDs. Last month Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of the WH Smith retail chain, also called on manufacturers to reduce CD prices. Manufacturers' claims that they have already reduced some CD prices appear to be supported by the BPI figures. The wholesale value of CD albums delivered to retailers was Pounds 380.5m, an increase of 10.1 per cent. The remorseless decline of vinyl records continued last year, with unit sales of LPs falling 48.3 per cent to 6.7m. That compares with 37.9m in 1989. The wholesale value of the LP market fell 48.6 per cent in 1992 to Pounds 23.9m. Cassette deliveries to record dealers fell 15.5 per cent to 56.4m. Cassette wholesale values were down 13.4 per cent to Pounds 207m. Deliveries of cassette singles rose by 29.8 per cent to 13.8m. However, they were overtaken for the first time by CD singles, which grew 68.7 per cent to 16.4m. Seven-inch vinyl singles fell 41 per cent to 12.9m, and delivery of 12-inch vinyl singles dropped 30 per cent to 9.9m.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SIGNS LAW ON STATE DEPT. PROGRAMS, INSISTS HE IS NOT BOUND BY PORTIONS OF  IT  </P> <P> President Bush on Friday signed into a law a measure governing State Department  programs for the next two years, but said he would not consider himself bound  by several provisions that White House lawyers claim infringe on presidential  powers.  </P> <P> The move was significant as part of a continuing campaign by Bush to bolster  presidential privileges that he contends have been eroded in recent years.  </P> <P> But Bush's action stopped well short of asserting a so-called line-item veto  over legislation -- the power to nullify certain parts of a congressionally  passed measure while signing the rest. Administration officials have said Bush  is looking for a bill that he could use as a test case on a line-item veto.  </P> <P> Instead of anything that drastic, in this case Bush issued a three-page  statement late in the day here after he arrived for a three-day vacation. The  statement said the President simply would interpret the provisions he objected  to as "advisory," not binding. Both Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter  took similar stands in similar circumstances and Bush as well has issued  similar statements in the past.  </P> <P> The law in question is tailor-made for these sorts of disputes about the  relative powers of the executive and legislative branches because a quarrel  over it would have few practical consequences. The bill is what is known as an  authorization measure, a law that sets ground rules for certain programs, in  this case nearly $10 billion of State Department programs this year and next.  </P> <P> But the way the government is set up, those programs would continue in effect  whether the authorization were in place or not. By contrast, disputes over  appropriations measures -- the laws which actually provide money for programs  -- can cause serious disruptions because the government is not allowed to spend  money if an appropriation has not been signed.  </P> <P> Because of that difference, Congress and the executive branch both usually try  to avoid fights over appropriations bills while using authorizations to make  political statements.  </P> <P> In this case, for example, one provision of the bill prohibits U.S.  representatives from conducting Middle East peace negotiations with any  representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization who has "directly  participated" in a "terrorist activity which resulted in the death or kidnaping  of a United States citizen."  </P> <P> Voting for that provision had an obvious political advantage for members of  Congress who proposed it, allowing them to say they had taken a stand against  terrorism.  </P> <P> Bush, however, takes the position that the Constitution gives the President the  sole right to decide whom to negotiate with. In Friday's statement, he said  that while he does not plan to negotiate with terrorists, he would not be  constrained by Congress telling him not to.  </P> <P> The bill also includes two provisions relating to China. One enacts into law  sanctions on China that Bush already has imposed by executive order. In a  compromise worked out earlier, the bill gives Bush flexibility to waive the  sanctions when he sees fit.  </P> <P> The second provision, aimed at last year's "secret mission" of Administration  officials to Beijing, would require the State Department to notify Congress of  such trips in the future. But the bill does not impose a specific deadline for  making such reports. In his statement, Bush said he was "concerned that such  provisions tend to undermine the spirit of cooperation and trust between the  executive and legislative branches."  </P></p>

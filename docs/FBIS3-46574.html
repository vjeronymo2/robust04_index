			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries a by-lined article titled "Highly Important Work  Illumining Path to Socialism in Our Age" upon the lapse of two  years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published the  immortal classical work "The Historical Lesson in Building  Socialism and the General Line of Our Party" on January 3, 1992.    The article says:    The work is a classic one that scientifically analyzed the  historical lesson in building socialism and fully proved the  validity and invincible vitality of our party's general line of  socialist and communist construction. It is also a highly  important work that makes it possible to restart the socialist  movement and further strengthen and develop it as demanded by  the era of independence.    In the work the dear leader exposed the essence of the  reactionary sophism of the imperialists and the renagades of  socialism describing the frustration of socialism in some  countries as a change in the historical trend. He, on the basis  of a scientific analysis of the reasons for the collapse of  socialism in some countries, gave a comprehensive exposition of  the questions arising in steadfastly defending and accomplishing  the cause of socialism. It reflects the unshakable stand and  will of our party and people to firmly defend the cause of  socialism under any circumstances.    The significance and vitality of the work find expression,  first of all, in that it made clear in a scientific way the  reasons for the frustration of socialism in some countries, so  as to reconstruct the socialist movement on a new basis and  advance it more vigorously. The work profoundly indicated the  basic reasons for the frustration of socialism in some  countries: One of them is that they did not put the main  emphasis on strengthening the motive force for building  socialism and on enhancing its role because they failed to  understand the essence of socialism centering on the popular  masses, the makers of history. Another reason is that they  failed to recognize the qualitative differences between  socialism and capitalism and did not adhere consistently to the  fundamental principles of socialism. And it is also the reason  that they had not strengthened international solidarity based on  independence in relations between parties of socialist countries.    With those reasons clarified in the work, a precious  guideline for reconstructing the socialist movement on a new  basis and invigorating it has been provided. And it has been  possible for the world revolutionary parties and peoples  struggling for socialism to fight more vigorously for the  victory of the socialist cause with renewed confidence and  optimism, well aware of the lesson of the history.    The significance and vitality of the work is also manifested  in that it fully proved the validity and invincible vitality of  our party's general line of socialist and communist  construction, thus encouraging our party and people to further  promote the cause of Korean-style socialism under the banner of  the chuche idea.    In our country the cause of socialism is now being  steadfastly defended and advanced ever victoriously in spite of  all the forms of challenge and maneuvers by the imperialists and  reactionaries.    This is attributable to the fact that the great leader  President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  put forward the most correct line of socialist and communist  construction and have wisely guided its thorough implementation.    The great leader was the first in history to put forward the  general line of building socialism and communism by carrying out  the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural,  while strengthening the people's power and enhancing its  function and role.    In the work the dear leader scientifically and theoretically  vindicated our party's general line of socialist and communist  construction and comprehensively reviewed the great victories  and achievements won by our party and people in socialist  construction by constantly tackling and successfully  implementing it.    Our people have the unswerving faith through their life that  our party's line of socialist and communist construction is most  just and they can accomplish the cause of socialism only in  accordance with it.    Indeed, the publication of this immortal work which is of  weighty theoretical and practical significance in the completion  of the socialist cause in the era of independence is another  great exploit of the dear leader in the accomplishment of the  human cause of independence, the cause of socialism.</p>

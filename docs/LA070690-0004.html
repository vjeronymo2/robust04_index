			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION TO ALLOW LOGGING IN OWL COUNTRY  </P> <P> The effort to save the spotted owl from extinction may cost thousands of lumber  industry workers their jobs. It all comes down to which is more important: the  welfare of human beings or animals? Owls are usually associated with wisdom,  but the campaign to preserve them at the expense of humans is one dumb  decision.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

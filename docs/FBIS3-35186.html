Despite the police minister's  recommendation to tighten the closure in the territories, the  government took no decisions on this issue. Our political  correspondent Udi Segal reports from the Prime Minister's Office:    [Begin recording] [Segal] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will  set up his residence in Jericho by the end of May, according to  Minister Yosi Sarid. Sarid bases this assessment on the  progress made in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO.  Sarid added, however, that 'Arafat must reduce the level of  terrorism, otherwise terrorism will reduce him.    In today's cabinet session, the cabinet was briefed about  the  grave attack in Ari'el, which the ministers called a shocking  attack. The prime minister decided not to discuss the issue of  a closure. Despite the police minister's recommendation to  tighten the closure, the government took no decisions in this  issue. This is what Minister Amnon Rubinstein had to say  following the session:    [Rubinstein] The prime minister did not recommend reimposing  or exacerbating the closure, although the issue is hovering in  the air. It was said that if the closure is reimposed we have  to prepare for it properly, a thing we failed to do last time.  It is also feared that a closure will exacerbate the situation  in the Gaza Strip.    [Segal] Rubinstein said that according to figures submitted  to the cabinet this morning, 19 Palestinians were murdered by  other Palestinians during the first two weeks of the month.  'Arafat will have to deal with this difficult situation.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Hata Cabinet Sets Sail in </F> Story Waters"]    [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The minority coalition  cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata announced today seems  destined to be short-lived and basically unable to push any  policies through Parliament, given the fact that the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) has vowed to cooperate with the largest  opposition party.    It appears that Hata, Japan's 51st prime minister who was  elected by the Diet (Parliament) Monday [25 April], will have no  choice but to dissolve the House of Representatives and call a  general election once he gains Diet approval of the long-delayed  fiscal 1994 budget, political observers say.    There is little doubt that the Hata administration, the  fifth  minority government in Japan since the end of World War II, will  achieve its goal of enacting the state budget since the SDP,  once the largest contingent in the former ruling coalition, has  promised to assist in securing its approval.    But Hata will stumble over ways to address key policy issues  such as the proposed consumer tax hike, trade friction with the  United States and the country's stance on the suspected nuclear  development program on the Korean peninsula.    He is fully aware that coordinating policies within the  ruling parties on those issues is crucial before the summit  meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations  meet in Naples, Italy in July.    Given the SDP's withdrawal from the nine-month-old alliance,  however, the shaky minority government is unlikely to be capable  of making effective decisions as the SDP is no longer bound by a  coalition policy platform it earlier signed with the other  parties.    Japan needs to hammer out substantial and specific  macro-economic steps to improve its ties with the United States,  over which a shadow has been cast since the breakdown of  bilateral trade "framework" talks in February. The steps which  have to be taken by the end of June include concrete measures on  Japan's tax system reform and deregulation.    Japan's market-opening package compiled by the coalition  government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in late  March was rebuffed by the United States as a "half-finished  work."    The SDP, meanwhile, is strongly opposed to an increase in  the  3 percent consumer tax, which essentially is inevitable if the  government is to finance multiple-year income tax cuts. The  SDP's opposition means that Hata's government may fail to enact  necessary legislation by the end of the year and the party's  defection from the coalition has even made the settlement of the  tax matter before the July G-7 summit meeting more difficult and  unlikely.    The SDP quit the coalition immediately after the ruling  parties struck a deal on policy issues, including the tax hike,  to protest the sudden setting up of a 130-strong parliamentary  group by Hata's Shinseito (the Japan Renewal Party) and other  partners which excluded it.    Now the Hata government even seems unable to tide over  difficulties in its handling of the alleged nuclear issue with  the DPRK.    The SDP is also opposed to revising Japan's self-defense  forces law to allow it to provide logistical support to U.S.  warships in the event of a contingency demanding such action.  It argues that such an extension of logistical support would  run counter to Japan's constitution of renouncing war-like  activities, which is generally interpreted to mean that is  opposes collective security measures.    Hosokawa's government was riven by cracks and mutual  distrust  after the coalition achieved the shared goal of passing  political reform bills. Earlier this year, some analysts  predicted that the coalition was filled with internal  contradictions which could topple it if those conflicts  escalated into open hostilities.    The SDP's withdrawal from the coalition has opened a new  chapter in Japan's political realignment but should Hata lose  his sense of proportion for which he is acclaimed, his  government is expected to collapse, even if there is no strong  opposition from outside.</p>

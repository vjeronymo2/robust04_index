			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Heath suggests talks with Sinn Fein THE GOVERNMENT should consider holding talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, Sir Edward Heath said yesterday, describing such a step as 'a sensible thing to do' when the time was right. The former Conservative prime minister told BBC Radio 4: 'When the moment is right, I have no objection to them telling Sinn Fein exactly what the government's position is and trying to influence them to have much greater influence over their military counterpart, the IRA, and get them to pack it all in.' He said: 'I do not object to people having talks with other political people. During my government Lord Whitelaw had direct talks with the IRA.' Sir Edward also criticised Mr John Major, the prime minister, for attacking Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, over her recent brief meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Sir Edward said he would keep Mr Ian Paisley, the Democrat Unionist leader, out of any discussions on the province's future. He urged Mr Major to appoint a senior cabinet member with sole responsibility for dealing with terrorism. The timing of his remarks was intriguing because the government may need to persuade Ulster Unionists to vote with it to win Thursday's crucial Maastricht vote. Two weeks ago Mr Major triggered a rare political row on Northern Ireland at Westminster by angrily denouncing an idea floated by Labour that responsibility for the province should be shared between London and Dublin. His comments, which infuriated nationalist MPs, were widely thought to have set back still further the chances of round-table talks on Ulster resuming this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  has affirmed that President Husni Mubarak has defined clear and  stable principles governing Egypt's Arab and international  relations. It said that some of the most important principles  are mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of  others, and respect for the privacy of each state.    The newspaper clarified in a comment today that Egypt is  keen  on extending bridges of friendship and cooperation with all  countries and people within the framework of these principles.    The newspaper said that throughout history, Egypt has  maintained relations of cooperation and brotherhood with the  fraternal Sudanese people as a result of an imposed geographic  reality that cannot be changed. However, there is also a joint  factor that has preserved the lives of the two peoples since  time immemorial: the immortal Nile River.    The newspaper added that Egypt has always cooperated with  the  successive Sudanese governments in private projects to maximize  use of and benefits from the waters of the Nile to serve  agricultural development in the two fraternal countries.    The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH continues: And as the great Nile  River kept its promises throughout history and provided the two  fraternal people in Egypt and Sudan with their water needs,  Egypt also kept its promises in cooperating with Sudan to  exploit the waters, irrespective of who took over power in  Khartoum. Egypt always adhered to a firm principle which is  that when it deals with Sudan, it deals first and foremost with  a fraternal people.    The newspaper affirmed that Egypt has always stood alongside  united Sudan, from the deep south to the extreme north. Egypt  believes that Sudan is the natural hinterland of Egypt without  any discrimination, and perhaps also without any account-keeping.    The newspaper expressed its regret that many things have  changed in Khartoum, particularly inside the Sudanese  Government, which is in coalition with the former Oxford  student-transformed imam, who wants to rule Sudan with fire and  steel in the name of Islam and religion, while Islam has  absolutely nothing to do with it.    Concluding its comment, the newspaper said that we view our  relations with Sudan in a grander way than Imam al-Turabi views  this relationship. He wants to destroy relations with Egypt.  The paper affirmed that these relations are relations between  two fraternal people linked geographically and historically with  each other. The two peoples will not allow these historic and  geographic relations between them to be harmed in any way.</p>

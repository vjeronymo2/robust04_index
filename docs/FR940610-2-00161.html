(``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The linkage had been scheduled to terminate on October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 2, 1987, the SEC issued an order approving operation of an experimental market linkage between Nasdaq and LSE (formerly, the International Stock Exchange of The United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) for a pilot term of two years. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  This linkage supports an interchange of quotation information (``linkage information'') on about 740 securities (``linkage securities''); of that total, each marketplace has designated approximately half as its ``pilot group'' of linkage securities. NASD and LSE members that function as market makers in one or more of a subset of linkage securities that are quoted in both the Nasdaq and LSE dealer markets (``common issues'') are entitled to access linkage information without paying a separate charge to receive it. Operation of the linkage in this fashion comports with the terms of the Commission's October 1987 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24979 (Oct. 2, 1987), 52 FR 37684 (Oct. 8, 1987) (the ``October 1987 Order''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most recently, the Commission authorized an extension of this pilot linkage through October 31, 1994 by approving File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;23. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The latter also stated that the linkage would terminate on or about October 31, 1994. Subsequently, the LSE advised Nasdaq that it will switch communication carriers at the end of June and that Nasdaq would have to bear the costs of new communication lines to its processors in Trumbull, Connecticut and Rockville, Maryland. After reviewing the specific communication requirements and costs, Nasdaq determined to forgo the added communication costs and terminate the Nasdaq-LSE linkage on June 30, 1994. Therefore, the sole purpose of this rule change is to accelerate the termination date for the Nasdaq-LSE linkage to June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33946 (Apr. 21, 1994), 59 FR 22036 (Apr. 28, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) requires that the NASD's rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other changes among members or others using any facility or system that the NASD operates or controls. Section 15A(b)(11) authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations disseminated by member firms. Termination of the Nasdaq-LSE linkage on June 30, 1994 will obviate the imposition of additional communication costs (which could not be readily recovered) to support a service that is infrequently used by eligible NASD members and that duplicates market data offerings by commercial vendors. Similarly, LSE members that wish to receive comprehensive quotation and transaction information from Nasdaq can easily do so by subscribing to an appropriate vendor service. From either perspective, a vendor-sponsored service will provide access to more market information than that which is accessible through the Nasdaq-LSE linkage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing For Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because the proposal constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation concerned solely with the administration of a pilot system whose operation had been extended, on an interim basis, by numerous rule changes filed by the NASD. In this regard, the establishment of a revised date for terminating this experimental system is an administrative matter that does not involve the enforcement or interpretation of any NASD rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NASD. All submissions should refer to file number SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;33 and should be submitted by July 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

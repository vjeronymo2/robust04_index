The ROS is a right-wing organisation with a great power  ideology, favouring a highly centralised state and a strong  executive branch. It was founded in October 1993.    The speakers admitted, that the ROS is not yet a powerful  political force. It did not run with other electoral coalitions  in the December 1993 elections. Nonetheless, they adopted a  resolution to register the movement as a party.</p>

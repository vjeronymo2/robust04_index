			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Zhou Shuchun </F> (0719 2885 2504)]    [Text] Almaty, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Foreign  Minister Dai Bingguo said during an interview with reporters in  Almaty on 28 April: Premier Li Peng's visit to four Central  Asian countries was a complete success, marking a new stage of  development in the relations of good-neighborliness, friendship,  and cooperation between China and those countries.    Dai Bingguo said: "The visit, with rich contents, was of  great significance and remarkable success" It will certainly  move relations between China and the Central Asian nations  toward a greater depth and breadth. The visit has achieved the  desired objective of enhancing mutual understanding and trust,  promoting the relations of good-neighborliness and friendship,  and expanding mutually-beneficial cooperation.    He particularly mentioned the important speech delivered by  Premier Li Peng in Tashkent. He said: It was the first time  that a Chinese leader had quite completely and openly expounded  China's basic policies toward the Central Asia countries. What  he expounded are China's permanent, basic principles, not  expedient policies. His speech fully showed China's respect for  the sovereignty of those countries, and its good intentions for  promoting regional stability and development. The speech has  aroused a positive response among the Central Asian nations. It  will certainly yield a far-reaching impact on the relations  between China and the Central Asian countries. As time goes by,  the principles proposed in the speech will show their increasing  vitalities.    The visit has enabled us to see many common stands shared by  China and the Central Asian nations: Both sides want to  maintain long-term relations of good-neighborliness and  friendship, be good friends and good neighbors, and develop  friendship and cooperation in all fields. Both sides maintain  that every country should choose its own political system,  ideology, and road of development according to its own  situation; all countries are equal regardless of size; and a  new, just and rational international political and economic  order should be established. Both sides are anxious to maintain  a lasting peace and stability in the Central Asian region and  oppose national splittism and other activities detrimental to  regional stability. Both China and these countries expressed  their desire to strengthen mutual consultations and cooperation  in international affairs.    Dai Bingguo said: In Almaty, Premier Li Peng made an  important six-point proposition on developing economic  cooperation with the Central Asian countries. Both China and  the Central Asian countries want to continue to expand and  strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation on an equal footing,  enrich the contents of cooperation, increase the forms of  cooperation, improve the environment of cooperation, and enhance  the benefits of cooperation. Chinese entrepreneurs who  accompanied the premier on the trip had wide contacts with their  counterparts in the four Central Asian countries, and reached a  series of agreements and signed a number of letters of intent on  cooperation with the latter, indicating a good start for  cooperation between the enterprises of the two sides.    Dai Bingguo emphasized: During the premier's visit, the  Chinese Government signed a series of bilateral cooperation  documents with the governments of those countries. The most  important of them is the Sino-Kazakh border agreement. The  conclusion of the agreement was an event of great historic  significance, and it will yield a far-reaching impact on the  development of bilateral relations. Dai Bingguo said: During  the talks between Premier Li Peng and Kyrgyz leaders, both sides  shared the willingness to settle their border issue at an early  date. The settlement of border issues between China and these  countries will help us create a good border environment.</p>

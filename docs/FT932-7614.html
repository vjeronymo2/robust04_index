			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith faces creditors in fight against bankruptcy MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midlands entrepreneur known for his involvement in the flotations of several natural resources companies in London in the 1980s, will seek to avoid personal bankruptcy next month when he faces creditors demanding repayment of about Pounds 20m. Mr Smith has been involved in UK quoted companies such as Butte Mining, Geevor, Petranol, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Globe Petroleum, formerly called Far East Resources. The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into at least two, Richmond and Butte, following a raid on the offices of Bryant &amp; Co, a Jersey accountant last year. Mr Smith is due to meet a group of 15 creditors in London on June 7 where he will propose to repay approximately 8p for every pound of debt owed, against 0.1p if he is forced into bankruptcy. The meeting was scheduled for Monday but was adjourned following questions from some creditors over certain debt claims. In order to be approved, the arrangement must be approved by creditors representing 75 per cent of the debt. Some Pounds 12m is being claimed by Richard Pearce &amp; Sons, a Hong Kong registered company. The address for Richard Pearce is listed in Mr Smith's schedule of creditors as Danore, Drogheda, Co Meath, Ireland. This is the same address as Mr Kelvin Myles, who managed many of Mr Smith's offshore interests from an accountant's office in Jersey. A further Pounds 3.8m is being claimed by Newsham Investments, an offshore vehicle for the Smith family. Other creditors include Societe Banquaire de Paris, which a court ruled in November was owed Pounds 2.7m by Mr Smith. Last year the bank issued proceedings against him to recover this amount, the balance of a Pounds 3m loan made in 1990. Mr Smith offered security in the form of shares in Geevor, Richmond, Butte, and two other companies, Western &amp; Pacific and Image Store Holdings. The value of the collateral is at present estimated at Pounds 1.5m. In his voluntary arrangement, Mr Smith has proposed to repay Pounds 12,000 in the first year of the agreement, the proceeds from his work as a 'finance cum project consultant'. Mr Smith argues that he would be able to improve his contribution in the second and third years and holds out the promise of a further Pounds 1.67m payment if he is able to recover money due to the CJ Smith Life Trust.</p>

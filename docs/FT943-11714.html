			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Turnround under way at BCE BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, is showing signs of a turnround, with improved performances from equipment subsidiary Northern Telecom and Bell Canada, the fully-owned domestic telephone utility. Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 223m (USDollars 161.7m), or 65 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 520m, or CDollars 1.77, a year earlier. Total revenues were CDollars 5.3bn against CDollars 4.66bn, up 14 per cent. The 1993 period included BCE's share of Northern Telecom's special restructuring charges of CDollars 624m. BCE's first-half net profit was CDollars 474m, or CDollars 1.38 a share, against a loss of CDollars 299m or CDollars 1.13 a share. Revenues were CDollars 10.3bn, up 10 per cent. Bell Canada, the biggest contributor, recored second-quarter operating revenues up slightly at CDollars 2bn. For the second half, the figure was CDollars 4bn, also up slightly. Net profit was CDollars 186m against CDollars 179m. Half-year net profit was CDollars 378m compared with CDollars 327m. Bell Canada continues to face strong long-distance competition. The higher earnings were due mainly to reduced amortisation and restructuring charges.</p>

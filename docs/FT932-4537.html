			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Haiti's Prime Minister resigns Haiti's Prime Minister Marc Bazin resigned yesterday, creating a dangerous power vacuum in the troubled Caribbean nation whose military refuses to restore democracy despite the threat of increased sanctions, Reuter reports from Port-au-Prince. In Managua, Nicaragua, where the Organisation of American States is discussing how to step up the pressure, ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide said he hoped the news could mean his return to Haiti 'within the next few weeks or even days'. Mr Bazin, a former World Bank economist, quit after he had been prevented from appointing four new cabinet members. Political pressure had been mounting since Friday when four ministers, some with links to the police chief of Port-au-Prince, had refused to step down. Mr Bazin had also lost the support of a small centrist party which had given him a parliamentary majority.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / EU and US clear last hurdles to trade deal: Negotiators set aside differences on financial and audiovisual services The last obstacles to successful completion of the Uruguay Round global trade pact were effectively cleared in Geneva yesterday when the US and the European Union agreed to disagree over long-standing differences. While there was disappointment that the two world trade leaders failed to settle differences over financial and audiovisual services and shipping and aircraft subsidies, there was relief that weeks of brinkmanship were over, and the Uruguay Round deal was in sight. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, welcomed the breakthrough, which came after all-night negotiations. 'I am confident that we can conclude the round on Wednesday,' he said. President Bill Clinton declared that the US was on 'the verge of an historic victory' in its efforts to open markets. He acknowledged that 'thorny details' remained to be settled, but said he had instructed US negotiators to push hard to get them out of the way. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US and the EU had 'broken the Gordian knot'. The deal would bring tariff barriers down more than any other agreement in history, expand US exports and apply international trade rules for the first time to services, agriculture, intellectual property and investment. Mr Kantor claimed the global economy 'will be Dollars 6,000bn (Pounds 4,000bn) wealthier' over the next decade because of the deal. In the market-opening deal agreed between the US and the EU, each will cut tariffs on the other's products by just over 50 per cent. Such cuts are commonplace in market-opening deals with other countries, and compare with a target of 33 per cent set by negotiators in 1988. Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, shared Mr Kantor's regrets that differences over audiovisual services, shipping and financial services had not been resolved. He also cautioned that the deal finalised yesterday was between the US and the EU, with the other 111 Uruguay Round participants still to be brought on board before this evening. EU foreign ministers will today consider whether to give their seal of approval to the draft Uruguay Round accord. Mr Sutherland said problems remained in the sensitive areas of financial services, textiles and intellectual property, but did not expect these to block completion of the round. However, the failure of the US to win better access to Europe's film and television market was bitterly felt yesterday by US film industry lobbyists in Geneva. Mr Jack Valenti, who heads the Motion Picture Association of America, described the outcome as a loss for the people of Europe, who would have less choice on programming in future. News that the EU had succeeded in removing the culturally sensitive film and broadcasting industry from the Gatt draft was seen as a significant boost in Brussels. 'It is a total victory for France,' said one official, referring to that country's fierce battle to defend European culture. France also succeeded in reopening the Blair House agreement on subsidised EU farm exports, and in defending its aluminium industry against threats of lower tariff protection. By refusing to accept any audiovisual deal, the US hinted yesterday that its options were open to press legal challenges to Europe's broadcast regime, but EU negotiators were sceptical about this prospect. Complex compromises have been proposed for financial services and shipping, which effectively buy time for both sides to negotiate settlements over the next two years. One conspicuous success from the negotiations was US support for creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation to replace the Gatt, with wider powers.

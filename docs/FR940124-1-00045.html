			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The recognition process, as described in subpart B of the proposed regulations, consists of an application to the Secretary by the agency, an analysis of the application by a designated Department official, an opportunity for a written response to that analysis by the applicant agency, a review of the agency's application by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (Advisory Committee), a recommendation to the Secretary by the Advisory Committee with regard to that application, an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation by either the agency or the designated Department official, and, finally, a decision on that application by the Secretary. The analysis of an agency's application by the designated Department official includes publication of a notice of the agency's application in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inviting comment on the agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and a review by the designated Department official of any public comment received. The Secretary believes the new procedures for recognition allow an agency a full and fair review of its application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional appeal procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed regulations add two key new steps to the recognition process. First, in &sect;602.11(b) the Secretary gives an accrediting agency seeking recognition by the Secretary an opportunity to respond in writing to the designated Department official's analysis of its application for recognition before the application is reviewed by the Advisory Committee. Second, in &sect;602.13(b), after the Advisory Committee completes its review of the agency's application and makes a recommendation to the Secretary on the agency's application, the Secretary gives both the agency and the designated Department official an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation. The contesting party, however, may not submit any evidence to the Secretary that it did not submit to the Advisory Committee. This restriction is to ensure that the Advisory Committee's authority is not circumvented. The Secretary believes that in general the only reasonable grounds for contesting an Advisory Committee recommendation would be if the contesting party could demonstrate that the Advisory Committee either misunderstood or did not take into proper account certain information presented by the contesting party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The negotiators reached consensus during the negotiated rulemaking sessions on the first step. The Secretary added the second step after the negotiated rulemaking sessions ended to address the non-Federal negotiators' concerns about the lack of sufficient appeal mechanisms for agencies prior to the Secretary's final decision. The Secretary believes that these two new steps in the proposed recognition process provide agencies with sufficient opportunity to present any concerns they might have regarding the recommendation of either the designated Department official or the Advisory Committee before the Secretary reaches a decision on the agency's application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Announced and unannounced site visits by the Secretary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 496(n) of the HEA requires the Secretary to conduct an independent analysis of an agency's application for recognition, which must include a site visit to the accrediting agency and may, at the Secretary's discretion, include site visits to representative institutions or programs accredited by the agency. Section 496(n) of the HEA also provides that the site visits may be unannounced, as appropriate. Accordingly, both &sect;602.10(b) and &sect;602.11(b) of the proposed regulations provide for unannounced site visits. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to conduct unannounced site visits only, where necessary in the judgment of the Secretary, to obtain information to verify the agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and the information would not be forthcoming in an announced site visit. The Secretary wishes to make it clear that this Secretarial judgment is not subject to challenge by an accrediting agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;602.11(b), the Secretary also proposes that the Secretary's evaluation of an agency may include a review of information directly related to the institutions or programs accredited by the agency, as this information relates to the institution's or program's compliance with the agency's standards, the effectiveness of those standards, or the agency's application of those standards. The Secretary believes that the inclusion of this language in the proposed regulations, which was agreed to by negotiators, provides the agency, the institutions and programs it accredits, and the general public with a clear understanding of the scope of the Secretary's evaluation of an agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- A two-day conference of 57  countries opened here Thursday [26 May] with the aim of defusing  possible new wars in Europe by settling potential border  disputes and solving the problems of minorities.    The conference, opened by UNESCO director general Federico  Mayor at the organisation's headquarters here, is the brainchild  of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.    It will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be signed  by the end of the year for potential new candidates to the  European Union (EU).    Russia is respresented at the conference by Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev and the United States by Undersecretary of State  for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said the summit aims  to settle border and minority problems between "countries with  the vocation of entering the EU," following the collapse of the  Soviet bloc.</p>

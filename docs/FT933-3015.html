			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Arafat set to go to Jericho: Palestinians 'have a friend in White House' MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, returned from the US to his headquarters in Tunis yesterday declaring that a Palestinian state was within reach and that he had discovered a new friend in President Bill Clinton. The PLO leader said that he hoped to travel to Jericho in the Israeli-occupied West Bank within 10 weeks to begin setting up the new Palestinian authority agreed in the declaration of principles signed with Israel in Washington on Monday. 'After that will come a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and in confederation with Jordan,' he asserted. The PLO-Israel accord provides only for limited Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho which will be later broadened to include most of the West Bank. Negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories, including the future of Jerusalem, which has been annexed by Israel, will not begin until the third year of the five-year period of autonomous Palestinian rule. Israel and the US remain opposed to the concept of an independent Palestinian state. They will continue to press for Palestinian self-determination to be expressed within a confederation with Jordan. However, Mr Arafat declared yesterday that his talks with Mr Clinton had been 'cordial, friendly, positive and fruitful'. He added: 'I can say that the Palestinian people have an important friend in the White House.' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, had earlier returned home from Washington to warn Syria against aiding groups which opposed the peace process. He accused the Syrians of supporting Islamic radicals in Lebanon while also providing shelter in Damascus for 10 hostile Palestinian groups. 'One hand is supposedly outstretched to peace while the other hand opens fire,' he said in a broadcast on Israeli radio shortly before the start of the four-day Jewish new year holiday. He added that Syrian radio continued to 'preach hatred against the peace negotiations'. The Israeli premier also defended the deal struck with the PLO. 'It seems to me that in this agreement we are taking the smallest chance,' he said. 'If they will be able to maintain public order and prevent terror - between themselves and certainly against Israelis - that is the essential test for us,' Mr Rabin said. 'Therefore, if we succeed in this, and we can succeed, I think we'll have made an opening to a new period.' Israeli security forces were placed on alert yesterday in anticipation of attacks during the holiday period by opponents of the Israeli-PLO peace accord, police and the army said. Israel has barred nearly 1m Palestinians from leaving the Gaza Strip until Sunday. The army will also limit the number of Palestinians who will be allowed to enter from the West Bank.</p>

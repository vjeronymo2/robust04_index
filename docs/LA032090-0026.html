			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL FOR POLICE MUSEUM ENDORSED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee has endorsed a proposal by Councilman  Richard Alatorre that would make a police museum the centerpiece of any  commercial project built at the site of the old Northeast Police Station in  Highland Park.  </P> <P> The council's Public Works Committee has reviewed plans from two private  developers who proposed apartments, offices and a restaurant in and around the  historic 1925 police station -- which is no longer in use -- at 6045 York Blvd.  The committee also heard from a volunteer group that wants to open a police  museum and youth center on the property.  </P> <P> Concerned that the volunteer group lacks funding, the committee told city staff  members and museum organizers to meet with the private developers about making  the museum a centerpiece of the commercial projects.  </P> <P> City staff members were told to report in 60 days regarding results of the  negotiations with the developers. The committee will then make a recommendation  to the City Council, which will make the final decision on the project.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles Police Sgt. Richard Kalk, president of the Los Angeles Police  Historical Society, said his group still hopes to win the committee's approval  to build the museum without the help of developers. Converting the old station  into a museum is expected to cost $4.5 million.  </P> <P> "We'd like to show them within the next 60 days that we have the capability of  raising money," Kalk said.  </P> <P> He said he will seek financial help within the Police Department and from  private foundations. Kalk said he prefers not to join forces with the private  developers.  </P> <P> "Our board feels that if we merge with them, we're going to have to sacrifice  display areas and the youth center," he said.  </P> <P> Alatorre, in whose district the station is situated, wants the museum  organizers to blend their project into one of the commercial proposals.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful idea," said Robin Kramer, Alatorre's chief of staff. "Both of  the for-profit developers have expressed an interest in accommodating them. The  question is to what extent."  </P> <P> H.T. Greene and Associates of Los Angeles has proposed a housing and commercial  project for the site. The Jacmar Companies of Alhambra have proposed a pizza  restaurant and offices.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our Foreign Ministry accompanied a decision about  Slovenia's participation in the Partnership for Peace with a  special statement:    In the introduction, the statement mentions a letter that  Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle sent to the foreign ministers of  its member-states prior to the 5 February NATO summit, a visit  by the U.S. President's special envoy Madeleine Albright to  Slovenia, and a letter that our Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek  sent to [NATO] prime ministers together with a formal  application for the participation of our country in the  Partnership for Peace.    The Foreign Ministry emphasizes that, by being admitted into  the Partnership for Peace, Slovenia has accomplished an  important step in drawing closer to the Western European  integrations, also in the realm of security. Today's decision  of the NATO Council in Brussels represents a materialization of  the efforts of our state organs in the implementation of the  Resolution on Guidelines of the National Security Concept, which  was passed by the Slovene Parliament in February.    We are supposed to sign a cooperation document in the coming  days. After the talks with the NATO political and military  experts, our country will get another opportunity to appoint its  military and political representatives to NATO Headquarters in  Brussels, is written in a statement by the Foreign Ministry.</p>

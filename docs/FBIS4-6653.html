			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- The chief of the Tokyo  Stock Exchange [TSE] said Tuesday [19 April] he feels the  economy is on an upward track judging from stock trading volume,  despite a lack of clear-cut signals from government statistics.    Speaking at a news conference, TSE President Minoru Nagaoka  said trading volume is still vulnerable to political uncertainty  and other negative news, but he pointed to a tendency in the  volume to rebound quickly after any setback.    Asked to comment on the overnight tumble on Wall Street due  to a rise in U.S. interest rates, Nagaoka said he is closely  watching the New York stock market, but added that he is  confident Tokyo stocks will not follow New York.</p>

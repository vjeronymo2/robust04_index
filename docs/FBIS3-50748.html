In that decision, the Federal Supreme Court established  several restrictions on collections for entities considered  immune by the Constitution and for states and municipalities.  The court decree has not been published yet.    The banks allege that the Constitution restricts immunity on  operations related to the essential activities of those  entities, and that without the publication of the court  decision, the banks will not be able to define what operation by  the same entity is immune. Helio Ramos Dominguez, legal adviser  for Febraban, said: "It is not up to the banks to define whether  an operation is related or not to an entity's essential  activity."    On 27 December 1993, the banks sent requests for  clarification to the Federal Revenue Office and the Central  Bank. Febraban believes it will be very difficult for the  Federal Supreme Court to publish its decision before January --  the court is in recess and will return to work in February --  therefore, it hopes to begin collecting based on the  clarifications from the two organizations.

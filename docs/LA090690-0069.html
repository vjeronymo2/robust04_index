			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD MEN RELISH COMEBACK THAT TIES THIRD-RANKED UCLA  </P> <P> After 90 minutes of regulation and two 15-minute overtimes, the USD and UCLA  soccer teams finished with a 3-3 tie Wednesday night at Torero Stadium.  </P> <P> But as far as USD (2-0-1) was concerned, this was a little like kissing Julia  Roberts, and not just because UCLA (3-0-1) is ranked No. 3 nationally. The  Toreros came back after UCLA also took an early, 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'm happy with the tie," said Seamus McFadden, USD coach. "Actually it  would have been a shame if either team lost, because both teams played so  well."  </P> <P> After an initial 10 minutes during which neither team could control the ball,  UCLA changed tactics and began firing from long range. The result was what  McFadden termed "two magical goals. UCLA won't score two goals prettier than  that all year."  </P> <P> Both were unassisted. In the 11th minute, freshman midfielder Jorge Salcido put  one into the upper-right corner from 40 yards past freshman goalie Tom Tate  from USDHS.  </P> <P> In the 17th minute, sophomore midfielder Chris Henderson took a shot from an  improbable angle, along the left sideline some 30 yards from the end line.  That, too, found the upper-right corner.  </P> <P> "I thought we were going to be in for a long night at that point," McFadden  said.  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid said those two quick goals actually led to his team's  downfall.  </P> <P> "I think those two quick goals really hurt us," he said. "I think our players  thought the game was going to be a little easier than it was."  </P> <P> If they weren't thinking that, they at least seemed to be thinking about the  bus trip home. Suddenly, UCLA's midfield disappeared, and USD was able to work  the ball upfield and connect on passes in their attacking zone.  </P> <P> Paul Gelvezon put USD on the scoreboard in the 19th minute when he collected a  centering pass from Leo Ronces, who was dribbling the ball along the right  sideline. When Gelvezon got the pass from Ronces, he sidestepped one defender  before letting go with a right-footer that got past freshman goalie Brad  Friedel and into the left side.  </P> <P> In the 31st minute, the Toreros tied it when Paul Adair took a shot from atop  the penalty box. It wasn't a hard shot, and Friedel was moving slowly to his  right to collect it when Phillip Button, a sophomore midfielder out of The  Bishop's School, redirected it to the left of Friedel and into the net.  </P> <P> With seven minutes left in the half, USD went ahead, 3-2, when Adair beat two  defenders and centered to Gelvezon 10 yards in front of a wide-open goal.  </P> <P> UCLA tied it 22 minutes into the second half on a counter-attack. Coby Jones,  dribbling down the left side, sent a centering pass to Henderson, who banged it  in.  </P></p>

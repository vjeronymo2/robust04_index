			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair bases vision on opportunity and responsibility Mr Tony Blair, the Labour party leader, yesterday outlined his vision of opportunity and responsibility for all, a commitment to rebuild communities and a series of pledges to change the constitution of both the party and the country. At the heart of his first leader's speech to the party conference was the concept of a society of opportunity built around a strong and stable economy. This meant maintaining a high and stable level of employment and a 'dynamic market economy based on partnership between government and industry'. A Labour government would take the lead in getting public and private finance working together in transport and housing in capital projects in health and education, he said. 'If there are Treasury rules or antiquated concepts of public borrowing that hold us back, change them. That is what intelligent government is for.' It would also mean investment in the new electronic superhighways such as satellite and telecommunications. But a dynamic market did not mean supporting unfettered markets or rigid dogma, Mr Blair argued while opposing railway and Post Office privatisation. Continuing his theme of opportunity for all Mr Blair said education would be the passion of his government. 'I know how important the education of my children is to me. I will not tolerate children going to run-down schools, with bad discipline, low standards, mediocre expectation or poor teachers, and nor should anyone else.' Mr Blair added that responsibility must go hand-in-hand with opportunity. Arguing that the left had undervalued the notion of responsibility and duty, he said parents should have responsibility for their children, companies to their employees and community, and ministers to truth. Labour would be tough on crime, with measures to tackle juvenile offending and a crackdown on illegal firearms, and tough on the causes of crime, with a comprehensive crime prevention programme and an anti-drugs initiative. Mr Blair supported the Social Justice Commission's call for a new civilian service to enable youngsters to be given constructive tasks. He defined responsibility as recognising that there could be no divorce from the outside world. He said responsibility and opportunity would require fairness and justice. This meant a tax system that was fair and related to the ability to pay. He promised that a future Labour government would introduce a minimum wage - which, he said, existed in every European country and in the US  - sign the European social chapter and give the right to people at work to join a trade union and have that union recognised. The obstacle in the way for Labour's plans was disillusionment with politics itself, Mr Blair said. This meant being open and telling the truth. Rebutting those who argued that a Labour government must repeal all Tory trade union laws, he said: 'There is not a single person in this country who believes that to be realistic, or that we will do it. No one believes strike ballots should be abandoned. So why should we say it? We shouldn't, and I won't' He said Labour would change the rules of government, including legislating in the first year of a government for a Scottish parliament and an assembly for Wales. He committed Labour to a Bill of Rights, a Freedom of Information Act, reform of the Commons and its working practices, ending the right of hereditary peers to vote in the House of Lords and tightening the rules of financing of political parties. He warned that the task of renewing the UK was not one for the 'faint-hearted or the world-weary'. By the next election voters would have had a Conservative government for 17 or 18 years. 'They may hate them, but they know them. I want them now to know us.' As change would be part of that process he and Mr John Prescott, the party's deputy leader, would be putting forward an up-to-date statement of the objects and objectives of the party. A modern party living in a period of change required a modern constitution, he said.</p>

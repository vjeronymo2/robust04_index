			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (6): Loan goes adrift - Banking reform BANKING reform has become critical for Bulgaria. The Berov administration is under mounting pressure to take steps to clean up and strengthen the banking system if Bulgaria is to rally the outside support it needs to continue with its transition to a market economy. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Bulgaria's largest sources of external financing in the past three years, have tied further loans to progress in implementing banking reform. Already the second half of a Dollars 250m structural adjustment loan from the World Bank has been held up by delays in tackling this issue. Western institutions are concerned by the lack of financial sector regulations and by the growing level of enterprise debt on the books of state commercial banks. The debts, accumulated by insolvent state firms and estimated at Lv35-60bn (Dollars 1.35-2.31bn), are even pushing some banks into bankruptcy. Others cannot be considered for privatisation or as partners for western banks until the debt issue is resolved. The government has said it will take action but to date has made no firm decisions. 'After 2 1/2 years of discussion there is still no consensus on the Bulgarian side as to how to tackle state enterprise debt,' says one western consultant. 'There is an awareness that something must be done but that's it. They are drifting while all the time the situation gets worse.' One problem is that the country's financial institutions have conflicting interests, he says. 'The central bank is concerned about the effect of a settlement on the banking system, the ministry of industry about state firms and the finance ministry about the cost to the budget.' The responsibility for financial sector regulation, on the other hand, lies primarily with the National Bank of Bulgaria, an independent body accountable to parliament alone. The Central Bank Act of 1991 gave the national bank a supervisory role as well as control over exchange rate, credit and interest rate policies. The bank, too, has delayed action, issuing some prudential regulations only last month. These follow standard international practices and include rules on capital adequacy ratios, liquidity and licensing. Even now, Mr Todor Vulchev, the bank's governor, acknowledges banking regulation is far from being a reality. 'The difficulty will come in implementation. First, most of the state commercial banks don't understand the new regulations. Second, we are not in the best position to supervise them. 'Like other public institutions, we have lost many of our best staff to the private sector. We are now training new people with the help of the US Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank but, inevitably, this takes time.' The central bank is also likely to face resistance to the new regulations from the private financial sector. 'There are powerful groups out there who have been following their own rules for the past three years,' says one western banker. 'Some of them have set up 'banks' as fronts for their own business activities. 'It will be hard to unravel exactly what is going on, not least because many of these private bankers have contacts inside the government and the central bank who will try to shelter them.' One area, however, where progress has been made is in 'bank consolidation'. This involves the merging of 80 state commercial banks, created by the communists in the mid-1980s, into eight to 10 new banking groups, considered sufficient for a country of 8.5m The first merger, the United Bulgarian Bank, which brought together 22 banks, began operations in January. 'We hope to form four more groups by July, leaving only three banks unresolved,' says Mr Plamen Petrov, executive director of the Bank Consolidation Company which was set up in November 1991 to oversee the process. But he, too, stresses the need for wide-reaching banking reform. 'The EBRD is interested in a stake in the UBB. Through this it could open credit lines to the private sector. But it is unlikely to go ahead without more banking supervision and a solution to the internal debt problem,' he says. The central bank would like to see more foreign banks enter the Bulgarian market but this, too, hangs largely on the outcome of foreign debt negotiations. Meanwhile Austria's Raffeissen bank has taken a 35 per cent stake in the Bank for Agricultural Credit and several Arab and other European banks have set up representative offices. A few new banks with grand names and influential backers, such as the International Bank for Investment and Development, in which the former finance minister of the Shah is a major shareholder, are also setting up to offer services in competition to the First Private Bank and other fledgling local banks which have emerged in the past two years.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS' WHITE, JOHNSON HEAD UNPROTECTED LIST  </P> <P> The Rams made public their list of 19 unprotected players Thursday and, as  expected, it contained nary a surprise.  </P> <P> It did, however, contain several members of the 30-and-over club, which  figures, since the Rams are concerned that way. Ten of the 19 players --  running backs Charles White and Mike Guman, defensive linemen Gary Jeter and  Greg Meisner, linebackers Jim Collins and Carl Ekern, snapper Mike McDonald,  tight end Eric Sievers, safety Johnnie Johnson and quarterback Mark Herrmann --  are or will be 30 before the season begins.  </P> <P> The rest of the selected Rams are or probably will be, in the team's mind,  career backups. Included in that list are cornerback Mickey Sutton, wide  receiver Michael Young, defensive lineman Fred Stokes, running backs Buford  McGee, Tim Tyrrell and Keith Jones, offensive lineman Mike Schad, tight end Jon  Embree and linebacker Mark Jerue.  </P> <P> "You had to try to look at your team in a lot of different ways," said Coach  John Robinson, who is attending the scouting combine meetings in Indianapolis.  "We used a lot of different criteria to make the judgment."  </P> <P> Robinson also said that he didn't expect "an awful lot of (player movement) for  the first period of time."  </P> <P> Under the existing rules, which have been written by the National Football  League's Management Council and disputed by the NFL Players Assn., an  unprotected player has until April 1 to test the free-agent market. Otherwise,  he can return to his former team.  </P> <P> "This is my one opportunity to market Johnnie Johnson and see what he's worth,"  Johnson said. "I can't tell you how thrilled I am."  </P> <P> Johnson, if all works out as he hopes, has reason to be pleased with the Rams'  decision. His contract, which ends at the conclusion of the 1990 season, calls  for a salary of $200,000 in 1989 and $200,000 in 1990. By shopping his skills  around, Johnson said he could possibly double his money.  </P> <P> "The fact that I had such a solid season last year, that benefits me even  more," he said. "It's a decision I'm glad was made."  </P> <P> As for the 37 players still considered sole property of the Rams, Johnson sends  his condolences.  </P> <P> "I can't stress enough how I feel about those players," he said. "I feel sorry  for the players on each team who can't (test the market)."  </P> <P> White, who said he thought his unprotected status wasn't related to a substance  abuse relapse last season, preferred to remain with his security blanket, the  Rams.  </P> <P> "I really don't understand," he said. "They do what they have to do. But I'm  not looking to go anywhere as of right now. As of right now, (I'm) still a  Ram."  </P> <P> White previously has been made available to other teams. The Rams have placed  him on waivers twice and each time reclaimed him without incident. So when news  of the latest management strategy reached him, White was prepared for it.  </P> <P> "I think it was just a business decision," White said. "In this business,  nothing catches you by surprise."  </P> <P> Should White, for whatever reason, not return to the Rams, he said he'll  attempt to sign with another team.  </P> <P> The others . . . and probable reasons for being included on the unprotected  list:  </P> <P> Jones -- Released once during the 1988 season. A scout-team member.  </P> <P> Guman -- Just finished the final year of a guaranteed contract. On injured  reserved until the last regular-season game.  </P> <P> Tyrrell -- A special teams player, nothing more.  </P> <P> Sievers -- No mystery here. A last-season acquisition who didn't figure to get  past third string at tight end.  </P> <P> McGee -- Look for him to re-sign. The Rams, despite sticking him on the list,  like McGee.  </P> <P> McDonald -- He might be able to make a better deal elsewhere. You'd be  surprised how many teams need a dependable snapper.  </P> <P> Jerue -- Two bad knees.  </P> <P> Collins -- Knee injuries galore.  </P> <P> Ekern -- A 13-year veteran whose guaranteed contract is up. Just turned 33.  </P> <P> Jeter -- Despite recording 11 1/2 sacks -- a career year -- Jeter is seriously  considering retirement.  </P> <P> Meisner -- He'll be 30 in April. He held out, then hurt his knee and didn't  play until Oct. 2.  </P> <P> Schad -- Still under contract, but apparently out of chances. Rams obviously  aren't worried that he'll sign elsewhere.  </P> <P> Embree -- Has little or no shot at playing time.  </P> <P> Young -- Can try to return as the fourth wide receiver or improve his chances  with another team.  </P> <P> Herrmann -- A short-term insurance policy for Jim Everett.  </P> <P> Stokes -- No jobs available.  </P> <P> Sutton -- Good enough to sign with someone else.  </P></p>

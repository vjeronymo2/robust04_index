			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credit Mutuel chairman optimistic CREDIT Mutuel, the French bank, hopes to 'maintain or possibly increase' net profits for 1993 compared with last year, in spite of the competitive state of the banking market. Mr Etienne Pflimlin, chairman, likened the current condition of the sector to that of the 'first oil shock in autumn 1973'. However, he said his group had managed to increase market share and hoped at least to maintain net profits at the same level as 1992's FFr1.5bn (Dollars 264.3m). Credit Mutuel, which is the fifth largest retail banking network in France, has been affected by the sluggish demand for credit, according to the chairman. The French credit market has been depressed by the impact of high real interest rates, in spite of recent rate reductions. Mr Pflimlin identified the farming sector as an area of potential market share gains. He said his group should win share at the expense of Credit Agricole, the co-operative farmers' bank, which he described as a 'dinosaur'. Credit Mutuel also plans to extend its branch network. It intends this year to set up new offices in Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Nancy.</p>

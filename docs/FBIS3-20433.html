According to the latest  statistics compiled by the Ministry of Construction, the trend  of rapid expansion of the scale of real estate development has  somewhat subsided with the implementation of the various  macro-regulatory and control measures. That is, the work has  achieved initial results.    Comparing the growth rates for January-November 1993  versus the same period in 1992 and the growth rates for the  first half of 1993 versus the first half of 1992, we can see the  following changes: The growth rate fell 14.9 percentage points  for real estate investment, 26.7 percentage points for the floor  space of buildings for sale under construction, 67.2 percentage  points for the floor space of newly launched building projects,  15.9 percentage points for the floor space of buildings  completed, 22.4 percentage points for the floor space of  buildings sold, and 3.2 percentage point for the total sales  volume.    Since July 1993, strengthening and improving  macro-regulation and control over the real estate market has  been one of the focal tasks for all levels of governments and  construction departments. Under the overall planning by the  party Central Committee and the State Council, the Ministry of  Construction promptly called a meeting in mid-July, attended by  chairmen and directors of construction commissions and  departments across the country, to make arrangements for the  macro-regulation and control of the real estate market. After  that, special teams led by six leaders from the Ministry of  Construction were sent out on two different occasions to various  places to listen to local work reports on strengthening  macro-regulation and control over the real estate market and on  conducting inspections of real estate development units.  Meanwhile, similar arrangements for macro-regulation and control  and plans for inspections were promptly mapped out by party  committees and governments of all provinces, autonomous regions,  and municipalities and by all relevant departments and  commissions of the State Council. Among other things, leading  inspection groups were formed with the local governments'  comrades in charge of construction work as the heads. The groups  were composed of representatives from the departments of  construction, land administration, industry and commerce,  taxation, planning, and finance with the construction department  representatives as the leading members.    The concerted efforts made by the various levels of  pertinent government departments have not only reined in  remarkably the growing scale of real estate development, but  also produced many positive results in the real estate industry,  such as a better mix of investments, stable prices, and the  gradual improvement of market rules. Plus, the management of  real estate companies has also been improved to a remarkable  extent.    With the gradual shift of the focus of investment to urban  residential construction, between January and November last  year, 84.6 percent of the building projects around the country  being constructed for sale were residences. Of the new building  projects launched in this period, 85.5 percent were residences.  Residences accounted for a whopping 89.7 percent of the building  projects completed. All these topped the 1992 records.    With the market under macro-regulation and control, real  estate prices during the latter half of last year remain  basically stable even in those areas that had been hot spots for  real estate business. In some areas, prices of buildings  completed and to be completed fell by 20-30 percent and 10-20  percent, respectively, compared with the beginning of last year.    While progress is made in the macro-regulation and control  of the real estate market, a number of pertinent regulations  drawn up by the concerned departments of the State Council have  been promulgated and put into effect. These include the "Statute  for Value-Added Tax on Land," "Regulations Governing Assets of  Real Estate Development Enterprises," and "Provisions on  Comprehensive Acceptance Inspection of Newly Completed Small  Housing Areas." Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other provinces have  also promulgated local laws and regulations governing sales and  transfers of land-using rights, real estate transactions, real  estate price appraisal, and standard land prices. This has  prepared the ground for legalizing the operations of the real  estate market.    With the market under macro-regulation and control, a  number of incapable real estate development companies have  closed down of their own accord. For example, 380 real estate  companies in Guangxi have closed down in this way. Meanwhile,  the authorities concerned in various localities have forced  incapable real estate companies to cease their operations. In  Guangdong Province, 170 real estate companies have been thus  shut down. In addition, a number of illegally operating  companies around the country have been investigated and dealt  with. With regard to real estate companies established by land  administrative departments or financial institutions, steps are  being taken to separate them from these departments and  institutions as required by the state regulations.    Through more than a half year's efforts, remarkable  results have been achieved in exercising macro-regulation and  control over the real estate market. However, many problems  exposed in the course of real estate development have yet to be  radically resolved. For example, due to a lack of self-provided  funds, many real estate development companies cannot fulfilled  their contracts. To get foreign funds, some localities have  often sold their land not in accordance with their established  plan or even without a plan. The result is that they have  arbitrarily sold a lot of farmland, especially vegetable land,  leading to a sharp rise in vegetable prices within a short  period. This has made it difficult for people to satisfy their  vegetable demand. Besides, quite a number of localities have  over-expanded their scale of development, making it necessary to  move a large number of people out of the old residential areas.  These people have to take care of themselves during the  transitional period. They get no timely assistance from the  government.    In view of the above, some experts say that the  macro-regulation and control of the real estate market over the  past six months has only solved some urgent problems in  developing the real estate industry, and the results obtained  are merely initial-stage achievements. To truly put our real  estate market on the track of orderly development and healthy  operations, we should still do a lot of hard and careful work on  the basis of what we have achieved at present.</p>

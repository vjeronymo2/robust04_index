			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur discusses disposal of 1,250 pubs INNTREPRENEUR Estates, the Grand Metropolitan and Courage pubs joint venture, is discussing the sale of 1,250 pubs, worth an estimated Pounds 250m, with a number of potential buyers, writes Philip Rawstorne. A management team from Inntrepreneur is understood to be one of the interested parties but no confirmation was forthcoming yesterday. The pubs, which Inntrepreneur must free from tied beer supplies to meet government orders, may be sold as one block or in several large packages. Tenants and lessees of the pubs likely to be affected have been informed, GrandMet said yesterday. Following the sale, Inntrepreneur will be left with 4,350 pubs, taking their beer supplies from Courage. Of its initial 7,350 pubs, 500 have already been sold, 700 leased free of tie, and 550 transferred to GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer estate.</p>

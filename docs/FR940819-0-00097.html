			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions provided a summary of research on circadian dysrhythmia and fatigue with an extensive bibliography. NTSB reiterated Recommendation I&hyph;89&hyph;1, which stated that the Department of Transportation should ``expedite a coordinated research program on the effects of fatigue, sleepiness, sleep disorders, and circadian factors on transportation system safety.'' Other commenters submitted copies of articles and recommendations related to fatigue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has reviewed the extensive amounts of literature provided by commenters on fatigue related to travel and extended work periods as well as to shift work. Although consideration has been given to numerous fatigue studies, no accident/incident data is available to provide a direct correlation between flight attendant fatigue and passenger safety. However, it is evident that fatigue may affect flight attendant performance and that proper scheduling practices may help avoid compromising flight attendant performance. The FAA recognizes that flight attendants perform essential safety duties and has determined that the requirements contained in this final rule enhance safety by protecting flight attendants from acute and chronic fatigue. This final rule addresses the potential safety problems that could occur if fatigued flight attendants work excessive duty hours or receive inadequate rest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Industry Study <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal commenters who addressed the Industry Study include AMR Combs, American Cyanamid Company, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and SCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Cyanamid Company stated that the Industry Study does not indicate that there is a pattern of air carriers willfully scheduling long duty days or long series of days without a day off. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions indicated that the Industry Study has been used as evidence that extreme examples of scheduling abuse are isolated and that the actual occurrences of scheduling abuse were most likely under-reported because the instances provided in the Industry Study were ``self-selected.'' The Coalition further stated that, even though the instances were self-selected, the Industry Study found industry-wide flight attendant duty and rest period problems. SCA stated that the Industry Study does not provide evidence to establish any correlation among flight attendant duty time, flight attendant safety duties, and risk to passengers. AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company noted that the Industry Study did not consider unscheduled part 135 operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA conducted the Industry Study to determine if scheduling extremes exist, and, if so, to determine the nature of the extremes, not to determine the statistical frequency with which they occur or to correlate passenger risk with extreme scheduling. Access to records was gained through the cooperation of air carriers. The air carriers did not choose individual records for examination. Based on the purpose of the study, records were selected for review when flight attendant scheduling extremes were expected to be likely. Therefore, statistical inferences cannot be made. However, the data contained in the Industry Study provides fundamental background information on flight attendant scheduling practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Industry Study included a review of data from major, national, regional, and supplemental carriers. The study did not include a review of unscheduled part 135 operators because relatively few of these operators conduct operations that require a flight attendant. As previously discussed, air carriers and commercial operators conducting operations for which the FAA does not require a flight attendant will not be required to comply with flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements even if flight attendants are involved in those operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> International and Domestic Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment did not make a distinction between domestic and international operations in determining flight attendant duty limitations and rest requirements. Five commenters commented on whether there should be a distinction between domestic and international operations for determining flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements. Four commenters, including the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM &amp; AW), supported making a distinction. The Coalition provided definitions for a domestic flight, an international flight, and a long-range international flight. One commenter stated that flight attendants assigned to international flight require more rest than flight attendants assigned to domestic flights because flight attendants on international flights are in a state of physical desynchronization. Another commenter stated that duty period limits should be 12 hours for domestic flights and 14 hours for international flights. NAA stated that no distinction should be made between international and domestic flights because some domestic flights are as long as international flights and the work load is the same for the crew. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a review of the Coalition comments and an analysis of flight schedules, the FAA finds that scheduled duty periods for operations wholly within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia should not be allowed to exceed 18 hours. The FAA is not aware of any scheduled duty periods for these operations that currently do exceed 18 hours. However, for duty periods involving one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, the duty period may not exceed 20 hours. Thus, the final rule makes this distinction between domestic and international operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Part 125 Operators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed that each flight attendant be relieved from all duty for at least 8 consecutive hours during any 24-hour period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters, including the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, addressed this proposal. The Coalition recommended that the 8-hour period free of duty be replaced with a 10-hour period free of duty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Responses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 125.37, Duty time limitations, currently requires a flight crewmember to be relieved from duty for at least 8 consecutive hours during any 24-hour period. The final rule incorporates flight attendants into the current provision, thus providing parallel duty time limitations for flight attendants and flight crewmembers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rules for Flight Attendants in Other Nations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and the IAM &amp; AW noted that flight attendants in other nations have regulations that provide flight attendant duty time limitations and minimum rest requirements. APA stated that the proposed Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) regulations address issues related to fatigue. The Coalition provided a copy of the proposed JAA rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Bugs and bytes bedevil those paying by plastic: David Barchard, Andrew Jack and Alan Cane on the damage done to the credit card industry by a software glitch WHEN First Data Resources introduced new computer software systems on July 17, it could not have foreseen that a consequence would be to attract unwelcome publicity to the credit card processing industry. The company handles the payment card operations of National Westminster, Midland and Lloyds banks, as well as Royal Bank of Scotland. The result is that the change in software affected some 10m accounts. A glitch caused mistakes in some card statements and yesterday the banks were having to reassure customers that the bugs had been resolved with only a few accounts affected. Credit card processing is a low-profile industry, and until recently it was not even a market in which participants competed for business. The eyes of FDR and several other companies are now on the European card market, which is expected to grow steadily as card usage increases and transaction volumes approach levels in the mature US market. FDR's computer system, introduced from its parent in the US, was intended to enhance its card processing operations at Southend and Basildon in Essex. The operations, bought from the Access banks last year, made FDR, a subsidiary of the American Express group, the largest credit card processor in Europe. Mr John Elftmann, director of personnel and quality for FDR in the UK, called the switch to FDR's own system 'the biggest accounts conversion in history'. A day or two later, others in the credit card world knew the operation had not gone smoothly. Barclays, the other large card processing operation, found some long delays when processing its card transactions through retailers that banked with Access banks, and whose service messages were routed through FDR at Southend. Barclays says the situation is now improving. It adds that this is the first time, to its knowledge, that this sort of glitch has been experienced in the card processing world. The Access banks bore the brunt of the trouble. Three of them - Lloyds, Midland, and Royal Bank of Scotland - say they detected hitches early, but were only very marginally affected. The number of customers who had to be notified ran to tens rather than hundreds. Royal Bank of Scotland says: 'We had some problems with direct debits going out on statements, but it was really only a few cases that needed ironing out.' The bank worst affected was NatWest, particularly its 250,000 Gold Card customers. 'The Gold Card has its own system and many customers pay by direct debit each month,' NatWest says. Some customers' statements showed incorrect late-payment details, or charges for non-existent cash advances, or gave incorrect dates for transactions. NatWest refused to discuss the technology involved, saying it was a matter between the bank and FDR. The troubles seem to lie, however, in the accounting and reconciliation ('back office') software, which is used to manage the card transactions and pass information to the banks' main computers. Mr Gary Tobin, a senior vice-president of First Data Corporation, the parent of FDR, emphasised that errors unrelated to the company's equipment might be responsible for some of the complaints over credit cards. He said only a few hundred errors had been recorded, a small total when converting some 10m customer records from one computer system to another. He said the conversion was necessary because Signet, the card processing company acquired by FDR last year, which had been responsible for card processing in Southend, was using 20-year-old software that lacked up-to-date facilities or security. The new software was developed in the US and 'anglicised' for UK use. Preparation took a year and involved 100,000 programming hours. The entire customer list was transferred to the new system over one weekend in July, he said. It would not have been possible to run the old and new systems in parallel because of the cost of providing duplicate computer hardware. Old computer systems are notoriously difficult to manage and maintain because they will have been patched and modified over the years. Mr Tobin, who is based in New York, said he flew to London during July for three weeks to oversee the transition to the new system, and left only last Friday when he was confident that the conversion had been successfully completed. TSB said yesterday that it did its own card processing and was not directly affected by the FDR system.</p>

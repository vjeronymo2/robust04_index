			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Rail workers call more strikes Three more days of rail signal workers' strikes were called yesterday as their union leaders reacted angrily to reports of Railtrack plans to sack workers, David Goodhart writes. The RMT transport union said a 48-hour stoppage would cover the whole of Tuesday and Wednesday September 14 and 15 and a 24-hour strike the whole of Friday September 23. They will follow a 24-hour strike called for next Thursday. Mr David Armstrong, human resources director of Railtrack, said he was appalled at the announcement of more stoppages. He said: 'Every striker has lost over Pounds 1,000. Railtrack's losses stand at over Pounds 100m. And for what? The RMT would rather indulge in a futile show of strength than negotiate a package that has been on the table since June 28 and would benefit every signal worker.' Reports of the Railtrack plan to dismiss striking workers and offer them new contracts drew an angry response from Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary. He insisted that a Railtrack policy of hoping to scare people back to work was 'doomed to failure'. He said: 'Railtrack should abandon their macho management stance and get back to genuine negotiations on RMT's claim. That is the only way this dispute is going to be resolved.' Railtrack said more than 53 per cent of trains ran during this week's 48-hour strike, the highest number so far.</p>

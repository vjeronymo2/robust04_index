			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Jiang Zemin to the Third Plenary Session of the </F> Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on 28 February]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- This plenary session of  the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is very  necessary to sum up the anticorruption drive in the previous  period and make plans for the next stage in accordance with the  Central Committee's suggestions. Comrade Wei Jianxing delivered  a very good report to the session. I am in full agreement. We  should redouble our efforts and make new progress on top of the  achievements already made.    Here I would like to address the following three issues:  <H3>  1. A Realistic Assessment of the Achievements of the  Anticorruption Drive in the Previous Period </H3>   Half a year has passed since the Central Committee announced  last August specific plans for intensifying the anticorruption  drive, improving party work style, and promoting clean  government. In assessing the work in the previous stage, we  should, I think, stress the following four points:    A) We have been fairly successful. Taken together, party  committees, governments, discipline inspection, supervision, and  judicial departments at all levels have worked actively and done  a great deal of painstaking work in implementing the Central  Committee's plans. We have, by and large, achieved the expected  results. The broad ranks of cadres and people have responded  positively and offered active support to the party and  government in intensifying the anticorruption drive. Thanks to  the common efforts of all quarters, we have achieved varying  degrees of success in the three tasks set by the Central  Committee for the near future. The momentum of spreading  corrupt manifestations has been halted. The results are even  more pronounced in localities and departments that have done a  better job in implementing this work. Although the  anticorruption drive involves considerable difficulties, we are  able to cut, step by step, corrupt phenomena to a minimum so  long as the leadership takes it seriously, enlists the  participation of the masses, and works together with them with  one heart and one mind.    B) The work has proceeded in a healthy manner. In setting  the short-term plan for fighting corruption, the Central  Committee pronounced a number of specific principles and  policies which have fundamentally guaranteed that this work will  be closely integrated with reform and construction. Practice  has shown that this work has -- rather than standing in the way  of reform and construction -- served as an important guarantee  for reform, opening up, and economic construction.    C) Judging from the problems that have been exposed, corrupt  phenomena are serious. Corruption has penetrated into broad  sections of our society; in particular, it is corroding our  party and government organs and the ranks of cadres. Criminal  offenses including abusing powers for personal gains,  participating in corrupt practices in violation of the law,  taking or demanding bribes are widespread to an alarming degree.  The situation tells us that if we do not fight this hard battle  with resolution, the party and state are in deed in danger of  collapse.    D) The tasks are tremendous and we must not slacken our  efforts. In view of the actual problems that are out there and  the people's demands of us, the work we have done so far falls  considerably short. Many problems have not been solved well and  the masses remain dissatisfied. The work has been implemented  unevenly from region to region and from department to  department. Some localities and department relayed the plans  and arrangements but did not pay enough attention to  implementing them afterwards. Some even just went through the  motions. Some localities and departments were guilty of gross  protectionism and there has been obstruction and resistance to  the investigations of major cases. Some leading cadres who  still entertain all sorts of misconceptions about the  anticorruption drive have not displayed adequate initiative.  All in all, we must continue to pay close attention to the  anticorruption drive. In short, we must affirm the  achievements, take note of the problems, sum up experience, keep  a clear head, and redouble our efforts to implement the  anticorruption drive well.  <H3>  2. Several Suggestions for the Anticorruption Drive in the  Next Stage </H3>   A) The Central Committee has set the basic principles and  overall situation for the work of the whole party in 1994. The  anticorruption drive must subordinate and serve these principles  and overall situation and it must be implemented in a deepgoing,  sustained, and more effective manner. This is the general  requirement.    B) The anticorruption drive cannot be accomplished  overnight.  Hence, we should solve problems one by one, investigate cases  one by one, and deepen the drive step by step. A slightest  relaxation of guard may spoil all that has been achieved. We  must be prepared to fight a protracted battle and push the drive  forward phase by phase. We must never provide a "pliable  environment" for corrupt behavior; and we must never allow the  corrupt elements to act willfully and get off scot-free.    C) In addition to the three main tasks set by the Central  Committee last August, the current session has put forward some  new requirements. All localities and departments must combine  these three tasks with the new requirements and earnestly  investigate and solve outstanding problems in each locality or  department. Those departments or localities that did not pay  adequate attention to the drive in the previous stage must  bestir themselves and catch up.    D) We gained an important experience from the anticorruption  drive in the early period; namely, we must firmly believe and  rely on the masses and must combine the arousing of the masses  to report corruption cases to the authorities with the special  organs' investigating them according to law. The merit of this  experience is that it can help uncover problems and promote the  conducting of the drive in an orderly manner. We must continue  to adhere to this experience. We must pay attention to  protecting people who report corruption; and must commend and  award those whose reports contribute to the drive.    E) We must earnestly investigate and handle corruption  problems exposed, especially major and important cases. We must  never turn big problems into small problems and end up with  nothing accomplished. We must never let bureaucrats shield each  other and localities and departments practice protectionism.  Those who harbor criminals must be punished according to party  discipline and state law.    F) We must pay attention to policies and stress focal  points.  Those who violate criminal law and party discipline must be  sternly dealt with according to law and party discipline.  People engaged in unhealthy practices should, in general, be  criticized and educated. Those who voluntarily examine and mend  themselves are fine; and those who refuse to undergo education  and to mend their ways should be punished by party or  administrative disciplinary action as deemed necessary. This is  for the purpose of education and enforcement of discipline.    G) We should bring into full play the role of the democratic  parties and people without party affiliation. We should  organize them to take part in implementing various tasks of the  anticorruption drive, and should listen to their opinions and  suggestions.    H) While launching the anticorruption drive, we must rectify  mistakes and promote party building at the same time; we must  address the issue by looking into both its root cause and  symptoms. The problems exposed show the existence of many  loopholes in our management system and of serious defects in  leadership style, which provide the opportunities for criminals  and corrupt elements. We must learn from mistakes and earnestly  sum up experiences and lessons by stopping the loopholes,  improving rules and regulations, strengthening management, and  resolutely getting rid of bureaucracy.    I) The key lies in strengthening leadership. Party  committees and governments at all levels must properly handle  the relationship between reform, development, and stability.  They must firmly grasp the central task of economic  construction and persist in grasping two links at the same time,  mapping out overall plans to effectively combine the  anticorruption drive with the deepening of reform, opening up  wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability.  Principal party and government leaders must personally attend to  the drive and solve important problems. They must support the  work of discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs  and coordinate various departments concerned so as to join  forces and promote in-depth development of the anticorruption  drive.  <H3>  3. Further Consolidate and Strengthen the Party's Flesh-and  Blood Ties With the Masses </H3>   In the final analysis, the anticorruption drive aims to  consolidate and strengthen the party's ties with the masses and  consolidate the position of the CPC as the ruling party under  the new circumstances so that our party can more effectively  carry out the historical responsibility of leading China's  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The ties  between the party and the masses is a fundamental political  issue that has a bearing on the success of the party's cause and  on the survival of the party. This principle must be stressed  repeatedly and for a long time to make sure that all comrades of  the party attach great importance to it.    The CPC is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, and  its  sole objective is to serve the people wholeheartedly. Our party  represents the people in exercising political power; all party  activities are aimed at protecting and fulfilling the interests  of the broad masses of the people. If we do not pay attention  to strengthening the party's ties with the masses and  eliminating phenomena of divorcing ourselves from the masses,  and if we let corruption spread unchecked, the CPC as the ruling  party will degenerate and lose popular support. If the economy  fails, we will collapse [jing ji gao bu hao hui kua tai 4842  3444 2269 0008 1170 2585 1006 0669]. Even if we do well in the  economy, but corruption, embezzlement, and bribery spread  unchecked and we seriously divorce ourselves from the masses, we  will collapse, too. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said as early as 1980:  "We must resolutely criticize and correct various mistakes of  divorcing ourselves from the masses and showing no interest in  the people's hardships. The masses are the source of our  strength; the mass line and mass viewpoint are our cherished  heritage. Party organizations, members, and cadres must  identify themselves with the masses; and must never stand  diametrically opposed to the masses. If a party organization  divorces itself from the masses and cannot make up its mind to  correct itself, it will forfeit the source of its strength, be  doomed to fail, and be abandoned by the people. All comrades of  the party and cadres at all levels, leading cadres in  particular, must always bear this point in mind and use it as a  criterion for examining their speeches and actions." We must  always remember these incisive, pertinent words and resolutely  implement them into concrete work.    The vast numbers of cadres and, in particular, leading  cadres  must study hard the Marxist mass viewpoint, adhere to the  party's mass line, constantly immerse themselves among the  masses, and improve their ideological and work style in a  down-to-earth manner. This is a necessity not only for  implementing the party's line, principles, and policies and  successfully fulfilling various tasks, but also for continuously  remolding world outlook, resisting corruption, and preventing  [peaceful] evolution. At the present, the masses in some areas  still live in poverty as they still do not have enough to eat  and wear. Each and every party cadre should constantly remember  their hardships. The stand, thinking, and feelings of party  cadres is a fundamental issue. When party cadres divorce  themselves from the masses, are indifferent to the masses' weal  and woe, and become apathetic, their thinking will inevitably  degenerate and it becomes hard for them to avoid corrupt  behavior.    The current situation in the country as a whole is very  good.  However, we must be aware of some contradictions and problems  confronting us in our march forward and of the existence of some  destabilizing factors in society. These problems should merit  our keen attention and should never be treated lightly. Leading  cadres at all levels and, in particular, principal leading  cadres must personally take a hand in successfully solving the  conspicuous problems in their own local localities. Where  problems are serious, leaders should visit the place to solve  the problems. If leaders sit in the office and make empty talk,  acting like bureaucrats and seriously divorcing themselves from  the masses without solving practical problems, how can they  fight corruption? The tasks we have undertaken are very heavy.  We must steadfastly rely on party organizations at all levels  and on cadres and the masses. The party and its cadres must  work together with the masses with one mind to maintain  political stability; to create a favorable social environment;  to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy;  to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic  development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa  zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660  4099 1455]; and to promote smooth progress of the undertaking to  build socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

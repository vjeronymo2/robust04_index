			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Health and development THE WORLD Development Report from the World Bank is a timely reminder that at the root of the world healthcare problem lies a remarkable success: the increase in the life expectancy of all of the world's citizens. Precisely how long, and how healthy, their lives will be is still excessively determined by place of birth. But the rules for serving their rising health needs as well as possible are the same the world over. In 1950, a child born in the developing world had a life expectancy of 40 years. Today it is 63 years. The chance of that child dying before the age of 5 is now 1 in 10, nearly three times lower than in 1950. The World Bank's report, Investing in Health, pays due tribute to such achievements, the result of gains in income and education as well as concerted public health programmes. Not that there is room for complacency. As the report notes, infant mortality is still 10 times higher in the developing world than in the established market economies because easily preventable health problems persist. Some 43 per cent of the burden of disease in Sub-Saharan Africa is due to complaints such as measles, which are cheaply prevented or cured. The report argues that governments could make progress even on existing budgets, by targeting funds more effectively. Broad scope The Bank's recommendations see a broad scope for the developing world to learn from the developed. Strategies which richer countries have found only belatedly in the face of rising health costs could be adopted now in many low and middle income countries. These would produce immediate gains in terms of human life as well as ensuring that future economic development has the maximum possible effect on health and living standards. Governments must target what they spend towards those services which offer the biggest return. The difficult calculation about the balance of spending between highly specialised treatments and simpler procedures of wider value applies in both rich and poor countries. In the developing world, many still die for lack of access to clean water. At the same time, the report encourages developing countries to promote diversity and competition in the funding and delivery of health services. The breadth of the Bank's experience enables it to show where lessons learnt in high income countries - about the dangers of fee-for-service insurance systems, for example, or scope for localised decision-making - can valuably be applied in poorer regions. Donors' role Growth in understanding of these points is at least as important as overall spending levels. The report notes that the share of overseas aid devoted to health fell from 7 to 6 per cent during the 1980s and argues that this cut should be restored. The Bank also points to a World Health Organisation estimate that less than half of all medical equipment in developing countries is usable. Donors clearly have a part to play in ensuring that money is wisely spent. The report also focuses upon two controversial areas: Aids and tobacco-related diseases. On current trends, each will be killing around 2m people a year in developing countries within 10 years. There is little support in this report for a fashionable western view that too much money is being spent on research into combatting Aids, although in the developing world, the key message is that preventive measures are as potentially effective as they are inadequately available. Diseases caused by tobacco also call for determined preventive programmes, although here the developed world's stance is compromised by the commercial interests of its cigarette manufacturers. The core message of the Bank's report is that investment in health and in growth are two sides of the same coin. There is a 'mutually reinforcing cycle' from improved health standards to higher productivity and stronger economic growth. The world's richest countries, as represented today at the G7 summit in Tokyo, have a role to play at each stage of the cycle, through nurturing information flows, aid programmes and, most important of all, the further development of a liberal system of international trade.</p>

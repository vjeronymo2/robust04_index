Cuban Ambassador Jorge Alberto Bolanos assured Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim that the alleged invitation does not  exist, to the extent that the Collors will not be lodged in any  of the official or special guest houses that the government owns  on the island.    A source close to Collor has admitted in a round about way  that an adviser of the former president was the origin of the  rumors. The former president will also visit France, but he will  not be given any exceptional honor.    The rumor that Collor was going to be treated as a chief of  state in Cuba caused a lot of concern in Havana, so much so that  the consul in Sao Paulo, Rafael Hidalgo, was asked to visit the  leaders of the Workers Party (PT, leftist) to express an  energetic denial.    The visit took place while a letter was on its way to Fidel  Castro from Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT's leader and  presidential candidate, in which he expresses surprise and  regret over any special reception for the former president,  although he also admitted the possibility that the rumor  originated within Collor's advisers, who are very active in  their campaign to reinstate him.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOTER ATTITUDES ON RAISING TAXES  </P> <P> Although neither group wants to believe it, California's elected officials and  its journalists are very much alike in one respect: Both consistently  underestimate and misread California's voters.  </P> <P> The best example ever was in how both politicians and press misread the voters'  intents in passing Proposition 13, which led to a major reduction in property  taxes as well as to stringent new requirements for levying new taxes. That  movement was characterized as a simple-minded, gut-level reaction against  taxes, even taxes for our children's education.  </P> <P> Not true! The driving element of that fiscal change was an intent to change how  taxes were collected, not an intent to hurt our kids. We voters didn't -- and  don't -- want to be taxed on our homes, which represent our life savings.  </P> <P> Neither the politicos nor the writers got the message that time. Did they think  we were too simple to reason at that level?  </P> <P> Now, we in Orange County are seeing it happen again. Proposition M fails and  the immediate official and unofficial responses are that Orange County won't go  for new taxes, even for the roads we need.  </P> <P> Not true again! Those of us who read the proposition realized that much of the  funding would go for new freeway lanes -- but diamond lanes we'd be forced to  pay for and then not be allowed to use.  </P> <P> We are already offended that gasoline taxes, once reserved for roads, were  diverted into the general fund under Cranston's leadership. We're already  offended that existing highway funds are being spent on lanes we are kept from  using. And, finally, we're offended that we were expected to be simple-minded  enough to vote for it.  </P> <P> Try it again, M, but this time separate rails from roads and diamonds from  asphalt.  </P> <P> Give us some credit. We will vote for school taxes if they are justified, just  not for property taxes for schools. And we will vote for freeways, just not for  diamond lanes.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. McLAUGHLIN  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

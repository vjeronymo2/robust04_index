			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Japan split over banks' bad debts JAPAN'S financial authorities are deeply divided over how commercial banks should deal with mounting bad debts. The Bank of Japan and the finance ministry favour different approaches. This threatens to complicate the banks' task as they set about writing off non-performing loans left after the collapse of the boom economy of the late 1980s. The outcome of the tussle over how to rid the banking system of bad loans could determine how Japan's financial system emerges from its present crisis. The Bank of Japan appears to want a far-reaching restructuring of the financial system, while the finance ministry favours a more gradualist approach in an attempt to keep most financial institutions afloat. The Bank of Japan is urging the commercial banks to take swift action to write off bad loans. They want other banks to follow the lead of Sumitomo Bank, which recently wrote off Y100bn (Pounds 584m) of failed property-related loans. Bank officials are warning the main banks that they may have only limited room for manoeuvre in writing off bad loans. The banks are making strong operating profits partly because successive reductions in the Bank of Japan's official interest rate has reduced the cost to the banks of borrowing from the central bank. As these reductions in interest rates have not been fully passed on to customers, the banks have been able to widen their profit margins. However, the BoJ is warning banks that in the next year or two, as growth recovers, interest rates may start rising, cutting into banks' profits. This would limit their ability to pay for bad loans from profits. Officials at the Bank of Japan recognise that this policy would require some banks to declare losses for the first time in their history. Finance ministry officials want to take a more gradual approach to the write-offs. One official said: 'It is not practical or possible to write off bad loans in one or two strokes in the near future. It is all very well for Sumitomo to write off bad loans but it is a very profitable bank. For less profitable banks it is much more difficult.' The model for the finance ministry approach is the recent deal to bail out Nippon Housing Loan, the deeply troubled housing finance arm of several commercial banks. Rather than write off Nippon Housing's bad loans swiftly, its nine banks have agreed to forgo interest on outstanding loans worth Y830bn for up to 10 years. Agricultural banks, led by Norinchukin, will continue to receive an interest rate of 4.5 per cent on their loans to Nippon Housing. Tokyo bankers say the joint body set up by the banks earlier this year to help them dispose of their bad loans is working very slowly.</p>

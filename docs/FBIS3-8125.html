			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague March 3 (CTK) -- At his meeting with  Chairman of the Slovenian Parliament Herman Rigelnik on Thursday  [3 March], Chairman of the Czech Parliament Milan Uhde expressed  his full support for Slovenia's efforts at joining European  structures.    Uhde rejected any speculations aimed at the division of  Europe into different spheres of influence. Democratic  principles and abiding by the law are values most respected by  the Czech Republic in evaluating states' authority.    Rigelnik stated that Slovenia would never forget the Czech  Republic's contribution to the recognition of the independent  Slovenian state. He said that the clear majority of Slovenian  residents had been for their homeland's independence. However,  if they had not been backed from abroad and "by friends", it  would have been more difficult to attain independence, he said.    Uhde and Rigelnik expressed their interest in working out  and adopting a standard Czech-Slovenian agreement on friendship  and cooperation.    Rigelnik stressed that Slovenia was part of Central Europe,  and that for 70 years it has been forcedly pushed to the Balkan  region. He described as unacceptable such efforts of "other  subjects" which he did not specify.    Rigelnik said that Europe still lacked a defence identity, a  shortcoming which surfaced in its relation to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Referring to the reinforcement of the  Russian military presence in the former Yugoslavia, he admitted  that Russia was trying to strengthen its position in the Balkans.    Europe needs inspiration to consider its own set-up. That is  why we must play an active role, he emphasised.    As to the West European protectionism, Rigelnik said that  the  Western Europe was willing to negotiate "with us", but that it  was pursuing its own interests. Therefore a joint attitude of  Slovenia, the Czech Republic and other countries undergoing  transformation is important so that they can attain conditions  of advantage in the process of their integration with Western  European structures.    Rigelnik described Slovakia as a stable country. Its economy  stabilised last year but it faces high unemployment, he added.  Uhde told Rigelnik that the Czech Republic was relatively  stable from both political and economic points of view.</p>

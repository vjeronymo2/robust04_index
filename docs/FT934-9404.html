			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Military chief fears for Nato expansion NATO'S most senior military official yesterday expressed clear reservations about expanding the alliance, saying its effectiveness could be undermined. Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military committee, also warned against offering security guarantees to former members of the Warsaw Pact. Drawing comparisons with security promises made in the late 1930s, he said guarantees had to be underpinned by political will and by military capabilities. 'I do not see either of these seriously in prospect,' he told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute in London. He said his remarks were 'strictly personal'. Sir Richard recognised that Nato might not be moving 'far and fast enough' to satisfy the expectations of central and eastern European countries or to fulfil its own aim of helping to create a stable security environment. But Nato's best path was a step-by-step policy based on practical military co-operation in areas such as peacekeeping. Allies could not afford to 'rush into this recklessly'. There were already signs that different national and regional perceptions among existing allies were making it more difficult to achieve a common approach. Links with eastern Europe will be high on the agenda of a Nato summit in Brussels on January 10. Sir Richard's outspokenness created a stir earlier this year when he said Nato could not intervene in Yugoslavia unless political leaders provided clear objectives. He returned to this theme yesterday, arguing that a larger-scale military operation required decisions beforehand on its scope, on its funding, on who should take the ultimate responsibility and on who would exercise day-to-day oversight and direction.</p>

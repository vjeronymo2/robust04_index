			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina article: "Russia-NATO: </F> Will Partnership Come About?"]    [Text] The question of whether Russia will subscribe to  NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, and on what terms, is  being decided now while Russian Federation Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev is in Brussels, which houses the headquarters of  the North Atlantic bloc.    A few days before Pavel Grachev arrived in Belgium, a group  of Moscow journalists and scientists of the Russian  Sociopolitical Center along with your correspondent visited  Brussels, where the NATO leadership devoted the maximum  attention to us to explain the essence of the partnership  program.    Let me remind you that the invitation to states belonging to  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and to CSCE countries to  subscribe to the partnership program was approved by the 16 NATO  countries 10 January 1994. The framework document of this  agreement proposes that each country should make an individual  contribution to military cooperation with NATO and that joint  peacemaking, rescue, and humanitarian operations should be  conducted.    Eighteen countries, including several CIS states, have  already responded to NATO's invitation to join the partnership.  In June their representatives will take their seats in a  specially prepared office and will commence joint work.    But Russia, as is known, has put to NATO the condition that  its great-power status be recognized and that our country be  granted special powers within the framework of the "Partnership  for Peace" program. Pavel Grachev's position was even more  rigid: He repeatedly advanced a demand for preliminary  consultations between the leadership of the North Atlantic  alliance and Russia in the event of decisions being adopted on  the forced establishment of peace in conflict zones.    NATO Deputy Secretary General von Moltke and also other  leaders of the alliance, with whom we associated closely, told  us gently yet adamantly that the North Atlantic alliance is  prepared to take Russia's special status into account and to  conclude an individual bilateral agreement with it, but only  outside the program, participation in which presupposes equal  terms for all countries.    To judge from the answer to a question which I put to the  president of Russia on the eve of the Russian Federation defense  minister's visit to Brussels, Boris Yeltsin gave Pavel Grachev  instructions to defend the position declared by Moscow: To join  the partnership, but to stipulate the simultaneous signing of a  large-scale agreement between NATO and the Russian Federation.  Thus, the question of Russia's joining the partnership remains  open, as before.    The misgivings that the Russian authorities have about the  NATO program are accounted for both by the fact that the USSR's  former Warsaw Pact allies have joined the North Atlantic bloc  alliance and, particularly, by the recent bombing strikes  against Bosnian Serb positions in the former Yugoslavia, which  were not agreed with Russia.    Proceeding from this, Russian politicians are focusing  attention on the military aspect of the partnership program. On  the one hand, they are concerned about the question of  obligations relating to the joint ensuring of democratic control  over defense forces, about which our military are, naturally,  unenthusiastic. On the other hand, the problem of  standardization of the NATO partners' military equipment, which  could deprive Russia of sales markets for its armaments, is  being raised repeatedly.    At the NATO headquarters, in response to misgivings of this  kind, we heard arguments which merit attention. Participation  in international structures really does bind countries in a net  of obligations, Mr. Leroy, leader of a department, told us, but  what is bad about that if joint obligations restrict states with  regard to drastic actions without prior consultations? For this  constitutes concern for collective security.    Developing this argument, NATO experts said that Russia's  failure to subscribe to the partnership program would give our  internal opposition a clear trump card, and in that case there  will be an increased potential danger of Russia's being drawn  into conflicts.    Another counterargument by the Russian military against  subscribing to the partnership porgram was the opinion that  participation in it will mess up the CIS countries' collective  security treaty. But, first, eight former Soviet republics have  already joined the partnership with NATO. Second, overall  membership of the program would be capable of ensuring global  security "from Vancouver to Vladivostok."    In addition, it is also impossible to disagree with the  argument that it is better to influence decisionmaking -- which  Russia seeks to do within the framework of the European and  world community -- by being within the structure and not being  isolated.    On the other hand, the thesis that economic cooperation with  developed countries is the priority for Russia seems fair. If  we are invited to military cooperation, why not link this  question to the opening up of European markets to goods from  Russia?    Otherwise we get an undisguised picture of the desire of the  United States and West Europe to bind Russia with obligations to  maintain stability and security without reinforcing its  membership of the partnership program with economic cooperation.  Without the latter it will not be easy to find considerable  additional funds in the Russian budget for Russia's dues for the  "Partnership for Peace" program. Having adopted the political  decision to subscribe to it, Russia still retains the right to  draw up a bilateral agreement with NATO.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After a temporary paralysis in the construction of  the Juragua nuclear plant, the main concern of the personnel is  maintenance, in which several organizations have joined. For  many years, the people of Cienfuegos have grown accustomed to  this great project on the coast a few kilometers from the city.  The Juragua nuclear power plant is the most ambitious symbol of  industrial development in this province.    The causes of the momentary interruption of this  construction  are well known, but Cuba has not given up. All efforts are now  aimed at the preservation of the existing construction.  Continuous contacts are under way with the Russians concerning  technical aspects of the temporary paralysis of construciton on  the nuclear power plant as well as the supplies that are  essential for its preservation. At present, 2,000 workers are  engaged in its maintenance.    Several potential foreign investors are evaluating the  possibility of investing in the Juragua project. A state  committee was recently created to conduct these negotiations.  The committee is also responsible for coordinating the aid that  the national economy, despite its limitations, can give to this  project. A number of organizations in Cuba have sufficient  resources to meet the needs of the project at this stage and to  guarantee the fulfillment of the maintenance program agreed upon  in September [year indistinct] when the decision was made to  halt construction on the plant.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] I believe it can be  fulfilled this year. [end recording]    International atomic energy organizations in charge of  overseeing nuclear plants have issued favorable reports  concerning the plant's safety and the qualified training of the  technical personnel. For all Cubans, the Juragua nuclear plant  is the project of the century. Its construction continues,  notwithstanding current difficulties.</p>

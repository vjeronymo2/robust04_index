			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / BCCI official 'withheld data' An official with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International helped to boost the bank's profits artificially by almost Dollars 250m by manipulating loan accounts, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Mr Anthony Evans QC, prosecuting, said Mr Imran Imam, who was an account officer at BCCI's London headquarters, also withheld crucial information from Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, which allowed a false picture of BCCI's profitability to be presented to the outside world. Mr Imam is charged with six offences including two of conspiring to conceal documents, three of furnishing false information and one of conspiring to falsify records. He denies all the charges. Mr Evans said that Mr Imam worked alongside the two most important men in BCCI - Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, its former president, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its former chief executive. Although junior to both men, Mr Imam played an important role in the multi-million-dollar fraud which led to the bank's collapse, he said. In one part of the alleged fraud, Mr Imam was involved in inflating profits by falsifying documents relating to loans apparently made to eight wealthy individuals, Mr Evans said. These loans were not genuine, he continued. Shares in the Dutch Antilles-based company Credit and Commerce American Holdings, which were used as security for the loans, were held by the individuals only as nominees. Mr Imam was aware of this and failed to report it. Documents also showed that BCCI never expected the loans to be repaid. However, the bank's accounts showed that between 1982 and 1989 Dollars 500m was charged to the bank in the form of interest and fees, Mr Evans said. Of this, Dollars 248m was charged between 1987 and 1989, the period covered by the charges against Mr Imam. The trial continues today.</p>

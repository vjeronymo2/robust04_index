			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: Criticism of MMC competence at variance with experience Sir, While I agree with David Sawers' view ('A high-price market', August 4) that 'the most necessary reform is to give the OFT (Office of Fair Trading) power to investigate where the restrictive practices exist', I take issue with a number of his criticisms of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. First, he suggests that the MMC 'can at best be described as unprofessional and at worst incompetent' and that 'a depressing aura of mediocrity hangs over the MMC and its staff'. On the contrary, I have always been struck by the thoroughness and competence of the MMC - an impression that has also been voiced by clients which I have represented before it. These clients have been favourably impressed by the commission's depth of understanding of their industry and the incisiveness of its questioning. Second, the MMC is criticised for having part-time commissioners. I have never found this to be a disadvantage. On the contrary, it has helped build clients' confidence that the commissioners are still in touch with the way industry thinks and works. Third, David Sawers refers to the 'rigid legalistic approach' with which MMC proceedings are conducted. I find this a somewhat puzzling criticism given the lack of rigid procedures, the possibility for open debate in oral hearings, and the possibility to contact the MMC at any time during an investigation - by letter, fax or telephone. If Mr Sawers has found things too legalistic, I would suggest that this may have more to do with the way in which particular companies and their legal advisers went about the investigation than with the MMC itself.

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Business and the Law: UK benefits discriminatory - European Court The European Court of Justice has ruled that invalidity benefits which discriminate against women can only be justified under EC legislation if the form of the discrimination already exists under other benefit schemes and is necessary and objectively linked to the difference in retirement age. The case concerned the right in the UK to severe disablement and invalidity care allowances. Both sets of allowances cannot be claimed by individuals over retirement age, which in the UK is 60 for women and 65 for men. The case was brought by five women who were refused the allowances because they had reached the age of 60. The House of Lords asked for a preliminary ruling from the European Court on the issue of whether UK law was compatible with EC law. The court ruled that the statutory schemes fell within the scope of the relevant EC legislation. The UK legislation was discriminatory and could only be justified under a provision in the EC legislation which allows member states to determine for themselves the pensionable age 'for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits'. The court then relied on a recent decision involving the UK Equal Opportunities Commission. This was to determine that forms of discrimination provided for in benefit schemes other than old-age and pension schemes can be justified only if such discrimination is necessary to avoid disrupting the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure consistency between retirement and other benefit schemes. In a rare move for a preliminary ruling, the court held that as it was called on to provide worthwhile answers for the national court, it had the jurisdiction to give guidance as to whether the criteria justifying discrimination existed in fact. In this fact-finding guise the court strongly found against the UK schemes and the arguments put forward in their support by the UK government. C-328/91: Secretary of State for Social Security v Thomas and others, ECJ 6CH, March 30 1993. German rules restricting mutual recognition valid. The European Court has upheld German rules which restrict the use in Germany of a master's degree obtained from a university outside Germany without authorisation from the local authorities. The case was brought by a Mr Kraus, who obtained a masters degree from Edinburgh university and hoped to use it to continue his legal studies in Germany. The local authorities refused to accept his degree because it was not accompanied by the relevant form and DM 13, as required under German law. Mr Kraus argued the German law was incompatible with Rome Treaty provisions on the free movement of workers and the right of establishment. The court on a preliminary reference from a Stuttgart court held first that the subject matter was governed by EC law. However, at the time the case was brought there was no specific legislation dealing with postgraduate degrees. Member states were therefore competent to deal with such matters in their own territories. However such action by member states was limited to restricting the exercise of the fundamental rights to free movement and establishment which were guaranteed by the Rome treaty. C-19/92: Kraus v Land Baden-Wurttemberg, ECJ FC, March 31 1993. German licence rules on canal navigation valid German rules which only allow carriers access to canals in Germany if they are in possession of an accredited navigation licence were upheld by the European Court. The court upheld a member state's right to employ this type of licence scheme, but emphasised that members were not entitled to modify such schemes in a manner which discriminated against carriers from other EC countries. Joined Cases C-184/91 and C-221/91: Ooburg and van Messem v Wasser-und Schiffahrtdirektion Norwest, Aurich, ECJ 6CH, March 31 1993.</p>

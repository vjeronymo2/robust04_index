			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Employers criticise Tecs as inflexible More than one-in-four employers find training and enterprise councils in England and Wales and local enterprise councils in Scotland inflexible, says one of the first large-scale surveys of business attitudes to the employer-led bodies. It also found that one in five criticised the relevance of the help the councils gave. The survey of 234 employers - with a combined workforce of nearly 500,000 - found a significant mismatch between what employers believed Tecs and Lecs should be doing and what employers thought they actually were doing. For example, local economic development was given the highest priority by employers - 33.8 per cent gave it top priority - but only 7 per cent believed that Tecs and Lecs put this at the top of their agenda. However, the Tecs (which deliver government training schemes) and Lecs (which have a wider economic development role) will find some encouragement in the survey by employment analysts Industrial Relations Services. It reported that 87.2 per cent of companies use the councils' services. An Industrial Society report in May 1991 found that less than half of companies had such contact. But the IRS survey is biased towards larger organisations and 23 per cent of respondents were represented on the local Tec or Lec. Those companies that did have contact tended to come more from manufacturing than services, with financial services particularly under-represented. Companies gave four main reasons for contact, all of them connected with government-inspired initiatives: Investors in People, National and Scottish Vocational Qualifications, training courses and Youth Training. Less encouraging for Tecs and Lecs was that only one-third of respondents who contacted the organisations said they did so about issues of central importance to them. Smaller companies generally reported more satisfaction than larger ones, although between 65 per cent and 88 per cent - depending on the issue in question - were either satisfied or very satisfied. The biggest complaint from larger companies in particular was 'civil service attitudes'. Most organisations that spanned several Tecs or Lecs complained of problems and one national organisation said that the only way it could deal with the Tec was to employ one person full-time.

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Speaking of trees, famed graphic artist Peter Max donated an original  acrylic-on-canvas painting portraying two trees to Mayor Tom Bradley, who  accepted the Max original on behalf of TreePeople, a Los Angeles-based  conservation group that is organizing a program to plant as many as 5 million  trees across the city over the next five years. Though TreePeople officials  have yet to decide what to do with the painting, it will either be used as a  symbol for the planting campaign or auctioned to help raise money for the  multimillion dollar effort.

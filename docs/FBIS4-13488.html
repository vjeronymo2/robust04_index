			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nada 'Ammar from Beirut Airport] </F>   [Text] Following the Lebanese Government's decision to  sever diplomatic relations with Iraq as a result of the killing  of Shaykh Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, the following Iraqi diplomats  were deported at 1015 today: Charge d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri and  Attaches Salam 'Ayid Makhul and Samir Ahmad 'Ali Husayn.    The Iraqi diplomatic mission arrived at Beirut International  Airport in an Iraqi Embassy vehicle at 0845 today.

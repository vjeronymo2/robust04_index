			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (9): The Catalan powerbroker - Profile: Jordi Pujol MR Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalists, and Mr Xavier Arzallus, leader of the Basque nationalists, are likely to get the electoral result later this year that they have been waiting for ever since democracy was reintroduced to post-Franco Spain. The prospect of a hung parliament converts their regionally-based minority parties into powerbrokers. Polls suggest that the governing Socialist party will do well to hold 160 seats in congress, 15 short of an overall majority, when general elec- tions are held in five or six months' time. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, could therefore be forced to rely on the 18-odd members that Mr Pujol's Convergencia i Unio (CiU) party returns to the Madrid parliament and, con- ceivably, on the five to six that are returned by Mr Arzallus' Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV). With current voting trends showing a clear swing to the centre-right opposition party, the Partido Popular (PP), the two nationalist leaders may even find themselves being courted by both the main political groups. Wooing the nationalists will not be an agreeable task for the Socialists or, should it come to that, for the PP. Mr Pujol and Mr Arzallus are essentially single issue politicians. Rooted in the mystique of their respective cultures and traditions, which they view as the objects of sustained harassment down the ages by Madrid centralism, they want nothing, more nor less, than ever-increasing self-government for their communities. Given the choice, Mr Pujol and Mr Arzallus would prefer an association with Mr Gonzalez. When they are not abstaining in the Madrid parliament, the CiU and the PNV have tended to side with the governing party and the PNV has for years maintained a somewhat testy relationship with the Socialists in the Basque Country where the two parties govern in coalition, the Socialists as junior partners. However, neither nationalist leader is at all anxious to join a Gonzalez-led coalition government. Should they do so, they would risk losing their conservative supporters - the CiU and the PNV have a strong Christian Democrat component - and they would also be challenged by the more committed nationalist minority parties in both Catalonia and the Basque Country. A tacit support in parliament is the most that Mr Gonzalez can expect. Mr Pujol has said that the Catalan nationalists can be relied upon to ensure the governance of Spain but he left unsaid, because it did not need saying, that the price for doing so would be a set of assurances that would allow him to govern Catalonia with as little interference as possible. Such a federal-weighted scenario need not be as grim as some Madrid-based politicians and political pundits make out. It would acknowledge the reality of a multinational Spain and replace the often bruising confrontation of the past with a hands-off and respectful collaboration.</p>

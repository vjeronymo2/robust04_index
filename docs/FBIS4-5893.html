			<p>BFN     [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos has approved the adoption  of new measures to speed up the actualization of the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area or AFTA following the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations under the General  Agreement on Tariff and Trade or GATT. With the signing of the  Uruguay Round final act this month, the ASEAN-member countries  want to ensure that preferential treatment under the AFTA is not  diminished. The ASEAN groups the Philippines, Indonesia,  Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei Darussalam.    President Ramos approved three basic approaches as proposed  by the Philippine Council for ASEAN Cooperation's Technical  Board. These are:    -- Broadening the coverage of the Common Effective  Preferential Tariff or CEPT by including products selected from  the temporary exclusion list;    -- Broadening the same inclusion list by including  unprocessed agricultural products from the permanent exclusion  list; and,    -- Improving the existing AFTA CEPT inclusion list.    Under the first approach, some 52 items were first delisted  from temporary exclusion list. These items are those classified  as natural processed and those under Memorandum Order No. 95  implementing the Magna Carta for Small Farmers and the  government rationalization program.    A line-by-line evaluation of the remaining 662 items in the  temporary exclusion list will be done to determine which should  be included in the AFTA CEPT scheme based on a set of criteria.    Under the second approach, some unprocessed agricultural  products will be lifted from the permanent exclusion list to  conform with increasing criteria adopted by other member  countries.    The third approach includes measures shortening from 15  years  to 10 years the period for bringing the tariff levels of 1,086  [word indistinct] to 5 percent or less, as well as deepening the  tariff cuts.</p>

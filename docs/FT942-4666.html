			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bank leads Banking group Standard Chartered was the FT-SE 100's best individual performer for the second consecutive session, the shares following Monday's 12p rise with a further gain of 10 at 262p after renewed aggressive buying from Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. Morgan Stanley recently published a strong buy recommendation on the stock, emphasising the bank's 'very good long-term prospects, cost-cutting ability and dividend growth potential'. Mr Nick Collier, banks specialist at Morgan Stanley, said Standard shares had come down from the equivalent of 358p and that he had emphasised the selling had been overdone. 'The rerating of Standard has only just begun,' he added. A buy recommendation from Yamaichi helped J. Sainsbury buck the general trend and rise 3 to 384p. The broker highlighted a stronger than anticipated recovery in sales and the impact of subsidiaries - such as Homebase and US retailer Shaw's - as major factors in the recovery, and believes the 'Essential for Essentials' campaign, launched last October, has been successful enough to put strong pressure on other retailers. 'If Sainsbury and the other majors can contain the discounters and if cost reductions can be implemented, then it is possible to forecast some recovery in profit levels for some parts of the industry,' it said. Yamaichi is forecasting Pounds 787m pre-tax profits for the current year and Pounds 847m for 1996. Strong sentiment pushed RTZ ahead with a buy note from Kleinwort Benson and an upgrade of this year's estimates from Lehman Brothers helping the shares post an increase of 13 to 833p. Lehman boosted its earnings per share forecast from 37.6p to 40.8p for this year on the back of a substantial upward revision of the copper price by the broker. It raised its estimate for the average copper price for 1994 from 78 cents/lb to 92 cents/lb, citing a combination of high demand in the US and strong investment interest. Turnover reached 2m. Unilever bounced back from yesterday's 22p fall, gaining 13 to close at 988p. Sentiment recovered after this morning's statement from Dutch retailer Ahold that it would continue to stock the Unilever washing powder which rival Procter &amp; Gamble has alleged ruins clothes. Kleinwort Benson moved from hold to buy; Richard Allen said the worst possible case was a one-off write-off of about 3 per cent of market capitalisation, about Pounds 250,000 - even on that basis, the stock was undervalued 'and that is not our central case,' he added. 'Remember over 50 per cent of Unilever's business is in sectors that are growing as well as if not better than the market. The shares represent good value at this level.' Enterprise Oil slipped 9 to 379p, with the shares increasingly weakened by fears that a robust defence document which has to be made by the end of this week from bid target Lasmo, could bring a higher offer from Enterprise. Lasmo shares were again upset by selling from speculators who bought the shares ahead of the much-rumoured bid, closing 5 1/2 off at 135 1/2p. Amersham shares surged 33 to 871p in the wake of excellent preliminary results which showed pre-tax profits up over 65 per cent and the dividend total up 15 per cent. The good figures and news of a proposed one-for-one scrip issue saw Allied Colloids advance 11 to 260p. Heavy turnover of 5.7m in brewer Bass was prompted by a change from hold to buy by Kleinwort Benson, but the stock eased a penny to 519p. Mr David Thompson said the two concerns of big cash outflow and beer pricing had now been factored into the price. Results from Great Portland Estates disappointed the market this morning, knocking 7 off the share price to close at 196p. A NAV of 209p per share compared badly with expectations in the 225-230p range, and a cautious statement on the prospects for rental growth did nothing to allay fears. Continued benefit from its announcement of talks to take a stake in Fokker and news of a Colombian contract buoyed British Aerospace, which added 9 at 468p with 1.3m shares traded. The stock was backed in buy notes from UBS, Strauss Turnbull and NatWest.</p>

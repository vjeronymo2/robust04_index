			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Tension rises as US rebuffs Japan trade package offer Trade tension between the US and Japan worsened last night as Washington rebuffed a Japanese market-opening package, dismissing it as 'of little substance'. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said that the package unveiled earlier in the day by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, was a 'half-finished work' that did not meet US concerns. Mr Hosokawa had hoped the package would go a long way to meeting US pressure for steps to stimulate Japan's economy and open its markets wider to foreign goods, reducing its trade surplus. Mr Kantor's rejection, backed by the White House, will be a severe blow to Mr Hosokawa. The package was carefully put together after the US laid the groundwork for possible trade sanctions in the wake of Japan's refusal last month to provide numerical targets for imports. Japanese officials claimed yesterday that except for setting numerical targets, their package conceded most demands made in previous negotiations with the US. The package aims to boost the economy and open markets to foreign goods through deregulation and enhanced competition, laying particular stress on four sectors - telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance and motor vehicle parts. But Mr Kantor still insisted on 'qualitative and quantitative indicators' to measure the progress of export penetration of Japan's markets. He indicated he wanted specific agreements on key sectors, more movement in regulatory reform and 'a significant new commitment toward macroeconomic stimulus'. Mr Kantor said the package was not enough to lead to a resumption of the US-Japanese trade talks that broke up without agreement during a summit in Washington last month. But he sought to soften the US rejection by referring to the measures as 'a work in progress'. The US was not discouraged, he said, adding: 'Our door remains open.' Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate international trade subcommittee, could summon no more enthusiasm than Mr Kantor. 'This very modest package of reforms that Japan unveiled yesterday only provides further evidence that Japan only makes real concessions under concrete pressure,' he said. Mr Kantor said the package showed progress in the area of government procurement, but there was 'no movement' in the motor vehicle and insurance sectors. 'We don't want cosmetic agreements,' he added. Yesterday the dollar dropped sharply in New York to Y103.6 against Y104.62 previously on speculation that the US would push for a higher yen. In Tokyo this morning it opened at Y103.2. Package details, Page 6</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Ramiro de Leon </F> Carpio, following a meeting with Costa Rican President-elect  Jose Maria Figueres, with unidentified domestic and foreign  reporters in Guatemala City on 12 April; from the "Telepress"  newscast]    [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio on 12 April flatly  denied a media report about his alleged secret agreement with  deputies to ensure that they will extend their terms in the  National Congress until January 1996. De Leon Carpio held a  news conference after meeting with Costa Rican President-elect  Jose Maria Figueres. De Leon talked about the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal [TSE] decision to hold elections to choose a new  Congress on 14 August. This new Congress will function until  January 1996. He pointed out that he will ask the magazine that  published the report on the alleged secret pact to explain its  article.    [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...is false. As for  the first question, through the Public Relations Secretariat of  the Presidency, we denied the report and asked the magazine that  published it to offer an explanation in its next issue. We have  sent the media our explanation that this report lacks integrity.  In addition, the report mentioned the Army, as well as  Christian Democrat Alfonso Cabrera. I flatly deny this. I have  not met with him. If I had, I would admit it. I have no  reasons to hide it. I repeat, it is untrue that I met with him;  it is untrue there was such a pact.    [Reporter] The TSE today decided to hold congressional  elections on 14 August. What is your opinion on this decision?    [De Leon] Imagine the great pleasure that is overcoming me,  because it pleases me to say this in front of the Costa Rican  president-elect and his distinguished delegation, which  represent Central American democracy. Costa Ricans have upheld  democracy for so many years. There were times when Costa Rica  was the only democratic country in the region. We Guatemalans  admire, commend, and -- I admit it -- even envy them. If there  is something we lack, it is their democratic system and the  respect for human rights that has ennobled Costa Ricans and  their country.    I say this because today is a very special day. The TSE  called elections as a result of a popular consultation.  Regardless of the number of citizens who participated in the  electoral process and regardless of abstentionism, the people  chose to follow this path, the most difficult path. It is worth  recognizing that Guatemala is following the most difficult, yet  democratic and constitutional, path. A few months ago, when  institutional and constitutional order broke down, the  Guatemalan people requested that the three governmental branches  be purged. The executive branch acquiesced when I arrived at  the Presidency. It is still acquiescing, but it asked and  demanded the purging of the other two branches.    Unlike what was done and is being done in other countries in  which illegal channels are being used, we are resorting to  democratic ways until we fully comply with the people's  determination. People won a great battle: They will have a new  legislative organization -- namely, a new Congress  democratically elected by the Guatemalan people. They will also  have a new court of justice. The TSE's decision to hold  congressional elections strengthens all of these achievements,  which, along with the new constitutional reforms that have gone  into effect as the result of the desirable mechanism of popular  elections, undoubtedly make me unable to hide my great pleasure,  because, as Costa Rica found out many years ago, we are also  finding that democratic path, the path of respecting the  Guatemalan people. I believe the Guatemalan people are  beginning to know, defend, and love the democratic system for  the first time. They showed this love by defending it in May of  last year.    I have not been asked to say this, but I am going to say it  anyway. It is a great honor and pleasure for me to meet with  the president-elect of our sister nation of Costa Rica, Jose  Maria Figueres, because he is a great symbol for us. I repeat,  meeting with President-elect Figueres and his honorable  delegation is a great pleasure for all Guatemalans, because they  represent a truly democratic system.    As I said before, if there was something we Guatemalans had,  it was the lack of democracy. We have never, or almost never,  lived in democracy. On the contrary, our history is plagued  with all types of dictatorships -- civilian, military, personal,  collective, open, blatant, and sometimes underhanded.  Dictatorships, coups d'etats, and electoral fraud plague our  history. I say this before Costa Rica, which has implemented a  different system -- a system of accepting the results of the  Costa Ricans' political resolve. By meeting with Figueres  today, we are greatly pleased, because we feel we are following  the same path.    We are emulating them, and we are advancing toward that  democratic path they started traveling so many years ago.  Additionally, the good relations between both presidents -- one  a president-elect and the other an incumbent -- are satisfying  to the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan people. This  underscores the excellent relations not only between Costa Rica  and Guatemala, but those relations at the Central American level  as well.    President-elect Figueres just said Central American economic  integration will be further strengthened. This is our  intention. He also referred to our plans concerning NAFTA and a  series of issues and objectives that are of common interest to  Costa Rica and Guatemala, as well as to all Central American  countries. Therefore, I reiterate before the domestic and  foreign press that you, Mr. Costa Rican President-Elect, are  welcome in this country, which is struggling to find the  democratic path you found so many years ago.    [Reporter] Mr. President, after you stated last night in  your  message that some countries have opposed [words indistinct] to  provide the equipment needed to [words indistinct]. What  countries were you referring to specifically?    [De Leon] Well, I would say -- as I said last night in my  message to the nation -- it is ironic that today, when there is  a president who respects human rights and who is striving to  respect human rights and to attain peace, thereby achieving  respect for individual rights, there appear problems, obstacles,  and stumbling blocks from some countries that are demanding that  our civilian military forces be demilitarized. In light of our  work plan, as we attempt to devise ways to fight poverty and  achieve respect for economic, social, and cultural rights, it is  ironic that such obstacles be presented.    Nevertheless, when we ask for equipment or support [words  indistinct] I am not going to answer your question in full,  because I prefer that the representatives [one-second reception  break] who have heard this report by the people of Guatemala,  through their president, reconsider it and note the irony of  this. At this moment, we need to strengthen civilian security  forces. To this end, however, we undoubtedly need the aid these  countries offer to other countries. [end recording]</p>

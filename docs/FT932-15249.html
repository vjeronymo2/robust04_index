			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Bonds: Sterling sector braced as Japanese units set to raise Pounds 600m THE STERLING market braced itself yesterday for a further spate of activity, amid expectations that two Japanese power companies are preparing to raise about Pounds 600m in sterling Eurobonds today. Swap spreads in the sterling market have widened further in recent days, creating fresh arbitrage opportunities for borrowers. Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the largest of the Japanese power companies, has mandated Credit Suisse First Boston to arrange a Pounds 300m five-year issue, which CSFB plans to launch today. The proceeds are expected to be swapped into yen via floating-rate sterling. With five-year swap spreads at about 50 basis points above Libor, the borrower is expected to achieve a funding level of around 15 basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor), assuming a launch spread of about 35 basis points over the five-year gilt yield. Kansai Electric Power is also believed to be preparing a Pounds 300 five-year deal via SG Warburg, but the timing of this deal is more uncertain. Officials at SG Warburg declined to comment. After record volume in the first quarter, the sterling sector is suffering from some overhang of paper, despite strong demand. In particular, there has been a surplus of five-year paper. However, further issues are expected to be concentrated at this area of the yield curve, because swap opportunities are most attractive over a five-year term. Seven-year swap spreads are around 35 basis points and 10-year swap spreads are currently about 25 basis points, compared with five-year swap spreads of 50 basis points. Yesterday, Deutsche Bank Finance added a further Pounds 100m tranche to its outstanding Pounds 200m issue launched in February. The bonds were priced to yield 37 basis points over the five-year gilt yield, a pick up over the current spread of 32 basis points for the outstanding paper. In the French franc market, Alcatel added a further FF1bn to its FF2bn five-year deal launched earlier this month via Societe Generale. Firm demand was encouraged by expectations of further cuts in French interest rates. In the Canadian dollar market, Toyota Credit Canada and the City of Winnipeg both tapped the market, with deals aimed at continental retail investors. The City of Winnipeg launched a CDollars 125m 10-year issue of 8 1/2 per cent bonds via Wood Gundy. The deal was priced to yield 93 basis points over the comparable Canadian government bond. Toyota's CDollars 150m issue of five-year bonds, via Hambros Bank, was priced to yield 48 basis points over the curve.</p>

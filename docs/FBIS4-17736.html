			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Trade Unions" rubric: </F> "FITUR Ready To Sign Memorandum on Accord, But Demands Some  Additions to it"]    [Text] Stanislav Kramarenko, adviser to the chairman of  the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR],  told your SEGODNYA correspondent yesterday about the Federation  leaders' intention to sign the memorandum on accord. According  to Stanislav Kramarenko, FITUR political leaders find themselves  "in a difficult situation" because they are getting numerous  cables and letters from primary trade union organizations in  which the signing of the memorandum "is hedged" with the most  varied demands. In a number of trade union organizations, the  adviser thinks, the "civic accord" notion is interpreted as  "accord in the area of a single approach to economic reforms,"  although it implies a treaty of principles between public and  political organizations on the existence together with power  structures without a rigid standoff and upheavals.    In this situation, according to the adviser, the FITUR  political leadership proceeds from the fact that trade unions  are supposed to state their readiness to conduct with the  current president, government, Federal Assembly, the State Duma,  as well as with the other participants in the agreement, a  constructive dialogue on a platform of civic accord. The FITUR  leadership also believes that "the most important interests of  working people can be protected only within the framework of a  powerful state," the adviser stated.    At the same time, Stanislav Kramarenko underscored that the  agreement "should not be signed at the expense of working  people's interests." For his part, FITUR Chairman Mikhail  Shmakov passed on the main remarks and proposals to Boris  Topornin, chairman of the public chamber under the president,  and, during a recent meeting with Boris Yeltsin confirmed, the  need for their inclusion in the text of the memorandum. Among  these proposals, perhaps the main ones are to ensure the  implementation of the principles of social partnership detailed  in the General Agreement between the trade unions, employers,  and the government; to follow an active social policy aimed at  "stabilization and subsequent raising of people's living  standards; adapting the able-bodied population to new economic  conditions..."    If these proposals go through, Stanislav Kramarenko thinks,  FITUR-member trade unions would fundamentally have no special  remarks to make about the other sections of the memorandum.  Besides, "in a bid to strike off many existing trade union  demands" the federation leaders insist on the inclusion in the  text of the agreement, in the item on pledges by trade unions  and their amalgamations, "not to hold and not to participate in  organizing strikes aimed at redistributing budget funds," an  amendment -- "after the budget has been approved." Virtually  all Federation trade unions now vigorously uphold this amendment  because in this case they reserve the right to collective  actions, including strikes, before the budget has been approved.    According to a FITUR information and analysis center report,  the Federation General Council's executive committee made a  decision late last night "to form a delegation for the signing  of the memorandum."</p>

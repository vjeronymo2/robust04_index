			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Shpetim Roqi from Bucharest] </F>   [Text] After visiting Hungary the Albanian delegation  headed by President Berisha arrived in Romania last night. The  official welcoming ceremony was held at Cotroceni Palace this  morning. Presidents Berisha and Iliescu then held a  tete-a-tete, and at 1000 both delegations held official talks.    Taking the floor, Romanian President Ion Iliescu thanked  President Berisha for the visit to Romania and considered it an  important step for the further development of political  relations and economic cooperation. He made explained the  economic situation in Romania and the reforms undertaken on the  road to a market economy. He pointed out that alongside the  historic ties that exist between our both countries it is high  time to strengthen the economic and political cooperation that  is mutually advantageous to countries that have just emerged  from fierce dictatorships.    President Berisha briefed President Iliescu on the course of  reforms in Albania. He stressed that despite the unfavorable  geopolitical situation, the results of reform are positive.    Regarding the situation in the Balkans, he stressed once  again that the main question in the Balkans is the Albanian  question. Albania does not support a change of borders through  violence, but demands democratic space for Albanians and  freedoms and rights pertaining to them from the Helsinki  Charter. As long as Albanians demand the implementation of CSCE  principles, the international community and the region should be  seriously engaged in solving their problems. The idea that  Kosova is Serbia's problem is a half-baked idea and seeks to  provoke conflict, President Berisha stressed.    All Balkan peoples have their own national problems, but no  one wants to resolve them through war, as Serbia does. If  Serbia does not give up the idea of Greater Serbia, Belgrade  will involve the whole region in a war. The division of Kosova  or Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] is equal to conflict. Milosevic's refusal to conduct a  dialogue with the legitimate representatives of 2 million Kosova  Albanians is absurd. We support dialogue in the presence of a  third party. It is within this framework that we assess the  efforts by British Minister Hogg during his last visit to  Belgrade and Kosova.    I am convinced, President Berisha continued, that an  acceptable solution can be found. However, since the situation  is equivalent to a time bomb, this runs the risk of turning into  a conflict that includes not only Albanians.    President Berisha then held a warm meeting with  representatives of the Cultural Union of Albanians in Romania at  the Albanian Embassy.    In a meeting with reporters, President Berisha stressed that  to continue the dialogue to resolve problems and improve  relations with Greece, we intend to propose another meeting of  the foreign ministers of both countries in Tirana. We see the  Zurich meeting as positive, because both ministers expressed  their clear willingness to improve the relations. We hope that  this willingness and predisposition will be further strengthened  and that they will yield fruit.</p>

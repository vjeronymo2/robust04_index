			<p>BFN     [Text] Hiroshima, June 18 KYODO -- The head of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a ruling coalition component,  said Saturday [18 June] that the coalition should be flexible in  its realignment talks with former partners.    DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa told a news conference that an  uncompromising stance by the coalition would lead to the  collapse of talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social  Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and Sakigake for their return  to the ruling camp.    "If we build up high hurdles at the outset, the talks would  lead only to breaking off," he said.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority coalition will open  talks with the second largest opposition SDP next week to lure  it back to the coalition and restore a stable government amid  threats of a no- confidence motion by the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The SDP in April walked out of the broad coalition that  supported the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa over a move by some coalition partners to create a new  Diet bloc without the socialists.    Yonezawa said the ruling coalition might make some  concessions on the thorny issue of a consumption tax hike.    "We have left the issue undecided for meeting halfway with  the SDP in the planned talks," he said.    The Hata administration wants to raise the consumption tax  from the current 3 percent to secure fiscal revenues to finance  continued tax cuts and also to reform the taxation structure in  the face of a rapidly aging society.    But the SDP, which opposed the introduction of the  value-added tax, is still dead set against any steep raise.    On the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  program,  Yonezawa said the easing of tension following former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang may be of great help.    "The fact that (the atmosphere) is becoming considerably  softer due to former President Carter's visit is a favorable  factor," he said.    The SDP, which has a long tradition of friendly ties with  Pyongyang, is averse to Japan taking a hard line against North  Korea over the issue.    Yonezawa also said the Hata cabinet should resign rather  than  dissolve the House of Representatives if a no-confidence vote  against him passes the diet.    "We would like to avoid elections under the current  multiseat  constituency system. We should seek a way toward a stable  government through the cabinet's resignation en masse," he said.    The current election system is to be replaced with a new  system of combined single-seat and proportional representation  after a government committee finishes redrawing an electoral map  in line with the political reform bills that passed the Diet in  January.    The LDP has vowed to submit a motion of no confidence once  the budget bills pass the diet, probably next week.    If the SDP supports the move, the no-confidence motion will  be certain to clear the lower house, leaving Hata with a stark  choice of either dissolving the lower house to call snap polls  or stepping down with his ministers.    Yonezawa said if the policy-making boards of the LDP and SDP  decide to proceed with a no-confidence vote, it will create a  great "reaction" within the two parties, referring to possible  defection moves.</p>

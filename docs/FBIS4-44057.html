			<p>BFN     [Text] A government reshuffle is expected sometime before 6  July. Government circles say the reshuffle will be selective.  Theodhoros Pangalos, alternate foreign minister on European  affairs, reportedly will remain in government but will move to  another ministry. Dhimitrios Tsovolas [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement member and former finance minister] will receive a  ministerial portfolio. Correspondent Kostis Dhimtsas has the  following report:    [Begin Dhimtsas recording] According to close associates of  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, the reshuffle will take place  within the first 10 days of July, probably on 6 July. The  reshuffle will be selective, not wide as has been reported in  the press. Karolos Papoulias will remain as foreign minister  and Yerasimos Arsenis as national defense minister. Theodhoros  Pangalos will leave the Foreign Ministry, but will remain in the  government and assume another ministry. Pangalos expressed a  desire to go to the Culture Ministry. As close associates of  Papandreou said, however, the prime minister has not decided  whether the ministers of culture and education will be replaced.  The basic structure of the Ministry of National Economy and the  Finance Ministry will not change, but secondary changes with the  appointment of Dhimitrios Tsovolas and possibly Vaso Papandreou  [former Greek commissioner at the EU] are not ruled out.  Finally, and again according to close associates of the prime  minister, there have been proposals to appoint deputy prime  ministers. It appears that Papandreou has not adopted these  proposals.

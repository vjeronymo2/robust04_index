			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Halifax house index climbs - At a glance HOUSE prices in September were 1 per cent higher than in September 1992, according to the Halifax building society. This is the first annual rise in the seasonally adjusted Halifax house price index since January 1991. The annual rise could reach 2 or 3 per cent by the end of this year, the society said, but warned that the housing market recovery was still fragile. In contrast, the Nationwide building society's index showed a year-on-year fall of 2.5 per cent in September. This was largely due to a drop of 1.8 per cent since August, the first fall in the Nationwide index for five months. However, the Nationwide also predicts a modest year-on-year gain by the end of 1993.</p>

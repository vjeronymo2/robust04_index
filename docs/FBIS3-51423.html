			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maricarmen Camacho from Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas] </F>   [Text] This afternoon [18 January], the 58th legislature of  the Chiapas Congress appointed Javier Lopez Moreno governor of  Chiapas after Provisional Governor Elmar Setzer resigned. After  being sworn in as governor, Lopez Moreno announced that the  state's three branches will be installed as soon as possible in  Ocosingo in an effort to deal with the institutional crisis in  the state. The new governor promised to be frank and to deal  directly with the Chiapas Indians and peasants, and he invited  the people to confront the crisis with unity, genius, and hard  work. He said he will hold the post of governor loyally and  patriotically.    [Begin Lopez Moreno recording] I will take office with the  state's legislative and judicial branches in Ocosingo as soon as  possible. The new government will begin working in the middle  of the conflict zone with all of the forces of Chiapas. [end  recording]    The appointment was made by a congressional majority. The  only vote against Lopez Moreno was cast by PRD [Party of the  Democratic Revolution] Deputy Demostenes Munoz who, attempting  to be funny and ironic, voted for Commander Marcos -- the leader  of the subversive actions in the jungle areas of Chiapas.    The new governor is of Indian heritage, and he was born in  Tenejapa on 19 November 1946. He holds a law degree from the  Mexican Autonomous University. He served as education and  culture secretary during the government of retired General  Absalon Castellanos Dominguez. For several years he was member  of the PRI's [Institutional Revolutionary Party] National  Executive Committee, where he held the posts of social action  secretary, delegate to the Federal Electoral Commission, and  head of the PRI's National Executive Committee advisers. In  addition, he served as federal deputy for Chiapas during the  54th legislature of the Chiapas Congress.</p>

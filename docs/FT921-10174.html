			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Reynolds picked to succeed Haughey THE IRISH former cabinet minister Mr Albert Reynolds yesterday easily won a leadership contest to replace Mr Charles Haughey as head of Ireland's governing Fianna Fail party, Reuter reports from Dublin. He will formally be elected as prime minister next week. Mr Reynolds, who is 59, won 61 votes to just 10 for Mr Michael Woods, agriculture minister, and six for Ms Mary O'Rourke, health minister, who was bidding to become Ireland's first woman prime minister. Speaking after his victory, Mr Reynolds referred to the upsurge of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. 'I wanted today to be a day of exhilaration and hope,' he said. 'Instead it is day when we are trying to come to terms yet again with death on this island, so many deaths.' 'I look forward to working with the British prime minister to try to end the cruelty of this continuing conflict. That cruelty comes from a dwarfed and twisted patriotism which sees inflicted deaths as instruments of change,' he said. Mr Reynolds was sacked by Mr Haughey last November for leading a failed party mutiny against his leader. Mr Haughey, who dominated Irish politics through a tumultuous decade of scandals and leadership challenges, was forced to step down after allegations he knew about the tapping of journalists' telephones back in 1982. Mr Reynolds comes to power at a time of deepening economic gloom in Ireland: unemployment has reached record levels with one in five jobless, and the safety valve of emigration to North America and Britain is closed by the international recession. Creating jobs was a top priority, he said. In mid-term, he also faces an uphill climb restoring morale in Fianna Fail. Their popularity has sunk to an all-time low in opinion polls because of the stagnant economy and a string of financial scandals in state firms. He promised 'a government of openness, not defensiveness, a government of consultation and consensus, not diktat'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in six installments by Tokyo University Professor </F> Yoshitsugu Kanamoto]    [Text] [20 Apr 94 p 27]  <H5>  Problems With the System </H5>   A huge public works scandal erupted with the arrest of LDP  [Liberal Democratic Party] vice president Shin Kanemaru on  suspicion of tax evasion early last year. Since that time,  several Diet members and heads of municipalities have been  arrested on charges of graft or influence peddling. After this  scandal broke, there has been an attempt to reform the bidding  process for public works projects. In December 1993 the "Special  Committee on Public Works" of the Central Construction Industry  Commission issued the following recommendations: 1) replace the  private-tender bidding system with a more competitive system; 2)  abolish the guarantor system for project completion; and 3)  create a bidding oversight council. These recommendations are  currently being put into effect. These efforts constitute the  most significant reforms since the competitive private-tender  bidding system was introduced in 1900.    During the open debate on public works in the mass media,  the collusion between general contractors and heads of  municipalities received the most attention. Since then, however,  several problems with the public works system have surfaced.    First, the number of politicians accepting illegal  contributions in exchange for public works contracts is not  limited to heads of municipalities. Several Diet members have  been arrested or implicated for overstepping their authority.    Second, many career civil servants have retired to take  positions with general contractors, inviting suspicion of  collusion between those placing orders for public works  contracts and those receiving the orders.    Third, dango [bid-rigging by collusion among  construction firms] has become widespread. Dango has rendered  competition ineffective, and this is the sole reason for the  high cost of public works projects in Japan.    Fourth, the number of public works contracts has increased  despite staff reductions at public agencies and a relative  decline in their technical capabilities. General contractors  have had to cooperate with public agencies during the planning,  design, and accounting phases without receiving compensation. If  they do not receive the contract, companies cannot recover these  costs. This is one reason why general contractors have used  dango to coordinate their bids.    The declining ability of government agencies and municipal  agencies to plan and design projects has also created several  problems. For example, an exceptionally large number of public  works projects have had to be redesigned during the construction  phase because the original designs were inadequately prepared.  In Western Europe and North America, large public works projects  are evaluated during the planning stage and the results are made  available to the public. In Japan these projects are seldom  evaluated and the results are almost never disclosed. This is  the single greatest cause of inefficient projects whose costs  far exceed benefits.    Fifth, in Japan the government or municipal agency sets  acceptible price ranges for bids on public works projects. These  are supposed to remain confidential, but are often leaked to  general contractors.    We will have to address these problems if we are to reform  the bidding system for public works projects. It is often argued  that switching to a bidding system based on open competition  will solve all of these problems, but that is not necessarily  true. In subsequent articles in this series, I will point out  the critical issues that have to be considered in any redesign  of the bidding system for public works projects.  <H5>  [21 Apr 94 p 31] </H5>   [Text] The Great Dilemma    Public works projects are carried out using tax money to  benefit the public. Accordingly, those public agencies that  place orders for public works have a responsibility to ensure  that the public receives the highest quality for the lowest  cost. In other words, the focus of the public works bidding  system should be on "cost" and "quality."    It is difficult to eliminate poor quality and ensure high  quality work in a construction contract. In order to ensure  quality work, one must choose an honest and competent contractor  who is motivated to insist on quality in whatever form it takes.    If we were able to make "quality" objective, it could be  built into contracts. In reality, however, it is often difficult  and even impossible to quantify something like "quality,"  especially when technologies and circumstances change. For this  reason, contracting agencies have broad discretionary powers  when it comes to ensuring quality.    Private companies need only concern themselves with issues  of cost and quality, but in the case of public works attention  must also be given to "fairness" and "corruption prevention."  Private companies use their own money and thus can be  self-serving, but since public works use taxpayer funds they  cannot be used to benefit only certain people. Moreover,  impropriety by the contracting party is essentially an internal  matter for private companies, but a public issue for government  agencies.    The difficulty in designing a new public works bidding  system  is in the trade-off between "cost," "quality," and "corruption  prevention." It is nearly impossible to achieve all three of  these goals perfectly in a single public works project.    For example, if cost minimization and corruption prevention  were the only two goals and a perfectly open competitive bidding  system were established, it would eliminate dango. If under the  open bidding system the lowest bid automatically won the  contract, it would eliminate corruption because the contracting  agency would not have any discretionary powers at all. If the  contracting agency were unable to tamper with the process in  response to bribes, influence peddling would disappear.    However if price were the only factor in the open bidding  system, this would cause quality problems. If lower costs were  the primary objective, contractors would cut corners and shoddy  workmanship would result.    Moreover, if cost minimization and quality assurance were  the  only two goals, the contracting agency would need discretionary  powers to appraise quality in order to balance these two  objectives. However if the contracting agency is given  discretionary powers, the possibility of corruption occurs. It  is often argued that regular rotation of officials and strict  penalties would severely limit corruption in the professional  civil service ranks, but the structural collusion resulting from  the illegal influence of politicians as well as former civil  servants taking positions with general contractors would remain.    It is therefore impossible to create a public procurement  system that can meet these three objectives perfectly. Under the  current system, a delicate balance is maintained between these  three objectives. Whatever system is adopted, there is an  inherent incompatibility between technological, political, and  social factors.  <H5>  [23 Apr 94 p 31] </H5>   [Text] Corruption Prevention and Quality Assessment    In order to prevent corruption in public works, the  discretionary powers of contracting agencies must be reduced.  This is the reason why most countries have gone to an open  bidding system for public works contracts.    Under a competitive bidding system based on price alone, it  is impossible to promise that public works contracts will go to  specific companies. For this reason, it is possible to eliminate  unfair practices such as contracting agencies receiving bribes  from contractors. Since politicians also attempt to meddle with  the process, a competitive bidding system based on price would  also make it impossible for politicians to conspire to award  contracts to a particular company.    Another advantage of a competitive bidding system is that it  would end the problem public agencies have with cost  consciousness. If the lowest cost bidder automatically won the  contract, it would reduce costs even if the contracting agency  had no incentive to do so.    A competitive bidding process would seem to be the ideal  public procurement system, but it has one fatal flaw. It does  not ensure quality. If the lowest cost bidder won every contract  and there was a rise in instances of shoddy workmanship due to  cost-cutting measures, the ultimate cost to the public could  actually increase.    In order to ensure quality in a competitive bidding system  based on price, detailed quality specifications would have to be  laid out before bidding took place. Rigorous inspections would  have to be conducted after the construction was completed to  ensure compliance. This may be difficult to verify. Some of my  readers may have had the experience of laying down clear  guidelines for the construction of a new home. After the house  is built, some of you may have discovered how difficult it is to  determine whether the contractor used the specified materials  behind the walls. Even in the relatively simple case of a  private residence, innumerable inspections are required. When a  contractor places an extremely low cost bid, the chance of  shoddy workmanship rises.    Some form of oversight will be needed in the public works  bidding system to ensure quality work and to eliminate defective  workmanship. Every country has some kind of inspection process,  and there is no such thing as a purely competitive system  without quality considerations.    In the United States the federal government has a  competitive  bidding system, but bidders must be underwritten by bond  companies or insurance companies. These companies conduct  studies prior to the placement of the bid.    These companies conduct inspections after a contract has  been  awarded as well. In order to ensure that construction is  completed as specified, both the contracting agency and the  insurance company conduct inspections. The contracting agency  usually focuses its attention on the more technical aspects. The  inspection process is extremely severe on companies that do not  obtain the desired results. The detailed inspections include  interviews with engineers and technicians.    Every country conducts investigations, but the timing and  methods vary. The openness and transparency of these inspections  also vary. The Japanese private-tender bidding system is unique  in concentrating its investigations at the time of bidding. The  contracting agency has broad discretionary powers to conduct  inspections, and the results are not made public.  <H5>  [24 Apr 94 p 22] </H5>   [Text] Two Sides of Discretionary Power    Despite the fact that inspections are inadequate when it  comes to ensuring product quality, they form the heart of all  public works bidding systems.    If inspectors are made responsible only for objective  criteria and their discretionary powers are eliminated, then the  opportunities for corruption will be greatly reduced. Although  all elements that are objectifiable should be made objective,  problems remain.    Professor Kelman at Harvard University conducted a case  study  on public procurement of computer systems in the United States  and published the results in Procurement and Public  Management (1990). According to his study, excessive  objectification of demands produces great inefficiencies. Under  the U.S. procurement system, a party which is not the lowest  cost bidder can win a contract, but claims of superior quality  must be objectively demonstrated. However, past experience is  not considered significant.    For example, in one case when a government computer system  would go down, the contractor often did not send the appropriate  specialist. Instead it would send a less qualified technician.  Despite this track record, the competent authorities considered  this subjective information and would disregard it during  procurement bidding for new government contracts. In order to  build the case that the contractor's support services were  substandard, the contracting agency would have to limit its  inquiry to statistical data from studies conducted by other  government agencies and private firms. Under such an  arrangement, support services continue to deteriorate because  the extra effort and cost associated with improving support  services have no bearing at all on whether the company will  receive any new government contracts.    Therefore, excessively objective demands in the review  process harm quality assurance. But if these objective standards  are relaxed and discretionary powers increased, there is no  assurance this discretionary power will only be used to improve  quality. The old Japanese National Railways (JNR) established  more flexible standards in order to improve quality, but the  public corporation began to use extremely expensive special  parts. It is said this occurred primarily to ensure lucrative  positions in these special parts companies for retired JNR  officials.    While discretionary powers must be given to contracting  agencies in order to ensure quality work, organizational  measures are also needed to make sure that these discretionary  powers are exercised properly.    First, efforts to expose and punish wrongdoing should be  strengthened in order to prevent the abuse of this discretionary  power in the form of bribe-taking. Politicians have also been  implicated in public procurement corruption scandals, because it  is difficult to penalize them for overstepping their authority.  If something is not done to strengthen jurisdictional barriers,  political-influence scandals will only intensify.    Second, public disclosure and an effective system of formal  complaints would help eliminate criminal abuse and arbitrary use  of discretionary powers. In western Europe and North America,  all uses of discretionary power by whomever for whatever purpose  is made public. This does not happen in Japan. The public must  have confidence that such discretionary powers are being used  properly.  <H5>  [25 Apr 94 p 19] </H5>   [Text] Dango Prevention and Dumping    Competition is the most effective way to lower construction  costs. Japanese construction costs are relatively high compared  to western Europe and North America, and much of this can be  attributed to the lack of competition resulting from the spread  of dango. Since last year bidding prices have been dropping with  the breakup of some dango, but the elimination of dango is still  a long way off.    Economists have recently begun to study competitive bidding.  According to Tatsuyoshi Saijo, an assistant professor of  economics at Tsukuba University, dango somehow quickly forms if  bidders are allowed to confer with each other. Consequently, one  could say that it would be extremely difficult to prevent dango  if an environment is created in which bidders are able to confer.    In order to prevent dango, we must rigorously enforce a  prohibition on contact between bidders as they do in the United  States, or actively support outsiders who have not participated  in meetings with other bidders in the past. Under a restricted  competitive bidding system, there are geographical limitations  on qualified bidders. This only encourages the tacit formation  of dango. The recent reforms have also abolished the guarantor  system for project completion and have placed limits on joint  ventures. This has made conferences between bidders all but  inevitable, and has created a hotbed for dango.    Recently, Chairman Maeda of the Japan Federation of  Construction Industry Organization called for self-restraint  concerning contract "dumping." His comments have evoked much  criticism. If there were no dango, low priced bids would begin  to emerge.    Naturally, there is a possibility of shoddy workmanship with  low priced bids, but stronger industry oversight and penalties  for negligence are the proper response.    With price competition, many new companies have emerged in  regions outside the major metropolitan areas. Companies that  could not compete under the private tender system have also been  revived by open competition. However, few of these companies  have resorted to intentionally negligent work in order to build  a track record and increase market share. In such circumstances,  the elimination of price competition by establishing price  floors would do even more harm.    Loss-generating contracts due to intensive price competition  have increased the overcapacity problems of an industry already  in recession. For example, many companies have too many  engineers and not enough work. Even though some have idled their  engineers, they must still pay their salaries. By placing bids  under cost, they create work for their idle engineers and reduce  the expense of keeping them on the payroll. However, once  prosperity returns and demand outstrips supply, these companies  turn a profit.    Regulating low cost bids in order to prevent loss-generating  contracts will only create a situation in which there is  constant overcapacity and lead to even more excessive  competition. Price floors intended to support the industry in  times of recession will only encourage overcapacity by  encouraging new companies to enter the fray. It will also help  inefficient companies to survive.  <H5>  [26 Apr 94 p 25] </H5>   [Text] Peculiar Price Estimate System    Japan's price estimate system, by which bidders calculate  their costs, does not allow contracts to be awarded above a  certain price. This strict price estimate system is peculiar to  Japan. In western Europe and North America proposals are usually  allowed to fall within a certain range. Where price estimates  are set, differences in price estimates can vary by as much as  10 percent (for example) within a fixed range. More contract  awards are thus determined by price estimates.    Because bidders take part in dango, there would be no upper  limit on cost increases if not for price estimates. With the  spread of dango, price estimates are the only means of  restraining the skyrocketing price of successful bids. However,  if recent reforms are successful at preventing the dango, then  the need for price estimates will decrease.    According to "accounting laws governing estimates and  account  statements," price estimates must be kept confidential until the  bidding actually occurs. There is no rule stating that price  estimates cannot be made public after the bidding process is  over, but it is rarely done.    Stories of leaked price estimates have appeared in the  press,  and the most recent bidding system reforms have centered on the  question of whether or not confidential price estimates have any  purpose.    According to economic studies of the competitive bidding  process, price ceilings can sometimes serve to reduce the price  of the successful bid. However, it works best if these price  ceilings are known to bidders prior to the bidding process.  Confidentiality, as in the Japanese case, makes little sense.  Confidential price estimates only increase the insecurity of the  bidders in the process.    Services such as auction houses set the lowest acceptable  price at the start of bidding. The starting price, or lowest  acceptable price, is usually made public prior to the auction.  Because the price limits are determined by an expert appraisal  specialist, disclosing price limits has the same effect as  disclosing appraisal information. Making appraisals public is  believed to narrow price differentials among bidders and  intensify the competition.    Prior disclosures of price estimates are prohibited in  Japan,  but ex post facto disclosures are not. Because of the  proliferation of dango in Japanese public works bidding, winning  contracts are often said to be nearly identical to the price  estimate. If the price estimate were publicly disclosed after  the bidding, the situation would become more clear. It would  serve to curtail the activities of dango. The winning bid would  come in lower than the price estimate in order to conceal the  existence of dango. At the very least, it would hold down costs.  Because there does not appear to be any harm in ex post facto  disclosures, there is no reason why price estimates should not  be made public after bidding has closed.    In addition to the problems addressed in this series of  articles, there are other issues that have to be considered when  reforming the bidding system, such as introducing a construction  management (CM) system and improving quality in the planning and  design stages. I hope to have another opportunity to examine  these problems at a later date.</p>

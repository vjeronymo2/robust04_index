			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> D.A. WILL USE OUTSIDE LABS TO CHECK ON LAPD  </P> <P> The district attorney's office announced Friday that it will begin hiring  independent firearms experts to selectively "verify or further scrutinize"  results of firearms analysis performed by the Los Angeles Police Department.  </P> <P> In some cases, prosecutors might even bypass the LAPD crime lab altogether,  although "that has not been entirely worked out," said Sterling E. Norris, the  deputy district attorney in charge of special trials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discredited Tests  </P> <P> The emerging policy was announced by Norris after he and another senior  prosecutor, Peter Bozanich, met Friday with Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates. Norris also said independent firearms experts are to be selected next  week to conduct a full evaluation of the equipment and procedures used at the  LAPD lab. In addition, Gates will authorize the purchase of better and  additional photographic equipment for the firearms investigative unit, Norris  said.  </P> <P> The review of the firearms unit and the district attorney's new policy come in  the wake of LAPD firearms tests that had erroneously linked a gun found in the  possession of former Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross to the murders of three  South-Central Los Angeles prostitutes.  </P> <P> It was those LAPD results that led county prosecutors to file first-degree  murder charges against Ross. But the charges were dropped on Monday after  independent tests cleared the gun.  </P> <P> Norris said the police chief "feels very bad about the entire situation" and is  offering "complete cooperation" in the proposed remedial measures. "He said he  will do anything necessary" to prevent future errors by the LAPD's firearms  experts, Norris told a press conference.  </P> <P> Gates did not return telephone calls to his office Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Find Whatever Is Broke'  </P> <P> But a department spokesman quoted the chief as saying: "Our goal is to find  whatever is broke and fix it." He said the district attorney's office  "certainly will have our full support and cooperation." Officials would not  comment further.  </P> <P> Norris said on Friday that further firearms tests are to be performed on the  three slugs and a shell casing found at the murder scenes and that "there is  still that possibility" that Ross' gun may yet be tied to the murders. Those  results, he added, may not become available until after June 1.  </P> <P> Ross, 40, an 18-year veteran of the department, has proclaimed his innocence  from the time he was arrested in Los Angeles early Feb. 23 after what was  described as a routine traffic check.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pistol Found  </P> <P> Ross was seated next to a prostitute and he drove erratically away from the  curb as officers approached the car, police said then. Officers found Ross'  nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in the trunk of his county-owned  undercover car.  </P> <P> Two LAPD firearms experts conclusively linked that gun to the three slugs and a  shell casing found at the murder sites of Judith Simpson, 27; Cynthia Walker,  35, and Latanya Johnson, 24. But a subsequent test, conducted by defense expert  Charles Morton, a highly regarded Oakland specialist, contradicted the LAPD  finding.  </P> <P> After that, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman agreed to a third test,  conducted by Al Biasotti of the California Department of Justice and John  Murdock of the Contra Costa Sheriff's Department. Their tests supported  Morton's conclusion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Further Tests Suggested  </P> <P> All the tests were performed at the LAPD lab, using the same equipment, Norris  said. It was Biasotti who then suggested that the slugs and shell casing in the  Ross case be further tested, at the state Department of Justice lab in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Norris and Bozanich noted that there is a difference of opinion among firearms  experts as to the efficacy and reliability of photography in the testing of  firearms evidence. Firearms experts also agree that such forensics testing is  more an art form than a science, one in which experts may disagree in their  interpretations of results.  </P> <P> Morton earlier and Norris on Friday also raised the issue of the adequacy of  training of the LAPD's firearms experts in general. "There is no quick school,"  Norris said. "It takes years of on-the-job-training" to become an expert in the  field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Produce Good Science'  </P> <P> Civilian scientists may be more qualified than trained police investigators to  conduct such tests, Morton said. "If you have someone at the top (of a lab) who  is a good scientist, their job is to produce good science, not just support for  a case," he said.  </P> <P> Indeed, even before the Ross controversy, the LAPD's scientific investigations  division has begun moving toward "civilianizing" the firearms investigative  unit that it oversees, according to Joe De Laudurantey, who recently left as  the division's head to become Harbor Division captain.  </P> <P> Until about 3 1/2 years ago, he said, training in the firearms unit had been  very limited, although that has improved recently.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K, already authorizes dry cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage and approves dry casks for use by utilities to store spent fuel at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor sites. See 10 CFR 72.214 for a listing of information on Cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate Nos. 1000 through 1003, 1005, and 1007. The purpose of this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is to add one more cask to the list of casks already approved by NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cask added to the list in &sect;72.214 by this final rule complies with all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable NRC safety requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, this final rulemaking applies to the use of this cask by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power reactor within the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the January 30, 1994, reply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from NRC's Robert Bernero to Mr. Adamkus, EPA, is completely inadequate, as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the March 1994 ``Draft Environment Assessment and Finding of No Significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact'' because no consideration is given to the site's unsuitability even for LLRW per NRC's own admission, and ``new information which could alter the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original site evaluation findings'' is ignored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not provide any site-specific NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval or address site-specific parameters that are peculiar to a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor site. The rule only adds one cask design, the Standardized NUHOMS, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the list of approved casks available for use by a power plant licensee in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the conditions of the general license in Part 72. Pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those conditions, each licensee must determine whether or not the reactor site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters (including earthquake intensity and tornado missiles) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompassed by the cask design bases considered in the cask SAR and SER. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EA and FONSI for this rule are limited in scope to the Standardized NUHOMS in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a generic setting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike interim storage prescribed in 10 CFR Part 72, the in-ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal of radioactive material, whether high-level or low-level waste (HLW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or LLW), must take into account the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of the site or region to isolate the radioactive waste from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accessible environment. Site criteria for in-ground disposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactive wastes enable an applicant to choose an appropriate site, one with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a combination of favorable conditions that will be a natural barrier to retard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or attenuate the migration of any leaked radioactive material over a long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period to control releases within acceptable limits. The disposal period for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LLW is on the order of 500 years, and for HLW it is greater than 10,000 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, site characteristics are investigated and assessed for interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel storage under Part 72, not to determine their suitability as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrier to release of radioactive material, but rather to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency and the severity of external natural and artificial events that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could affect the safety of an ISFSI. Unlikely, but credible, severe events  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are considered to determine the safety of the storage cask design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the NRC has not approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies for the use of spent fuel at the sites of *&blank;*&blank;* without the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional site reviews. If that were so, no additional site review would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been necessary at Palisades, nor would an SAR revision or a Certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Compliance amendment be called for right after the VSC&hyph;24 was certified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The approval and use of dry storage technologies under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions of the general license are relatively new. Questions were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by members of the public about the possible effects of earthquakes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erosion at the Palisades site on the safe storage of spent fuel in the VSC&hyph;24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dry casks. As the agency which is responsible for questions about compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regulatory requirements, which oversees such matters as the ``cop on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beat,'' the NRC began an independent assessment to more closely examine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavior of the pad at Palisades under normal conditions, under the long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of erosion, and under conditions of a postulated earthquake that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause the sand below or around the pad to move. The results of NRC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment were documented in the NRC Final Safety Assessment of Independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Support Pad (TAC No. M88875). As is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case at all sites, NRC requires the cask user to determine if the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for the storage technology being considered encompasses the site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters at the location where the fuel is to be stored. The review at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Palisades confirmed this to be the case. As experience with use of this new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design is gained, modifications to the design described in the SAR are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected and allowed under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted the environmental impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives, such as: renewable energy sources, conservation of energy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shutting down the nuclear power plants, and wind and solar power evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Energy production is not the subject of this rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and alternative sources of energy are, therefore, not reasonable alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring evaluation. This rulemaking is limited to the addition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS to the list of approved casks in 10 CFR 72.214.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the NRC is ignoring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirements of a site-specific license as to the feasibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the cask or of modifying its design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

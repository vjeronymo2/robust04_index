			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / 15 schools to become technology colleges ABOUT 15 schools could become city technology colleges next year under plans being developed by the City Technology Colleges Trust. The trust hopes to use a change to the law, introduced in the Education Bill now before parliament, which will allow established schools to take technology college status if they have opted out of local education authority control. The colleges, introduced in the Education Reform Act of 1988, were at first intended to be purpose-built new schools funded only by business sponsorship. Under the trust's plans commercial sponsors would provide a minimum of Pounds 50,000 a school, while the government would provide at least Pounds 200,000. This new route to technology college status is thought to offer similar standards for a lower cost than that of a purpose-built college, which requires backing of about Pounds 8m from companies. The Department for Education said yesterday that the criteria used to vet each application had not yet been decided by ministers.</p>

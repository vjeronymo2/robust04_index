			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoichi Funahashi, chief of ASAHI SHIMBUN's U.S. General </F> Bureau]    [Text] Japanese diplomacy has been described as a  diplomacy of "gifts" and "apology." Maybe "private settlement"  should be added to this. Such a description indicates the  extent to which Japan has gone in being passive, waiting for  outside pressure, being engrossed with pleasing its partners,  and indulging in behind-the-scenes deals. The Japan-U.S.  semiconductor agreement may be a classic example to illustrate  this point.    However, things have changed drastically with the latest  Japan-U.S. summit meeting. This time, Japan offered neither  "gifts," "apologies," nor "private settlements." The two  nations failed to reach agreement on the framework trade talks  due to a dispute over the issue of designating "objective  criteria" to measure progress in the opening of Japan's markets.  Both nations were given verdicts that "it is a time for mature  deliberation" (as stated by U.S. President Bill Clinton) and  that "it is a time for us to cool our heads" (as stated by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa).    The Japanese negotiating team feels refreshed. Apparently  they feel a sense of satisfaction and relief as they were able  to resist "being pressured with managed trade in the form of  numerical targets." Even U.S. negotiators seem to have "felt  cathartical" (as stated by a high-ranking White House official).    The same official has added: "Nothing can move as long as we  have to deal with Japanese bureaucrats. Sensing it would be  useless to go on like this, we were extremely frustrated."    Both the Japanese and U.S. Governments tried to give the  impression that their relationship was undergoing a "maturing  process" (as stated by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher) so this relationship, as a whole, would not be  shaken despite the breakdown in top-level trade negotiations. A  high-ranking U.S. Government official has explained: "Although  the United States has at times imposed sanctions against  European nations and Canada because of trade disputes, it has  been able to maintain basic relations with these countries. Our  relationship with Japan has reached this stage." In other  words, this relationship is probably one based on "gamesmanship."    This cannot necessarily be denied. In the United States, a  younger generation of politicians who are intolerant of Japan's  attitude of taking advantage of U.S. tolerance has taken control  of politics and diplomacy. In Japan, the idea that Japan should  say what it has to say to the United States and maintain a firm  attitude so as to come up to the expectations of other Asian  countries is spreading among its leaders. Both nations have  begun to think about whether they can somehow have more  business-like relations with each other. It certainly is  necessary for the two nations to broaden the scope and context  of their relationship by outgrowing their excessive bilateralism  under which they look at each other from the opposite ends of a  telescope.    Nevertheless, the latest "cathartical diplomacy" between  Japan and the United States lays bare the uncertainty of  post-Cold War relations between the two nations.    There was almost no coordination of macroeconomic measures  to  maintain economic growth, while microeconomic measures to deal  with sectoral trade issues stood out. The idea of "Japan-U.S.  cooperation on a global scale" regresses as the United States  sticks firmly to its inward-looking stance. While Japan and the  United States call for a promotion of an open regionalism for  the Asia-Pacific region, both of the all-important nations  continue to engage in their chronic trade conflicts.    The Clinton administration has its own "internal problems"  to  worry about. Since it pushed through the enactment of the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) against opposition by big  labor unions, it has had to secure concessions from Japan at  bilateral trade negotiations that would keep the labor unions  happy. It would not be a bad idea to take a hard-line stance  toward Japan to wipe away the administration's image of  "diplomatic weakness" built up by its faulty handling of the  Bosnian conflict and other issues.    At the latest framework trade talks, the U.S. Government  decided that "everyone would sing the same song" (as stated by  U.S. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV). During the Cold War era,  such U.S. Government agencies as the White House's National  Security Council (NSC) and the State Department played the role  of trying to keep trade conflicts from intensifying. This time,  however, they closed ranks with the Government's economic and  trade departments and agencies to avoid causing utter confusion.  It seems as if the United States considers Japan in the same  way it previously considered the former Soviet Union.    Above all, what is significant is ideological fluctuation.  One high-ranking White House official has said: "One of the  reasons the trade negotiations broke down is that Japan made a  caricature" of the framework trade talks as if it were a  confrontation between the United States, which advocates managed  trade, and Japan, which champions free trade.    Meanwhile, Japan has a mass of "internal problems" to  deal with. But, in the series of trade talks with the United  States, Japanese bureaucrats particularly came under fire.    On the eve of the summit talks, President Clinton read such  books by Prime Minister Hosokawa as There Will Be No  Tomorrow [Ashita-wa Gozanaku-soro] and a compilation of  Hosokawa's past comments translated into English, entitled "The  Time To Act Is Now." Clinton reportedly showed great interest  in Hosokawa's call for reforming the Japanese bureaucratic  system, and revealed to his close aides his intention to support  the prime minister in his struggle against bureaucrats.    The "breakdown" in the trade negotiations may have resulted  from Japanese bureaucrats' reaction to such a Japan-U.S.  partnership toward reforming the bureaucratic system. In this  connection, it is suspected that bureaucrats may have skillfully  manipulated nationalistic feelings.    Japan-U.S. relations can probably mature only after the two  nations carry out their respective reform programs broadly,  deeply, and swiftly. It is too early to speak of maturity at  this stage.</p>

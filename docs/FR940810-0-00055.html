			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Formerly, the general industry standard had been considered the generic asbestos standard. However, because of dramatic changes in the market for asbestos containing products, the standard now covers only four industry segments, three of which are distinct from each other, and all are diminishing in volume and employee population. Brake and clutch repair is the activity engaged in by the largest group of asbestos exposed workers, although most of them are exposed sporadically and at low levels. Next largest is custodial workers who do not perform their duties as part of construction activities, but clean surfaces, sweep, buff and vacuum floors and wash walls and windows in manufacturing plants and a wide variety of public and commercial buildings. Although in the preamble to the proposal and throughout this proceeding OSHA and most commenters had treated these workers as part of the construction work force, OSHA concludes that pure custodial work is not a construction activity, and should be regulated under the general industry standard. However, to avoid misinterpretation or for purposes of clarity of duties to affected parties, OSHA also is including provisions protecting custodial workers who may unknowingly contact asbestos-containing material in the construction and shipyard employment standards. In this way, there will be no advantage to interpreting coverage under any one of the asbestos standards, rather than another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary and secondary manufacture of asbestos containing products, completes the roster of identifiable general industry sectors. Once, along with installers of asbestos-containing products, the core of the asbestos-exposed work force, asbestos-containing product manufacturing employees are rapidly dwindling in number. OSHA expands on this theme its on economic analysis later in this document. At the time of the proposal, EPA had prohibited, at three stated intervals from August 1990 to August 1996, the future manufacture, importation, processing and distribution in commerce of asbestos in almost all products (54 FR at 29460, July 12, 1989). Subsequently the ban was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. EPA has interpreted the decision as invalidating only those portions of the ban for products that were manufactured or imported at the time of the decision. Despite the remaining legitimacy of manufacture and use of asbestos-containing products, the industries which make and maintain them and the employees who are employed in those industries are declining rapidly and dramatically. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) Construction Standard. 29 CFR 1926.1101. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The construction standard covers (but is not limited to) the following activities involving asbestos: demolition, removal, alteration, repair, maintenance, installation, clean-up, transportation, disposal, and storage. It has been redesignated 29 CFR 1926.1101 to reflect the reorganization of health standards covering construction made June 30, 1993 (58 FR 35076). The scope and application remain generally unchanged from the proposal and earlier standard. However, 3 issues arose. First, new language, proposed in 1990 is retained in the final. ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;coverage under this standard shall be based on the nature of the work operation involving asbestos exposure, not on the primary activity of the employer.'' This point was made clearly in the preamble to the 1986 standards; however, it was not specifically stated in the regulatory text and subsequently some confusion arose among the regulated community. Therefore, it is included as a clarification of the intended application of the standards. Asbestos work which involves removal, repair, maintenance or demolition is therefore explicitly regulated by the construction standard even if such work is performed within a facility otherwise regulated under the general industry standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain commenters stated that maintenance and custodial work should not be regulated by the construction standard, because they are not construction operations. OSHA notes that it has made a distinction between maintenance and custodial work, that maintenance work is covered in the construction and shipyard employment standards, and that custodial work is covered in all three standards, when it is incidental to work otherwise covered by a standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Naturally Occurring Asbestos in Soil: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prior to the publication of the 1990 asbestos proposal, OSHA received submissions describing asbestos deposits which occur as natural formations in the U.S. and that when disturbed, for example during earthmoving projects or during mining operations, drilling, blasting or sawing operations, the asbestos in the deposit can become airborne and expose workers to significant levels of asbestos fibers (Ex. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;11). The Agency proposed to clarify that such activities were covered under its asbestos construction standard and that methods of control were to be employed to avoid worker exposure during disturbances of naturally occurring asbestos deposits. OSHA sought additional information regarding any additional provisions it would adopt to protect workers engaged in these activities. In the proposal, the Agency also requested any information on appropriate methods to use to determine the presence of asbestos in soils, the effectiveness of wet and/or other methods to control worker exposures and information on effective decontamination methods for exposed workers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Poor conditions check issue flow Adverse market conditions have checked the flow of international and foreign bond new issues this year and reduced the average maturity of bonds launched, according to the latest Financial Market Trends survey by the OECD. Also, the proportion of fixed-rate bonds has shrunk in relation to floating-rate notes, particularly since interest rates began to rise in February, New issues totalled Dollars 180bn in the first five months of the year, which implies a year-on-year decline of some Dollars 29bn, according to the report. However, a large proportion of this activity was concentrated in the first two months, when new issue volume totalled almost Dollars 100bn, with an unprecedented Dollars 62bn raised in January alone. While long-dated bonds were easily placed even at the turn of the year, when several borrowers issued 20-year and 30-year paper, the maturities of new issues have since declined due to the change in market conditions, the report notes. Straight bond issues totalled Dollars 111bn in the first five months, a contraction of almost 34 per cent, while total offerings of floating-rate notes reached Dollars 44.6bn. Straight bonds accounted for only 62 per cent of the market. The market share of straight bonds has traditionally been around 80 per cent. For currencies perceived by the market to be near the bottom of the interest rate cycle there was a marked shift in the first two months from issuance of straight bonds to offerings of floating rates, the report said, citing the dollar, yen and sterling sectors. Overall, the dollar sector of the international bond market remained the most important, with a 34 per cent market share, but the D-Mark sector fell back sharply from 14.3 per cent to 6.8 per cent. The OECD says secondary market turnover of bonds and floating-rate notes totalled Dollars 1,800bn in the first quarter, citing industry sources. The report estimates scheduled redemptions and early repayments at some Dollars 115bn in the first five months, implying net issuance of some Dollars 65bn, which represents a decline of around 20 per cent.</p>

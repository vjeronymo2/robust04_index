			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Hongkong starts Midland shake-up HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) yesterday disclosed the first stage in its reorganisation of Midland Bank, following last month's Pounds 3.7bn takeover of the UK bank, with the appointment of a new deputy chief executive at Midland to work with Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive. At the same time, it confirmed that two top executives at Midland are stepping down from the Midland board prior to leaving the group. Mr Keith Whitson, 49, a general manager of HSBC has been made Midland deputy chief executive . Until last month, Mr Whitson had been executive director of HSBC's US subsidiary, Marine Midland. At Marine Midland, he helped push through tough cost-cutting and restructuring measures. Next Monday, Marine Midland will publish half-year figures which are expected to show that it has returned to profit compared with a loss of Dollars 109.3m (Pounds 56.8m) at the same point last year. Mr Whitson became known at Marine Midland as an energetic hands-on manager who was not afraid to take sharp remedial action. Mr Whitson previously served as HSBC chief executive in the UK from late 1987 after it purchased its 14.9 per cent stake in Midland. He will succeed Mr Brian Goldthorpe, who takes up responsibility for group risk at HSBC from January 1. Midland also confirmed that Mr Gene Lockhart, chief executive of UK Banking, and Mr George Loudon, chief executive of Midland Montagu, are to leave the Midland board. They will resign from Midland when the terms of their departure have been negotiated. Mr Lockhart has run the UK banking arm of Midland for two years. HSBC's decision that he should go came as a shock to Midland executives. Mr Loudon's departure reflects HSBC's plan to forge closer links between each bank's commercial and investment banking arms. Mr Bernard Asher, an HSBC director, is expected to become head of a combined merchant banking and international division. Observer, Page 19</p>

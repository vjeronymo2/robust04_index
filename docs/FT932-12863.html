			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Nigeria cracks down on petrol smuggling NIGERIA yesterday banned all cross-border movements of petrol in an effort to halt domestic fuel shortages and stop smuggling, Our Foreign Staff writes. The official petrol price in Nigeria is 0.7 naira a litre (about 1 1/2 pence), compared with N9.72 in Benin, N10.93 in Cameroon, N14.61 in Niger and N16.11 in Chad. Massive smuggling of petrol to these neighbouring states has left some parts of Nigeria short of fuel. It also represents a substantial loss of revenue for the government and the state-owned Nigerian National Petrolum Corporation (NNPC). The government has said it plans to raise petrol prices but has deferred implementing the decision, bitterly opposed by most Nigerians, until after mid-June presidential elections.</p>

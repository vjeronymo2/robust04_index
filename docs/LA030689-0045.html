			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING A LID ON LOUD MUSIC?;  </P> <P> NOISE-CONTROL LAWS MAY VARY FROM SITE TO SITE  </P> <P> It was just last week that the U.S. Supreme Court heard lawyers argue whether  the law allows those who would like some peace and quiet to put a sonic damper  on a rock concert bent on reaching high-decibel nirvana.  </P> <P> In Orange County Superior Court, such matters have been filling ever-growing  volumes of legal files for more than five years.  </P> <P> Since 1984, the Pacific Amphitheatre and a group of its Costa Mesa neighbors  have been fighting in court over the point when a boisterous outdoor concert  stops being fun and becomes a public nuisance. The Supreme Court case, which  involves New York City's attempt to enforce noise limits at a Central Park  concert band shell, apparently won't have any immediate bearing on the Pacific  Amphitheatre case.  </P> <P> Richard L. Spix, attorney for Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, the group that  has sued amphitheater management to tone down concert volume, took some heart  from New York's ability to get the Supreme Court to consider the concert noise  issue. But Spix said a different set of ground rules govern the Costa Mesa  suit, because no noise-control law similar to the New York City regulation is  in effect. Neil Papiano, attorney for Ned West Inc., the arm of the Nederlander  Organization that runs the Pacific Amphitheatre, said Wednesday that he wasn't  familiar with the Supreme Court case.  </P> <P> In the New York case, the city tried to take the control of the volume knobs  out of performers' hands and put a city-supplied technician in charge, while  also requiring that a city-supplied sound system be used. A federal appellate  court ruled that the restrictions deprived performers of their constitutional  right of free expression, prompting the city to appeal the case to the Supreme  Court. New York City's attorney in the case, Leonard J. Koerner, said Thursday  that a ruling isn't expected before the end of May.  </P> <P> Spix said the Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa isn't pressing to take the  control out of Pacific Amphitheatre management's hands. Its aim is to have the  managers of the 18,700-capacity amphitheater take initiatives of their own to  put a lid on sound levels the neighbors maintain are excessive.  </P> <P> Each side contends the other's measurement of sound levels in the neighborhood  is flawed, and Papiano denies that the limits set by a county noise ordinance  have ever been broken. Pacific Amphitheatre officials have been adamant about  not restricting performers' sound output: locked in hot competition with  another major Orange County outdoor venue, the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre, any such restriction could put the Pacific at a disadvantage in  attracting top acts that want to let the decibels fly unfettered.  </P> <P> In a new gambit that amphitheater officials hope will reduce noise outside the  amphitheater without attenuating the sound power on which some rock bands and  audiences thrive, Papiano said a new sound system is being installed for the  1989 season at a cost of $250,000. The system is designed to focus sound inside  the amphitheater instead of projecting it over an earthen barrier and into  residential areas. It will involve suspending speakers in an arc above the  stage, instead of mounting them in columns on the sides as in the past, Papiano  said.  </P> <P> The first big test will come April 8, when the heavy-metal act Poison plays the  Pacific, after the April 7 season opener by country band Alabama. Orange County  Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom has set an April 14 conference with  lawyers to review the new system's performance.  </P> <P> "I don't know what the system will do," Papiano said. "We hope it will take  care of all problems in all directions."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, outdoor concert noise has been a problem, but not an unsolvable  one.  </P> <P> In response to neighbors' noise complaints, the Universal Amphitheatre was  converted from an open-air venue to an enclosed theater in 1982. Noise  complaints also plagued the Greek Theatre until 1986, when its operator, the  Nederlander Organization, agreed to sound restraints that appear to have worked  for the city-owned facility.  </P> <P> "The Greek for the past two years has had no complaints by the citizens, none  whatsoever," said Officer Chuck Massar, coordinator of the Los Angeles Police  Department's noise-enforcement team. The key, he said, was installing a  "limiter" device on the amphitheater's sound control board, thereby  automatically capping its sound output at levels tolerable on the outside.  </P> <P> Aside from one loud, late-running 1987 show by the rock band U2, the Los  Angeles Coliseum has been free from noise complaints in recent years, Massar  said. The Hollywood Bowl and the John Anson Ford Theatre also have not  generated neighborhood complaints, he said.  </P> <P> However, the Bowl and the Ford Theatre did come into disharmony with one  another last year when Philharmonic concert-goers at the Bowl complained that  rock bands at the smaller theater across the freeway were drowning out the  orchestra.  </P> <P> "We canceled about 10 concerts to suit the Bowl," said Ward Hassett, assistant  manager of the private company that runs the county-owned Ford Theatre. "As it  sits right now, we're not allowed to (have concerts) on the same night as the  Hollywood Bowl when the Philharmonic is in session. We're in negotiations with  the Philharmonic and the county, trying to devise some kind of solution" that  would allow simultaneous shows at both locations. One possibility, he said,  could be the installation of a sound-reducing roof over part of the Ford  Theatre.  </P></p>

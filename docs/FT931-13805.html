			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: US upturn helps GE to 6% rise in final quarter GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, helped by an improving domestic economy and strong shipments from its power systems business. The company made Dollars 1.34bn, compared with Dollars 1.26bn in the same period of 1991. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from Dollars 1.46 to Dollars 1.57, and revenues rose from Dollars 17.6bn to Dollars 17.8bn. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE was 'better positioned than ever before, with a strong balance sheet, very strong cash-flows and excellent prospects for earnings growth.' In 1992 overall, GE's earnings rose 7 per cent to Dollars 4.72bn, while its share repurchase programme helped lift earnings per share 8 per cent to Dollars 5.51. Revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 62.2bn. GE estimated that earnings from continuing operations - excluding its aerospace division, being sold to Martin Marietta - would show a rise of around 10 per cent. Mr Welch said the company's performance in 1992 had been lead by double-digit earnings increases at GE Financial Services, Power Systems and Medical Services. He added that the year's operating highlight was 'the increasing ability of the businesses to turn the rhetoric of 'speed' into reality . . . as demonstrated by record inventory turnover and productivity of nearly 5 per cent during a period of slow global growth. 'This not only increased earnings but also translated into a record Dollars 5.3bn in operating cash-flow, some Dollars 1.3bn over 1991 results.' Earnings at GE Financial Services totalled Dollars 1.499bn for the year, 18 per cent up on 1991's Dollars 1.275bn. GE Capital, the main financial services arm, saw double-digit earnings growth, and Kidder, Peabody, the securities house, achieved 'sharply improved' results.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Availability and Identification of Must-Carry Signals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 614(b)(7) provides that all must-carry signals shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system and shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which the cable operator provides a connection. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we declined to grant a request to provide a special exception for commercial subscribers (e.g., hotels, hospitals) that receive specially designed channel line-ups. We stated our belief that the 1992 Cable Act is clear in its application of Section 614(b)(7) to every subscriber of a cable system, that it grants no authority to exempt a specific class of cable subscribers from the carriage requirements, and that there is no reason to believe that such commercial subscribers are not interested in receiving local broadcast signals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. On reconsideration, we note that the must-carry provisions do not distinguish between commercial and residential viewers. Congress made clear its intent that all subscribers have access to local commercial broadcast signals. We do not believe that petitioners have presented sufficient cause to change our earlier interpretation of the 1992 Cable Act. Therefore, we affirm that all subscribers must have access to these signals on all television sets connected by the cable operator or for which the cable operator provides a connection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. It is our understanding that the on-channel carriage of some UHF signals has resulted in situations where a converter box supplied by a cable operator does not contain the necessary channel capacity to permit a subscriber to access a UHF must-carry signal through the converter. For example, a converter may supply channels 2&hyph;36 while the must-carry station is on channel 55. Where a cable operator chooses to provide subscribers with signals of must-carry stations through the use of converter boxes supplied by the cable operator, the converter boxes must be capable of passing through all of the signals entitled to carriage on the basic service tier of the cable system, not just some of them. In addition, any converter boxes provided for this purpose must be provided at rates in accordance with Section 623(b)(3). Therefore, in a situation where the subscriber's converter is supplied by the cable operator, and is incapable of receiving all signals as required by Section 614(b)(7), the cable operator must make provision for a converter which is capable of providing these signals. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  If it is necessary to replace the converter, the subscriber must not be required to pay additional sums nor to pay for the installation. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  As discussed below, we have provided a mechanism for relief for cable systems which cannot meet the on-channel requests of must-carry stations. A decision not to seek such relief may not be used to contravene the directives of the 1992 Cable Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Memorandum Opinion and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (CSR&hyph;3903&hyph;M) (Complaint of WLIG&hyph;TV, Inc. against Cablevision Systems Corporation), DA&hyph;93&hyph;1365 (released November 10, 1993), in which the Mass Media Bureau noted that converter boxes provided by the cable system must be capable of transmitting all the signals entitled to mandatory carriage on the basic tier, and required Cablevision, because it was in the midst of an upgrade of its system, to switch station WLIG to a channel receivable by all subscribers, without the necessity of an additional converter box, during the rebuilding of its system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that where the cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections, but does not provide the subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, the operator must notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and the operator must offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates in accordance with section 623(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Definition of a Television Market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Use of ADI Markets and the Home County Exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the 1992 Cable Act, a local commercial television station is entitled to must-carry status on all cable systems located in the same television market as the cable system. The 1992 Cable Act states that the television market shall be determined pursuant to &sect;73.3555(d)(3)(i) of our rules, which in turn defines a television market in terms of the Area of Dominant Influence (``ADI''), as defined by Arbitron. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In the Report and Order, the Commission noted that each county in the contiguous United States is assigned by Arbitron exclusively to one ADI, and that each broadcast station licensed to a community located in an ADI is considered local throughout that ADI. The Commission established one exception to that rule, determining that each broadcast station will also be considered a must-carry station in its home county, even if that station is assigned to a different ADI from that of its home county (the ``home county exception''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that Arbitron has cancelled its television ratings service. However, the decision will not have an impact on the use of Arbitron-designated ADIs until the next must-carry/retransmission consent election which must take place by October 1, 1996. We will address this issue sufficiently before that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

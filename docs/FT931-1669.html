			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts tumble as Bank prepares Pounds 3bn auction UK government bonds shed nearly a point yesterday at the long end on news of a larger-than-expected gilt auction. The Bank of England said it would auction Pounds 3bn of the 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2013 on March 31, creating a 20-year benchmark stock. Dealers said the size of the auction took the market by surprise, as most participants had expected the Bank to sell about Pounds 2.5bn. The stock is partly paid, with the final instalment of 50 per cent payable on May 17. Although the gilt is a so-called Fotra stock (which means that non-resident investors receive the interest gross), dealers expected the issue to attract more interest from domestic than foreign investors. The Bank of England said after the Budget that it would hold larger and more frequent gilt auctions to meet the government's heavy borrowing requirement. Auctions of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn of stock will take place roughly once a month. The 9 per cent gilt due 2011 fell  13/16 to 105 13/32 to yield 8.42 per cent, while the Liffe future fell from 105.31 to 105.13 on the auction news. Shorter-dated issues edged lower, as hopes of another cut in the base rate evaporated. GERMAN government bonds closed lower following the Bundesbank's announcement of a variable rate repo, and the bund market's weakness pulled some of the higher-yielding European bond markets lower during the day. Dealers said news that the Bundesbank's securities repurchase transaction would be set at variable bid rates left market participants wondering where money market rates would settle following last week's discount rate cut. The repo results are due today. The release of inflation figures for one of the four key German states yesterday added to the weak state of the bund market. Consumer prices for North Rhine-Westphalia in the month to mid-March climbed 4.2 per cent, showing a slight year-on-year acceleration from the 4.0 per cent year-on-year rise in February. The Liffe bund future opened at 95.30, rose to a high of 95.68 and ended the day lower at 95.25. THE high-yielding Italian and Spanish government bond markets closed lower, taking their cue from the weak of the German market. The BTP futures contract fell from 96.53 to 96.27. Spanish government bonds, which fell sharply on Monday, continued their decline with the yield on the 10-year benchmark moving from 11.51 per cent to 11.56 per cent. SWEDISH government bond yields rose sharply after news that S&amp;P, the credit rating institution, had downgraded Sweden. Yields rose about 20 basis points. The four-year bond yield rose five points to 8.70 per cent, while the 10-year bond traded at 9.54 per cent, up two basis points. JAPANESE government bonds closed weaker, with the market largely ignoring the continued strength of the yen against the dollar and the firm tone for US bonds. The yen reached a historic closing high of 115.33 to the dollar in Tokyo trading. However, traders said that with the approach of the financial year-end on March 31, few investors were willing to change their holdings substantially. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved in a range of 4.045 per cent to 4.10 per cent, and closed at 4.075 per cent, against its opening of 4.065 per cent. The June futures contract opened at 110.17, traded up to 110.27, and ended at 109.89. US Treasuries rose yesterday afternoon in quiet trading as the market waited for today's durable goods report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at 104 1/2 , yielding 6.764 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 , to yield 3.839 per cent. There was little reaction to the Johnson Redbook report of US retail store sales for the week ended March 20, which showed a 1.8 per cent rate of decline on a seasonally adjusted basis from the average level in February.</p>

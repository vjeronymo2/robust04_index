			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: The Church and its finances Sir, Before readers of your delightful article on the Church's missing millions (July 11) reach for their cheque books, may I point out that the figure of Pounds 12,000 as the pay of the clergy is misleading? In December 1982, the Church Commissioners, in a memorandum to the General Synod, estimated that a vicar was better off with his stipend of Pounds 5,802, plus his tax-efficient perks, than if he were to be paid Pounds 10,500 only, with no housing. Adjusting for inflation, the perks therefore now seem to be worth Pounds 8,099 making, with the average stipend of Pounds 12,800, a total of Pounds 20,899. In the interim, interest-free loans have been made available for car purchase. Oliver Lever, Blackacre, Back Lane, Malvern, Worcs WR14 2HJ</p>

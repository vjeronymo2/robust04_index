			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / EU to tighten ship standards EU environment and transport ministers yesterday backed in principle a European Commission plan to tighten up inspection procedures for sub-standard ships, as part of the effort to reduce the high rate of accidents in EU waters. Ministers also agreed that member states should detain in port unsafe ships 'until all major deficiencies have been rectified'. The Commission underlined that the use of ships more than 15 years old had doubled over the past four years. But the EU still cannot decide whether to restrict shipping from waters near environmentally sensitive areas, or on a civil liability regime for owners of hazardous cargos using sub-standard shipping. Traditionally, EU states have acted individually through the International Maritime Organisation. But following a spate of oil tanker disasters pressure has built up for the EU to police European waters more vigorously.</p>

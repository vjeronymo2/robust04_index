			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Blair's manifesto to stress continuity Mr Tony Blair will today seek to consolidate his lead in the contest to succeed John Smith as Labour leader with a personal manifesto focusing on individual opportunity and civic responsibility, Kevin Brown writes. Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, will present himself as the candidate best able to blend continuity with the leadership of John Smith and fresh policies to carry Labour into the next century. In a passage inspired by the success of President Bill Clinton's election campaign, Mr Blair will stress the need for Labour to develop ways of managing the industrial and social changes facing the UK. He will also argue that Labour should explicitly commit itself to achieving a balance of rights and responsibility within the community, expressly rejecting the view that society owes an automatic debt to individuals. The manifesto will argue that individual rights, distorted by 15 years of Conservative government, can only be fully realised in the context of a community in which individuals accept responsibilities to each other and to the state. But Mr Blair will also stress the need for Labour to offer security to individuals in a rapidly changing world in which people of all social classes have suffered dislocation.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / German Bonds: View of bund market as 'safe haven' loses appeal WITHIN a matter of weeks, investors' views on the attractions of the German bund market have soured appreciably. It was only on April 14 that the yield on 10-year bunds dropped to 6.45 per cent, down from over 9 per cent in the summer of last year. This reflected enormous buying from primarily foreign investors. Mr Klaus Holzschuh, head of fixed income research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, calculates that foreigners invested DM190bn in the 14 months to the end of February this year - more than twice the level in 1991, the previous record year. That wave of buying has not given way to massive selling. But enthusiasm for the long end of the market has dwindled and yields are back above 6.8 per cent and - if the pessimists are to be believed - are likely to drift up to 7 per cent over the course of the year. The buying was inspired primarily by two factors: hopes of cuts in interest rates and perceptions that the D-Mark offered a 'safe-haven' in times of political and economic uncertainty. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Market Research in London, says the safe-haven argument has lost its appeal at a time when tensions within the ERM have eased. She believes it will revive only if the Danes deliver a 'no' vote in their referendum on the Maastrict treaty on May 18. As for long-term interest rates, Ms Cottrell says they are now 'so low that they cannot go any lower'. With inflation running at over 4 per cent, real long-term rates are around 2.5 per cent. Despite cautious words from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, and other members of the policy-making council, economists are convinced the severity of the German recession will prompt further sharp cuts in short-term rates over the rest of the year. Although inflation is running at twice the Bundesbank's long-term target rate of 2 per cent, the central bank can camouflage its monetary easing by reference to money supply. After enormous distortion caused by currency inflows last autumn and their aftermath, M3 broad money growth is likely to be within its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target for the year. This will allow the Bundesbank to claim future inflation is being brought under control. Mr Thomas Mayer, economist at Goldman Sachs, believes the central bank has 'stepped up a gear' in its easing of monetary policy. It cut its discount and Lombard rates on April 22 - taking the crucial discount rate down 0.25 of a percentage point to 7.25 per cent - and delivered a sharp cut in the repo rate the following week. The Bundesbank has made clear its determination that the German yield curve, which has for so long been steeply inverted, should normalise: that is, short-term rates should be lower than long-term rates. It would like to achieve this by bringing down short rates and seeing long-term yields stay where they are rather than rise. The latter would be a possibility if investors lost faith in the Bundesbank's ability to combat inflation over the long-term - or if they start to contemplate the implications of Germany's ballooning public sector debt, more details of which will emerge next week. Economists now expect the discount rate to be down to 5 or 6 per cent by the end of the year. From an investment point of view, that means stay at the short end of the yield curve and avoid the longer end. Or abandon bunds altogether.</p>

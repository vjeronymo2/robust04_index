			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Making a mark - Richard Gourlay considers Lord Strathclyde's role as UK minister for small businesses When Lord Strathclyde first took his seat at the Palace of Westminster at the age of 26, police inside would not believe he was a noble lord. Eight years on, and now minister for small businesses at the department of trade and industry, Lord Strathclyde has lost none of his boyish looks and enthusiasm. His age was initially some concern to the vociferous small-business lobby. With only six years' work experience at insurance company Bain Clarkson, what could he know of small business' concerns, some asked. He was, furthermore, following a procession of ministers who had passed through the department with such speed that it seemed government support for small businesses was little more than rhetoric. But Lord Strathclyde has prompted pleasant surprise in the six months since he replaced Baroness Denton. Where she was ultimately criticised for not modifying her strong opinions, Lord Strathclyde has impressed audiences with his open mind and an ability to pick up complex briefs. However, the direction in which he seems to be leaning has not been so widely welcomed. There is guarded optimism among people who want government increasingly to focus its small-business support services on the few businesses that have a real chance of growing, creating jobs and wealth. Those who want support services to be spread more thinly among a greater number of smaller businesses are less pleased. A careful politician, Lord Strathclyde does not dismiss the value of what are often called 'lifestyle businesses', companies which have little prospect of growing and creating wealth. But his policy emphasis is clear. 'Sole traders are very important. They are crucial to local areas but the area we want to concentrate on is those businesses with an equity gap that want to expand, that are entrepreneurial,' he says. This preference is well illustrated by plans to revamp the consultancy service currently offered under the Enterprise Initiative, for example. Lord Strathclyde says: 'It will be fewer companies that come into the net but those that do come in will get more out of it.' While Lord Strathclyde is developing his own views, there is no doubt his task is aided by fresh enthusiasm for smaller companies within the government. 'In the last three or four months there has been a step change in the way government and other organisations treat small firms,' he says. The chancellor's last Budget put the funding gap on the agenda, with the announcement of a replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme and new venture capital investment trusts. He also focused the debate about legislation to counter late payment and relaxed a number of administrative rules, such as the need for smaller companies to have a full audit. 'I think Ken Clarke (the chancellor) is genuinely very keen on this area of the economy,' Lord Strathclyde says. 'I see my role first to represent government policy and how it affects small business, and to make sure my colleagues in government are not thinking of legislation which will damage the interests of small businesses,' he says. But there are specific areas where he would like to leave a mark. His first priority is Business Link, a project championed by Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, which is designed to bring the government's support services together in one-stop shops. He says 50 of the 200 planned outlets will be open by the end of the year. 'We need to reach not so much the people who don't know they exist but those that don't know they need the services. And we have to counter the view that what is on offer from government is cheap and shoddy.' Another priority is to sort out the issue of late payment. Lord Strathclyde says he 'walked into the issue' on his first day, has welcomed the quality of the formal submissions but remains agnostic on whether there should be a statutory right to interest on late debts. On finance, he would like to see greater use of the Loan Guarantee Scheme, recently raised to Pounds 250,000, as part of a package of finance. He recognises that investors in private companies need exit routes and supports calls for some form of third market to replace the Unlisted Securities Market. 'I would like to see what the Stock Exchange is proposing although it doesn't have to be under the Stock Exchange's auspices.'</p>

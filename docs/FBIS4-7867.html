			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yves Heller on interview with FYROM President </F> Kiro Gligorov on 4 April in Skopje: "`Everything Is Negotiable  Provided Greece Lifts the Blockade,' President Kiro Gligorov  Told Us"]    [Text] Skopje -- The Republic of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is prepared to  negotiate "immediately" on the dispute with Greece, including on  its name and on its flag, which are both disputed by Greece,  only if Andreas Papandreou's government lifts the embargo it  imposed on its northern neighbor more than six weeks ago. This  is the position which Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov  expressed in an interview to LE MONDE on Monday 4 April in which  he reported Greek "troop movements" on the common border.    "The negotiations (with Greece) can resume immediately, but  the embargo must first be lifted because it is very difficult to  have discussions in such imbalanced circumstances," Mr. Gligorov  stressed, emphasizing the fact that "no country would negotiate  under such constraints." And the Macedonian president confirmed  that his country is "prepared to negotiate on all issues"  remaining between Skopje and Athens. These are, first, the very  name of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), a  temporary name accepted by the United Nations exactly one year  ago because Greece refuses to allow this country, which has a  little more than 2 million inhabitants, to bear a name --  Macedonia -- which Athens thinks belongs exclusively to Greek  heritage.  <H5>  Loss of Identity </H5>   Among the other disputes between the two states is the  Macedonian flag, with the Greeks demanding a change to the  emblem it carries (on a red background) -- a so-called Vergina  sun, named after a city in Greek Macedonia in which such an  emblem was found in the tomb of King Philip II. Athens is also  demanding that Skopje change some articles of its Constitution,  seeing them as evidence of "irredentism."    But although everything is open to negotiation, not  everything is necessarily acceptable in the eyes of President  Gligorov, a 77-year-old lawyer and economist with great  political experience and skill who has a long federal career  behind him (in particular he was a member of the Yugoslav  presidency and was speaker of the Federal Assembly from 1974 to  1978).    Hitherto, and since the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991, he  has been the only leader of the six federated republics to keep  his fellow citizens out of the war, despite a highly explosive  environment. For him "it is possible to discuss everything;  nothing can be excluded (from discussion), but it is clear that  a people cannot be asked to change its identity. Changing its  name represents a loss of identity."  <H5>  Troop Movements </H5>   In return, "any negotiation, any agreement implies a  compromise by both sides." As for the flag, "if there is  agreement, even this question can be settled." At all events,  "there cannot be negotiation as long as the embargo continues."  To make Macedonia bend, to ensure that it abandons its name and  symbols to avoid asphyxiation, Greece is imposing a blockade on  Macedonia in violation of all European Union [EU] rules. This  policy means that Athens is completely isolated within the EU,  its 11 partners protesting this measure, but without securing  its lifting. The EU Commission has expressed the intention of  referring the matter to the European Court of Justice in  Luxembourg to force the Greek authorities to abandon their  position.    This embargo "is causing great damage to the people and  economy of Macedonia" and it is "in the interests of the EU for  it to be lifted, because it does not just affect Macedonia, it  violates the Maastricht Treaty. Europe must find a way out of  this situation," Mr. Gligorov stressed.    He has so far received no signal indicating an easing of the  Greek positions, which instead are "hardening." "Some Greek  troop movements" have been noted on the border, according to the  Macedonian president, who does not believe that "Greece will  attack Macedonia now" and does not "think that a NATO and EU  member country could behave like that."    Referring to the lessons which should be learned from the  war  in Bosnia, Kiro Gligorov reaffirmed that independent Macedonia  "is a democratic country, a rule-of-law state, oriented toward a  market economy, which wants economically open borders with all  its neighbors" and that "such a Macedonia is a precondition for  stability in the Balkans." "Our existence is in the interest of  our neighbors, who must abandon some ambitions resulting from  History, because those ambitions have always led to war."    No neighbor of Macedonia -- an enclave between Greece,  Bulgaria, Serbia, and Albania, and which has a very large  Albanian minority -- is apparently exempt from "ambitions" in  one form or another. Among them, Albania is clearly not the  last to engage in attentive and insistent scrutiny of Macedonian  affairs.    In particular, the Skopje press has pointed out the active  participation of Tirana's ambassador in meetings of the  leadership of the main Albanian movement in Macedonia, the Party  of Democratic Prosperity, which split after fierce internal  struggles. "There is a difference between each country's  legitimate right to take care of its minority, and interference  in another country's internal affairs. This legitimate right  means following the implementation of international norms with  regard to your minorities; but interference in the life of  political parties in unacceptable," President Gligorov said with  regard to Albania and its practices, about which the Macedonian  Government has expressed its annoyance.    Macedonia is at present outside the conflict which has  brought bloodshed to most of the former Yugoslavia. The  satisfaction which Kiro Gligorov derives from this is, however,  undermined by the fact that there is a "risk (for his country)  as long as the war continues alongside it and as long as the  crisis with Greece continues."</p>

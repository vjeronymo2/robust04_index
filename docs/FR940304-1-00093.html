			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, the Department recognizes that for analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completeness, it should conduct studies on the potential impacts of standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on natural gas utilities. Accordingly, DOE is now examining methodologies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data sources that will enable it to conduct such studies. The Department,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, welcomes submittals of relevant information and data in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia Gas and the Montana-Dakota Utilities Company stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation standards on gas appliances would result in a loss of natural gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales, which, in turn, would lead to higher rates to all gas customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 5; Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, No. 54 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not accept the inevitability of that contention; a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss of gas sales may or may not increase rates. The actual effect depends on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost structure of the gas utility. If avoided costs are larger than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates, then reducing sales would actually decrease rates. Without study of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual gas utility cost structures, no  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a priori <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conclusion in this regard can be drawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, four comments addressed the Department's planned analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental effects. Both the Southern Union Gas Company and Columbia Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out that the negative environmental effects from electric resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters are more severe than are the effects from natural gas water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. Columbia Gas stated that carbon dioxide emissions from electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance water heaters are 3.8 times higher than those from a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency gas water heater. (Southern Union Gas Company, No. 22 at 2;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 5). Also, the American Gas Association and Columbia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas urged the Department to consider the environmental impact of the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy delivery cycle, i.e., source energy, not just site consumption only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3; Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statements regarding the relative environmental impacts of gas and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance electric water heating are generally correct. Furthermore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department does account for source energy (not just site energy) savings by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the fuel used by electric utilities and the consequent emissions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the utility impact assessment and environmental analysis. These effects are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported in Chapter 9 of the Technical Support Document accompanying this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Product-Specific Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Room Air Conditioners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the September 1990 advance notice, DOE proposed 12 classes of room air conditioners. The product classes consist of four categories; units with side louvers, units without side louvers, units with reversing valve with side louvers, and units with reversing valve without side louvers. There are five class divisions by capacity within each of the two categories without reversing valves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Energy Commission proposed a reduction in product classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 12 to 4, eliminating the class divisions based on capacity. (California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2). Whirlpool Corporation and Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers proposed two additional classes, a casement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slider and a casement only room air conditioner. They stated that restricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geometry adversely impacts the potential new designs that can be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those types of room air conditioners. For example, rotary compressors could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be fitted into the casement units. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 7;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 4). The American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council for an Energy Efficient Economy in its comments cited room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioners as an example where broad product classes have been properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6, at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several constraints placed on the design of room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioners. Because most room air conditioners are installed in double-hung  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> windows, the size of the most typical double-hung windows becomes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant factor in cabinet design and production. Every room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioner unit could be designed to optimize performance and efficiency as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long as a specific cabinet could be built to best suit the unit's particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity and efficiency. Manufacturers cannot afford the luxury of optimizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every model they produce, so they limit their production of cabinets to three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or four sizes. Because of space and configuration limitations, the larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity units for a given cabinet size will tend to be less efficient. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this reason the Department is rejecting the California Energy Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to ignore capacity in establishing classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department decided to adopt additional classes for casement slider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and casement only room air conditioners. These units offer a unique utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the consumer in that they offer a performance-related feature (fitting into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> casement windows) which other room air conditioners cannot provide. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that the size limitations imposed on casement units are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more significant than those faced by typical double-hung window units. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its performance-related feature justified a lower standard, separate product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes were established for casement slider and casement only units. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the small amount of empirical data on casement type units, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was unable to analyze these classes. As a result, the Department is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing any standards for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandra Semenova report: "Joint Plenum of Three Courts"] </F>   [Text] A joint plenum of Russia's Constitutional, Supreme,  and Higher Arbitration Courts was held in the Supreme Court of  Russia building yesterday. It discussed draft amendments to the  law "On the Status of Judges." As a result, a drafting  commission was confirmed which would busy itself with finalizing  the wording of the amendments and then submit them to the State  Duma of the Federal Assembly for approval.    The plenum agreed with the provision in the draft law on a  single status for judges. In the words of Constitutional Court  acting Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, in the law "it is necessary to  underline precisely the unity of judges." The plenum approved  the article in the draft law on judges' independence and abiding  only by the requirements of the Constitution and the Federal law.    Speakers at the plenum noted that it is necessary to reduce  the length of service qualifying judges for life-long financial  support from 20 to 10 years. According to one of the judges, 10  years is quite sufficient for earning "the whole bunch of  occupational ailments." The plenum also agreed that the length  of service in the prosecution, justice, and investigation bodies  should be taken into account in calculating the size of  life-long financial support.    Lyudmila Maykova, deputy chairperson of the Council of  Judges  of Russia, proposed that state arbiters should have the same  social benefits as judges, which they do not have now.    Representatives of the Constitutional Court suggested that  the draft law should include a provision on the creation of its  own independent security service. The participants also agreed  with the provision that judges should have the right to carry  firearms.    The plenum also discussed the questions of benefits for  judges working in the extreme north: one year of work there  will be put on record as 18 months.    The draft law "On the Status of Judges" will be put into  final shape by a commission of nine participants in the plenum  confirmed by that body.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Excerpts] FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU writes: The deadly  grenade on the black [as heard] market of Sarajevo marked the  end of the time of hypocrisy. Either the UN withdraws the blue  helmets and lifts the arms embargo to make the Bosnians'  legitimate self-defense easier, and leaves Bosnia to its fate,  or the UN -- represented by NATO -- wages war against the Serbs  and Croats. An ultimatum for pacifying Sarajevo, addressed to  the Serbs, is, in the worst case -- and one has to proceed from  that premise -- just an overture of a war with ground forces.  However, who would be willing to wage such a war, in view of  the probable heavy losses, a confrontation with Russia, and  without any obvious prospect of a time when a sensible, feasible  policy will once again replace the war? FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU  asks.    STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN, too, is skeptical: The NATO  ultimatum will give new hope to the desperate, often  disappointed people in Sarajevo. However, what political effect  can air strikes have? Are they more than a late sign of  collective, helpless outrage? Bombs against resignation,  because a solution to end the bloodshed continues to be elusive?  And surely anyone who wants to break the siege around Sarajevo  for any length of time necessarily needs the will to drag those  ruined villages out of the claws of violence, those villages  that lie off the track of international attention and cannot  hope for a worldwide outcry against the atrocities? This was  STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN.    MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG is also critical: Cease-fires for  Sarajevo -- how many have there been? Yet again hope arises for  the inhabitants of the Bosnian capital -- a hope that may be  deceptive. No one will guarantee that the Bosnian Serbs really  want to take a first, serious step toward negotiations by  loosening the siege around the city. There is too much that  indicates that this announcement is just another attempt to lull  the outraged world public. In particular since only NATO's  threat of military force has given rise to some movement among  the parties to the conflict in the Balkans, doubts about the  seriousness of the plans for withdrawal are more than  appropriate, MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG stresses. [passage omitted]    FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, discussing Russia's resistance to  attacks on Serbian positions, notes: Even though there has  never been any doubt about the solidarity of the Eastern  Orthodox Slavs with the Orthodox Serbs, now Moscow for the first  time has threatened quite clearly to veto air strikes on the  Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo. The fact that the accusation  against UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, which was made at the  same time, namely that he has exceeded his authority, happened  to coincide with the NATO deliberations about a potential  ultimatum addressed to the aggressors on the Balkan battlefield  was no coincidence, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE notes.</p>

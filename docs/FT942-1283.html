			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sell-off in futures undermines initial advance - Market Report The London stock market suddenly developed a mind of its own yesterday afternoon, reversing an early advance to fall sharply in the direction of the year's lows. Weakness in UK shares contrasted with firmness in other markets, including the British government bonds sector. In early afternoon, the FT-SE 100 Index dipped to 2,936.5, a fall of nearly 24 points and within 5 points of the closing low recorded at the beginning of this month. The turnround from the 19-point gain at the market opening coincided with news that US durable goods had risen by a potentially inflationary 0.9 per cent in May; but traders also referred to general nervousness ahead of publication today of the UK government White Paper on the pensions industry, which some analysts fear may urge that funds increase weighting in bond markets. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,942.4 for a loss on the day of 18 points. Although trading in equities increased, the selling pressure came through the stock index futures markets, where two large sellers, one of whom, at least, was a US firm, drove the September contract on the Footsie to a substantial discount and undermined the stock market. Selling was not confined to the Footsie list but spread across the full range of the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index declined 24.3 to 3,436.9. However, non-Footsie stocks made up only about 45 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 540.2m shares; on Wednesday, 463.3m shares were traded through Seaq, for a retail, or customer, value of Pounds 1.3bn, a return to healthy profitable levels of equity trading for the London-based securities industry. At first, UK shares followed trends in European bond and stock markets, moving higher as the US dollar steadied in response to the assurances overnight from President Clinton and the US trade secretary that the US currency would be defended. But London equities appeared to part company with other markets in the second half of the session. An outstanding feature was the collapse of shares in The Telegraph, together with losses in other UK newspaper shares, as a sharp cut in the Telegraph cover price indicated a significant upgrading of the UK press circulation war sparked off by price cuts by the Murdoch group publications. The Telegraph share price fell by about one third and the London Stock Exchange announced an inquiry into share dealings. There was also a fall in Mirror Group Newspapers, head-on rival with the Murdoch tabloids and also the new owner of The Independent, which also reduced its cover price, albeit for only one day. Eurotunnel advanced at first in spite of some disappointment with the take-up of only 67.7 per cent of the rights issue. The stock lost its gain before the close and traders commented that the share price would be vulnerable to any further shakeout in equity markets. London's concentration on its own concerns masked developments elsewhere. But strategists said that the clouds remain over the outlook for the US dollar and that markets would continue to look for more decisive action on the US currency than indicated by the US trade secretary. Some investors had hoped for a cut in key rates from the Bundesbank yesterday and there was some disappointment when the German central bank made no move on its discount or Lombard rates.</p>

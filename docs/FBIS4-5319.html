			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The four-day visit of Cambodian Deputy Prime  Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut to Malaysia this week marked  another step in building stronger relations between the two  countries. A Malaysia- Cambodia Joint Commission is to be set  up soon to promote bilateral activities. The idea was suggested  by Sirivut himself at his one-hour meeting with Malaysian  Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. The commission will,  among others, coordinate training and cooperation in  agriculture, tourism, and forestry apart from the exploitation  of oil and minerals. Cambodia has also requested Malaysia's  assistance in the formulation of trade and investment policies  for the country.    Ever since the two-decade-old civil war was brought to an  end, Malaysia has been in the forefront in that country's  reconstruction and development. Prince Sirivut expressed his  country's gratitude to the Government and people of Malaysia who  had greatly contributed toward the peace process in his country.    Cambodia plans to set up an embassy in Kuala Lumpur before  proceeding to do so in other countries of ASEAN. The embassies  are necessary to enable Cambodia keep abreast with developments  in the region as they have been isolated during the last 20  years.    Right now, Cambodia's priority is to revive its economy. The  new Cambodian Government, which was formed after last May's  general elections, is keen on attracting Malaysia's private  sector to invest in the country. It is also seeking Malaysia's  expertise in various fields, especially in agriculture. It is  relevant to find out that 85 percent of the Cambodian people  live in the rural areas. Thus, Cambodia naturally wants to  learn from Malaysia how the latter has achieved immense  development and improved the quality of life in the rural areas.    The visit of Prince Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation, was also to finalize  details of the Malaysian premier Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's  three-day visit to Cambodia next week. Dr. Mahathir is  scheduled to hold discussions on bilateral, regional, and  international issues with the co-prime ministers of Cambodia,  Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Mr. Hun Sen. According to Sirivut,  the official visit of the Malaysian premier is interpreted and  considered by the Government of Cambodia as a very important  political event. The people of Cambodia are reported to be  looking forward to the visit, especially because of Malaysia's  role in the country's peace process.    Malaysia, just like its other ASEAN partners, considers  Cambodia as an important and integral part of Southeast Asia.  Malaysia may be remembered as among the first countries to send  troops to serve in the United Nations Transitional Authority in  Cambodia, UNTAC. And now that peace has come about as a result  of the UN-brokered 1991 Paris peace accord, Malaysia would like  to see that country grow and prosper in all fields, and come on  par with other countries in the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Prokopenko: "`Pocket' Armies Hard on the </F> Pocket. Servicemen from Nearby Foreign Countries Set on Coming  to Russia"]    [Text] It appears that national armies are becoming a  national disaster for the independent states of the post-Union  space. In fact, the last thing politicians who gained points  and earned dividends from the idea of independence are bothered  about now is the future of the very armies they advocated  creating. They were necessary merely as an essential attribute  of embryonic statehood. But when the once common "blanket" was  torn up, it turned out that the shreds would not even cover the  private parts, if you will excuse the expression. The units  which were once the subject of fierce polemics are in a dire  state. For example, the regiment of ultramodern Tu-160  strategic bombers, which were once "privatized" with such pomp  and ceremony by Ukraine. While they have been under yellow and  blue banners, the regiment's pilots have hardly ever been up in  the air.    For the umpteenth time the military are pawns in political  games. The recent flood of requests for transfer to national  armies has dried up. The lack of proper social guarantees and  the threat of professional degeneration altered the direction of  migration. Now the cadre departments of the Russian Army's main  commissariats are snowed under with letters in which officers  from nearby foreign parts are expressing their willingness to  serve anywhere and in any posts.    For instance, 800 military pilots have left the Belarusian  Armed Forces and are now serving in Russia. They constituted 60  percent of the Belarusian Air Force flight personnel. Also  badly weakened by the mass "exodus to Russia" are the Belarusian  Airborne Assault Forces, 339 of whose officers have changed  their place of service in this way. According to the republic  committee for the social protection of servicemen, another 2,500  officers want to go to Russia.    Clearly, the independent states cannot afford to keep  armies.  Moreover, one cannot expect economic progress and a  corresponding easing of the crisis in these armed formations in  the foreseeable future.</p>

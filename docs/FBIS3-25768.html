He was addressing 10,000 people  who attended a peoples' forum to raise issues with the  leadership at the Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley.    A questioner asked how matriculation could remain a  qualification for membership of the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we  Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation] if the future government was to  provide only 10 years of free education.    Mr Mandela said MK members must at least have a  matriculation  certificate. "The SADF, with which we are now uniting and which  has had an opportunity for education, is very well qualified.  Officers require certain academic qualifications and many of  them are highly educated."    This was evident at a recent meeting with the General Staff  of the SADF at which he could see from the way they presented  their arguments that they were well educated. "We do not want  to bring down the standards of the army. We want to keep them  as high as they are," he said. "Even in the reorganisation we  will not get the qualifications we want; we must have at least  matric," he said. The 10 years of free education was a first  target and a future government would hope to increase it in  stages.</p>

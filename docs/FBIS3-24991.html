The opposition candidate to  Guinea-Bissau's presidential elections has just been cleared of  charges at Guinea-Bissau's Supreme Military Court. After the  verdict was pronounced the first thing Joao da Costa did was to  talk to us:    [Da Costa] "There were 14 defendants on trial at the Supreme  Military Court and only three of them were cleared of charges:  Joao da Costa, Tarmo (Anawai), and Gil (Sanha)."    [Announcer] That was a relieved Joao da Costa.    [Da Costa] "Thank God. I have just witnessed one of the  greatest injustices ever."    [Announcer] That was Joao da Costa talking to Luis Ferreira.  The leader of Guinea-Bissau's PRD [Democratic Renewal Party] has  no doubt that had there not been international pressure his  conviction would have been certain:    [Da Costa] "That is the regime. Had it been anyone else but  Joao da Costa, I am sure they would have also been convicted.  It is all because I am Joao da Costa, one of the opposition  leaders, and international pressure helped me in being cleared."</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / People: BAe's new engineer Trevor Truman, a well-known behind-the-scenes figure in the European defence industry, has landed a high profile job with his appointment as director of engineering at British Aerospace. Truman took up the new post last week, replacing Ian Hall who has retired. The new engineering chief is less well known to the public and BAe shareholders than he is in defence and aerospace circles. He is a member of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council, a council member of the Defence Manufacturers Association, technical board member of the Society of British Aerospace Companies and director of the European Defence Industry Group. He is also a member of the UK delegation to the Nato Industrial Advisory Group. Truman, 53, was educated at King's College, London University, and joined Royal Ordnance in 1967 from the Ministry of Defence. In the mid 1980's he was successively director for organisation and planning, managing director of the explosives division, and operations director. In 1987, he became a member of the board of Royal Ordnance after the company was bought by British Aerospace. In 1988 he became chairman of Royal Ordnance Speciality Metals and engineering director of Royal Ordnance. He joined the board of British Aerospace Defence last year and will continue as engineering director there concurrently with his new post, which is not a main board appointment.</p>

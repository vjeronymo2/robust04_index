			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Schubert on the South Bank The South Bank Schubert series, now well underway, is a lop-sided one, with all the interesting events happening at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. This is where we are hearing the chamber music written for intimate evenings among the composer's circle of friends, although it cannot have been the intention of the organisers that their audiences should be the same kind of size. This part of the series lasts until March. There are string quartets, piano sonatas and duets, some songs. Best of all, on Tuesday, was the only truly novel item - a selection of Schubert's partsongs, which proved so entertaining that some in the audience may have gone away to look out more. There are plenty of them, too: three full pages listed in Grove, no less. Can they all be so imaginatively varied? Many of these pieces were written for specific occasions, which will explain why Schubert tried his hand at some unusual combinations of voices and instruments. One father, wanting to celebrate the convalescence of his dance-mad daughter, commissioned the lively 'Der Tanz'. Several of the more ambitious songs, including 'Nachtgesang im Walde', a Lied that has outgrown its origins, have a quartet of horns in support. In among these trifles, however, are at least a few minor masterpieces. It is difficult to resist Schubert's setting of the 23rd Psalm ('The Lord is my Shepherd') and especially when its wide-eyed innocence is as beautifully caught as it was here by the ladies of the BBC Singers accompanied by Imogen Cooper. Then again, the 'Gesang der Geister uber den Wassern', for male octet with a quintet of lower strings, looks far ahead of its time to becoming a 'serious song' in the Brahms manner, mellow, pensive, richly textured. In every item the BBC Singers were on expert form, holding in check the individual voices which wobbled away during the recent Janacek weekend. Sian Edwards conducted, a relaxing duty, one imagines, before ENO responsibilities claim her attention. The partsongs were preceded by the Chilingirian String Quartet in the A Minor Quartet, undemonstrative and affectionate Schubert playing, which captured the Landler spirit nicely. Unfortunately the Borodins' recording was fresh in my mind and this was not its equal. Schubert series continues at the Queen Elizabeth Hall until 2 March (Box Office 071-928 8800)</p>

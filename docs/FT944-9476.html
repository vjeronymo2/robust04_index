			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (8): Congestion is expected to worsen - Zurich and Geneva Zurich and Geneva airports are both enjoying moderate growth in both business and leisure traffic and are suffering from capacity constraints. In both cases, the problems are entirely related to passenger handling. Zurich-Kloten's three runways are more than adequate to meet foreseeable demand as is Geneva-Cointrin's single runway. Zurich's two terminals tend to reach their limit to handle passengers in early summer when both business and leisure traffic is high. Cointrin is already handling 6m passengers a year, which is about 15 per cent more than the terminal was designed to accommodate. With passenger growth of 4.8 per cent in the first eight months of this year, things will get worse before they get better. However, construction is under way on a SFr120m (Dollars 96.7m) terminal extension that will raise capacity at Cointrin to 8m passengers a year when it is completed in 1996. Other more moderate improvements in people moving are also in the works. At Kloten, the outlook is more cloudy. The airport is a hyper-sensitive issue in environment-conscious Zurich. A proposal for a new SFr2bn terminal building must be submitted to the people of the canton in a referendum next summer. If the proposal is approved, construction could begin in 1998 with the hope that the terminal would open in 2003. In the meantime, congestion in the existing terminals will worsen. In the first nine months of this year, passenger numbers were up 7 per cent, and the upward trend is expected to continue.</p>

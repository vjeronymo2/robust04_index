			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Observer: Late delivery Yesterday's letter in the FT from Mike Flanagan, network director of Post Office Counters, caught the eye. Not so much for his comments about the growing popularity of franchised post offices with customers, but his statement that 95 per cent of Britain's post offices have been run by sub-postmasters for the past 350 years. Business must have been pretty slow for the first couple of hundred years until Sir Rowland Hill introduced the modern postal system in 1840.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After his visit to Australia from 20 to 23 March,  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri began his  official visit to New Zealand from 24 to 27 March at the  invitation of Donald McKinnon, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister of New Zealand. The visit is aimed at strengthening  bilateral relations between Thailand and New Zealand and  exchanging views with New Zealand leaders on the situation in  the Asia-Pacific region and the upcoming meeting of the ASEAN  Regional Forum, or ARF, to be held in Bangkok in July.    On the first day of his visit in Wellington, the foreign  minister paid courtesy calls on New Zealand leaders, namely  Peter Captain, house speaker and national assembly chairman;  James Bolger, prime minister; and David Lange, former prime  minister of New Zealand; and had talks with his New Zealand  counterpart, Donald McKinnon.    The foreign Minister said New Zealand leaders attached  special significance to the efforts to strengthen relations with  Thailand, especially regarding trade, investment, and tourism  cooperation, for they believe that the future of New Zealand is  closely bound up with Asian countries. In this connection, the  foreign minister expressed support for New Zealand's Asia 2000  Program, under which New Zealand business people will visit  Thailand and other countries in Asia to find ways of promoting  investment cooperation.    The foreign minister suggested an increase in contacts  between business circles, the setting up of Thai-New Zealand  business council, and wider dissemination of trade and  investment information as measures to promote trade and  investment cooperation between the two countries, and the New  Zealand side has agreed to take them up for further  consideration.    The New Zealand side expressed its gratitude to Thailand for  its support for New Zealand becoming a member of the UN Security  Council in 1992 and expressed interest in joining the Treaty of  Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, or the Bali Treaty.  The foreign minister promised to bring the matter up for  consultations with the other ASEAN member countries.    The foreign minister praised the long-standing relations  between the two countries and thanked New Zealand for the  excellent reception rendered to Princess Sirinthon during her  visit to Antarctica.    Touching on the ARF meeting, which Thailand will host in  July, the deputy prime minister of New Zealand said the meeting  is the most meaningful meeting this year because it will provide  both an opportunity for leaders of big countries to meet each  other and a forum for the discussion of the future and stability  of the Asia-Pacific region.    The foreign minister noted that there should be a mechanism  in the region to settle conflicts and act as a guarantee for  regional stability. The New Zealand side agreed with him. The  foreign minister also briefed his New Zealand hosts on the  latest developments in Cambodia and Burma. The foreign minister  told the New Zealand leaders that he, in his capacity as  chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, will soon pay a visit  to Burma at the invitation of the Burmese foreign minister and  will consider inviting Burma as a guest of the host to attend  the ASEAN annual meeting to be held in Thailand in July.    On the same day, the foreign minister met with Thai  residents  in Wellington and briefed them on the latest developments in  Thailand and answered their questions on tourism promotion and  the environment in Thailand. During his meetings with the New  Zealand leaders, the foreign minister asked them to look after  the well-being of the Thai residents who are there to earn their  living, pursue higher education, and do business. The New  Zealand leaders promised that Thai residents would be accorded  fair and proper treatment.    The foreign minister received a warm and respectful  reception  during his visit. The foreign minister also extended his  invitation to the New Zealand foreign minister to visit Thailand.</p>

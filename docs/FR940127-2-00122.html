The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to report the declaration of a dividend payable on January 20, 1994, to PTC's stockholders of record as of December 31, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated March 27, 1989, from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors''), PTC was prohibited from paying dividends to its stockholders. By letter dated June 9, 1992, from the Board of Governors, PTC was relieved of the restriction on the payment of dividends on the understanding that dividends, if declared, would be declared periodically by PTC's Board of Directors and paid at a rate not to exceed the 90-day United States Treasury bill rate in effect at the time the dividend is declared. By order dated January 15, 1993, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  the Commission approved PTC's practice of paying such dividends out of net profits subject to the limitations imposed by the Board of Governors and subject to the further requirements that (i) prior to using excess income from invested principal and interest (``P&amp;I'') to pay a dividend, PTC's Board of Directors be advised of any amount related to the investment of P&amp;I which has not been rebated and is part of the net profits used to declare the dividend, and affirmatively approve the application of such excess P&amp;I income for the dividend, and (ii) PTC file a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act each time it declares a dividend. PTC paid its first dividend on January 18, 1993, in the amount of $.52 per share, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31746 (January 27, 1993), 58 FR 6319. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At its meeting of December 21, 1993, PTC's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $.525 per share, payable on January 20, 1994, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 1993. This dividend rate does not exceed the 90-day United States Treasury bill rate in effect on December 21, 1993 (3.11%, as published in The Wall Street Journal on December 21, 1993). The dividend does not include any excess income attributable to investments of P&amp;I as all such P&amp;I related income with respect to fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 will be rebated to participants, pro rata, based on the amount of P&amp;I disbursements to each participant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issuance of a dividend under these circumstances advances the requirements of fair representation of shareholders and participants under Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act in that it provides an incentive for participants to invest in PTC shares, and is also consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable fees and other charges among participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

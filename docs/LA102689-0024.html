			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT . . . : STEPS FOR BAKING AT HIGH ALTITUDE  </P> <P> Question: I live in a home at 6,000 feet elevation and am having trouble baking  a cake. I like making my cake from scratch, but when I bake it, it always rises  nicely and then sinks in the middle. What do you suggest I do?  </P> <P> Answer: The following information about high-altitude cake baking comes from  "Joy of Cooking" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1986) by Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer  Becker:  </P> <P> "Cake batters at high altitudes are subject to pixie-like variations that often  defy general rules. Read the comments and then launch forth on your own,  keeping records at first until you know what gives you the greatest success. On  the whole, cupcakes and layer cakes are better textured than loaf cakes.  </P> <P> "Up to 3000 feet, if you reduce the air in the cakes by not overbeating eggs,  you will probably need no adjustment of the cake formula. Also raise the baking  temperature about 25 degrees. In elevations higher than 3000 feet, continue to  underbeat the eggs as compared to sea level consistency. Another way to reduce  their volume is to keep the eggs refrigerated until almost ready to use.  </P> <P> "At around 5000 feet, it will also help to reduce the double-acting baking  powder or baking soda by 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon for each teaspoon called for in  the recipe. Decrease sugar one to two tablespoons for each cup called for and  increase liquid two to three tablespoons for each cup indicated. Raise the  baking temperature about 25 degrees.  </P> <P> "At 7000 feet, decrease double-acting baking powder and baking soda by 1/4  teaspoon for every teaspoon called for. Decrease sugar by two to three  tablespoons for each cup indicated and increase liquid by three to four  tablespoons for each cup in the recipe. Increase the flour one tablespoon for  each cup called for. Raise the baking temperature about 25 degrees.  </P> <P> "At 10,000 feet, decrease the double-acting baking powder or baking soda by  one-quarter to one-half teaspoon for every teaspoon called for in the recipe,  and add an extra egg, but do not overbeat the eggs. Decrease the sugar two to  three tablespoons for each cup in the recipe. Increase the liquid by three to  four tablespoons for each cup liquid indicated. Increase the flour by one to  two tablespoons for each cup called for. Increase the baking temperature about  25 degrees."  </P> <P> The book goes on to say "whatever formula you use, grease your baking pans well  and dust them with flour or line them with parchment paper. For, at high  altitudes, cakes have a tendency to stick to the pan. Fill cake pans only half  full of batter, as high-altitude cakes may overflow."  </P> <P> Perhaps this will help you, as well as others who live or vacation at high  altitudes. You might also check bookstores in those areas for cookbooks that  address the subject.  </P></p>

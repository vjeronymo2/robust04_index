			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Delta debt rating may be downgraded MOODY'S, one of the largest US rating agencies, said yesterday it was considering downgrading the debt ratings of Delta Air Lines, one of the three US 'mega-carriers', writes Nikki Tait in New York. Its review was prompted by 'the outlook for continued losses in the intermediate term'. Last year, Delta bought the east coast shuttle and transatlantic routes owned and operated by Pan Am. The benefit from last November's acquisition of Pan Am's European routes 'have fallen short of Moody's expectations, and Delta's domestic business has reflected weak conditions in the US'. Mr Donald Carty, executive vice-president of American Airlines, says a deal to inject CDollars 200m-CDollars 250m into Canadian Airlines International should be finalised within 30 to 45 days, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. But American might not necessarily end up with 25 per cent of CAIL's voting equity, he said, and the deal might lead to American forging links with several other airlines. 'Such alliances are primarily concerned with administration and computerised booking systems, where tremendous economies of scale are possible,' Mr Carty said after a service club speech. Under the alliance CAIL and American would also co-ordinate flights and develop strong cross-border connections to improve the Canada-US service. CAIL is insisting on an investment by American, either in equity or other securities.</p>

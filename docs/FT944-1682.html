			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce in BMW supply deal Rolls-Royce Motors, Vickers' luxury cars subsidiary, will this morning announce an agreement under which BMW of Germany will supply components and technology to help cut the cost to Rolls-Royce of producing its next generation of models. Rolls-Royce last night declined to give details of what has been agreed after nearly a year of negotiations with BMW and Mercedes. However, it is understood that BMW will supply Rolls-Royce with one of the most fundamental of its needs - a modern V12 engine to replace Rolls-Royce's V8 power unit. Mercedes and BMW produce these units and have been anxious to supply them to Rolls-Royce because of the increased economies of scale. Neither Mercedes nor BMW produce more than 10,000 of these engines a year. Rolls-Royce's current annual car output is below 2,000 as a result of recession in some of its main markets; but production in the past has exceeded 3,000 a year. With BMW's help, Rolls-Royce plans to introduce new saloon cars and broaden its model range, including the launch of a coupe codenamed Java. There has been persistent media speculation of a 'race' between Mercedes and BMW to become Rolls-Royce's long-term partner, with joint car development and a possible equity stake - or even outright purchase - touted as the intended outcome. However Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive, has said that the company is seeking only components and technical collaboration and that there is no reason why Rolls would not seek similar deals with other potential suppliers, including Mercedes. BMW, which bought the UK's Rover group at the beginning of this year, already has a relationship with Rolls-Royce because it supplies several electronic systems, and, through Rover, body panels. Exploratory talks with Vickers two years ago about the possible purchase of Rolls-Royce were discontinued and Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, has recently stated that Rolls-Royce is not for sale in the foreseeable future.</p>

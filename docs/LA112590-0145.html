			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: TRITONS EDGE CHRISTIAN HERITAGE  </P> <P> Senior guard Tim Rapp scored 28 points, and Tom Shawcroft added 15 Saturday  night to help UC San Diego edge Christian Heritage, 74-72, in the championship  game of the UCSD Triton Tip-Off Tournament.  </P> <P> The Tritons' victory, their second two-point decision in as many nights, was  safe after the Hawks' Vernaldo Butler missed a three-point attempt at the  buzzer. Butler led all scorers with 35 points.  </P> <P> Rapp, Shawcroft and Butler were joined on the all-tournament team by UCSD's  Gordon McNeill and Christian Heritage's Jeff Martin.  </P> <P> In the consolation game, Occidental defeated Christ College Irvine, 97-82.  </P> <P> Point Loma Nazarene defeated Cal State San Bernardino in a nonconference game  at Point Loma, 114-99. Donnie Buettner led the Crusaders with 25 points and 16  rebounds, while Mark Bulgin had 24 points and Rusty Fallin 18. PLNC led 58-41  at halftime and improved to 2-1, while CSUSB dropped to 1-3.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Forward Anja Bordt scored 27 points to lead St. Mary's to an 83-68 victory over  San Diego State in the championship of the St. Mary's Invitational in Moraga.  St. Mary's (2-0) jumped out to a 46-23 lead at halftime and never looked back.  SDSU (1-1) was led by center Kieishsha Garnes, who had a game-high 30 points.  Garnes and Melanie Usher (10 points) were named to the all-tournament team.  Bordt was the tournament's most valuable player.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State defeated Notre Dame, 15-3, 15-5, 15-11, to finish third in the  Whataburger Classic in Austin, Tex. Penn State, which defeated the Aztecs  Friday, won the championship, downing Texas, 15-11, 15-10, 15-2.  </P> <P> With the victory, SDSU Coach Rudy Suwara believes the Aztecs will receive an  at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Aztecs, which finished the regular  season 23-11 and ranked 19th in the nation, should find out for sure tonight.  </P> <P> "We're confident we'll get a bid," Suwara said. "If we'd have lost to Notre  Dame, we would have been frightened."  </P> <P> Against Notre Dame, which finished 9-27, SDSU's Angela Martin had nine kills  and three service aces and Gracie Schutt added eight kills and five aces.  Schutt was named to the all-tournament team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JUNIOR GOLF  </P> <P> Travis Williams of Carlsbad lost in the match-play quarterfinals of the Rolex  Tournament in Tucson. Chris Stutts of Leoma, Tenn., defeated Williams 2-up over  the par-72, 7,038-yard La Paloma Country Club Course. Earlier in the day,  Williams defeated Trevor Arts of Flower Mound, Tex., 4 and 2 in the  championship flight first round.  </P></p>

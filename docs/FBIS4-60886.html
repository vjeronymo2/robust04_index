			<p>BFN     [Text] The Republican Party (RP), having signed the Civic  Accord Pact, believes that it gives the country a chance at  evolutionary development, one RP leader Vladimir Lysenko who is  also in the Yavlinskiy-led alliance said on Friday. He stressed  that any refusal to sign the document would have led to the RP's  political isolation and fall into the camp of the hardline  opposition.    Lysenko said that only two out of RP's eight-member council  voted against signing the Pact. They are Vyacheslav  Shostokovskiy and Igor Yakovenko of the Yavlinskiy-led alliance.    Asked if the RP decision was likely to split the Yavlinsky  alliance, which refused to sign the document, Lysenko warned  against dramatizing the situation adding that he himself would  stay put as its member.    The decision not to sign the Civic Accord Pact was made by  alliance leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy while other members  including Vladimir Lukin and Viktor Sheynis had warned against  rejecting it, Lysenko said.    One other RP leader Stepan Sulakshin who recently defected  from the Russia's Choice Party said he had had differences with  its leader Yegor Gaydar because of his dogmatic reform policy  "which inevitably leads to violence." On his immediate plans,  Sulakshin said he did not contemplate joining any faction or  group for the time being and that "time will alone tell what  happens next."    In the meantime, one other member of the RP council and  Yavlinskiy-led faction Igor Yakovenko has accused Lysenko of  reneging on the alliance's position.    In an interview with Interfax, he said Lysenko should have  given up the mandate he won running on the alliance's ticket  before signing the Pact.    "Lysenko who was defeated as an independent owes his mandate  to the Yavlinskiy-led alliance. By reneging on the faction's  platform, he has in fact cheated the electorate," Yakovenko  said. He said the question of party infighting and its stand on  the Civic Accord Pact would be discussed at a party congress in  June.</p>

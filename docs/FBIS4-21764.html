			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, Egypt, March 27 (AFP) -- Four gunmen believed  to be Islamic militants shot dead a suspected police informer on  Sunday at his shop in the troubled town of Asyut in southern  Egypt, security officials said.    'Abd-al-Hafiz 'Abd-al-Na'im, 35, died on the way to  hospital.    The officials said the outlawed Moslem fundamentalist  organisation al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) suspected  'Abd-al-Na'im of informing police about its operations.    'Abd-al-Na'im's death raised to 53 the number of civilians  killed since Islamic militants launched their violent  anti-government campaign two years ago. The campaign has  claimed a total of more than 300 lives.</p>

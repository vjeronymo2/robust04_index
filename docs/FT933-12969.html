			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German rate puzzle EUROPEAN markets were yesterday awash with speculation about German interest rate cuts, as the Bundesbank offered few clear signals either way, writes Stephanie Flanders. On Monday, many in European money markets were preparing for lower German rates, claiming that the Bundesbank's two-day currency pact led the way for a lower fixed repo rate in this week's tender round. But yesterday the German central bank announced a variable rate repo tender, not the clear signal of future rate cuts which optimists had anticipated. Analysts are divided as to whether German interest rates will fall before the Bundesbank's summer recess. Arguing against are those listening to rumours that German M3 growth in June, to be released some time this week, will have been higher than the 6.6 per cent which most forecasters predicted. Yesterday morning there were unsubstantiated claims that it would be closer to 7 or even 7.5 per cent, which would make it more difficult for the German central bank to lower rates at next week's council meeting. Dealers, who continue to anticipate a German rate cut, claim that the current, relatively high, level of reserves among German banks will ensure that a lower repo rate emerges from this morning's tender: perhaps 7.20 per cent, down from last week's 7.28 per cent. This, they claim, would not rule out an official rate reduction next week. Renewed ERM worries took French money market rates back up to the higher levels of last week. French three-month money ended at around 7.68 per cent on the bid side, up nearly 40 basis points from Monday's bid of 7.30 per cent. In London money markets, analysts reported a general return to economic fundamen-tals in the pricing of UK instruments. This, they said, was driving the rise of ster-ling, but would only translate fully into domestic money markets until the outcome of tomorrow's Maastricht vote in the House of Commons is known. At the short end of sterling markets, overnight money traded at 5 3/8 per cent for most of the day, and closed at much the same level. The Bank of England more than met a Pounds 1.55bn shortage in technical operations in the morning and afternoon.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EFFORT TO BOLSTER IMAGE;  </P> <P> NATIONAL UNIVERSITY NAMES NEW PRESIDENT  </P> <P> National University trustees, eager to bolster the school's position in the  academic community, have named a seasoned East Coast educator to take the reins  of the 11-campus institution.  </P> <P> Jerry C. Lee, former president of a prominent university for the deaf, was  selected from among a field of more than 100 to lead National University.  </P> <P> Lee succeeds the school's founder and first president, David Chigos, who  resigned last year amid problems over accreditation at the 17-year-old  university, which serves mostly working adults.  </P> <P> "He has a rare combination of managerial skills and academic background which  fits National's needs perfectly," said Donald L. Fagan, chairman of the  trustees. "His experience in both business and higher education will be  particularly valuable to the university as we move into the future."  </P> <P> A one-time corporate executive with General Motors and other private firms, Lee  is perhaps best known for his long tenure at Gallaudet University, a school for  the deaf in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critical Juncture  </P> <P> He served at Gallaudet for nearly two decades, beginning as vice president for  administration and business before moving up to the presidency in 1984. His  resignation last year set in motion a series of events that prompted national  interest and headlines. Hearing-impaired students protested when they learned  that his successor, like Lee, was not deaf.  </P> <P> Lee, 47, assumes National University's top spot at a critical juncture in the  school's history, as it struggles with financial problems caused by rapid  growth during the mid-1980s and a nagging reputation as an academic  lightweight.  </P> <P> In December, school leaders announced a major financial reorganization that  included issuing bonds and selling the Vista campus, which was leased back as  part of the deal.  </P> <P> The university was recently given a reprieve by the Western Assn. of Schools  and Colleges, which put National on a yearlong probation and threatened to yank  its academic accreditation, maintaining that the school's rapid growth was  undermining the quality of its classes.  </P> <P> "We're hoping we can put some of this to rest," said Peter Casey, a university  spokesman. "We feel it's pretty good news that National has been able to  attract someone of the caliber of Jerry Lee."  </P></p>

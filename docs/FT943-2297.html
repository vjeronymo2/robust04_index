			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Political chaos theory Chaos theory is fundamental to an understanding of science, and chic among economists and investment managers, but to learned students of politics like you and me it is old hat. We have always understood that a surprise may hit us in the face at any moment, that nobody knows what is going to happen, and that each event bounces off the other with a cumulative effect that on one equation is constructive, on another destructive. So be warned. We cannot be certain of the outcome of tomorrow's election in Denmark - although, if we are British, we may be envious of the choice of parties. Those of us who have mastered the finer intricacies of chaos theory know that when applied to politics, positive feedback does not always occur. Perhaps the most unexpected Danish politician of the post-1945 era was Mr Mogens Glistrup, who established his Progress Party in 1972 on the principle of cutting income tax. It briefly became the second largest party in the Folketing, their parliament. Unfortunately, it appeared that Mr Glistrup did not rely on the democratic process to reduce his bill. In 1983 he was sent to jail for three years for tax fraud. This was more than the beating of a butterfly's wing in Tokyo. It was world fame. A fat lot of good it did. Today Danes pay the highest share of national income in taxation of any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Chaos moves in mysterious ways. For example, Italy may have been hit by negative feedback. In April 1993, on a high turnout, four-fifths of the electorate signified approval of a change to the law on voting. The old, corrupt, party list system was cast aside. In future three-quarters of senators and deputies would be chosen by first-past-the-post and the rest elected on new, simon-pure party lists. Excitement ran high. Strong government would surely follow reform. A year later the first ballot held under the new rules produced a shaky coalition. Mr Silvio Berlusconi's hastily-established party, Forza Italia, promised change, but it has not yet delivered much. Italy's proponents of national renewal are understandably disappointed. Mr Berlusconi may be an admirer of Lady Thatcher, but he does not command the overwhelming, and stable, majority in Italy's parliament that the former prime minister enjoyed in Britain. Many other examples lie in the database, including the intervention of Mr Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election in the US and the unscripted victory of Mr John Major in the British contest of the same year. You will, however, have taken my point. So, I assume, will Mr Paddy Ashdown. The leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats can only keep his countenance as cheerful as he does by telling himself that one day something unexpected and positive will turn up. Then his party, created by him almost single-handedly out of the ashes of the Liberal and Social Democratic alliance, will have an assured role to play in national politics. To appreciate his predicament you need to step back a bit. The ancient and venerable Liberal party was virtually obliterated in the 1945 election that swept Labour to power in a landslide. In subsequent years, first under the then Mr Jo Grimond and later under the now written-out Mr Jeremy Thorpe, the lynchpin of Liberal strategy was the notion of the long march. Slowly, steadily, election by election, the party of Gladstone would regain its former glory. It may take a generation, or perhaps two, but that was the goal. A generation passed by. Little distance was gained. The footsloggers became dispirited. Under Mr David Steel's leadership a new strategy was adopted. Liberals were to be the pluralist party, willing to co-operate with others. If one of the two large parties would only be kind enough to introduce proportional representation, deals could be cut. This formula looked likely to become a winner when the alliance was high in the opinion polls in the mid-1980s. Alas, something, possibly a butterfly-wing, intervened. The alliance crashed. Mr Ashdown's initial task, when he surveyed the ruins in 1989, was clear. He had to rebuild. He has done so: the Lib-Dems are a long march ahead in local politics. As to national representation, they have half-a-dozen taxifuls of MPs and a position of strength in Scotland and the West Country. Unfortunately for them chaos has hit them on the head once more. The Labour party, which the Liberals, the Alliance and the Lib-Dems were supposed to overtake and replace, is remaking itself. Mr Ashdown knows he would not be credible if he preached a return to the long march. He must be aware that while pluralism works in hung local councils, a hung parliament is no more likely to follow the next general election than it did the last. That is why the current talk of whether the Lib-Dems will give their favours to Labour or the Tories, in return for no higher a payment than the rewriting of the British constitution, is a mere fancy. The expected outcome in 1996 or 1997 is a strong Labour victory; the second most likely is a repeat of the present parliament. Yet the statistically unexpected could happen. Labour, or its new leader, might turn out to be unmodernisable. The Lib-Dems would then gain a renewed meaning. Alternatively, Labour might win the most seats but not an overall majority. The people's party would then so depend on Lib-Dems support that it would be obliged to keep its promise to hold a referendum on proportional representation for the House of Commons. That could lead to an interesting twist up the chaos spiral. The Conservatives would oppose PR; Labour would be split, and Mr Ashdown might find himself fighting the referendum on his own. The outcome would be up to Chaos's sister, Fate. In two referendums in 1992 and 1993 New Zealand's voters rejected the advice of the main national parties and introduced the German combination of single-member and proportional elections. The strongest influence on voters was their dislike of mainstream national politicians. Whatever the latter asked for, they did not get. It makes you think. The presently available evidence suggests that Mr Ashdown's only secure future is to lie on the Labour leader's lap and wag his tail. But you never know. A thunderbolt may strike . . .</p>

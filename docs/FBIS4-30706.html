			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto and Australian Prime Minister  Paul Keating held two-hour private talks on bilateral ties and  APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] at Jakarta's Merdeka  Palace this morning. Minister-State Secreatary Murdiono briefed  reporters on the details of the meeting:    [Begin Murdiono recording] During the talks, the two leaders  exchanged views on various issues, including bilateral,  regional, and international events, as well as events related to  APEC after the grouping's meeting in Seattle last year. Several  points I can tell you are that the two leaders share the view  that ties between Indonesia and Australia have progressed  smoothly, while mutual understanding has also been enhanced  since the two leaders met some time ago. We all know that Prime  Minister Keating visited Indonesia a few months ago.    The two leaders also noted that bilateral trade ties have  steadily increased and that there are more frequent exchanges of  visits between the two countries' officials, both at the  national and regional level. The president pointed out that in  some Australian states, the Indonesian language has become the  second language taught in schools. The two leaders also believe  that relations between businessmen and private citizens should  be further intensified because, geographically speaking, the two  countries are indeed close neighbors which share similar views  and objectives for the future, namely boosting cooperation for  the progress of both countries.    The two leaders also discussed matters relating to APEC, as  well as the APEC leaders' meeting on Blake Island. They noted  that follow-up actions have been taken and these will be useful  for preparations to hold the second APEC summit meeting  scheduled in Indonesia in November. The Australian prime  minister also expressed his desire to extend his assistance to  make the upcoming APEC meeting successful. That is all I can  tell you; thank you for your attention.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (NA) -- Today, President  Carlos Menem stated "there is not all that much hurry" to debate  the pharmaceutical patents law, and he flatly rejected the  possibility that this would provoke "any type of friction" with  the U.S. Government, which is demanding quick approval of the  law.    "I have spoken with the ambassador (from the United States  in  our country, James Cheek) and he told me there is not that much  hurry on this topic," Menem said.    He also highlighted the fact that "the United States  understands that the delay in Congress is due to the need to  achieve a better law."    In remarks to the Buenos Aires radio station La 9.90, the  president again denied that the United States was applying  pressure to get the pharmaceutical patents law approved.</p>

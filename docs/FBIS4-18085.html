			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martinazzoli Quits"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Mino Martinazzoli today  tendered his resignation as secretary of the (ex-Christian  Democrat) People's Party with a letter to party chairman Rosa  Russo Jervolino. Jervolino will address a press conference at  1800 local (1600 GMT).    From initial reports, it appears that the party -- the bulk  of the once-dominant Christian Democrats -- will be led by a  collegial body coordinated by Jervolino.    Earlier this year, Martinazzoli's moderate line and  perceived  over-cautious approach to overhauling the party was contested by  the party's right wing, a small number of whom split to form the  neo-conservative Democratic Christian Centre (CCD), a Berlusconi  ally in the Freedom Front that is shortly expected to form a  government.    But the relatively poor showing of the People's Party and  the  success claimed by the CCD in garnering 44 seats in the general  elections was believed to have little to do with Martinazzoli's  decision. He did not stand in the election, and had for some  time intimated that after completing the party's transition he  would return full-time to his lawyer's practice in the northern  town of Brescia.</p>

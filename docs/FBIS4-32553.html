			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 26 Jun--The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  had registered lists with their candidates for councillors in  141 cities out of the total of 142 cities where proportional  representation elections were held; the alliance won in 75  cities, including four where it won the absolute majority. In  three cities it did not win a single seat, Jerzy Szmajdzinski,  the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SDRP] general  secretary, announced at a Sunday meeting of the party's Supreme  Council.    The SLD obtained an absolute majority in Sosnowiec,  Ostrowiec  Swietokrzyski, Walbrzych, and Wloclawek. In the remaining  cities, SLD participation in exercising power would require  talks and agreements. Talks are being held in a dozen or so  centers, among others, Plock and Jelenia Gora, Szmajdzinski said.    In his view, the alliance filled 27.2 percent of seats in  multiple-seat constituencies. Compared with parliamentary  elections, it had a worse result in 69 cities and a better one  in 29. In 23, there was no change. The largest drop in the  SLD's popularity was noted in Katowice Province.    Analysis of the results in single-seat constituencies is  still continuing. According to data available now, the alliance  has won an absolute majority in seven rural parishes. During  today's meeting, the SDRP Supreme Council will make an initial  analysis of the party associates' performances in the election  campaign.</p>

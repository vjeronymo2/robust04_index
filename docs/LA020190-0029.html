			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: INTAKE OF SOLUBLE FIBER IS IMPORTANT PART OF A PRUDENT,  LOW-FAT DIET  </P> <P> The precise role of oat bran as a variable in lowering blood cholesterol is now  a matter of public debate, but scientists have known for some time that soluble  fiber isn't the cornerstone of cholesterol-lowering therapy.  </P> <P> Research data has proven that soluble fiber intake, in general, and oat bran  intake, in particular, when combined with a low-fat diet can influence  cholesterol levels in the bloodstream. But consumers overlooked that connection  and instead sprinkled oat bran over everything from pretzels to beer as a  quick-fix solution to a more complicated problem.  </P> <P> The controversy stimulated by the recently released Harvard study, however, may  cause consumers to re-evaluate the placement of oat bran in the daily diet. At  least that's what health experts hope.  </P> <P> The Harvard study supports what dietitians and others have said all along: "Oat  bran is not a panacea . . . sprinkling it on cereals and other foods will not  provide an adequate supply of the body's total fiber needs."  </P> <P> What it does do, said one cholesterol expert, is prove that "You can't eat  whatever you want and eat oat bran and expect to lower your cholesterol that  much. It's best used as part of a prudent diet."  </P> <P> According to the evidence, there has always been a wide assortment of foods,  besides the much ballyhooed oat bran, and its recently touted cousin, rice  bran, that lower blood cholesterol.  </P> <P> Adding 1 1/2 cups of cooked dried beans to the diets of men with elevated blood  cholesterol has been shown to produce as much as a 19% decrease in serum  cholesterol; barley also has been shown to have an effect.  </P> <P> And, as recently as last week, a new study from the University of Florida  suggested that eating a grapefruit every day, along with other pectin-rich  foods, could have a potential cholesterol-reducing effect and thus reduce one's  risk for heart disease. In this trial, 15 grams of grapefruit pectin, which is  found just below the skin in the white interior peel, caused the blood  cholesterol level of the volunteers to decline about 8% -- without dietary  change.  </P> <P> According to Environmental Nutrition, a diet and health newsletter, a study of  five adults in Scotland demonstrated a 10% to 20% reduction in serum  cholesterol when seven ounces of carrots were added to the diet. One cup of  chopped cabbage or onions has a similar effect, the newsletter reported last  July. Psyllium, currently marketed as the laxative Metamucil, also has the  added benefit of lowering blood cholesterol, when given in regular daily doses.  </P> <P> But, none of these results is especially surprising to scientists, said Jo Ann  Hattner, clinical nutritionist, Department of Dietetics, Stanford University  Medical Center. She reports that when studying individuals with an elevated  blood cholesterol level, usually above 215 milligrams per deciliter, a 20%  decrease is to be expected when dietary regimens are followed.  </P> <P> It's more difficult to expect dramatic results when the individuals are healthy  to begin with, she said, as in the case of a Harvard study where the volunteers  were dietitians with healthy diets and an average blood cholesterol level of  186 milligrams per deciliter. The inclusion of oat bran, she explained, proves  most effective when the participants are hypercholesterolemics, people who  already have a high blood cholesterol level.  </P> <P> "One of the problems (with oat bran) has been that it was probably overused,  and overused in a way that was no longer medically beneficial," said Hattner.  "As a source of fiber in the diet it is just like any other source. . . .  People who were eating oat bran were not also lowering fat in their diet. They  were just adding oat bran.  </P> <P> "Clinically, the people who respond the best (to oat bran supplementation  therapy) are those with a higher blood cholesterol level -- at least 75% above  the acceptable cholesterol," she said, explaining that the body has a built-in  regulation system so that if a person already has a low cholesterol level it  probably won't be influenced much with diet.  </P> <P> She explained that dietitians have always focused on the total fiber content of  the diet and have encouraged consumers to select from a wide assortment of  fibrous foods, including grains, cereals, fruits and vegetables to meet the  recommended daily goal.  </P> <P> Ideally, she said, consumers should seek to include as much as 35 to 50 grams  of fiber each day, although 25 grams is a good beginning goal for those with  very low intakes. (The American Dietetic Assn. recommends intakes below 50  grams to avoid any adverse effects such as decreased mineral absorption.) And,  the Harvard study pointed out, anyone who makes a drastic change in the amount  of fiber they eat each day is likely to experience some gastrointestinal  discomfort.  </P> <P> "Obviously," Hattner said, "you have to find those sources that you do tolerate  and you have to start slowly. You can use bran as part of it but you need to  learn to ask for beans, lentils, whole grains and fruits." When increasing the  fiber content of the diet is it important to also include at least a quart of  fluids to prevent constipation.  </P> <P> But there are numerous other reasons to increase fiber in the diet. Lowering  cholesterol, Hattner said, "just happens to be one of them. It aids in  digestion, promotes feelings of fullness and, therefore, serves as a diet aid,  and it has a role in preventing colon cancer.  </P> <P> "As you increase your fiber (intake), you change the type of foods you eat and  you ultimately decrease the fats," she said, adding that ". . . fiber is one of  the most important components of the diet, but it's not ever a good idea to  single out just one source. Choose from a variety of sources."  </P> <P> Some other suggestions from Hattner: eat raw or slightly steamed vegetables;  select 100% whole grain cereals, then top with another high-fiber cereal;  choose whole grains breads; eat popcorn for snacks.  </P> <P> Here are some other ways of increasing total fiber in the diet from the  American Dietetic Assn. Have bean dip and salsa instead of a sour cream-based  dip. This will contribute two grams of fiber, compared with none for the creamy  dip. Eat green peas instead of green beans. This provides 7.7 grams fiber vs.  1.7, and whole-wheat toast with one-half pat butter and one teaspoon jam offers  about 3.2 grams fiber compared to white with one pat butter, at 0.8 grams.  </P> <P> Some sources of soluble fiber, the type that dissolves to form gel-like  substances during digestions, are oat products, legumes such as dried beans and  peas, barley and fruits such as apples, citrus, prunes and figs.  </P> <P> Water-insoluble fibers, those that cannot be broken down by the digestive  process and thus add bulk to the intestines, reducing risk of colon cancer,  include: whole grain breads and cereals, wheat bran and the skins of fruits and  vegetables.  </P> <P> Here is a list from the National Cancer Institute of some foods and the amount  of fiber they provide:  </P> <P>  -- Whole grain cereals: All Bran with extra fiber, 13 grams; Fiber One, 12  grams.  </P> <P>  -- Beans, peas and lentils, (one-half cup cooked): black-eyed peas, 12.4  grams; kidney beans, 5.8 grams; pinto beans, 5.3; split peas, 5.1; white beans,  five grams; lima beans, four; lentils two grams.  </P> <P>  -- Fruits: one medium pear, five grams; apple, 2.6 grams; medium banana, two  grams; one-half cup applesauce, two grams; one-half medium grapefruit, 1.7  grams; medium peach, 1.6 grams; small orange, 1.2 grams.  </P> <P>  -- Vegetables (one-half cup cooked): peas, 4.1 grams; corn 3.9 grams; medium  baked potato, 3.8 grams; zucchini 2.7 grams; carrots, 2.3 grams; collard  greens, 2.2 grams; green beans, 2.1 grams; broccoli, two grams; raw celery 1.3  grams; tomato and lettuce, less than one gram each.  </P> <P>  -- Whole grain breads and rice: one slice pumpernickel, 4.3 grams; one slice  whole wheat, 1.4 grams; one slice rye or enriched white, less than one gram.  </P> <P>  -- Flours (one-quarter cup): dark rye, four grams; whole wheat, 2.9 grams;  all-purpose white 1.1 grams; light rye, less than one gram.  </P> <P> BREAKFAST RICE PUDDING  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups instant rice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup frozen egg substitute, thawed  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups scalded low-fat milk  </P> <P> 1 cup small pitted prunes, halved  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/4 cup granola cereal  </P> <P> Prepare rice according to package directions for 4 servings, omitting butter.

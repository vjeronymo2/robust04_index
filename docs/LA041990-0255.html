			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG-TIME PLANS AND A SMALL-TIME BUDGET;  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL: LOYOLA COACH MIKE NORMAND GAVE UP $80,000 IN SALARY TO LEAD THE  LIONS TO THE TOP IN A CONFERENCE OF POWERHOUSE TEAMS.  </P> <P> Mike Normand, Loyola Marymount's volleyball coach, is always blunt. He calls  himself a straight-ahead guy who doesn't like the spotlight and hates the  publicity that often comes with success in coaching.  </P> <P> During an interview in his cubicle office at Loyola, he tried desperately to  focus on his team rather than himself. He leaned in a chair, clad in a white  tank top that revealed well-defined biceps and a pair of blue shorts that  exposed muscular legs, and said: "I'd rather you write something on my players  and not me."  </P> <P> Through the years, however, Normand's successful athletic and coaching career  has made it impossible for him to avoid the limelight. As a coach, the former  UCLA all-American outside hitter has triumphed at practically every level:  junior college, four-year university and age-group clubs.  </P> <P> Even now, in his second year at the helm of a small-time program in a big-time  league, Normand can't avoid recognition. Last year he led the Loyola men to  their best record ever (4-16) in the tough Western Intercollegiate Volleyball  Assn., and this season he topped that with the best mark in school history  (9-10) and a No. 8 national ranking.  </P> <P> Breaking into the top 10 was a difficult feat for little Loyola, since the  12-member WIVA includes powerhouses such as UCLA, USC and Hawaii. Most teams in  the league are fully funded, which means having five scholarships and a  full-time coach.  </P> <P> Loyola has neither. The Lions have only two full scholarships and a part-time  coach who took a huge pay cut because he believes that the program can be  turned around.  </P> <P> Normand left an assistant coaching position at UCLA and a teaching job at  Crozier Junior High in Inglewood to take over at Loyola.  </P> <P> "I gave up $80,000 of money to work for less than $20,000," Normand said.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old coach says Loyola has many obstacles to overcome before it can  be a contender in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. He hopes to change  that with the help of Athletic Director Brian Quinn, a strong supporter of  volleyball.  </P> <P> "In real life," Normand said, "to be successful at a Division I college in any  athletic event, the No. 1 thing you need is a good coach. The No. 2 thing is  that it has to be fully funded. Then you have to have the ability to get an  athlete into the school and keep the kid in school.  </P> <P> "Once you have all that, you can win it all, or at least you have a chance to  win it all. We've proven that in basketball. It's fully funded and we made it  to the Sweet 16. Same with baseball. It's fully funded and we're in the top  20."  </P> <P> Normand, whose budget won't spring for an assistant, says he'll do his best  with what he has. He's determined not to let insufficient funds get in the way  of success.  </P> <P> "I'll go out there and beat the bushes," he said, waving his index finger, "but  I'm going to win the NCAA."  </P> <P> For now, that sounds far-fetched, but Loyola seems to be headed in the right  direction. The much-improved Lions have defeated several higher-ranked teams  this season like crosstown rival Pepperdine, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, San  Diego State and Brigham Young University.  </P> <P> "He does a real good job," said Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy, who has led the  Waves to two national titles. "He's a real plus, and he's made a great impact  on the team over there. The kids look real strong and they look  well-conditioned."  </P> <P> Dunphy, who coached the U.S. men to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, played  at Pepperdine when Normand played at UCLA.  </P> <P> "He was real good in all skills as a player," Dunphy said. "I really respect  his volleyball knowledge. It's great."  </P> <P> Normand is also a great motivator, according to his players. Senior middle  blocker Chris Young says his intensity and competitiveness have played key  roles in the team's success.  </P> <P> "Basically he gives us confidence," Young said. "He teaches us great techniques  and to believe in ourselves. He makes us believe that no one in our league is  unbeatable."  </P> <P> Young says there's a big difference between former men's Coach Rich Rosales and  Normand.  </P> <P> "Mike is a lot more disciplined," Young said. "He sets his rules and you have  to follow them. It's all more structured now. We have a very rigorous  weightlifting and conditioning program. As a result, I feel much stronger this  season."  </P> <P> Normand also brought immediate success to the Loyola women's team. He led the  Lions to a 7-7 mark during his first season in 1989.  </P> <P> He won't coach the women next year, in order to dedicate more time to the men  and pursue an administrative position in Loyola's athletic department. Junior  setter Anita Irwin says he will be missed.  </P> <P> Irwin said Normand did wonders for the women's team, which posted a dismal 2-12  record in 1988 under former Coach George Yamashita.  </P> <P> "At first it took some adjusting," she said, "because he's a very demanding  coach, both physically and mentally. But that helped almost every aspect of my  game, from jumping to my stamina. He's a great coach and he knows the game so  well."  </P> <P> Normand says that's the result of more than two decades of training with the  game's finest.  </P> <P> His first two volleyball coaches, he says, had the most impact on him. The  first, Harlan Cohen, taught him skills, and the second, UCLA Coach Al Scates,  taught him mental toughness.  </P> <P> Cohen, an assistant under Scates at UCLA, introduced Normand to the game in  1967. Normand was a hotshot football, baseball and basketball player at Black  Fox Academy, an all-boys school in Los Angeles. Cohen figured the enthusiastic  young athlete would succeed in volleyball as well.  </P> <P> And Normand did. He was an immediate hit. He played for a Santa Monica club  under Cohen for two years before serving in the Army from 1969 to 1970. Then he  competed at UCLA, where he was an all-American in 1973 and 1974.  </P> <P> "Stormin' Normand" led the Bruins to the 1974 national championship against  favored UC Santa Barbara in front of a rowdy Santa Barbara crowd.  </P> <P> "Mike was our spiritual leader on the floor," Scates said. "He was our best  hitter, and he played a very emotional game. He's the reason we won that match.  His hitting was fantastic, and he had a tremendous vertical jump. He was very  strong and very quick."  </P> <P> Scates, who has led UCLA to 15 national titles in 27 years, says Normand got  his nickname because of his intensity.  </P> <P> "During that NCAA game in 1974," Scates said, laughing, "he got a wide set on  the left side and he put it away with his left hand against a 6-foot-5 star  blocker from UCSB. Then he ran around the perimeter of the court pointing to  his left bicep. He told the Santa Barbara crowd, 'Look what I can do to your  All-American with my left hand!' He always had lots of enthusiasm."  </P> <P> Normand believes that's what made him a good player. He says he never had  natural talent.  </P> <P> "I never felt I was a great player. I've just played with great players and  I've had great coaching. I was a mediocre player who trained and worked harder  than anyone else."  </P> <P> After UCLA, Normand played professionally for one year in a now-defunct men's  pro league. Then he won three open beach titles, one of them with Sinjin Smith,  arguably the world's best professional beach player and known today as "King of  the Beach."  </P> <P> "Sinjin won his first open with me in 1977," Normand said. "I remember it was  the Hermosa Open."  </P> <P> Normand still plays on the beach when he's not coaching or spending time with  his wife and two children in their Westchester home. Up until last year he  competed for Molten, an 18-and-over club in Carson that won several national  titles while Normand was on the team.  </P> <P> "He's a real competitor," said Catalino Ignacio, Molten's coach of 11 years.  "When he plays, he's a real winner. He's very aggressive and he really hates  losing."  </P></p>

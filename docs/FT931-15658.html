			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Road in City row is put on sale THE controversial scheme to redevelop the Mappin &amp; Webb site near the Bank of England has moved a step nearer after a decision by the Corporation of London to sell Bucklersbury, a road adjoining the site, Vanessa Houlder writes. The future of the road has attracted attention because of a dispute over its ownership and because of opposition to its closure, which is necessary for the proposed redevelopment of the site. The corporation's agreement in principle to the sale of Bucklersbury, likely to fetch around Pounds 300,000, may help it reach an early settlement in a dispute over the road's ownership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Robert Gallucci,  assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs,  says the United States hopes to resume working-level contacts  with North Korea in New York this week.    "We hope that this week we'll be able to get back to North  Korea -- almost certainly using the New York channel ... that we  conduct talks at either the office-director or deputy  assistant-secretary level," he said Tuesday.    Gallucci, who was recently named chairman of the senior  policy steering group on Korea, made the remarks at the  department's regular weekly press briefing upon returning from a  trip to South Korea, China and Japan.    "We have consulted our allies, particularly South Korea,  that  we'll be able to go back to North Korea with a proposal," he  said.    Gallucci declined to go into further detail about what the  United States and its allies would propose.    But he said the new offer looked very much like the Feb. 25  proposal in that it would contain similar elements.    One of these elements, of course, requires that North Korea  maintain the continuity of safeguards, Gallucci said.    Washington is prepared to hold a third round of high-level  talks with Pyongyang, he added.    Reiterating that the United States prefers a diplomatic  solution to the nuclear dispute, Gallucci noted that the "Team  Spirit" military exercise was suspended as "envisioned" in the  Feb. 25 agreement between the United States and North Korea.    "Inter-Korean dialogue could also be an element," he said.  "Advancing inter-Korean dialogue in some modality would also  figure in such an arrangement."    Gallucci said the United States and its allies were not  aiming to bring the North Korean nuclear issue back to the UN  Security Council.    "Our objective is to stay away from the security council,  get  on with negotiations, and settle this through a diplomatic route  and not have to go back to the security council," he said.    But if the director-general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) makes a report judged by the security  council to necessitate its further involvement, it will act  accordingly, he said.    "(and) if they (security council) .... take up the issue,  there is no doubt that there will be discussion about when and  if sanctions ought to be considered, and what kinds of sanctions  ought to be considered," he said.    He said the mere presence of IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon  nuclear complex when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at  the 5- megawatt reactor is insufficient.    Gallucci declined to make any further comments, however.  "I'm  not going to go very far down that road because that's a road  that really the IAEA has control of, as it ought to," he said.  "It will not be sufficent for the IAEA inspectors to be in North  Korea while this is happening.    "They (IAEA inspectors) are going to have more demanding  sets  of activities to be conducted if they are going to provide the  assurances with respect to the history and disposition of that  fuel that we expect of the agency," he said.    In any event, Gallucci said the United States would like to  see North Korea's nuclear program essentially frozen while "we  are engaged in these discussions."    "We would ask them to reconsider that step of refueling the  reactor," he said.    He added, however, this was not a precondition for  U.S.-North  Korean talks. "We just generally think that is not a step in the  right direction," he said.    Asked about the impression he had received from Chinese  leaders in Beijing on the North Korean problem, Gallucci said,  "they do not believe that the best route to a settlement of this  issue is through UN Security Council sanctions."    "We also agree that this is not the best route," he said.  "But it is for us the alternative if we can't find a diplomatic  solution and negotiate a settlement."</p>

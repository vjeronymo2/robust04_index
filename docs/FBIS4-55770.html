			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 18 (MTI) -- "The new parliament will  need a strong opposition so as to be able to the preserve  democratic achievements of the last four years," Prime Minister  Peter Boross, who is heading the Hungarian Democratic Forum"s  national election list, told an election forum in the west  Hungarian village of Gyor on Wednesday.    He warned that if the Socialists gain a supreme government  position in the parliamentary elections, living conditions will  not improve, against all promises. Boross said that those who  voted "left" in hope of a better life are set to face a bitter  surprise. In the years to come, less will be spent on research,  culture, sport and urban development, he presumed.</p>

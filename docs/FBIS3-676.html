Addressing the annual kwaZulu government prayer breakfast in  Durban, he said his opposition was principled and based on  honourable and democratic objectives. He warned there could not  be reconciliation unless the constitution was amended.    "If I am wrong in my constitutional analysis, or if I am  wrong that the 1993 constitution does not provide a framework  for the emergence of an open democracy, then I will feel greatly  honoured to change my views to help me help South Africa to  achieve a real democracy."    He warned: "I am prepared to go into the wilderness for  principles' sake, and I know that there are hundreds upon  hundreds of thousands of IFP grassroot members and supporters  who are prepared to die for the sake of the principled stand we  are taking."    He predicted unprecedented resistance ehould the  constitution  not be amended. The constitution, far from uniting South  Africa, "dramatically underlines the conflict between the IFP  and African National Congress [ANC]".    He added: "I challenge the election that might yet be held  under it. I say no to a constitution which is going to spawn  more violence than any constitution this country has ever had."    Ever more people were being killed in the constitutional  dispute and violence would continue to spiral as long as the  interim constitution was upheld. Mr Buthelezi said the final  constitution would "just be another constitutional instrument  for ANC party political power".    The IFP and kwaZulu government opposed the interim  constitution because it concentrated power in the hands of a  ruling political party and did not provide for the dynamic  interaction of the country's population and cultural groups in  an open working democracy.    "It does not recognise the dominance of pluralism in this  country, nor does it conform to any of the standards of  successful working constitutions in plural societies. Its  essential theme is centralism hidden behind cloaks of  regionalism or provincialism which just cannot bear proper  analytical scrutiny."    Mr Buthelezi said mediation in the constitutional crisis was  essential to clarify to confused South Africans the validity of  arguments for and against it.    The IFP's proposed constitutional amendments, which had to  be  met before it contested elections, were limited to what the  party regarded as essential for salvaging the interim  constitution from the "partisan hands" which shaped it. These  amendments were not aimed at political gain for the IFP, but at  reconciliation.</p>

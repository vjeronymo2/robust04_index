			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent L. Nikitin, including recorded </F> remarks by I. Mironov, economics minister of the Chuvash  Republic of the Russian Federation; from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] Chuvashia is trying to overcome the economic crisis  by relying on its own potential. Our correspondent reports:    [Nikitin] Chuvash Republic President Nikolay Fedorov has  signed an edict on additional measures to settle economic  relations in the Republic.    [Mironov] We are faced with two main tasks today. First, to  help republican goods producers to overcome their difficult  situation. The second task is of a more strategic nature; it is  to turn the Chuvash Republic into a major business, cultural,  economic, and financial center of the Volga region.    [Nikitin] The edict stipulates a lower tax rate applicable  to  banking. The republican authorities believe that the Chuvash  capital of Cheboksary will become one of Russia's major banking  centers. Goods producers should already be given assistance in  creating investment resources. Privileges are being introduced  by the edict with respect to some taxes, including the tax on  profits on enterprises engaged in production that are being set  up in the republic. They are exempt from this tax for three  years, which is quite a sufficient period for an enterprise to  establish itself and start production. After this, the  enterprise can fulfill its obligations to society and start  paying taxes. Thus, mutual interests will be satisfied.</p>

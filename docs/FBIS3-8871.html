The 350,000 signatures which, according to the Slovak  Constitution, are needed for the president to call a referendum  were not collected during a petition drive organized by the  HZDS, journalists were told by head of the President's Office  Jan Findra and Ladislav Orosz from the Office's legislative  department.    During the petition drive, which started in the last week of  February and lasted until March, 422,054 signatures on 21,000  petition sheets were collected and submitted to the President's  Office for checking.    A total of 695 sheets were found to be invalid during the  checking, Findra said, adding that out of the 399,212 signatures  on the remaining archs [as received] 38,000 signatures were  illegible and over 36,000 people did not put their first name or  shortened it. So only 324,321 signatures were recognized valid.  And after checking addresses of the people who signed the  petition a total of 232,957 valid signatures were left, which is  not enough for a referendum to be called.    Orosz said that the reason why the petition drive failed was  that it was the first time that a referendum had been organized  in Slovakia, its organization was not of the appropriate  standard and the pace of the collection of signatures was too  quick.</p>

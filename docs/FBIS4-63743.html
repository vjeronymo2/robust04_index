			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Galina Shkurenko] </F>   [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Government, held a news conference today regarding  the package of presidential decrees relating to economic issues.  They were published in today's newspaper. [Shkurenko] The  vice prime minister told representatives of the press how these  decrees were drawn. A week ago during a six-hour long  conversation between the president and the head of the cabinet  of ministers measures for stabilizing the economy and continuing  reforms were examined. Then the government drew up a package of  documents, which were discussed during Boris Yeltsin's meeting  with managers and Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting with  representatives of enterprises, banking, and economic structures  who were participating in the signing of the Public Accord  Treaty.    At the present time draft decrees are being drawn up  relating  to regulation of the consumption fund, improving banking  activity, on some issues regarding the regulation of the  securities' market, protecting of consumers from dishonest  advertising and on the sale of enterprises that are in debt.  Regarding the latter it will probably be signed literally today  or tomorrow.    Regarding the decrees that have already been signed by the  President, Shokhin said the following:    [Shokhin] I would like to draw your attention to the fact  that in this package of documents there are many openly liberal  premises connected with reducing taxes. We were pursuing two  aims simultaneously: to ease the tax burden while at the same  time enforcing tax discipline more strictly. No one can dispute  that this is a normal demand. As the enterprises begin to get  out of this situation, if they want to obey the law, bearing in  mind that the general policy of the government has been defined  here as that of reducing taxes, either they want to test how  firm the strict measures that are indicated in the decrees are,  and the future will show, and the experience of many countries  shows, that in conditions of sufficiently lenient taxes, they  pay much better than they evade tax, and we will gradually move  toward that. If enterprises will have many accounts and are  failing to provide information that they are not registering  their accounts at least, there can be no question of help for  those enterprises from the budget, of centralized investments.    The problem of abolishing quotas is in actual fact the  problem of stabilizing our export-orientated production  facilities. That mechanism allows us to stabilize the situation  in the oil and gas complex, metallurgy, cellulose, and paper  production. Many clauses in the decrees that came out yesterday  were already registered back in March, in particular. They were  even submitted to the State Duma.    On the other hand, a certain critical mass is needed not  only  in the number of decrees, but also in the number of clauses  contained in them to impart additional impulses to the reforms.  The critical mass, it seems, is present in that package of  decrees.</p>

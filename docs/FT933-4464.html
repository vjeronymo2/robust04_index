			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (18): More than just software tools - Exploiting the power of computers / What is RAD and why do we need it? Philip Manchester explains all RAPID Application Development (RAD) is the latest label to be attached to techniques for the creation of software for computer-based information processing systems. At the technology level, RAD is a new and quicker way to build software. But RAD is more than a set of tools to help software development. It is a combination of a new management approach to systems building, best practice in development methods and appropriate software tools. The move to RAD has been made possible by the convergence of technology advances in both hardware and software. Workstations and open client-server systems form the hardware base; graphics-based interfaces and object-oriented design provide new ways to build the software. The 1990s has seen a significant change in the way that applications software is built. Changes in infrastructural systems software such as operating systems and database management incorporate much more what once constituted an application. Complex software to handle graphical user interfaces, database management and communications increasingly forms part of the infrastructure - leaving application builders to concentrate on the business problem. At the same time, many companies need to build on existing - so-called 'legacy' systems - to give their users the advantages of advances such as graphical user interfaces. As a whole, RAD promises to make the development process easier by providing tools which can make use of existing data and systems without sacrificing quality and robustness of design. RAD techniques also reach deeper into the end-user community than previous methods of development. RAD demands more commitment from end users and requires their involvement in many stages of the development process. A significant part of RAD is the empowerment of users - to allow them to continue to evolve an application by building their own extensions to the original system. In simple terms, RAD is merely a quick way to build software. It has evolved historically from continuing efforts to make it easier to exploit the power of computers. Early programming languages such as Fortran and Cobol, the fourth generation languages which emerged in the 1980s and the more recent tools for computer-aided software engineering (CASE) all aimed to make it easier to build software applications. RAD is the latest manifestation of these efforts. The fast-changing market conditions of the 1990s mean that the information systems, which support a business and give it a competitive edge, must be able to adapt and change to meet new demands quickly. RAD offers the potential to do this. Earlier methods of development were too complex and too cumbersome. The success of RAD depends, however, as much on management will as it does on technology. One of the keys is to get the end user to take more responsibility - both in terms of defining the business goals of the application and in terms of controlling the technology which can deliver the solution. It is recognised that great gains can be made in productivity at the start of the application development process, if end users are brought together with information systems staff to discuss and agree what is the primary business goal of the new application. 'It has to be a partnership between users and IT staff,' says Ian Palmer, chairman of software consultancy James Martin &amp; Company. 'RAD must not be driven by technical people. You need a team drawn from both sides and the development must be managed and co-ordinated properly,' he adds. Other software developers are also taking this seriously. Leading software company Andersen Consulting, for example, uses intensive 'focus' groups to produce a rigorous system definition with users. Over a period of a few days, users and systems designers discuss the business goal, the technology needed to support it and the means of delivery. The end result is a detailed definition of the new application, how it can be implemented and what flexibility needs to be built in to cope with future needs. 'We interviewed a lot of companies about this and found that there were often contradictions in what people say when designing a system. The focus group aims to overcome this by forging a consensus. We have found it a much quicker way to get a real definition of the business objectives of the system,' explains Andersen Consulting partner Rob Baldock. He adds that the focus group approach achieves several important goals. It crystallises the application both in the minds of the users and the information systems professionals. It identifies training needs well in advance. And it specifies the infrastructural needs of the system in a long-term context. The essence of Andersen Consulting's view is that RAD takes place in a context and this must be fully understood before turning to the technology. If the business context is not understood, RAD becomes nothing more than a quick way to build the wrong system. 'In your haste to develop a new system you must not sacrifice flexibility,' says Baldock. Andersen Consulting's approach also recognises the importance of a flexible infrastructure for modern applications development. This can only work against a background of an efficient infrastructure. In the 1990s this infrastructure is based on some form of 'open' system, running on a network with a diverse collection of terminals, peripherals, communications servers and database stores. In hardware terms, the infrastructure can already be created from a set of components. This approach is also finding favour among software developers. The rapid rise of the object-oriented approach to software creation is a good example of this approach. It sees all information systems as a set of objects which behave in a predictable way. These software objects can be re-used by different applications. Many RAD specialists have identified that object-oriented development will make their job easier and the technology will play an increasing role in future applications. 'If you can combine business rules with object-oriented technology you have a good way to speed up development,' says Sam Jacobs of Trinzic International, a RAD software specialist. 'It means you can produce demonstration prototypes quickly and get high-level interest in a company early in the design phase'. Jacobs says that the market conditions of the 1990s means that the involvement of senior staff in IT decisions is essential so that applications are built to serve business goals. A RAD system in the 1990s must be able to provide the means to cope with an open, changing infrastructure which can keep pace with advances in hardware and software as well as changes in requirements from end users. RAD techniques point in the right direction. They offer systems designers the opportunity to concentrate on the building a flexible infrastructure and the provision of general services. These services can be harnessed by end users - through their desktop tools - to meet real business needs as they occur.</p>

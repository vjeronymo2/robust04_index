It has played an  important role in developing nongovernmental friendly contacts  and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries over  the past 40 years. He said: The 40 years the Chinese People's  Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries has traversed  were a period when it held high the banner of peace, friendship,  unity, and cooperation and marched continuously along the road  of human progress and social prosperity.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Abdellatif Filali, Moroccan </F> minister of state for foreign affairs and cooperation, by an  unidentified correspondent in Marrakech on 16 April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In a statement to Moroccan television today  Abdellatif Filali, the minister of state for foreign affairs and  cooperation, said that Morocco's stance vis-a-vis the  developments on the Saharan issue enjoyed international support.  He also said that the GATT conference opened new doors to  Morocco to extend the scope of its cooperation with various  developed countries. Here is the text of the interview.    [Correspondent] Mr. Abdellatif Filali, minister of state for  foreign affairs and cooperation: The GATT conference ended here  in Marrakech yesterday. You signed the agreement marking the  birth of the international trade organization on behalf of the  Moroccan delegation. First of all, what is your assessment of  the results of the conference?    [Filali] As stated by his majesty in his speech yesterday, I  believe that this was a very important international event.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Mentioning the European Union [EU], how do  you envision future relations between Morocco and the EU in the  trade and, particularly, the agricultural spheres?    [Filali] On this particular point I would like to remind the  Moroccan public, particularly those who have a specific  profession in this field or direct trade with European markets,  that within the scope of GATT there is an essential point,  namely Point 24 in the GATT agreement which stresses that the  regional agreements that hitherto exist will remain intact. By  that I mean that Morocco's privileges with the European  Community will not change. Therefore, let all Moroccans who  have close and well-established relations with Europe be rest  assured that there will be no change in that sphere. [passage  omitted].    [Correspondent] We shall set aside the GATT conference and  Moroccan-European relations and move to another question  concerning our national issue. What is the government's view  regarding the recent resolution passed by the UN Security  Council, Resolution 907?    [Filali] I believe that it is necessary to discuss  Resolution  809 before dealing with Resolution 907. In Resolution 809, the  Security Council gave the UN secretary general a new prerogative  in an attempt to bring about an agreement between the two sides  with regards to the criteria and implementation. The  negotiations were very tough, but finally we reached a positive  result with the secretary general and accepted his proposals  regarding the criteria and implementation. The Moroccan  agreement took place this year. Since then, the secretary  general personally, or his special envoy in the region, have  been repeatedly trying to convince the other side of the need to  get their endorsement of his proposal, namely compromise  solutions regarding the criteria and their implementation.  However, as stated in the secretary general's report, so far  Morocco has provided every facility in its dealings with the  secretary general and the general secretariat regarding the  proposal, but there are pending problems. By that I mean the  other side has so far not given a clear reply concerning the  secretary general's proposal.    Therefore, it is farcical when we hear many mercenaries  abroad saying that Morocco is responsible for the status quo;  and it is necessary that the Moroccan and also international  public opinion should be aware that the true culprit, who is  mentioned in Resolution 907, is the Polisario [Popular Front for  the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro]. In fact,  this resolution does not concern us greatly because we have  given our approval to the secretary general's reconciliation  proposal this year. Therefore, when the Security Council says  in this resolution that the voter identification commission is  now committed to register all the people in the referendum  lists, it means that from now until 30 June the Polisario has to  give its final reply. [passage omitted]    I believe that our stance is correct and enjoys official and  sensible international support. [passage omitted]  Responsibility for what is taking place in the region lies with  Polisario's stance and those who support its stance. This is  what can be said now. I believe that our public opinion in  Morocco is not confused about that because Morocco's position is  getting stronger daily. Everyone believes that what is taking  place in the international field is indicative that Polisario's  stances and statements have lost credibility. It is empty talk.  [passage omitted]</p>

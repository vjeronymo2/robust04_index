			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Russia has been trying to persuade the Arab  countries to evince flexibility and moderation in the peace  process with Israel. Political sources in Russia believe the  message President Boris Yeltsin sent last month to Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad prior to his summit with the U.S.  President in Geneva contributed to the moderation displayed by  the Syrian president.    Officials in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told an  Israeli Foreign Ministry delegation, which was in Moscow last  week to hold political talks, that they share the assessment  that the progress made in the Middle East peace process was  irreversible but hard to accelerate.    The Russians believe there has been a positive change in  al-Asad's positions, which was reflected in his statements in  Geneva, but would not say whether they thought al-Asad would  agree to a full normalization in relations with Israel in the  context of a peace settlement. Neither would they reveal the  contents of Yeltsin's message to al-Asad. [passage omitted]    The Israelis were impressed that the Middle East is  important  to Russia because of its proximity to its borders and the threat  of instability there. The Russians stressed their role as  cosponsors of the peace process alongside the Americans, and  came out in favor of upholding the format of the Madrid process.    The Russians are worried by Muslim fundamentalism and fear  it  might spread to the Central Asian republics and Muslim regions  in Russia. They agreed with the Israeli assessment that this  fundamentalism can hardly be curbed if the economic and social  situation in the Muslim countries does not improve.    The Israelis voiced their concern about the sale of Russian  arms to the Middle East. The Russians said the Arab countries  still owe them large sums of money for weapons supplied in the  past.    The bilateral agreements on cultural and economic  cooperation  whose signing has been held up for about a year were discussed  in the talks. The Russians are opposed to the Israeli demand to  note in the agreement that the joint committees will meet  alternately in Moscow and in Jerusalem, and argue that in their  capacity as cosponsors of the peace process they cannot sign an  agreement that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The Israeli officials believe a formula will soon be found to  settle the argument and proceed to sign the agreements.    In a meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last  weekend, Aleksandr Bovin, Russia's ambassador in Israel, noted  the need to accelerate the signing of the bilateral agreements.    The Foreign Ministry delegation went to Russia to exchange  views and assessments about the situation in the Middle East and  the CIS, in keeping with the cooperation agreement the two  ministries signed about a year ago. The Israeli delegation  consisted of Yo'el Sher, assistant director general in charge of  the Eastern Europe Department; Yo'av Biran, assistant director  general in charge of peace affairs; Uri Bar-Ner, assistant  director general in charge of the Cultural and Scientific  Department; Meron Gordon, director of the Eastern Europe 1  Division; and representatives of the Center for Political  Research and the Political Planning Department. The political  meetings were also attended by Hayim Bar-Lev, Israel's  ambassador in Moscow, Councillor Alex Ben-Tzvi, and other  embassy staffers.    The Israelis conferred with two deputies of the Russian  foreign minister, officials in the Middle East Department of the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; with Yegor Gaydar, a former  deputy prime minister and the current leader of the Reformist  Party; and with Yegor Lukin, chairman of the Russian  Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. The delegation also  toured academic research institutes dealing with the Middle East.    The Israeli Foreign Ministry gave a positive grade to the  visit, which reflected the openness and normalizations in  relations with Russia.</p>

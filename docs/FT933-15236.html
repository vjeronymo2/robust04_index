			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: US side behind rise at Gold Greenlees GOLD GREENLEES Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.32m for the year to April 30, in line with analysts' expectations and up 6 per cent on the previous Pounds 4.09m which was after exceptional items. Turnover increased 18 per cent to Pounds 275.4m (Pounds 234.1m). Operating profits were up by 13 per cent at Pounds 5.84m (Pounds 5.16m) and the final dividend is 5p on capital increased by the April rights issue, making an unchanged total of 8.3p for the year. The group benefited from the beginning of the end of the recession in the US; GGT's US agencies last year accounted for some 60 per cent of the group's profits, up by about 10 per cent on the previous year. Gross profit from US subsidiaries was up by 21 per cent in dollar terms. The group's Pounds 14.7m rights issue was 92.4 per cent taken up, and its joint venture with the GGK network of continental European advertising agencies last month will give it greater clout in pitching for pan-European accounts, according to Mr Mike Greenlees, GGT's chairman. Mr Greenlees said the current year had started well for the group, with the Nationwide Building Society's Pounds 15m advertising account being one of its significant wins. Earnings were down 5 per cent at 15.63p (16.49p), which the group said was due to an unusually low tax charge in 1992. Net profits were static at Pounds 3.21m. The group now has a net cash balance of about Pounds 5m. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m for the current year.</p>

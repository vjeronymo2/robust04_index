			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff correspondent Zhang Zhibin (1728 1807 </F> 2430) and staff reporter Fang Jiangshan (2455 3068 1472): "One  High, One Even: Wages Trend in `93"]    [Text] Although prices increased at a rather high rate in  1993, it seemed that the people's livelihood was not affected  too seriously, because workers wages increased at a higher rate  than the rate of price increases. It was learned from the  authoritative state departments that, in 1993, total wages of  workers amounted to some 477 billion yuan, up by 83.1 billion  yuan or 21.1 percent. The average worker's wage was 3,236 yuan,  up by 525 yuan or 19.4 percent over the previous year. By  reviewing the basic trend of wages last year, we found the basic  characteristic of "one high, one even" in wage increases last  year.  <H5>  Reasons for "One High, One Even" </H5>   "One high" refers to the high rate of increase for wages  compared with previous years. Compared with 1992 and 1991, wage  increases in 1993 were 3.5 and 10.1 percentage points higher  respectively. The comparatively high rate of increase was  mainly caused by economic growth and price increases. In 1993,  the national economy continued to grow at a rather high speed,  and a lot of enterprises issued more bonuses to workers or  raised wages. In addition, the general price level, especially  for goods closely related to people's daily lives, rose  substantially. In order to ensure that the people's living  conditions would not be worsened, many localities increased  price subsidies. According to calculations, economic growth  contributed to over 50 percent of the additional wages, and  price increases contributed to over 30 percent of the additional  wages.    "One even" refers to the even monthly rate of wage  increases.  From the beginning of the year to the end, the rate of increase  of workers' total wages always stood at around 20 percent, and  there was little variation from one month to the other. The  difference between the highest rate of increase, which was in  November, and the rate in December was only 2.9 percentage  points. These stable and even rates of increase over the whole  year have rarely been seen in recent years. This situation was  caused, first, by the fact that economic development during the  "off season" in 1993 did not slow down, and a rather high growth  rate was maintained from the beginning of the year. Second,  self-control mechanisms for wage increases in enterprises are  being built up gradually, and many institutions paid attention  to reserve certain funds when business is good to meet their  needs in periods when business is less satisfactory. This  prevents wage increases from being affected by seasonal changes  in business results.  <H5>  Analysis of the Results of Wage Changes </H5>   By analyzing the results of the wage changes in 1993, we may  find the following facts:    --As compared with the economic growth situation, wage  increases remained in a normal condition. With the price factor  deducted, total actual wages increased by 4.8 percent in 1993,  and this was lower than the growth rate in domestic production,  which was 13 percent (according to comparable prices);  meanwhile, the average rate of increase in real wage income was  3.4 percent, and this was lower than the increase in social  productivity, which was 10.9 percent.    --The gap between the wage income of workers in different  types of economic entities widened. The average wage of workers  in state- owned economic units was 3,441 yuan, an increase of  19.6 percent; for workers in urban collective units it was 2,436  yuan, an increase of 15.5 percent; and for workers in other  types of economic units it was 5,215 yuan, an increase of 31.5  percent. Among various types of economic units, wage income in  collective units increased at the lowest rate, wages in various  types of the mixed economy increased fastest, and those in  state-owned units were in the middle. The ratio of average  wages in collective units to state-owned units to all types of  joint ventures widened from 1:1.37:1.88 in 1992 to 1:1.41:2.14  in 1993.    --The average wage income of workers in production  enterprises increased faster than in nonprofit-making social  institutions and administrative institutions. According to  statistics, the average wage income of workers in enterprises  was close to 3,566 yuan, and increased by 21.7 percent over  1992; the average wage income of workers in nonprofit-making  social institutions was 3,173 yuan, and increased by 15.6  percent; and the average wage income of workers in  administrative institutions was 3,092 yuan, and increased by  only 11.1 percent. The rate of increase in wage income in  enterprises was respectively 6.1 percentage points and 10.6  percentage points higher than in nonprofit-making social  institutions and administrative institutions. Income gaps  between workers in these three types of institutions widened  further. Substantial differences also existed in the wage  incomes of enterprise workers in different trades and localities  as the economic results of the enterprises varied greatly. In  particular, the wage income of workers in enterprises which were  forced to partly or fully suspend operations was even lower.    --There were substantial differences in rates of wage  increases in different areas. As economic development in the  southeastern coastal area was fast and attained a high level,  the rate of increase in wages there was much higher than in the  interior areas. According to November's statistics, total wages  in the coastal areas mostly increased at a rate above 25  percent; in particular, rates of increase in Jiangsu and  Guangdong were above 30 percent. However, almost all of the  interior provinces recorded growth rates of less than 20  percent, and the rate in Shaanxi was only 10.9 percent. Because  there are a large number of large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises in the three northeastern provinces, the rate of  wage increases was rather low there, and they were all below 20  percent, and the rate in Heilongjiang was only 9.1 percent. In  areas where the economy grew fast and wages also increased fast,  substantial differences also existed in the actual rate of wage  income increases from one district to another.  <H5>  Main Problems With Current Wage Changes </H5>   As the self-control mechanism in enterprises to adjust wage  increases was not perfect enough, the economic efficiency of  wage expenditure is not high enough at present, and this is the  most prominent problem in the current situation in wage changes.  It is known that many enterprises continue to issue bonuses  while operating in the red. Some enterprises even continue to  promote workers to higher grades when their operations have been  suspended partly or completely and when they find it hard to  issue wages normally. In many enterprises, the purpose of  adopting a universal labor contract system and  post-and-skill-related wage system is to increase wages. Most  enterprises hope that they can pay more wages to their workers  but few people care about the economic efficiency of wage  expenditure.    Some experts in this field hope that the state authorities  will relax controls over total wage expenditure in enterprises  in an orderly way and will allow market forces to adjust wage  increases in enterprises. Through the  "wage--costs--prices--demand" mechanism, the issuance of wages  will be linked with the survival of enterprises, and the problem  will thus be better resolved.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Support rallies on Channel 4 funding Mr Jeremy Isaacs, founding chief executive of Channel 4, has launched a campaign to overturn the channel's controversial funding formula, Raymond Snoddy writes. Campaigners say the effect of a formula intended by the 1990 Broadcasting Act to protect Channel 4's remit to innovate 'is that a minority channel subsidises the shareholders of the ITV companies to the tune of some Pounds 50m a year'. The campaign has the backing of Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, who as trade and industry secretary shared cabinet responsibility for the 1990 act. Others backing the campaign, launched in a letter to The Times, include Mr David Abbott, chairman of advertising agency Abbott Mead Vickers, and Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of food retailer Argyll. The letter says: 'Channel 4 now pays more to ITV than it can invest in drama and film combined. This cannot have been parliament's intention.' It would not be unfair to make the change now, the former Channel 4 chief executive says, because by early next year the ITV companies will have collectively received Pounds 100m. This is 'all they estimated to get from Channel 4 over the full period of their licences'.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Berlusconi supporters rally Tens of thousands of supporters of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, took to the streets of Italy's largest cities over the weekend, as anti-corruption magistrates kept up the pressure on his business associates. The rallies, co-ordinated by 'clubs' of Forza Italia, the political movement founded by Mr Berlusconi, were prompted by Milan magistrates' decision two weeks ago to invite Mr Berlusconi in for questioning about alleged bribery of tax police by his Fininvest business empire. Yesterday, Mr Jas Gawronski, the prime minister's spokesman, said Mr Berlusconi would be unable to meet the magistrates before December 13 because of international commitments. The rallies came alongside voting yesterday in the second round of mayoral elections. It appeared last night, according to results reported on state television, that Forza Italia had been punished for its uncomfortable alliance with the Northern League, the most volatile partner in the right-wing government coalition. Centre-left opposition candidates won races in four out of six big towns. In the most closely watched contest, at Brescia in the north, Mr Mino Martinazzoli, backed by the Popular party and ex-communist PDS, won 56.5 per cent of votes against the 43.5 per cent cast for the League's Mr Vito Gnutti, the industry minister.</p>

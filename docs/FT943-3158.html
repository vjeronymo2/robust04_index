			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / T&amp;N obtains option to control Kolbenschmidt T&amp;N, the UK automotive components and engineering group, last night agreed to acquire an option to buy a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a leading German motor components producer. The complex deal, which would give T&amp;N a dominant position in the German market for some key engine components, must be approved by the German cartel authorities. Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and engineering group, is to sell its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt. Magna International, the Canadian automotive components group, is to reduce its stake in Kolbenschmidt from 12.5 to 2.5 per cent. As a first step, Commerzbank is to take over a 24.99 per cent holding in Kolben-schmidt, and German institutional investors will take over 32 per cent. Metallgesellschaft said the deal meant its disposal programme was almost complete. T&amp;N has acquired an option on the Commerzbank-held shares and on a stake of 25.01 per cent to be held by the institutions. The option must be exercised by March 31 1995. T&amp;N could take the remaining 2.5 per cent still held by Magna, giving it an option to acquire a total stake of 52.5 per cent. The deal could cost T&amp;N almost DM300m (Pounds 123.9m). Last year T&amp;N bought German-based Goetze, Europe's largest producer of piston rings. Kolbenschmidt had sales of DM1.59bn in 1992-93. Magna results, Page 27</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Uruguay Round deal awaits new US administration: David Dodwell on some misplaced optimism surrounding the conclusion of the world trade talks TAKE with a pinch of salt whatever President George Bush and Mr John Major said in Washington at the weekend about finishing within the first two weeks of January the six-year Uruguay Round of talks aimed at reducing barriers to international trade. There was a stronger sense of realism in Geneva when the statement was released. Most European Community negotiators had returned to Brussels, the head of the US mission had taken his son to the circus, and Mr Balkrishan Zutchi, India's respected ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, commented: 'It's not possible for President Bush to conclude this. We have to wait and see what the Clinton administration proposes.' The most patient response to the Washington initiative came from a senior EC official: 'It was an honest attempt to achieve a conclusion. If it were just up to the US and the EC, then it might just be possible. But Bush and Major have wholly under-estimated the resistance of the multilateral system, which calls for backing from another 106 countries.' Even Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of Gatt, under whose wing the Uruguay Round negotiations have progressed, complained of the critical time lost since the US and the EC settled their long-standing dispute over reform of farm trade in Washington early in December. 'There is still a tremendous amount of technical work to be done,' he said this week. The Bush and Major statement had its roots in the tokenism that Group of Seven leaders have so often shown over the past three years. Note the G7 summit resolution of Houston in 1990. It said: 'We stress our determination to take the difficult decisions necessary to achieve far-reaching, substantial results in all areas of the Uruguay Round by the end of this year. 'We intend to maintain a high level of personal involvement and to exercise the political leadership necessary to ensure the successful outcome of these negotiations.' However, one senior US trade official in Geneva commented: 'I don't see what changes in circumstances are possible between now and the new year to make a settlement possible. It is not the negotiators who are creating the blockages, but the instructions from politicians back home.' The US-EC breakthrough on reform of farm trade, which consumed the first 11 months of this year, without doubt triggered some progress. There have been three weeks of intensive activity in Geneva as countries involved in the Uruguay Round negotiated an array of tariff cuts, concessions to open up trade in services, and new protection for patents and copyright. But amid all of this technical work, disagreements have emerged which can doubtless be resolved, but which will take time and the sort of political commitment that leaders such as Mr Bush can no longer provide. The most critical of these are: US calls for amendment of the proposed anti-dumping rules, essentially giving the US more flexible recourse to bilateral sanctions if multilateral dumping rules fail to deliver 'fair' trade. A US challenge to the Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO), the umbrella organisation that would supersede the Gatt, and would embrace the new areas of trade subject to international rules. The US administration is concerned the MTO would compromise important sovereign powers. EC demands that any agreement on trade in audio-visual services should exempt 'cultural programmes' from unfettered international competition. Audio-visual services are the US's second most important export, and any talk of exemptions triggers angry responses. Other services are sensitive, including financial services (where concessions are being demanded from Japan, South Korea, and the six Asean countries in south-east Asia) and maritime services (where the US is dragging its heels). Developing countries are unhappy about the speed at which markets are to be opened up to free trade in textiles (too slowly), and are to provide patent protection in drugs and agricultural chemicals (too quickly). Tariff cuts remain contentious, with the US pressing for a number of sectors to have tariffs cut to zero, and the EC preferring to tackle sectors where tariffs are particularly high. Pressure is on Japan and South Korea to open their markets up to rice imports, albeit behind high initial tariff walls. Negotiators in Geneva believed firmly this week that these issues could be resolved, though it was open to question within what time frame. As Mr Zutchi noted: 'I am assuming that there is too much on the table that is worth preserving for the Clinton administration to want to lose it. But if their agenda is completely different, then talks could go on for several years.' He, like so many others, is waiting for Clinton.</p>

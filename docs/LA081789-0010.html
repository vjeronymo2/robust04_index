			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  BACK TO BASICS: HOW TO CUT STEAKS FROM WHOLE TURKEY BREASTS  </P> <P> Turkey breast slices are thin, boneless fillets, sometimes referred to as  steaks or cutlets. They are all white meat, cut across the grain of the turkey  breast.  </P> <P> In a recent price check of several local supermarkets, turkey breast slices  ranged from $4.29 to $5.39 per pound, while whole turkey breasts were $1.69 to  $3.99 a pound. Despite the weight of bone in the whole breasts, that still  amounts to a major price difference.  </P> <P> To economize, or if and when turkey breast slices are not available at the  market, you may cut them yourself from a fresh, thawed or partially thawed  whole turkey breast. The savings are even greater when you consider that turkey  breast slices are an excellent substitute for far more expensive veal cutlets.  </P> <P> Begin by placing the turkey breast on a cutting board with the small end  pointing away from you. Using a large sharp knife, cut through the center of  the breast (Step 1), down along one side of the keel bone.  </P> <P> Set that half of the breast aside. Then cut down the other side of the keel  bone (Step 2) to release the second breast half.  </P> <P> Remove the skin from the breast halves by running the point of the knife  between the flesh and skin (Step 3). Also cut off any excess fat.  </P> <P> Slice the breast meat across the grain into half-inch to one-inch slices for  steaks, 1/8-inch to 3/8-inch slices for cutlets (Step 4). Use as directed in a  recipe, saute or pound thinner and prepare as scaloppine, piccata or  Parmigiana.  </P></p>

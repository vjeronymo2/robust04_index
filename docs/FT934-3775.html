			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (7): A long way from Rio de Janeiro - Europe's energy tax, flagship of its green policies, is on the rocks The European Union's proposed carbon and energy tax, rightly or wrongly seen as the flagship in Europe's environmental convoy, has run aground, and is not about to be refloated. The tax was originally due to have started this year at Dollars 3 per barrel of oil equivalent, rising to Dollars 10 a barrel by the year 2000. It is intended to help the EU meet its pledge to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the end of the century, under the Twelve's commitment to the Rio de Janeiro Climate Change Convention. In 1990, the EU emitted 2,738m tonnes of CO. Brussels projects that if nothing is done, emissions will rise some 12-13 per cent by the end of the century. The tax was designed to complement other measures to cut greenhouse gases, principally the SAVE (Specific Actions for Vigorous Energy Efficiency) programme and the energy conservation programmes of the individual member states. But an EU-wide energy tax is a radical departure, and the plan quickly monopolised the energies and attention given not only to the EU's fight against global warming, but a good deal of the rest of European environmental policy too. The EU was in the vanguard internationally when it made its emissions stabilisation pledge three years ago. But it has now fallen well behind, with the tax portion of the emissions strategy mired in controversy for the past 18 months. There remains a danger that the EU will not be able to ratify the Rio Convention by the end of this year. And even if the Twelve do ratify, there are doubts that they can deliver the projected CO cuts. The SAVE programme, designed to deliver one third of the cuts through a new range of standards to improve energy efficiency in buildings, vehicles and appliances, has been emasculated. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the European Association for the Conservation of Energy, says 'it looks doubtful if even one quarter of that target will ever be met'. The national reduction targets, circulated by the European Commission this spring, look almost as dubious. Totted up, they indicate that total EU emissions would not stabilise but rise by over 4 per cent, or some 110m tonnes. But that is if these individual targets are met, and there is not enough evidence to suggest that programmes have been put in place to ensure they are. Consequently, attention has increasingly focused on the energy tax, on which the Twelve are divided. A German-led coalition of six member states (which includes Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium), insists the emissions target cannot be reached without an EU-wide tax. The four poorest member states (Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece) back the principle but in practice want undertakings that introducing the tax will not hold back their efforts to catch up with average levels of EU development. Their energy consumption is below average EU efficiency, but their relative backwardness at the same time means they emit less per capita; they want the burden of the target shared out among the Twelve so that in nominal terms they can emit more if they phase in the tax. France also claims to back the tax in principle, but as the EU's largest user of nuclear-generated electricity, takes the view that it would be unfairly hamstrung by the application of the tax to what it regards as a clean fuel which does not contribute to global warming. As currently designed, the tax falls on all non-renewable sources of energy. Lastly and most importantly, the UK, which in the year after the tax was formally proposed in May 1992 had been deliberately ambiguous, has now come out firmly against it. In a May 27 memorandum, Sir John Cope, the British paymaster-general, definitively ruled out an EU tax, and invited 'those member states who wished to do so to introduce a tax which is compatible with the single market'. This October, Mr Tim Yeo, the UK's junior environment minister, told Britain's partners that 'we are not willing to accept (an energy tax) imposed by the Community'. He acknowledged, however, that this was not the end of the battle. 'This is an issue which is not going to go away.' The Danish presidency of the EU, in the first half of this year, and the current Belgian presidency, have strained hard to advance the proposal. But since the EU has no taxation powers, unanimity is required, and Britain's objection amounts to a veto. The UK maintains that its decision at the budget to impose value added tax on domestic gas and electricity obviates the need for an EU tax. In fact, this step merely brings the UK into line with VAT on fuel among its partners. The furore in the UK over VAT on fuel was certainly a disincentive to any further tax on energy, but as Mr Yeo's words suggest, Britain objects to the very principle of the EU being able to levy a tax, even if it is supposed to be fiscally neutral and applies in what is clearly an area for pan-European co-operation. The debate between Britain and its partners has frequently been acrimonious. In June, Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, claimed he had defeated an ambush intended to force Britain into accepting that a tax was a precondition for ratifying Rio. Although in April, energy and environment ministers from the 11 agreed on the principle of a tax, this overstated the degree of real consensus. In October, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, produced detailed plans on 'burden-sharing', which would allow the poorest four member states to phase in the tax. But he himself acknowledges that this served to smoke out the extent of France's concerns, while not yet convincing the four. In the most recent twist, the Belgian presidency is pushing as a possible alternative the harmonisation upwards of excise duties on fuel. The Commission is looking at the idea, but is not prepared - at least yet - to withdraw the tax proposal to make way for it. Expectations now are that the Twelve will individually ratify Rio, and that the fight for measures to comply with it will go on. Although the pro-tax faction maintains that overall there will be no net new costs to industry from the measure, most still feel they could lose competitive edge to their partners if they introduce carbon/energy taxes unilaterally. Greece takes over the EU presidency in January, bringing little expectation that a way out of the emissions impasse can be attempted until Germany succeeds it in the second half of next year.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Costa Rica seeks EU banana compromise Costa Rica has asked the European Commission to make three important changes to its proposed banana import regime in an effort to break the deadlock in a row between Latin American producers and the European Union. A compromise plan offering Latin producers greater access to the European banana market was rejected last month after Costa Rica and Guatemala raised objections. A condition for accepting the Commission's offer of an import ceiling of 2.1m tonnes of fruit would be for the Latin Americans to drop their complaint about the EU's banana regime to Gatt. Costa Rica has asked the Commission to make the new import ceiling take effect this year rather than early next. The Costa Ricans also called on the EU to abolish tariffs whereby importers pay Ecu100 (Pounds 79) per tonne for deliveries within the ceiling and to remove the licensing system. The tariff and licensing systems are ways of guaranteeing a market in the EU for higher-cost bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries under Lome Convention obligations. The UK and France would almost certainly raise objections to abolition of the licensing system. Costa Rica's acceptance of the import plan is crucial as the Commission has already said it would be prepared to leave Guatemala, which represents only 1.5 per cent of the EU market, out of a final deal. Latin American producers meet in Panama tomorrow to consider a proposal from Guatemala calling on the Commission to raise the import ceiling but remove individual country quotas, and reduce tariffs, with the receipts going as aid to ACP countries. But it also calls for the abolition of the licensing system. The Commission has left its offer to the Latin Americans open until February 11 which is the date for circulating a Gatt report on the banana regime - condemning Lome arrangements - to all Gatt members. If Guatemala were left out of the final agreement, it could still press ahead with the Gatt complaint, but it would not have the force of the other four producers. Ecuador, which is the largest exporter of bananas to the EU, is unhappy with the new regime. But it is not a member of Gatt and does not have the power of the other producers.</p>

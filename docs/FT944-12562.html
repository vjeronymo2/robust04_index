			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: Railroaded Running a company during a heated takeover battle sure is stressful. It seems to have taken a particularly tough toll on Drew Lewis, chairman of Union Pacific, battling to win control of rival US railroad operator Santa Fe Pacific. On Sunday, after raising its bid for Santa Fe to Dollars 3.8bn to top Burlington Northern's rival offer of Dollars 3.2bn, Union Pacific announced that Lewis, a former transportation secretary in the Reagan administration, is taking a leave of four to six weeks to enter an alcohol-treatment programme. Will this affect the outcome of the bid struggle? Union Pacific will clearly miss him; no fewer than three senior executives are taking on Lewis's duties in his absence.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minister warns of Caspian oil risk Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, has warned international oil companies that investment in the huge oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea is fraught with risk. In an interview in the Petroleum Argus newsletter, he says that 'because so far there is no legal division of the Caspian (between Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, which all border it). . . I would advise you at the least, be careful'. Mr Shafranik refers to a letter sent by the Russian foreign ministry to the British Embassy in February, with special reference to a treaty signed between Azerbaijan and the UK regulating talks on a deal to exploit the large oil reserves off Baku, the Azeri capital. The talks have been going on for over three years between successive Azeri governments and a consortium of major oil companies led by BP. The letter says that the Caspian is 'an object of joint use, within whose boundaries all issues of activities, including resource development, have to be resolved with the participation of all the Caspian countries. . . any steps by whatever Caspian state, aimed at acquiring any kind of advantages with regard to the areas and resources of the Caspian Sea, run counter to the interests of the other Caspian states and cannot be recognised'. None of the companies involved has made any direct comments on the situation. But most appear to accept that Russian involvement in Caspian projects would be acceptable as long as it did not undermine the commercial viability of projects. The minister says that the investment climate for western oil companies has improved with the adoption of new laws. An agreement to prospect for oil on the Sakhalin shelf will be signed this month, he says, and 'a whole series of agreements will follow'.</p>

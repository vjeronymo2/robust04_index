			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/5/1994 -- Several cooperation  agreements were signed on Monday [16 May] between Romania and  Peru occasioned by the visit paid by Romanian Prime Minister  Nicolae Vacaroiu, currently on a Latin American tour.    Viewed by Premier Vacaroiu as the most significant, the  agreement on trade and economic cooperation (signed by Minister  of Trade Cristian Ionescu, on behalf of Romania, and by Liliana  Canale, the Peruvian minister of industries, tourism,  integration and international trade negotiations) stipulates the  principles for trade operations based on market economy rules.    The Romanian premier and his Peruvian counterpart Efrain  Goldenberg, who is also Peru's foreign minister, sealed an  agreement for investment mutual guarantee and protection.    The third document -- the collaboration agreement between  the  National Agricultural University "La Molina" in Peru and the  Bucharest Agricultural University -- was signed by Education  Minister Liviu Maior on Romania's behalf and by Jose Dance  Caballero, rector of the Peruvian institution.    Also sealed were two understandings by an exchange of  letters  signed by the two countries' foreign ministers, one setting up a  mechanism of consultation between the two ministers, and another  for free diplomatic, special and service visas.    Before the signing ceremony, Romanian Premier Nicolae  Vacaroiu and his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg (whose  parents are Bessarabian natives), had an interview during which  stress was laid on "the extremely fine ties" between Romania and  Peru.    Also on Monday, another agreement was signed by Aurel  Ghibutiu, president of Romania's Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, with the leadership of the National Confederation of  Private Employers Institutions, which stipulates the setting up  of a collaboration committee and envisages Peruvian economic  missions to Romania.</p>

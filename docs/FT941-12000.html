			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: MIM details its plans for Musto investment MIM, the Australian metals group which is competing with Canada's Metall Mining for the Bajo de la Alumbrera project in north-west Argentina, yesterday released further details of its agreement with International Musto Explorations, the small Canadian group whose main asset is the rich Argentine copper-gold deposit. MIM said that, of its proposed USDollars 130m payment to Musto for a50 per cent interest in the project, Dollars 10m represents repayment of Musto's investment in to date. The remainding Dollars 120m would cover Musto's half-share of the costs of putting the mine into production. Total development costs are put at Dollars 600m, but about Dollars 360m is expected to come from project finance. The deal between MIM and Musto comes on the heels of a hostile CDollars 232m(USDollars 175m) bid by Metall Mining, the international arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, for Musto. This, however, is conditional on Musto not signing a legally-binding joint venture agreement to dispose of a substantial part of its 100 per cent interest in Alumbrera.</p>

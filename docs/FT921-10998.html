			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / BAe chairman struggles to find a successor SIR GRAHAM DAY, the interim chairman of British Aerospace, is engaged in an increasingly difficult search for a full-time successor after his favoured candidate, Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds and Reuters, turned down the post. Sir Christopher was first asked whether he was interested in the job shortly after Professor Sir Roland Smith was forced out as chairman last September. Sir Christopher, who is increasingly absorbed by his chairmanship of Reuters, the financial information services group, has told Sir Graham that he is not interested in the job. His decision is a severe setback for BAe as his stature and track record would have been welcomed by the City and the company's industrial partners. In the 1980s he oversaw the rationalisation of Courtaulds' sprawling chemicals and textiles empire, and its eventual demerger into two companies  -Courtaulds, a speciality chemicals producer, and Courtaulds Textiles. Many City fund managers and analysts believe that similar radical surgery is required at BAe. BAe's senior management has been increasingly beleaguered since the autumn when a profits warning was followed by a mishandled emergency rights issue. The company's standing with City institutions fell further last month when the company was forced to disclose that Mr Dudley Eustace, its finance director, would be leaving the company in the spring. Sir Graham is still hoping to announce the appointment of a new full-time chairman and a replacement finance director around the time of the company's annual meeting in late April or early May. City analysts and fund managers would prefer a chairman with a sound commercial and industrial background rather than an aerospace specialist. Many feel an outsider would have a clearer picture of BAe's strengths and weaknesses. After Sir Christopher's rejection, attention is likely to focus on Sir James Blyth, a non-executive director of BAe and chairman of Boots, the chemists. Sir James, a former senior executive with Plessey, the electronics group, is well qualified for the post. However, he turned down the job in the autumn and it is thought he wants to stay with Boots. Another candidate thought to have been mooted by headhunters working for BAe is Mr Chris Lewinton, the chairman and chief executive of TI, the engineering group. Mr Lewinton is highly regarded in the City for the transformation of TI since 1986 from a diversified engineering group, heavily dependent upon the UK, into an international company focused on three main product areas.

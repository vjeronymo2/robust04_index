			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Massacre in Nagorno-Karabakh A family weep in Agdam, Azerbaijan, yesterday, embracing the coffin of one of the victims killed in Nagorno-Karabakh. More than 200 bodies have been recovered from the massacre. The armed conflict yesterday prompted Azeri parliamentarians to demand the resignation of their president, as they sought an outlet for their anger at recent battlefield setbacks, Reuter reports from Baku. Outside the parliament, thousands of demonstrators pushed through police cordons to bang on the building's windows. They accused President Ayaz Mutalibov of doing nothing to help Azeri fighters in their campaign against Armenia. 'Resign, resign,' chanted the crowd. One window pane was smashed. Many demonstrators lost relatives when Armenian forces seized a village in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

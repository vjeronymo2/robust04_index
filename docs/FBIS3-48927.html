			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Czech Economy Minister Karel Dyba: "What Will </F> the 1994 Bring in the Czech Economy"]    [Text] If we consider the year 1991 to be the beginning of  the real transformation of the Czech economy, in January 1994  the Czech Republic will enter the fourth year of the  transformation period.    The economic policy for 1994 continues with the successful  economic policy of the previous years. Of course, however, it  adds some new, growth-promoting accents (cf. highway  construction, housing policy, etc.). In 1994, the maintenance  of a balanced budget remains the objective, while the tax burden  should be relieved. The government policy of a balanced budget  helps the Czech National Bank, whose task it is to protect the  stability of the koruna.    Economic growth emerges from this background, as a new  objective for the government that is fully compatible with the  maintenance of the macroeconomic stability.    1994 is the first year in which we can say that all the  corner stones have been laid, and we should witness the  completion and finishing touchs to something that already exists  rather than some new pivotal events. This is the fundamental  information for the economic sphere, for the dependable  calculability of investment decisions.    I believe that inflation will not exceed 10 percent in 1994.  That is implied by the long-term trend of the development of the  month-to-month inflation, which, if we disregard the one-time  price shocks in 1991 to 1993, hovers within the 0.5 to 1.0  percent limits. It remains a question, however, whether the  Czech National Bank should not be more flexible and pump more  money into the economy. I believe that this approach would be  compatible with the protection of the stability of the price  levels and the rate of the koruna. At the same time, it would  support the growth tendencies on the already sufficiently  transformed supply side of the economy.    The gradual liberalization of prices should continue in  1994,  rationed with consideration to the ability of economically weak  households to bear the price moves. Another price  liberalization (for instance, rents, transport tariffs, etc.) is  considered in the context of the completion of the system of  social subsidies. The price liberalization must not be  cumulated so as to bring about useless financial expectations.    The balanced budget is one of the reasons why the government  has managed to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate of the  koruna. With respect to the development in the volume of foreign  currency reserves, I consider this policy a good one also for  the coming year, and do not expect any substantial shift in the  nominal exchange rate of the koruna.    Because of the relatively high level of inflation in the  Czech Republic (in comparison with our West European trade  partners), the stability of the nominal exchange rate of our  currency means a gradual strengthening of the competition for  our domestic producers thanks to imports growing relatively  cheaper. That is good for the consumer, and the producers have  to adjust.    The government has sometimes been reproached that it does  not  adequately deal with the structural policy. I believe that we  want no such policy in the sense of the selection by the  government bureaucracy of the victors and the vanquished. On  the contrary, it is possible that the government would  facilitate the process of the necessary structural changes by  general measures such as supporting the retraining of employees  or -- when necessary -- by selective interventions of the type  of the restructuring of Skoda Plzen [company]. The condition is  always that the interested entities, i.e., particularly the  enterprises and banks, share the costs.    It would be too soon to expect in 1994 a substantial  recovery  in the advanced market economies, and this will reflect  negatively on the possibilities of Czech exports. Our  manufacturers marked an exceptional success in export  performance in 1993. The pace of growth of exports reached  double-digit values at a time when competition on the world  markets increased because of the economic recession.  Nevertheless, I believe that, under the present economic  conditions, even a deficit trade balance would be compatible  with the external balance, given a surplus trade in services and  a continuing flow of investments from abroad. One has to bear  in mind that if the trade balance shows a deficit because of a  high share of machines and equipment in the overall imports (40  percent in 1993), it will be favorably reflected in the growth  of the gross domestic product in the next period and in  long-term exports.    Although the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic  fluctuates substantially from region to region, on average and  on a long-term basis, it belongs to the lowest in Europe. This  fact has its positive side (from the point of social peace) but  also a negative one (from the point of economic effectiveness).  Anyway, a certain growth is to be expected in the unemployment  rate in 1994. That is, above all, because of the  rationalization brought about by the progress of privatization,  but also as a result of the effect of the law on bankruptcy and  settlement. Under no circumstances, however, would I expect any  dramatic shifts in the unemployment rate. I am not even calling  for bankruptcies. I believe that in the instance of  bankruptcies, we bear witness to the process of learning while  working. Wherever a bankruptcy is the best solution to the bad  situation of the enterprise, sooner or later it will come to it.  I would really like it though, if the courts worked better in  the bankruptcy proceedings and that the court decisions were  more easily executable.    The small-scale privatization is practically completed, the  large-scale one will continue in 1994, among other things,  through the second wave of coupon privatization. A further  dynamic development can be expected on the capital market, which  has been operating smoothly for almost a year both at the Prague  Exchange and within the framework of the RM-system.  <H3>  The share of the private sector in the economy will continue  to grow. </H3>   The volume of both direct and portfolio investments from  abroad will also grow. The growth of foreign investments  together with foreign loans (both state and private) will  result, in 1994, in a further increase in foreign currency  reserves. The ability of the economy to produce a sufficient  volume of foreign currency is a prerequisite for introducing the  regime of full convertibility of the koruna, which has become a  topic of specific talks in banking circles.    If, in closing, I were to briefly summarize my expectations  regarding the economic development in the Czech Republic in  1994, I would say the following: The economic transformation is  moving in the right direction. In this respect, the Czech  Republic belongs to the best among the postcommunist countries.  This fact should become even more apparent in the next year  that it has been so far. I do not expect any dramatic jumps,  internal or external, which could threaten our economic  development.    Of course, we must not underestimate the fact that 50  percent  of our gross national product is produced for export. The  merciless struggle for the place in the sun will continue on the  world markets next year. The managers, whose performance is not  up to par, should realize this fact. If they do not realize it  in time, I hope that the enterprise owners will replace them  soon.    Overgrown bureaucracy, tying up enterprise with numerous  superfluous regulations, could also become a threat to healthy  economic development next year. Let us learn from the negative  experience of others, including the European Union countries.    A healthy economic development can only take place under the  conditions of social peace. On the other hand, the healthy  economic development itself creates conditions for maintaining  the social peace. The diversification of income is a desirable  driving force of the economic growth. The economic growth,  however, opens the path to a higher living standard, also for  those whose wages grow the slowest. The future prosperity is in  our hands.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium institute projects no permanent cuts in capacity NO PERMANENT cuts in primary aluminium production capacity are planned by producers despite present low prices and market turmoil caused by imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, according to the latest projections by members of the International Primary Aluminium Institute. These show forecast capacity in 1996 virtually unchanged from today's in every region except Africa. There Alusaf in South Africa plans a Pounds 940m smelter expansion, adding 460,000 tonnes to its present 170,000 tonnes of annual capacity. The Alusaf project will help African capacity almost double from 657,000 tonnes to 1.2m tonnes by 1996. According to the IPAI, total western world capacity will rise by 4 per cent to 16.7m tonnes Projected mid-1996 capacity in other regions is: North America 6.425m tonnes (6.424m tonnes in 1993); Latin America 2.07m tonnes (2.023m) East and South Asia 1.766m tonnes (1.736m); Europe 3.553m tonnes (3.506m) and Oceania 1.664m tonnes (same). Russian output of primary aluminium was 98 per cent of last year's levels in the first seven months of 1993, but nickel production fell to 80 per cent of year-ago levels, according to new government data, reports Reuter from Moscow. Statistics released by the government press service showed that July primary aluminium production was 100.3 per cent of levels in July 1992. July nickel production was 71.4 per cent of year-ago levels. Data on tonnages was not given.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures made further progress and in late, screen-based trading the FT-SE 100 March contract climbed back above the 3,100 level, writes Jeffrey Brown. Activity remained nominal, with the March contract notching up just 2,939 lots during pit trading and only slightly topping 6,500 when screen trading finally came to an end. At the official close, the March contract stood at 3,093, up eight points, taking its advance over the past four sessions to 100 points. The premium to the cash market was 28 points, or five points above fair value. Traders said the market had just about given up for the year. In contrast, stock options provided an abundance of features, with a number of big volumes showing through as December options expired, and Glaxo and HSBC (both January options) meeting with some heavy, genuine two-way business. Spurred by position-closing and rollovers as December options came to an end, British Gas, Barclays and Abbey National were the three most active options. British Gas clocked up 4,225 lots. Among January options, Glaxo saw 2,803 and HSBC 1,002. Total volume was 41,589 - up from 29,443 on Tuesday - with calls accounting for 24,752 and puts 16,837. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume was almost 28,000 lots.</p>

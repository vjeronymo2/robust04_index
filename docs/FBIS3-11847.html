			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party </F> presidential candidate]    [Text] Dear Editor:    A short time ago, the president referred to the discussion  of  alternatives for managing the income from the Cusiana reserves  as "the debate of the decade." I think the term is appropriate,  and I agree with EL TIEMPO on the need for the presidential  candidates to take a stand on this issue, which, in the coming  years, will have an impact on the Colombian economy exceeded by  few other issues.    In my case it is easy, because when I prepared the economic  program that I have submitted to Colombians for their  consideration, I examined the matter carefully, from the point  of view of its implications for the balance of payments and the  budget, and of course its social ramifications. Since I have  decided not to make any promises I am not capable of fulfilling  for the country, in preparing the social investment and  infrastructure programs we were especially careful to  incorporate a realistic projection of tax revenues, which would  not have been possible without expressly considering the  strategy for managing Cusiana revenues.    This is a complex issue, and it would be absurd to try to  cover all of it in a commentary of reasonable length. But  Colombians know that in this, as in all matters, the crux is  that the person who aspires to set the course of the country in  the future must have mental clarity and the ability to put  together top-flight technical teams. There are a few points that  I would like to emphasize regarding Cusiana at this initial  juncture.    Above all, Colombia's economy is already of a size that the  additional revenues that can be expected from an oil boom like  Cusiana are shocking only to those whose natural tendency is to  see a problem behind every solution. The total net  foreign-exchange income from Cusiana will depend a great deal on  the volatile price of petroleum, but it is unlikely that the  figure will exceed $3.5 billion a year in 1997. By that time, if  Colombians decide in 1994 to stay the course set by President  Gaviria's government, we will have a country with an annual  production of about $75 billion, and with annual two-way trade  amounting to some $25 billion per year.    Although in that case Cusiana will not be too big for the  country, the income from the exploitation of our subsoil will  provide us with a magnificent opportunity to accelerate our  growth even further and to make the final leap toward  development, toward a much more just society than the one we  have now. Obviously, that will require careful management,  especially in terms of the quantity and quality of public  spending by the nation and by the territorial entities. There  are examples of many countries that regressed and even collapsed  because of a mismanaged oil boom.    I know that many Colombians are concerned about the  possibility that, as a result of the abundance of dollars  flowing in from the sale of Cusiana oil, there will be a huge  revaluation of the peso that will make the situation intolerable  for exporters and for those who compete with imports. Few  people, however, are yet aware that this unfortunate outcome  would be almost certain in an economy more closed than the  current one, which is what some candidates are still dreaming of.    To be sure, Cusiana will increase our supply of dollars, but  the schemes some have put forth to "safeguard" or freeze the  funds would make sense only as very temporary mechanisms. A  country like Colombia that has so many needs and so many great  possibilities should aspire to have a president who will take  the lead and make sure that these additional resources will be  used properly in his administration; not a president who, like  the negligent and wicked slave in Matthew's parable, would  merely bury in a vault the talents that the Lord gave him.    Naturally, the economy has a limited absorptive capacity in  the short term, and any spending beyond that level would only  lead to inflation or wasted resources. For this reason, it is  not enough to try to invest these resources well; the great  challenge lies in modernizing the entities that are to carry out  the investments, developing efficient mechanisms such as  concessions for construction projects, and fighting corruption  head-on.    The only way that these resources can be used properly  without requiring us to give up other Colombian exports, out of  fear of a foreign-exchange bottleneck, is to implement a broad  program to stimulate private investment for agricultural and  industrial modernization, complemented by a realistic  infrastructure investment plan. This, of course, would include  the social infrastructure, represented by the great education  and potable water program that I have proposed to the country.    Andres Pastrana Arango Bogota</p>

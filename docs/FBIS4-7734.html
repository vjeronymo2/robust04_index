			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 3 (AFP) -- Former Albanian Prime  Minister Fatos Nano was sent to jail for 12 years Sunday [3  April] for embezzling about seven million dollars in Italian  humanitarian aid and forgery of official documents. Under  Albanian law, Nano faced a maximum 25-year prison term or  capital punishment.    Nano, 42, refused to make any statements or answer questions  during the trial which he said was political. Bashkim Zeneli,  spokesman for Nano's former communist Socialist Party, said the  sentence was "the most serious violation of democracy and  opposition rights in Albania." The Socialists would fight for  Nano's release, he said, adding that Nano would continue to be  party leader even while in prison.    The ruling Democratic Party said Nano's activities had to be  judged in court. Nano who was arrested in July last year was  prime minister in February-June 1991.    The court heard 51 witnesses including former Communist  Party  officials Ramiz Alia and Adil Carcani during the trial.    Several co-defendants arrested on charges of graft were  sentenced to lesser prison terms. Sokrat Plaka, a former deputy  foreign minister, was given a one-year suspended sentence  because of bad health, Robert Gjimi, a former deputy food  minister, was jailed for three years and humanitarian aid expert  Hasan Hallkja for one year.    Nexhmije Hoxha, the widow of Albania's post-war communist  leader, was jailed for 11 years late last year. A warrant for  the arrest of Alben Alia, the son of the former communist  leader, has also been issued.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE DEBATE OPENS ON NEW CLEAN AIR BILL  </P> <P> The long-awaited debate on cleaning the nation's air began in the Senate  Tuesday with Majority Leader George J. Mitchell arguing that the benefits of a  Senate proposal outweigh the high cost.  </P> <P> The Maine Democrat, inaugurating what is expected to be a long and vigorous  debate, acknowledged the Bush Administration's concern about the cost of the  Senate's voluminous 587-page rewrite of the 20-year-old Clean Air Act.  </P> <P> But citing statistics implicating air pollution in tens of thousands of deaths  annually, Mitchell argued that "we must protect the health of Americans. . . .  This bill should pass because the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of  action," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> The Senate's comprehensive and far-reaching version of a new Clean Air Act is  significantly tougher in the controls it would impose on industry than the  legislation President Bush sent to Congress seven months ago.  </P> <P> Although its provisions to control acid rain are similar to those proposed by  the President, the Senate bill incorporates much more stringent limits on  automobile tailpipe emissions to reduce urban smog and tighter restrictions on  the release of toxic chemicals blamed for an estimated 50,000 cancer deaths a  year.  </P> <P> The White House, attempting to strike a balance between its new environmental  priorities and the business interests with which the Republican Party  traditionally has been affiliated, has called some of the Senate bill's tougher  provisions "excessive." Bush, in letters to Senate leaders last week, also  hinted that he may feel compelled to veto any legislation that he considers  "unreasonable or unbalanced."  </P> <P> The Administration estimates it will cost the nation $40 billion annually to  implement the Senate's bill -- or roughly twice what it figures its original  clean air proposals will cost.  </P> <P> Mitchell and the two other chief backers of the bill, Sens. Max Baucus  (D-Mont.) and John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), all took to the floor Tuesday to dispute  the Administration's cost estimates as inflated.  </P> <P> Baucus cited a recent study by the American Lung Assn. that estimates the cost  of health care associated with air pollution at $100 billion per year. Mitchell  argued that the bickering over costs ignores the more fundamental "human" value  of the bill.  </P> <P> "What is the dollar value of a human life? What is the dollar value of a  child's health? I ask each senator, what is the dollar value of your child's  health?" Mitchell said.  </P> <P> The cost controversy, stirred by industry lobbyists who are mounting a major  campaign to weaken the Senate bill, was expected to be only one of several  contentious issues as both the House and the Senate debate new clean air  legislation at the floor level for the first time in 13 years.  </P> <P> Other issues include whether to mandate the use of alternative fuels to reduce  ozone pollution, how strictly air toxics should be regulated and whether  Midwestern states, which will bear the brunt of the bill's acid rain control  costs, should be given some form of cost-sharing subsidy.  </P> <P> Mitchell said he expects the Senate debate to take several weeks, with key  votes not likely until next week at the earliest.  </P> <P> The somewhat weaker version of clean air legislation under consideration in the  House is not expected to go to the floor for several weeks.  </P></p>

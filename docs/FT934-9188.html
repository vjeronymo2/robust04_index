			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Prices data dismay spurs long-dated Treasuries fall LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of a consumer prices report that failed to live up to the bond market's most optimistic expectations. A disappointing 10-year auction also affected the market. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at 100 9/16 , yielding 6.203 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 15/32 , to yield 4.142 per cent. After Tuesday's surprisingly weak producer prices figures, traders and investors had hoped the October consumer prices data would prove equally bullish for fixed-income securities. In the event, however, the government reported that the consumer prices index rose by 0.4 per cent last month. Although this was broadly in line with most analysts' forecasts, disappointment that the PPI number was not as encouraging as the CPI figure sparked early selling by dealers. The declines at the long end worsened later when commodities prices began to rise. The seal was finally set on a depressing day when the afternoon auction of Dollars 11bn of 10-year notes passed with weaker-than-expected demand for the new securities from retail investors. EUROPEAN markets again took their cue from the US in the absence of striking domestic news, and the release of a disappointing CPI figure for October dragged the main fixed-income markets down in afternoon trading. GERMAN paper dropped on the combination of the US CPI news and further supply in the form of 10-year Treuhand bonds. The Bundesbank's decision to shave one basis point off its repo rate - from 6.39 per cent to 6.38 per cent - barely caused a ripple as it was roughly in line with the market's expectations. The bund futures contract opened at 99.77 and traded in a range of 99.43 to 99.78, with the US news taking the futures down to the low of the day. By late afternoon, the contract was trading at 99.50. Dealers reported little outright buying of the new Treuhand bond, saying that investors continued to switch out of existing Treuhand issues into the new bond instead. HIGH-YIELDING European bond markets opened on a strong note, but slipped back on the US figures. The Italian market was given an initial boost by the the previous night's progress on the 1994 budget. The senate passed a key part of the budget on Tuesday night, and dealers said it was widely expected now that the full budget - which aims to cut L31,000bn from next year's deficit - will be approved by the end of the week. Traders noted two-way movement in Italian bonds, with some participants worried about the general political background and prospect of new supply over the next few days. Others, meanwhile, were more optimistic in view of the progress made on the budget. The BTP futures contract, which closed at 114.90 on Tuesday, jumped to a high of 115.27 early in the day, but slipped back to 114.84 by late afternoon. LONG-DATED UK government bonds slipped back a quarter of a point, while short-dated issues lost about  3/32 , with the US inflation news providing the highlight of the day. 'We try to be independent until lunchtime, and after that we're slaves to the US,' said one dealer. Traders expect the gilt market to go through something of a lull ahead of the November 30 Budget. The Liffe gilt future, which closed at 114.06 on Tuesday, was trading at 113.29 by late afternoon. Index-linked gilts saw some of the biggest losses on the day, falling up to half a point. JAPANESE government bond futures rallied strongly again and closed at a new six-year high. The December futures contract opened at 115.28, peaked at 115.44, and closed at 115.36, its highest level since June 12, 1987. The finance ministry held an auction of Y500bn of 2.4 per cent four-year paper, the first such sale of four-year debt since 1988. It sold the bonds at an average yield of 2.308 per cent.</p>

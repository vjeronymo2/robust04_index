			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEA'S CHIEF REJECTS GRANT TO BOSTON MUSEUM;  </P> <P> ARTS: AN AWARD IS DENIED FOR AN EXHIBIT WITH SEXUAL THEMES BY A LOS ANGELES  ARTIST, DESPITE APPROVAL BY A PEER REVIEW PANEL.  </P> <P> The chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts has rejected a $40,000  grant to support an exhibit at a Boston museum by an artist whose work includes  sexual themes, a museum official said today.  </P> <P> The Institute of Contemporary Art received formal notification last week that  NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer had rejected the grant, which had been  recommended for approval by a review committee, said Arthur Cohen, the  institute's marketing director.  </P> <P> The money was earmarked for an exhibition by Mike Kelley, a mixed-media artist  from Los Angeles, museum officials said.  </P> <P> "It is almost unprecedented in the history of the NEA that an application for a  gallery is approved by a peer review panel and then gets rejected by the  director," Cohen said.  </P> <P> The art institute's director, David A. Ross, said Kelley's work "deals with  serious and critical issues in our culture, some of which deal with the  pathology of our times, some of which deal with the body and references to  sexuality and sociology, some of which deal with nationality and nationalism,  some of which deal with madness and particular forms of modern schizophrenic  behavior."  </P> <P> Ross said it is unlikely that Frohnmayer will reverse his decision. He said he  did not know why the director objected to Kelley's exhibit.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Frohnmayer rejected four other grants that had been  recommended by review panels. Those grants were to individual artists involved  in controversial works, not a museum or gallery.  </P> <P> Cohen said that about two-thirds of all applications submitted to the NEA are  rejected by the peer panels and that the artists approved for grants are  heavily scrutinized.  </P> <P> "This is a show about a very important artist," Cohen said.  </P> <P> The NEA controversy began last year when Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other  conservatives in Congress objected to NEA funding of works by photographer  Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.  </P> <P> "They start with the easiest things first -- photography and performance, where  there is less of a historical precedent -- and then they get down to censorship  of other kinds of work," Kelley told the Boston Globe.  </P> <P> The peer panel recommended the $40,000 grant after reviewing the Institute of  Contemporary Art's application for $60,000.  </P> <P> The Kelley exhibit was scheduled to originate in Boston and tour other museums  across the nation and in Europe. "We're going to do the show no matter what,"  said curator Elizabeth Sussman.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Federal Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt has  called on Iran to continue promptly settling the claims of  German creditors. It will only make sense to consider holding  another meeting of the German-Iranian Economic Commission once  the debt rescheduling agreement that was concluded in February  has been fulfilled, Rexrodt said at a meeting with Foreign  Minister Velayati in Bonn.    According to official information, Rexrodt and Velayati  agree  that both sides are interested in the further development of  economic relations.</p>

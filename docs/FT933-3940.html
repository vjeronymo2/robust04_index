			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Commodity Exchange's robusta market COFFEE recovered from a weak start yesterday to be about unchanged by midday. And futures values surged to fresh 2 1/2 -year highs in the afternoon after the New York arabica price broke through stubborn resistance at 80 cents a lb for the near December future position. London's November position touched Dollars 1,300 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,297, up Dollars 29 on the day. 'The volume in London has not been all that great,' said one trader, 'we're just following the lead of New York.' The GOLD price also recovered from a modest early fall, as the German Bundesbank's discount rate cut improved sentiment. By the close the price was showing a gain from Wednesday of Dollars 2.40 at Dollars 354.15 a troy ounce. 'Gold and German interest rates tend to work in an inverse relationship,' explained James Capel's bullion analyst, Mr Jon Bertheil. COPPER prices ended easier after an active day, as nearby premiums narrowed in response to the LME's move on Wednesday to limit the one-day premium so as to relieve the supply squeeze that has persisted for some weeks.

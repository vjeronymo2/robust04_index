			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 27 (BTA) -- Bulgarian-Armenian  relations have reached a new level, Armenian Foreign Minister  Vahan Papazyan told the press at the end of his three-day formal  visit here. He signed on Monday [25 April] a bilateral trade  and economic cooperation accord and an agreement on cooperation  in culture, science and education. Papazyan also held talks on  Monday with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, the  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev  and National Assembly Deputy Chairman Yordan Shkolagerski.  Earlier today he was received by Bulgarian President Zhelyu  Zhelev to whom he delivered a message from Armenian President  Levon Ter-Petrosyan.    We agreed to keep working on building the legal framework of  bilateral relations and drafting accords on the avoidance of  double taxation and reciprocal investment protection; experts  should soon negotiate the signing of a Bulgarian-Armenian Treaty  on Friendship and Cooperation, Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Daskalov told the press today. It is not so important where the  treaty will be signed, here or in Yerevan, the important thing  is that there is a willingness to do that as soon as possible,  the chief Armenian diplomat said. Daskalov and Papazyan agreed  on more frequent contacts between the two foreign ministries,  other ministries and non-governmental organizations to boost  business, trade and cultural relations between Bulgaria and  Armenia. The two ministers shared information about their  countries' positions on the conflicts in the Balkans and the  Transcaucasian region. Papazyan said he was pleased with his  first visit here. He described his talks with President Zhelev  this morning as friendly and useful.    In answer to a question he said he did not think the  Armenian  community in Bulgaria faced any problems and voiced a hope it  would have a role in the promotion of Bulgarian-Armenian  relations. Papazyan held special meetings in Sofia and Plovdiv  (southern Bulgaria) with representatives of the Armenian  community. "There are no problems as to national identity",  said the Armenian foreign minister. About 20,000 Armenians live  in Bulgaria.    We've been sparing no effort to reach a political  settlement,  but peace will come when both sides agree, Papazyan said in  response to a question on Nagorno-Karabakh. He voiced an  expectation that Armenian-Turkish relations would improve and  Armenia and Turkey would soon establish diplomatic relations and  promote trade and economic cooperation. I believe this would  benefit both Turkey and Armenia, he said answering a question.</p>

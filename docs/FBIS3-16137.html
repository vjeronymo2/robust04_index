			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Opening statement at news conference by Ukrainian President </F> Leonid Krachuk in Kiev on 11 March -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified moderator] Ladies and gentlemen, I  have the honor to open this news conference by President Leonid  Makarovych Kravchuk on the results of his official visit to the  United States from 3 to 7 March. Before he answers your  questions, Leonid Makarovych wishes to make an introductory  address.    [Kravchuk] First of all, I can only focus attention on  certain fundamental issues because the visit was basically  covered both in our and foreign media, and its results were  outlined in the news conference by the Presidents of the United  States and Ukraine, as well as at the summing-up news conference  in New York. But I suppose there is a need to draw attention to  certain issues.    I think this visit -- this official visit, as it is  described  in the media as well as in the United States and Ukrainian  protocols, although there were attempts to call it a working  visit, depending on whose definition it is, and according to the  protocol definition it is an official visit by the president of  Ukraine to the United States -- is a logical conclusion to a  rather important stage in the ongoing process of forming the  political and the legal-contractual foundations of inter-state  relations between the United States and Ukraine. I believe this  visit took place in an atmosphere of notable positive  breakthroughs in Washington's lengthy but active rethinking of  its concept regarding relations with Ukraine. It allowed us to  proceed to the more substantive practical implementation of the  democratic partnership proclaimed during the visit in May 1992,  and to fill it with more specific content.    The talks and negotiations that were held with President  Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Christopher,  Secretary of Defense Perry, the heads of the Departments of  Finance and Trade, and with other top officials of the U.S.  administration, as well as in the Congress and at the Pentagon,  proved that the relations between our countries are ascending to  a qualitatively new level. There has been a change in relations  between the United States and Ukraine to relations between two  friendly countries called to play an important role, a strategic  role, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. In any event  Ukraine's role is thus evaluated in the long- term strategic  political plans of the United States, as I understood it.    Of no less importance is the implementation of our approach  to balancing the context of bilateral relations by displacing --  this is very important -- the accent from the problems of  Ukraine's nuclear (?armament) to other spheres of cooperation.  The fact that the American side has adopted namely such a  course confirms the correctness of our principled position from  this aspect, too.    The signing of a whole package of interstate documents  during  the visit, which determine the fundamental principles and  directions of bilateral relations for the nearest future in  political, economic, scientific-technical, and cultural spheres,  creates an important basis for giving Ukrainian-American  cooperation more substance and a more mutually advantageous  direction.    If one is to take the most important political result of the  visit, one may consider, first, the fact that the United States  unreservedly -- and this is very important -- confirmed support  for Ukraine's striving to consolidate its political and economic  independence, and the greater awareness of the potentially  increasing role of Ukraine in the development of evolutionary  social and political processes, both in the CIS region and in  Europe as a whole.    Next, the United States has realized to a greater degree the  existence of a stable, economically strong, and democratic  Ukrainian state, that its territorial integrity and security  conform to the interests of the United States, and that  Ukraine's loss of political independence could upset the  existing strategic balance in Europe and the entire world,  leading to unpredictable consequences. Thus, we can say that in  the period since 1991 certain strategic balances have taken  shape in Europe, and any unexpected development in any state,  first of all a state like Ukraine as our primary concern, could  lead to an imbalance. This is being increasingly realized both  in the United States and in Europe.    Next, the United States has expressed readiness to grant  additional financial aid to Ukraine. You know the figures.  However, it is important for me to emphasize one aspect, namely  that the United States has assumed a leading role in the  mobilization of additional multilateral aid within the framework  of the G-7 in order to support the reform program in Ukraine.  This was mentioned by the President of the United States.    Another very important aspect is that we have agreed to work  on the removal of barriers to trade and investments in order to  enlarge access to the two countries' markets. In March, the  benefits within the Generalized System of Preferences will be  extended to Ukraine, which will open opportunities for more  active access to the U.S. commodity market. Incidentally, today  I met representatives of the European Union and we also  suggested that the European market and the European Union  consider Ukraine's proposals to this effect after Ukraine signs,  soon I hope, the partnership and cooperation agreement with the  European Union, which is to be initialled in the near future,  some time in March.    We also reached an agreement, and I attach great importance  to this, about attracting more active private investment to  Ukraine. I held meetings at the Overseas Private Investment  Corporation in the United States with representatives of large  companies in New York, and I can tell you that the emphasis was  on the United States' economic aid to Ukraine and support for  private companies' capital investments in Ukraine, given of  course certain legislative support on the part of Ukraine. The  results of the visit also create real opportunities for the  establishment of mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation in  the sphere of science and technology and joint space research.  There are relevant agreements on all of these issues.    If one looks at it from the summing-up point of view, one  can say that there are considerable positive breakthroughs both  in Washington's philosophy and conceptual approaches toward the  establishment of relations between the United States and  Ukraine, in terms of pursuing a more balanced and realistic  policy that will embrace political, economic, scientific,  technical, and humanitarian cooperation, that is, practically  all areas. One can state already now that the crucial factor in  these breakthroughs was Ukraine's consistent, moderate, and  balanced stance in the rather intensive political dialogue at  all levels, both with the United States and with Russia, which  made it possible to sign the trilateral statement called to  maintain the necessary balance in relations between the United  States, Russia, and Ukraine. I think it has become clear to  all that the signing of the trilateral agreement was a decisive  stage in the present development of relations between Ukraine  and the United States, and between Ukraine and Russia.    The visit made it possible to consolidate the positive  trends  that had begun to take tangible shape in the bilateral relations  and channel them in a direction more consistent with our  political and economic priorities. I believe they are also  consistent with the aims of both the Western states and Russia.    The present steps of the Ukrainian Government must be aimed  at working out as soon as possible all the mechanisms regarding  the solving and implementation of the problems and agreements  that were signed. First of all, we need to ratify two  documents, one is the agreement on encouragement and mutual  protection of investments, and the other is the convention on  the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of tax evasion  in respect of income and capital tax. These documents must be  ratified.    It is very important to resolve, within the shortest  possible  period of time, and we are working on it now, the issue of  setting up a bilateral commission for assistance to trade and  investment that we agreed to form, and a commission for  assistance to joint activities in the sphere of high technology,  scientific research, and development. We have instructed our  National Space Agency to hold, in the near future, a meeting of  the two countries' experts to examine specific issues and  spheres of cooperation in space research in order to sign a  respective intergovernmental agreement.    The work conducted during and before the visit with  international financial organizations, particularly, the  International Monetary Fund and World Bank, was very important.  This work is now at the completion stage, its specific sections  have been worked out, and now the entire program must be  finalized. It is a program based on Ukraine's real  possibilities, and on our political will to pursue consistent  market economic reforms which is our most important task and to  which we see no alternative today. We have instructed our  Foreign Affairs Ministry to continue consultations with the  United States and other G-7 countries in order to mobilize  international financial aid to speed up the economic processes  and reforms in Ukraine that are taking place and should be more  intensive.    Thus, one can say without exaggeration that the official  visit by the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian delegation  to the United States is a very important stage in the  development of bilateral and multilateral relations, and in  determining a more clear political role for Ukraine as a  European state. I think this visit will enable us to place the  right emphasis in our relations, our policy, and our  perspective. I am now ready to answer your questions.</p>

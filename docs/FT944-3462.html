			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues as City Site turns in Pounds 2m City Site Estates, the property investment and development group, announced sharply increased profits for the year to September 30 as it built upon the recovery shown in the previous 12 months. Mr William Syson, chairman, said distributable reserves were Pounds 1.74m, enabling the repayment of arrears of Pounds 2.82m on preference dividends, during the current year. Net asset value rose from 22p to 55p per share by the period end. This has since risen to 60p pending the assignation of seven leased properties from Shoprite to Kwik Save. 'I am confident that with the quality of the portfolio and positive cash flow we can look forward to a sustained period of growth and an early return to the payment of ordinary dividends,' Mr Syson said. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.07m, against a restated Pounds 318,000. The company sold properties during the year for a total of Pounds 9.75m, in excess of book value. Property acquisitions amounted to more than Pounds 20m, giving additional income of Pounds 2.13m a year at an initial yield of 10.6 per cent. Earnings per share were 4.29p (losses of 6.81p).</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Clinton hints at flexibility on healthcare bill President Bill Clinton yesterday emphasised his flexibility over healthcare legislation at a conference of state governors in an effort to keep the reform on track. Speaking in Boston, Massachusetts, Mr Clinton said he would accept any plan that guaranteed 'universal coverage' for all US citizens. He seemed to indicate still further flexibility when he later said he would not veto a reform bill that 'moved toward universal coverage'. 'I have no pride of authorship and no pride of details, I just want to find a solution that works,' Mr Clinton said in his speech. However, in an earlier speech at the conference, Mr Robert Dole, the Senate Republican leader and chief opponent of Mr Clinton's healthcare initiative, accused the president of blocking a compromise. He said Mr Clinton was 'ratcheting up the rhetoric' and fomenting 'class warfare' with statements about the increasing healthcare burden on the middle class that would ensue if universal coverage was not achieved. Both the president and Mr Dole urged one another to deflate the rhetoric surrounding the healthcare reform debate which is beginning to draw to a conclusion in Congress and said they were willing to compromise. Mr Dole said: 'I think the seeds of a bipartisan bill still exist if the administration is willing to come our way.' Mr Dole promoted the insurance reform proposal he has floated as an alternative to Mr Clinton's demand for an overhaul of the healthcare system and coverage for every American. But Mr Clinton said he was highly sceptical of the plan, which would allow workers to keep the same insurance policy even if they switched jobs but would not mandate that employers pay for it. Mr Clinton said there was evidence that insurance reform without universal coverage was not a workable solution because it resulted in higher cost for most workers.</p>

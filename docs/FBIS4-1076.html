			<p>BFN     [Text] Transvaal National Party leader Pik Botha says the  party is considering forming a coalition to gain control of the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] province in next  week's election. Mr. Botha told a news briefing that it was  vital that the PWV, as the economic hub of South Africa, had an  effective government. Conrad Burke reports.    [Begin recording] [Burke] The PWV. The National Party says  there are over 4.5 million voters here, almost 1.5 million in  Soweto alone, and according to the NP's PWV team, the party has  a good chance here even as part of a coalition.    [Botha] There are other parties with more or less the same  basic principles, the same policies and objectives. And I would  have at this stage, that after the elections we would be able to  form a coalition, partnership, a grouping together -- I don't  want to give it a name. But it would be improper of me to  mention it at this stage because at this moment we are opponents.    [Burke] Yesterday's breakthrough with the Inkatha Freedom  Party was described by Mr. Botha as the most day in South  African history. It was also good news for the PWV election  campaign.    [Botha] Yes, the decision and agreement means that we've now  had a totally new ball game, particularly in this province --  but certainly for Natal-kwaZulu, yes; but also for our province.  I think that this will assist us to have more calm and an  orderly election here which we really need. [end recording]</p>

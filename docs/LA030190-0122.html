			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RIVAL CHRISTIAN MILITIAS DUEL IN EAST BEIRUT  </P> <P> Rival Christian militias exchanged tank and artillery fire Wednesday in East  Beirut, violating a shaky 12-day-old truce and sending panicked civilians to  underground shelters.  </P> <P> Security sources said that troops loyal to Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and fighters  of the Lebanese Forces militia fought at dawn around the hilltop neighborhood  of Ashrafiyeh.  </P> <P> The thud of explosions shook the capital and sent panicked civilians rushing to  bunkers for cover as artillery and mortar shells slammed into residential  areas. The fighting died down after about an hour.  </P> <P> More than 700 people have been killed since the battle for control of the  Christian enclave erupted Jan. 31, when Aoun ordered Samir Geagea's Lebanese  Forces to disarm.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a senior Muslim militia official told Reuters news agency that the  United States and Iran have held secret talks on releasing eight American  hostages held by pro-Iranian extremist groups in Lebanon.  </P> <P> The official, who asked not to be identified, said senior Iranian Foreign  Ministry officials and an American negotiator met in New York in December. A  second round of talks took place in Geneva in January.  </P> <P> U.S. officials on Tuesday denied reports of such direct talks.  </P> <P> In London, Peggy Say, the sister of journalist Terry A. Anderson, the  longest-held Western hostage, said she is hopeful that the United States, Syria  and Iran are cooperating toward the release of the 16 foreign hostages.  </P></p>

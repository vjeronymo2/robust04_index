In a predeparture statement at Istanbul's Ataturk  Airport, Yilmaz said many distinguished statesmen will attend  the meeting, to be held under the chairmanship of former U.S.  President Gerald Ford. International security policies and  topics concerning the world economy will be discussed at the  meeting, Yilmaz reported. He added that possible global  developments in the 2000's will also be on the agenda.    Yilmaz explained that he will then proceed to Washington,  where he will meet with U.S. Administration and Congressional  officials. He stated: I will have the opportunity to convey  our views on various issues to U.S. officials, particularly at  this time when we are experiencing some tension in Turkish-U.S.  relations.    In reply to a question on whether he will discuss the  extension of the Poised Hammer mandate with U.S. officials,  Yilmaz said:    [Begin Yilmaz recording] The question of whether the Poised  Hammer mandate will be extended depends on the decision of the  Turkish Grand National Assembly. The importance the U.S.  Administration attaches to this issue is evident, and if U.S.  officials raise the subject, I will convey our views to them.  [end recording]    Yilmaz remarked that on 20 June, he will hold a news  conference on his contacts in the United States, and he will  return to Turkey the following day.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Coaches ponder their final teams - The jobs of Carlos Alberto Parreira and Arrigo Sacchi are on the line tomorrow When their team was announced before the semi-final against Sweden, Brazilian fans in the stadium greeted every name with a roar - all names but the last one. They gave coach Carlos Alberto Parreira the bird. One of the oddities of this World Cup is that the coaches of both finalists could be fired. In part this reflects the whole tournament: lots of great games, no great teams. Brazil's fans yearn for more fantasia than Parreira has been able to provide. He did not invent the five-man back line that Brazil have used, but in this World Cup the formation has suddenly looked terribly defensive. Part of the blame lies with the players Parreira has. The three central defenders are all good, old-fashioned centre-halves: quick, strong and athletic and, as with all Brazilians, comfortable on the ball. But they are unwilling to burst forward. On the rare occasions that Mauro Silva has joined the attack he has not made a telling contribution. In front of the centre-backs sits Dunga, the best defensive mid-field player in the competition. He, too, is slow to commit himself to attack. Often when Brazil are attacking, four or five of their players loiter at the half-way line marking one opposing striker. Memories of last summer's defensive collapse against Germany in a friendly in Washington DC still linger. The Brazilian approach depends on the attacking abilities of the wing-backs and mid-field players. The suspension of Leonardo has been a severe blow. His replacement, Branco, is a menace at free kicks but lacks the pace and stamina to pose a consistent threat to the opposing full-back. The attacking mid-field men have disappointed. Mazinho and Zinho have been patchy, Ra pedestrian. Perhaps the coach will give in to the Brazilian president, fans (and to memories of Pele) and pick the 17-year-old wonder-child Ronaldo. Brazil have had difficulty breaking down defences. Their passing and movement off the ball remain pleasing to watch, but often lack thrust. They have been most dangerous on the rapid counter, when a long ball from defence finds Bebeto and Romario facing just two or three defenders, with the whole opposing half to move in. These two have demonstrated time after time how dangerous two attackers hunting as a pair can be. So far, Parreira's system has worked. Brazil's style is well-suited to the heat. The team have looked in control throughout all but one of their games. The solitary exception came after they took a 2-0 lead against Holland. Brazil may have been guilty of losing concentration or it may be that until they backed the Dutch into a corner they had not faced a dangerous attacking side. The suspicion remains that Brazil have looked so comfortable in most of their games not because they are good but because their other opponents  - Sweden (twice), Russia, Cameroon and the US - have been poor and defensive. Italy are capable of applying pressure that Brazil have not yet experienced. If Dennis Bergkamp can run through the Brazilian defence, so can Roberto Baggio. If Aron Winter can beat them in the air, so can Pierluigi Casiraghi  -if Sacchi picks him. Nevertheless, the Brazilians probably hope they face the industrious but goal-shy Casiraghi rather than the speedy, sharp-shooting alternatives: Giuseppe Signori and Daniele Massaro. The Brazilian solution will be to defend in numbers. Italy, too, will be obsessed with double- and triple-marking Bebeto and Romario. The hope tomorrow is for an early stroke of genius which brings a goal and loosens up both defences. The only people who do not have happy memories of the 1970 World Cup final, when Brazil produced a virtuoso display, are Italians. They lost 4-1. But if the attitude of the Italian team in earlier rounds of this World Cup is a guide, they will be glad that they face Brazil tomorrow and not Sweden  -not because they desire revenge, but because they want an opponent they can lose to without losing face. But which Italian side will show up? Will it be the confident side that tore into Bulgaria for 20 minutes in the first half of their semi-final, producing the best passage of sustained attacking play in the tournament? Or will it be the team that surrendered after Spain equalised in the quarter-final, spent 20 minutes in an abject defensive crouch and were rescued only by goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca's fortuitous save against Julio Salinas and by Roberto Baggio's off-side goal immediately afterwards? Italy's progress to the final has not stilled coach Arrigo Sacchi's army of critics. Some dislike his English-style tactics, others his endless tinkering with the team - Sacchi has used 20 of his 22 players  - as he searches for 11 who will conform to his plan. Some object to him on political grounds: he is Berlusconi's protege. It is easy to second-guess Sacchi's squad selection. Roberto Donadoni is the only genuine wide player and, canny, skilful and tough as he is, Donadoni now lacks the pace to beat defenders on the outside. Only Roberto Mussi, a full-back, and Giuseppe Signori, playing out of position, have consistently found good crossing positions, though, like everyone in this World Cup, they have had trouble crossing well. Critics argue that it is no accident that Italy have earned the nickname of 'Cardiac Kids,' winning twice with 10 men. Only when they have a player sent off can they safely shake off Sacchi's tactics, it appears. Yet against Bulgaria, Sacchi's thinking paid off. The Italians applied relentless pressure to the ball carrier. Two or three blue shirts would harry every Bulgarian. The Bulgarians tried switching the ball back and forth across the field, away from the crowds of Italians, yet could never escape. They were penned in their half. Italy seemed to have more men on the field. The Brazilians like to move out of defence with quick short passes, which should provide the Italians with chances to regain the ball quickly in the most dangerous area, as the Dutch did in the later stages of their match against Brazil. It also means that Italy could spend an exhausting afternoon in the heat chasing shadows. Since the injury to Franco Baresi, who showed his age against Ireland, the Italian defence has been impressively solid. Yes, they occasionally look shaky when players run at them, as Bebeto and Romario will, but so does any defence. Now they will be without Sandro Costacurta and, unless Fifa has an uncharacteristic change of heart, Mauro Tassotti. If this means a return for Baresi, who had knee surgery on June 19, the Brazilian strikers will be eager to test him out. Sacchi's squad is showing signs of wear. Baggio tweaked a hamstring against Bulgaria. With three days' rest he should be able to start, but he will know that if he extends himself the hamstring could pop again at any time. Pierluigi Casiraghi showed signs of cramp after barely an hour of his first World Cup start. That may be because he has hardly played for a month or, more likely, because the 90` heat on Wednesday and over the last month has taken a toll on even the best-rested players. But the key for the Italians lies not in their legs but in their heads. If their nerve and luck hold, they are capable of avenging 1970.</p>

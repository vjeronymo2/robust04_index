			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (9): Radical shift in attitude - Product development / So where is the paint industry going? From what its leaders say, there has been a fundamental change in attitude, with not only new products developed or on the way, but also fresh approaches to management Paint product development is dominated by the desire to use fewer volatile organic compounds (VOC) in solvents. More water is one answer. Other coatings have higher proportions of solids - pigment and resin - than before. Meanwhile, some companies are specialising in powder coatings, which have no solvent at all. In all companies there has been a shift away from pure research. Beckers, the Swedish paintmaker, now calls its laboratories the product development department, typifying a growing concentration on working up what the industry now has, rather than looking for something new. 'Purer' work is going on - but at bodies such as the Paint Research Association, where it is jointly funded, or at some universities, where projects are sponsored. In companies' own labs, work is focused and driven by the needs and problems of industrial customers. These relationships with the users of industrial paints are deepening and changing paints companies' approach to management. There has always been symbiosis, particularly in the automotive industry, where paintmakers have given car manufacturers guaranteeable anti-corrosion technology. The car business now exemplifies the latest management developments. Numbers of competitors for OEM - painting cars during manufacture - have been reducing steadily for 10 years. But even while four or five remained, competitive supply still had much to do with the price of paint. Now, both carmakers and paintmakers have realised that having fewer paint companies supplying the OEM market - worth about Pounds 650m a year in Europe alone - is the way to lower overall costs. As Dr Marvin Hartman, one of PPG's leading chemists, puts it: 'There is a lot more cost in painting than the cost of the paint. It's the whole process of getting it on to the car.' Dr Manfred Hopp, chief executive of BASF Lacke &amp; Farben, says: 'Only 10 to 20 per cent of a paint shop's cost is the cost of paint. The process is much more costly. 'We hope to get away from stupid negotiations on raw material prices. It is the total cost per painted car that matters, including the process cost.' There is some self-interest in this because paint has historically been priced by the litre. High technology modern coatings do a better job with less paint, but persuading purchasing managers they should therefore pay more per litre is another matter. Changing the pricing structure offers better prospects. The automotive industry is making this possible by moving away from competitive supply at individual plant level. Carmakers may retain several paint suppliers overall, but will give a franchise to only one per plant. PPG and BASF have now emerged as the two front runners in the market, but each is adopting a different approach. PPG thinks carmakers should outsource the whole painting process, with PPG managing and staffing the paint shop. BASF is openly hostile. 'There is enormous price pressure and everyone is trying to bring in savings,' Dr Hopp says. 'We are very good at making paint, but not necessarily at other things. We believe that by bringing together experts in car manufacturing, paint supply and application equipment manufacturing - as well as those in car design or design of car plants  - we can work as team to optimise the whole process.' Mr Austin O'Malley, who has been responsible for building PPG's OEM presence in Europe, disagrees. 'The body of knowledge about painting cars is now resident in the paint industry,' he says. 'We have the experience, knowledge and resources - and the critical mass. You need to be able to provide eight people per shift to replace the car company's own engineers. We are now big enough to offer this. Most of our competitors are not.' The answer to the question of which approach is better - or if neither is - will be decided over the next 10 years at individual factories of Ford and General Motors as they plump for one supplier at each - and the management system to go with it. It will be a new type of competition to that of simply undercutting to supply cheaper paint. Meanwhile, technology is driving the development of powder paints, which contain no solvent at all and are therefore ultra-friendly to the environment. The raw material is made by milling together pigment and resin finely enough for the resultant powder to be sprayed onto heated metal objects. An electrostatic field ensures they deposit evenly; the heat sets off polymerisation and a coloured film forms over the surface, 'painting' it. Oversprayed powder is collected and recycled. The process works well on items like aluminium extrusions for window frames, under-the-bonnet car components or office light fittings, but films are thick and achieving a hard gloss is difficult. The powder market was very fragmented, but is now concentrating worldwide, with a few companies - notably Courtaulds Coatings of the UK, Herberts of Germany and Ferro of the US - trying to solve the problems. Laporte, which now owns Evode Powder Coatings in the UK, is developing powder application methods for plastics - and aims to threaten wet paint in this segment. Courtaulds believes thinner films - the key to challenging wet industrial paints - will be achieved through engineering as much as chemistry, by milling to the fine particle standards of the cosmetics industry. Formulation - resin design and deciding the ratio of pigment - will become more critical, and cannot be done by anyone. Partnership with industry is also important here. Euramax, the aluminium coil coater, is experimenting with powder, though using single sheets of metal, rather than a continuous strip at present. Mr Roger Walters, the chief executive, says powder offers multi-coloured and embossed finishes - impossible with wet paint, which provides a uniform coating. Meanwhile, director Mr John Bernie says the Paint Research Association is looking at more distant technologies. For example, a biomimetics programme is studying how crabs and barnacles develop natural coatings from waterborne compounds in the sea, which then will not dissolve in water afterwards. The implications for waterborne paints, which are at present more suited to indoor than outdoor use, are obvious.</p>

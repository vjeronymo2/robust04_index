			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICANS CAST CRUCIAL VOTES  </P> <P> The government held a general election today that measured white attitudes  toward apartheid, specifically a proposal by the governing party to share  limited power with blacks.  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised blacks staged a general strike capping  nationwide protests of the parliamentary election. Factories, businesses,  schools and transportation services closed down in major cities, where more  than 90% of black workers and most students stayed home.  </P> <P> Acting President F. W. de Klerk smiled, shook hands and enjoyed a champagne  breakfast at his Pretoria-area polling booth. Officials say the vote is the  most crucial since the governing National Party came to power on promises of  strict race segregation in 1948.  </P></p>

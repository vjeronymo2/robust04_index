			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS PUT A ROADBLOCK ON THE CHIEFS;  </P> <P> DEFENSE INTERCEPTS FIVE; BERNSTINE SCORES TWICE  </P> <P> When the Kansas City Chiefs arrived at their San Diego hotel Saturday, 15 of  their rooms were not ready. This was not a surprise.  </P> <P> The Chiefs do not travel well. The only thing they have in common with the road  is accidents. Take a set of 3-week-old quintuplets away from home, and they  will be more comfortable than the Chiefs in a strange town.  </P> <P> The Chargers know this to be happily true. Before Sunday, their defense had not  taken the ball away once, and they had not won a game. Against the Chiefs, they  intercepted five Steve DeBerg passes, rushed for 200 yards and improved to 1-2  with a 21-6 victory.  </P> <P> "When you sit at home and draw it up, this is the way you'd like it to take  place," said Dan Henning, the first-year Charger coach. "We took the ball away  on defense, controlled it on offense, kicked the ball out of trouble when we  had to and went away with a win. That's exactly how it ought to be."  </P> <P> For the Chiefs (1-2), it was exactly the way it has been for more than two  years. They have lost eight consecutive games away from Arrowhead Stadium and  16 of their past 18 on the road. They are 3-24 in their past 27 AFC West road  games.  </P> <P> Don't look for either of these teams in the playoffs. But don't look for  Henning in the unemployment office just yet, either.  </P> <P> An embattled Henning finally witnessed the kind of defense he was told he had  inherited when he took this job last February. And his running game, led by  H-back Rod Bernstine, ran over and around a defense that entered the game  ranked third in the league.  </P> <P> Bernstine, who spent the entire off-season recovering from reconstructive knee  surgery, caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Jim McMahon in the third period.  </P> <P> Late in the fourth, he raced 32 yards up the middle on a third-and-eight draw  play for the score that put the Chargers out of reach. Before the play,  Bernstine was discouraged when a Chief linebacker yelled the word "draw" as a  warning.  </P> <P> It didn't matter. Bernstine, shielded initially by 6-foot-7, 307-pound left  tackle Joel Patten, broke several tackles en route to the end zone.  </P> <P> "I grabbed the back of Joel's pants and pushed him right into one defender,"  said Bernstine, who played fullback at Texas A&amp;M before converting to tight  end.  </P> <P> Said Patten: "If anything helped on that block, it was my sheer size. They  probably couldn't see Rod behind me."  </P> <P> Patten said he was especially pleased with Kansas City's inability to stop the  play even though they knew it was coming. Larry Beightol, the offensive line  coach, had addressed that very subject before kickoff.  </P> <P> "He said that if we had to resort to trickery, we were reeling, going  backwards," Patten said.  </P> <P> "What we did today," he added, "has been our potential all year."  </P> <P> And they did it without starting left tackle Brett Miller, who underwent minor  knee surgery Friday. James FitzPatrick replaced Miller and played well.  </P> <P> Bernstine led all Charger rushers with 73 yards in five carries. But rookie  Marion Butts added 62 yards in 15 rushes, and Tim Spencer gained 57 in 13  tries, including a nine-yard touchdown in the first period set up by free  safety Vencie Glenn's interception. Glenn's interception came after defensive  back Elvis Patterson tipped the ball. It was the first of the year for the  Chargers.  </P> <P> Spencer's score was his first since 1986. "I almost forgot how to get into the  end zone," he said.  </P> <P> Spencer also was an integral part of the Chargers' beleaguered special teams  units that had their best game of the year. Former CFL punter Hank Ilesic,  signed earlier this week, averaged 44.8 for five kicks, including a 60-yarder.  This despite being made by the officials to alter his kicking shoe moments  before the game.  </P> <P> Even the Charger kickoff coverage and kickoff return units, last in the league  after two games, outplayed the Chiefs.  </P> <P> Before the game, Henning instructed the public address announcer to introduce  the special teams unit that blocked a Houston punt last week. Usually the  announcer introduces either the starting offense or defense.  </P> <P> "We are trying to get these people (special teams) to step up, be recognized  and have some pride," Henning said.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Glenn predicted that one Charger take-away would lead to a  bunch more. He was right. Cornerback Gill Byrd added two interceptions. Strong  safety Martin Bayless and nickel back Lester Lyles got one apiece. All of which  helped offset a career-high 112 yards rushing by Christian Okoye, Kansas City's  260-pound fullback.  </P> <P> "He (DeBerg) was watching the side where he was going to throw to," Glenn said.  "It seemed like he was telegraphing his passes."  </P> <P> DeBerg said the Charger defensive alignment, which often included linebackers  in a three-point stance, was more responsible. "It was basically a seven-man  front," DeBerg said.  </P> <P> And it included Cedric Figaro at inside linebacker in place of Jim Collins.  Figaro weighs 17 pounds more than Collins. And, Henning said, "We wanted that  extra heft against this team. Collins is more into reads. The two of them give  is a good combination."  </P> <P> Last week, the Chargers fumbled the ball away twice, and McMahon threw three  interceptions for a minus-five turnover/take-away differential. Against the  Chiefs, they were plus five. Kansas City's only points came on Nick Lowery  field goals of 23 and 31 yards in the first half.  </P> <P> The Charger defense allowed fewer than 300 yards for the first time this year.  It added three sacks, including the first by rookie Burt Grossman, the team's  No. 1 draft choice.  </P> <P> McMahon completed 11 of 18 for 96 yards and one touchdown. More important, he  threw no interceptions and was not sacked. "Two losses," he said, "don't  necessarily knock us out of the playoffs."  </P> <P> Perhaps defensive end Leslie O'Neal, who led the Chargers with 1 1/2 sacks, put  it best when he said, "We played more like an experienced team today."  </P> <P> For their part, the Chiefs couldn't wait to get home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Before Sunday's game Charger running back Gary Anderson told NBC's Bob Costas,  "If I can't play with the Chargers, I'd like to play with someone else."  Anderson, an unsigned free agent, was the Chargers' leading rusher and most  valuable player last year. Moments after his remarks, Bobby Beathard, the  former Washington general manager, told Costas: "The demands are ridiculous.  Gary Anderson is simply not a million-dollar back." Ralph Cindrich, Anderson's  agent, said earlier this week Anderson isn't asking for that much. . . .  Charger rookie Marion Butts, who entered the game tied for the NFL lead in  touchdowns with four, carried three times for minus two yards in the first  half. On his first two carries of the second half he broke off two 14-yard  gains. . . . The Charger single-game record for interceptions is six. They have  done that five different times. They intercepted five Sunday. The last time  they did that was Sept. 20, 1981, at Kansas City. Kansas City quarterback Steve  DeBerg, playing for Tampa Bay, threw seven interceptions against the 49ers on  Sept. 7, 1986. . . . Gill Byrd's 20 career interceptions rank him eighth on the  all-time Charger list. . . . Linebacker Billy Ray Smith led the Charger defense  in tackles (seven) for the first time since last Nov. 6. . . . Chiefs'  linebacker Derrick Thomas, who had five tackles, 2 1/2 sacks and one forced  fumble last week against the Raiders, had three tackles and no sacks against  the Chargers. . . . The Kansas City defense has allowed just nine receptions by  opposing wide receivers in three games. Anthony Miller (two catches for 55  yards) was the only Charger wideout to catch a ball. . . . "Jim McMahon didn't  do anything that impressed me," said Kansas City free safety Deron Cherry.  Surely, the feeling was mutual. The fact that McMahon has never lost three  consecutive starts in this, his eighth season, is impressive by anybody's  standards. . . . Sunday's attendance was 40,128, a whopping increase of 115  people from last week's home opener. The Chargers play in Phoenix and Denver  before returning home again Oct. 15 to play Seattle.  </P> <P> SHOE BUSINESS  </P> <P> After a raging pregame controversy over one of his shoes, new Charger punter  Hank Ilesic has big day in his NFL debut.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 18, 1992 and January 21, 1993 the State of Wisconsin submitted such a PROGRAM to USEPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. The submittals contained the following portions of 1991 Wisconsin Act 269 and 1991 Wisconsin Act 302: Natural Resources (NR) 144.36_small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program definitions; section 15.157(10) of the Wisconsin Statutes_small business environmental council members; section 560.11 of the Wisconsin Statutes_small business environmental council duties; NR 144.399_fees; section 560.03(9) of the Wisconsin Statutes_business and industrial development (small business ombudsman clearinghouse); and section 96_nonstatutory provisions of 1991 Assembly Bill 1055_development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Small Business Assistance Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by requiring the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to develop information pertaining to the technical issues of regulations. The Wisconsin Department of Development (WDOD), the University of Wisconsin's Small Business Development Center_Solid and Hazardous Waste Education Center, and the University of Wisconsin-Extension Engineering Professional Development Center (University of Wisconsin-Extension) will assist WDNR in making the materials understandable to the layperson. Rule developers will also analyze the impact of new regulations on small business stationary sources to aid in the development of assistance materials. Advisory committees will be developed to encourage lawful cooperation and compliance with the Act. Advisory committees will also be involved during rule development, giving small businesses the opportunity to voice their concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A seventh requirement of Section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The State has met this requirement by promoting pollution prevention and hazardous waste minimization through several existing programs. Informational materials are developed by: WDNR's Pollution Prevention Office, WDNR's Bureau of Solid and Hazardous Waste, and the University of Wisconsin-Extension. WDOD's Hazardous Pollution Prevention Board coordinates and monitors hazardous pollution prevention, advises WDNR and the University of Wisconsin-Extension in their pollution prevention efforts, provides hazardous pollution prevention reports to the Governor and the State legislature, and awards pollution prevention audit grants to businesses and manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by developing mechanisms to inform small business stationary sources about applicable requirements through WDNR's Bureau of Air Management and WDOD's Small Business Ombudsman's Office and Permit Information Center. These mechanisms include an 800 telephone service (1&hyph;800&hyph;HELP-BUS-iness); permit applicability determinations; dissemination of written materials (including permit application process guidance); individual technical and business consultations; and potential permit application workshops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the Act. The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the new regulations. These mechanisms include public notices and hearings on draft State rules; mailings to trade associations, small businesses, and representatives of small businesses; newspaper notices, radio and television announcements, and other media for widely disseminating information; and an 800 telephone service. Preliminary notices will also be disseminated prior to adoption of a final rule in order to allow businesses time to prepare for the impacts of a rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their obligations under new regulations. These mechanisms are the same as those listed above for notifying sources of their rights. In addition, Wisconsin has developed mechanisms for referring small business stationary sources to qualified auditors. These mechanisms include providing information on Hazardous Pollution Prevention Audit Grants, providing information through the University of Wisconsin-Extension Solid and Hazardous Waste Education Center, and developing a guide to assist small business stationary sources in hiring auditors. The SBAP may also develop a list of consultants which provide environmental compliance audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement by addressing such requests through permit revision procedures. The SBAP will assist businesses with the permit revision process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

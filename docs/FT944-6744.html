			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (6): Wheel turns full circle for a man from Harwell / Profile of Energy Systems Trade Association The international energy efficiency industry was born 21 years ago when the armies of Egypt and Syria launched their October offensive against the Israelis and the Arab oil producing countries dramatically quadrupled the price of oil to the western world. The shock sent the industrialised world into headlong flight from oil to other fuels and prompted energy conservation efforts, such as the Save It campaign in Britain, more intensive than anything since the Second World War. Since then, apart from the the upheaval caused by the Iran revolution of 1979, oil prices have generally drifted downwards to become lower in real terms than even before the October 1973 war. Nevertheless, energy efficiency still commands lip-service from politicians, industrialists and property developers, not only for economic and security reasons but because of the perceived link between carbon fuels and the environment. The preoccupation with energy efficiency is reflected in the durability of many of the organisations which came into being during the energy crises which gripped the world throughout the 1970s. In Britain, these include the Energy Systems Trade Association (Esta), an umbrella body originally formed to serve manufacturers of waste heat recovery systems but now representing a diverse range of service and product suppliers with a growing emphasis on electronic controls. Esta was founded in 1982 by Dr Glenn Brookes, then a 32 year-old scientist working on energy efficiency projects at the Atomic Energy Authority's energy technology support unit (Etsu) at Harwell. While selecting promising new efficiency methods for government-sponsored demonstration, Dr Brookes had found that there was no umbrella body to represent the waste heat recovery industry. He resigned from Harwell, set up Esta and has never looked back. The energy efficiency industry, he says 'has come of age'. It no longer depends for its existence on the armoury of government grants created in the wake of the world oil crises. It has suffered many casualties but a hard core has soldiered through and advances with its own momentum. His own association now represents more than 80 members, with an estimated turnover of more than Pounds 1bn a year, and comprises six specialist branches: 14 independent energy consultants, with a Pounds 30m turnover and accounting for about 60 per cent of their market; 14 contract energy management groups; turnover about Pounds 200m; covers about 85 per cent of its market; 13 building controls suppliers; turnover Pounds 250m; represent 85 per cent of their sector; controls systems specialists: 13 members; turnover Pounds 30m; about 60 per cent of this sector; metering and monitoring group: 12 members; Pounds 30m energy efficiency turnover; represents 90 per cent of this sector; non-specialists (from heat recovery, lighting and boilers, to discrete controls and water management): total turnover for all members exceeding Pounds 500m, employing around 10,000 people and responsible for savings of around Pounds 250m a year. In Britain, the building controls market has moved with property values. After peaking in 1991 at Pounds 344m, building controls sales fell to Pounds 278m in 1992, but rose again last year to Pounds 293m and continues to grow at a few per centage points a year. Over the past four years, says Dr Brookes, there has been a 75 per cent increase in spending on servicing and maintenance of energy efficiency systems. The contract energy management group, which includes BP Energy, AHS-Emstar and subsidiaries of regional electricity companies, operates clients' heating systems more efficiently than clients feel able to do themselves. Their activities have grown by about 21 per cent since 1991, and their workforce has grown at a similar rate to reach a present level of about 2,000. They also cashed in on a 13 per cent growth in public sector contracts from 1991 to 1992, but this has since levelled out. Esta's latest initiative, launched a year ago, is a scheme which independently measures an organisation's achievements in energy efficiency under nationally applied rules. Meanwhile, the wheel has turned full circle. Fourteen years after Dr Brookes took the plunge into the private sector, the organisation from which he jumped is set to take the same path. In the Queen's Speech, the government announced its intention to privatise the Atomic Energy Authority, including its energy technology support unit. Would Dr Brookes be making a bid for it? 'Definitely not', he said.</p>

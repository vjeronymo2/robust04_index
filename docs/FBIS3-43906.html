The parties have not yet finished discussing the national  police formation dossier. Joao Ligio reports:    Point one in the working agenda of the second round of peace  talks has not yet been surpassed. Sources close to the peace  talks feel the national police dossier could this week still  become part of the documents signed by the parties during the  first round of peace talks begun during the last days of last  year.    After the amendments made yesterday to the proposal  presented  by the Black Cockerel's negotiators on the specific principles  of Point One, dealing with the percentages of each party in the  composition of the riot police, the mediator is expected to  present his counterproposal. The joint reaction of the mediator  and the troika, entitled the master document, should be  presented to the parties tomorrow, taking into account the  intense movement for exchanging correspondence registered today.  We saw hotel doors opening and closing, with Alioune Blondin  Beye's messengers going in and coming out.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> Kotkin says that the RAND Corp. study indicates that Latinos commit crimes at  rates slightly lower than blacks or whites. However, most, if not all, of  L.A.'s Hispanic barrios are littered with ugly, intimidating gang graffiti made  by the violent street youth that inhabit those neighborhoods. I have spent more  than two dozen Saturdays helping paint over the graffiti.  </P> <P> After growing up in mostly white neighborhoods where this type of behavior was  virtually unheard of, I deeply resent this low-class aspect of Hispanic  culture.  </P> <P> GREG SCOTT, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

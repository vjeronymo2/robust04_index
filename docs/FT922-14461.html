			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (12): 'I'm having a great time' - Profile: Michael Dell, an irrepressible entrepreneur who has confounded the sceptics and helped to reshape the PC industry TEN YEARS ago, probably few people outside his home town of Houston, Texas, had heard of a teenaged marketing and technical whiz kid called Michael Dell. International Business Machines, and other personal computer manufacturers such as Compaq, no doubt wish it had stayed that way. In the eight years since he founded his own computer company at the age of 19, Dell Computer Corporation has taken on 'Big Blue' and the computer industry establishment - and won significant victories. Michael Dell, a quietly-spoken, self-confident 27-year-old with an irrepressible entrepreneurial drive, who says he is having 'a great time' and can't imagine doing anything else, has consistently confounded all the sceptics. Since its beginnings in a college room at the University of Texas in Austin, his company has grown into a Dollars 1bn-a-year multinational which has re-written the rules of the PC marketing business. Direct sales, innovative marketing techniques and tight manufacturing controls have enabled Dell to under-price its competitors, while still delivering quality products and award-winning service to its customers - and solid profits to its shareholders. Success seems to come naturally to Michael Dell. When he was 12, he organised a national mail-order stamp auction business from the family home in Houston and made a Dollars 2,000 profit. Five years later, while still at high school, he displayed his marketing flair by thinking up novel ways to sell newspaper subscriptions. That initiative won him top honours as a sales representative for the Houston Post and earned him Dollars 18,000 in one year, working just two days a week. Meanwhile, he was indulging his real passion, fiddling with 'electronics kits, motors and anything with moving parts'. His first computer was an Apple II, followed by an IBM PC, and even before starting university he had won several computer programming awards and developed and sold a software copy-protection technique. At university he studied medicine 'because of parental pressure' - his elder brother and father are doctors. But Michael Dell and medicine did not get on. Looking back, he says with a smile that he is glad he is not a doctor because, 'the failure rate is too high in medicine - I like th. e more positive reinforcement of the customer being happy' During his first year at college he identified the opportunity for redefining the PC distribution chain by cutting out dealers and their high mark-ups and selling computers direct to end-users. From his college room he began by buying local computer dealers excess inventory, souping-up the machines and selling them on at a discount through newspaper advertisements. The business boomed and, in spite of parental disapproval, he quit college after his first year and set up his own company. With the exception of 1988, which Michael Dell admits was 'a difficult year' - and one quarter in particular when the company just managed to stay in the black with a Dollars 100,000 profit - sales and profits have risen steadily. In its latest financial year, while many other computer companies have been badly hit by the recession and cut-throat competition, Dell reported net income up 87 per cent at Dollars 50.9m on sales up 63 per cent at Dollars 889.9m. Over the past five years, Dell's average annual sales growth has been an astonishing 67 per cent and Michael Dell says proudly, 'we are not slowing down'. In the early days, most of Dell's sales went to computer enthusiasts, but now about half of its US sales go to Fortune 1000 companies and government departments. The company also has a growing overseas business, particularly in Europe, where it has set up a manufacturing plant in low-tax Ireland. Michael Dell, who is chairman and chief executive, says the basic drivers for competitiveness in the PC business are 'material costs, operating expense and tax rates', coupled with a willingness, and ability, to take risks. For example, while most companies carry about 14 weeks' supply of parts, Dell has shaved costs by cutting its parts inventory to 8.1 weeks. Similarly, Dell carries no inventory of finished machines, and since there are no dealers, there are no dealer inventories gathering dust and becoming obsolete. Every Dell computer is built to a customer's requirements and normally the order is delivered within five days. But probably the most important key to the company's success is its emphasis not only on price, but on listening and responding quickly to customers. 'If all you have is price you can attract a buyer once, but you won't retain that buyer,' says Michael Dell. Instead, Dell has evolved what it calls a 'direct working relationship' with customers. Dell takes 25,000 phone-calls worldwide a day. If a caller is one an existing customer, details of their equipment is stored a keyboard-stroke away on a database containing more than 750,000 names and addresses. The company pioneered unlimited telephone support for the lifetime of a product via a toll-free telephone 'hotline', and believes an engineer can solve 90 per cent of customer problems over the telephone. There are important spin-offs from this close customer relationship. It enables Dell to respond quickly to changes in tastes or requirements. For example, some customers said wanted the power of a machine built around an Intel 486 chip, but not in a big case. So Dell built a 486 in a small desktop unit. Other customers complained it was difficult to reach cards inside big tower systems on the floor under desks. So Dell put wheels on the boxes and made cards accessible from the top. In another customer -led move, Dell offered to ship systems fully loaded with applications software, if required. This can save a corporate customer buying, say, 100 machines, hours of time loading the software manually. Because Dell designs and builds its own machines it is able to react quickly to technological developments and can design, test and begin volume shipments of a new desktop machine within five months. 'It is important to remain on the leading edge of technology for a couple of reasons,' says Michael Dell. 'First, our customers absolutely require it - if you look at our product-line, our oldest product is 11 months old and more than half our sales come from products that were introduced in the last couple of months. Second, we are in a business that moves very quickly and speed can be a big advantage.' Listening to Michael Dell explain how he runs his company, it is difficult to believe he has had no formal management training, although he emphasises he does not hesitate to borrow a good idea. Somehow it seems almost instinctive to him. To stay in touch with 3,000 employees, he uses the internal electronic mail system, his car phone and pays frequent visits to the factory floor - and to overseas offices. His colleagues say he is always willing to listen and learn, and does not try to force his own views. Martin Slagter, Dell's vice-president in charge of European marketing and operations, adds: 'Michael is very non-precious of history; he has no qualms about hanging on to what happened even three months ago.' Like the company that bears his name, Michael Dell retains the energy and flexibility of youth. But these days he has cut back on the workaholic hours he once kept, to spend time with his wife, Susan, and three-month old daughter, Kira Elizabeth. Two things he has not given up are his delight in the latest electronic gizmo - he usually acts as the first tester for new Dell products - or of things that are smartly and efficiently designed such as his Honda Acura NSX, which he says is better than the Porsche 928 he used to drive. Dell Computer has helped reshape the PC industry, but can it keep up the pace? Michael Dell insists it can, provided the company remembers 'that customer-service is not a steady state thing - you have to always improve it, you have to keep changing.' As for his own future, he can't think of anything he would rather be. 'This is a tremendous amount of fun, and I'm having a great time,' he says. 'The real challenge was always Dell versus IBM - David versus Goliath. And it is still that.'</p>

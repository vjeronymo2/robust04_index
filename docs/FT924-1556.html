			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BLP employees stake rises to 48.3% after tender offer EMPLOYEES of BLP Group have increased their stake in the troubled USM-quoted wood laminates supplier to 48.3 per cent through a tender offer, the company announced yesterday. The mandatory offer was triggered in November when the Takeover Panel ruled that BLP's Employee Share Ownership Plan was acting in concert with directors and a minority shareholder. The offer has raised their combined holding from 45 per cent to 69 per cent, making the company invulnerable to hostile takeover. BLP was listed in 1987 and its shares peaked that year at 821p, valuing it at Pounds 48m. The stock has been on the decline since with the company wracked by ill-fated takeovers and other problems. It closed last night at 28p, just above the Esop's offer price and valuing the group at Pounds 1.9m compared with net assets of Pounds 8.69m. The concert party's stake is now seven times the maximum size recommended for Esops earlier this year by the Association of British Insurers speaking on behalf of a powerful group of institutional shareholders. BLP's Esop is handled by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, acting as the trustee through BLP (Jersey). The Esop has built up its stake in the company over the past two years without consultation of the employees. The company has lent it most of the money for the share purchases including funds for the current offer. Mr Malcolm Cohen, BLP's chairman, said majority ownership by the employees would not affect the running of the company. There are no rules governing the relationship between staff and an Esop, they have no say over the investment decisions by the body set up to run it, and there are no regulations preventing a company from using an Esop as an anti-takeover device, the ABI said. When BLP set up its Esop in 1990, the company believed employees would hold less than 10 per cent of the group's shares and only as an incentive scheme, Mr Cohen said. The Esop was run independently of BLP, by 'independent directors, receiving independent advice.' Mr Cohen said it was fortuitous that after a two-year fall in the company's share price, such a large stake was held by the trust, thereby affording 'security' against any potential takeover.</p>

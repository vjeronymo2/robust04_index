The modest increase can be attributed to foreign  investments, which rose over 10.6 percent during the first  quarter of the year. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 21  Jun 94 p 3A)    Speaking at the closing of the 26th National Meeting of  Fiscal Officials, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced  that all state governments will receive an additional allocation  of 1.2 billion new pesos, thanks to an increase in tax revenues.

(Mexico City  EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 8)    According to economic research by EL FINANCIERO, based on  information from the Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretariat and the DIARIO OFICIAL DE LA FEDERACION, the Law on  Economic Competition is being sidelined by the predominance of  foreign investment in priority areas for the country's  development. It is seen that foreign capital is increasing its  presence in the domestic market by forming strategic alliances.  This will promote the emergence of oligopolies that will limit  the free participation of Mexican enterprises. Key partnerships  are appearing in the commercial area with Gigante-Fleming;  Gigante-Carrefou; Liverpool-K-Mart; Comercial Mexicana-Price  Club; Comercial Mexicana-Toys'r'Us; and Cifra-WalMart. The  incursion of firms with foreign capital is not limited to a  single sector of the economy. They also include the food,  textile, and tourism sectors. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  (ANALISIS Supplement) in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 3a)    In the first quarter of 1994, Mexican Petroleum, Pemex,  netted a $44.5 million surplus in its petrochemical products'  trade balance.

(Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 16)    Foreign investment in the first two months of the year was  143 percent higher than the amount registered in the same period  in 1993.

Foreign investment  channeled to productive activity decreased 24.2 percent in the  first two months of 1994 while in 1989, this activity received  85.8 percent of the investments. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish  0118 GMT 25 Jun 94)    Foreign investment during the current administration  surpassed the goals set by the government at the beginning of  the term. Commerce Under Secretary Fernando Sanchez said the  1988-94 goal was $25 billion but has reached more than $42  billion.

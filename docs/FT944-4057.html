			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UN sees proliferation of Serb missile sites Serb forces have installed missile batteries covering at least 40 per cent of Bosnia to blunt Nato air power in a further blow to the viability of the United Nations mission in the country, Reuter reports from Zagreb. UN officials said that surface-to-air missile systems, springing up on Bosnian Serb-held terrain before and after Nato air raids on Serb targets, have compounded problems clouding the future of UN operations in Bosnia. Serb forces have set up missiles trained on '40 per cent of Bosnian air space or more' in a challenge to Nato, whose sorties over Bosnia are meant to deter attacks by combatants on UN humanitarian operations. The rocket sites were thought to be concentrated around the capital Sarajevo, Bihac and Banja Luka. The first two are government-controlled enclaves ringed by Serb forces, while Banja Luka is the largest Bosnian Serb city and bastion of their most vaunted army corps. UN officials said the proliferation of Serb air defence systems, coupled with the Serbs' detention of some 300 UN peacekeeping soldiers and increased shooting attacks on UN patrols, were wreaking havoc with the peacekeeping mission. 'This sort of outrageous behaviour is affecting the reassessment of the Unprofor mission going on in national capitals. There is a limit to what we can endure,' UN protection force spokesman Michael Williams told reporters in the Croatian capital. He said Unprofor's plight was symbolised by a new Serb mobile SAM-6 missile battery outside Sarajevo thwarting any resumption of a vital UN airlift to the Bosnian capital. The Serbs also have shoulder-fired SAM-2 and fixed-site SAM-7 missiles. The airlift was suspended after the Serbs threatened retaliation over Nato air strikes last month that knocked out several rocket sites and an airfield to punish the rebels for bombing Bihac, a supposed UN 'safe area'. The Serbs' warning, given teeth by repeated pinpointing of patrolling Nato jets by their air defence radar, also prompted Nato to ground its aerial task force for a week. 'There's been no let-up in Serb harassment of UN personnel (despite UN requests),' Mr Williams said. '(For example) the detention of UN personnel hardly contributes to a favourable assessment for (continuation) of Unprofor's mission. Detentions are part of a larger picture, increasingly preventing a successful operation of Unprofor. 'The limits must be decided by the national governments and the UN security council,' he said. 'Our credibility is obviously a matter of considerable concern now.' Mr Williams added that the Bosnian Serb high command was 'quite adamant' in telling Unprofor last Monday that it would not restore safety guarantees for the Sarajevo airlift as long as its forces were exposed to Nato air attack. The aerial bridge into Sarajevo has provided 83 per cent of the vital supplies for the Bosnian's capital's 380,000 inhabitants since it was started more than two years ago. There are fears that the city will start running critically short of supplies if the airlift is not resumed within a week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Israeli prime minister has declared it was high  time Israel ended its domination over a foreign people and  reconciled with the Palestinians. In this statement he made  yesterday before the ruling Labor party, Rabin said: Israel can  remain an occupying force. However, he added: It is high time  the Israelis realized the price for this will would be to pay  with their blood.    JANA's political editor commented on this report and said:  Can we infer from the statement made by the Israeli prime  minister that he has come to his senses, albeit late, or is it  merely another verbal maneuvering? We would like to think the  Israelis, who are strangers in Palestine, have come to their  senses and they have realized that their presence on a land  alien to them and against the will of its original inhabitants  and its real owners will cause their destruction and ruin.    Therefore, those who were fetched from Europe, America, and  other regions must return to their original homelands where they  will lead a peaceful life and they must leave Palestine to its  owners. Unless this happens, the Israelis will continue to face  a devastating danger; and if they want to be safe, they must  reject the plans of the Christian West, which hates them and  wants their destruction.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: A disturbing case of tunnel vision - Japanese bankers and the Eurotunnel ON THE face of it Eurotunnel, the operator of the channel tunnel linking Britain and France, has every reason to be pleased with relations with its Japanese bankers. An overwhelming majority of the 37 Japanese banks involved in the project last month voted to allow Eurotunnel to continue to draw down its borrowings, even though it was in breach of banking covenants. The vote among the Japanese banks, which are providing 23 per cent of Eurotunnel's Pounds 6.8bn borrowing facilities, is thought to have matched the level of support provided by the French. The Japanese banks' mounting bad debts, caused by the collapse in the property market, have led many to withdraw from international lending. Eurotunnel appears to be a notable exception. The reality is more complicated. Behind the public facade some leading Japanese banks, as well as several smaller regional institutions, harbour deep misgivings about Eurotunnel's prospects. Those doubts may yet surface, if as some Japanese bankers expect, Eurotunnel runs into another financial crisis next year. Such a crisis may well prompt a tussle between the public and the private sides of the Japanese banks' attitudes towards the project. Senior Eurotunnel executives describe the company's relationship with the Japanese banks as 'comfortable'. The direct corporate relationship between Eurotunnel and its bankers is underpinned by the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan which have shepherded their banks behind the project since 1986. The Bank of England and the European Investment Bank have also helped through their links with the Japanese long term credit banks. Before last month's vote Sir Alastair Morton, the Eurotunnel chief executive, visited about 11 top Japanese banks to deliver his message that construction was almost finished and would be completed without further significant cost increases. A senior Eurotunnel executive involved in the meetings said: 'The Japanese banks will support this project because they recognise its historic significance for European integration. To pull out of this project would be far too embarrassing politically for them." The banks are also under strong commercial pressure. Japanese manufacturers who have invested huge sums building plants in the UK as a base to sell their products in the single European market would not welcome any move by the banks which might jeopardise the tunnel. Eurotunnel also argues that the banks face minimal risks. The executive explained: 'The banks are assured the cashflow from this project well into the next century. If it takes longer than expected for that cash to arrive then the banks will make money by providing us with extensions to our borrowing facilities. The real risk is being carried by the shareholders not the banks because they will get their money.' Yet some of the leading Japanese banks are yet to be convinced. Several regional banks abstained in the vote, as a protest at what they regard as the lack of information provided by Eurotunnel about the outlook for passenger revenues when the tunnel opens in late 1993. A senior executive at one of the top four Japanese instructing banks, which organises the other banks in the syndicate, said: 'We are staying with the project to protect our position in case it folds. Eurotunnel has become a form of speculative finance, no one knows whether it will be successful." The four Japanese instructing banks are the Long Term Credit Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Tokyo and Sanwa Bank. The other main banks involved are Mitsubishi Bank, DKB, Sumitomo and Fuji Bank. Senior bankers admit to their pressing need to improve their banks' profitability to pay for their bad debts has changed their approach. One explained: 'When we entered the project there was no shortage of funds in Japan looking for lending opportunities. At that time the historic significance of the tunnel project may have been the greatest reason for our involvement. I am not sure a sound theoretical analysis was the basis for our involvement. But there is now a huge marketing risk with Eurotunnel that it may not generate the revenues it expects. Now we are asking to see the bottom line.' One of the main banks involved in the project has two staff working full time trying to independently assess Eurotunnel prospects because it complains Eurotunnel will not provide the information it has asked for. In spite of the agreement to allow Eurotunnel to continue drawing on its borrowings Japanese bankers expect another financial crisis in the early months of next year. As a condition of agreeing to the waiver, the banks have asked Eurotunnel to present a refinancing plan by May. That package will outline how Eurotunnel aims to raise more finance once the tunnel is open. The banks have insisted that this money will not come from them and it must not be superior to bank debt. A senior Tokyo banker commented: 'It is going to be very difficult for them to come up with a credible plan to raise more money from the market if construction is delayed and the revenue outlook remains very cloudy. If that plan fails to satisfy us then the waiver will fold, the project will run out of money and Eurotunnel will be in default." For its part Eurotunnel said it was happy to provide such a plan immediately. However, the banks preferred to delay it until next year.</p>

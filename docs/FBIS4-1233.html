Mr Ahtisaari, a former career  diplomat and a former director-general of the Finnish Foreign  Affairs Ministry, was for years closely connected with southern  Africa. "His role in the developments leading to Namibia's  independence was a particularly difficult one," the embassy  statement said. Mr Ahtisaari was at the time the special  representative of the United Nations secretary-general for  Namibia.</p>

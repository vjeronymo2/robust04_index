			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Sluggish growth in bank lending confirmed LENDING by banks and building societies continues to grow at a sluggish pace, according to figures released yesterday by the Bank of England and the British Bankers' Association. The Bank's final monetary statistics for February showed that bank and building society lending increased by only Pounds 284m on a seasonally adjusted basis last month, compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 400m growth and actual average growth of Pounds 2.4bn over the previous six months. In its latest quarterly analysis of sterling lending by the main UK banking groups, the association said seasonally adjusted lending grew by Pounds 2.06bn in the three months to February against Pounds 1.9bn in the previous three months. That represented an annualised growth rate of 4 per cent. The association's breakdown of lending, which is not seasonally adjusted, showed that Pounds 1.14bn, or just over half the increase in lending in the latest quarter, was to the financial sector. Lending to individuals grew by Pounds 952m and accounted for much of the other growth in lending. Lending for house purchase grew by Pounds 1.05bn in the latest quarter compared with Pounds 1.48bn in the previous three months, reflecting seasonal factors and the depressed state of the housing market. The association said there was a small Pounds 102m net repayment of lending for consumption. The association said the strong growth in lending to financial companies may have reflected the need of securities houses to finance increased activity on the market for UK government gilt-edged stock, as well as increased leasing activity. Manufacturers and construction companies repaid bank lending for the fourth successive quarter. The repayments of Pounds 365m and Pounds 113m respectively suggested that those companies were still using the proceeds of rights issues to repay bank debt. Last year was the worst in living memory in the business lending and leasing markets, Mr Brian Hassell, chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association, said yesterday. Demand fell and lenders to most business sectors suffered a sharp increase in the amount of bad debt. Small businesses were particularly badly affected.</p>

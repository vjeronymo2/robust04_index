			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blunkett calls for delegates to unite on social and economic policies Mr David Blunkett, the party chairman and shadow health secretary, called on delegates to unite behind policies designed to achieve social justice and economic efficiency, Ivor Owen writes. The message sent out by the conference, he said, should confirm that Labour under the leadership of Mr Tony Blair was 'in tune with the British people'. Mr Blunkett looked forward to full employment and a national minimum wage 'going hand-in-hand together'. He said: 'Equity and the narrowing of the gap between rich and poor must be our watchword.' He also sought to reassure delegates who fear the conference's policymaking role is being undermined. He welcomed Mr Blair's pledge to follow the example of John Smith in providing an 'inclusive, open style' of leadership. Mr Blunkett said this should ensure that 'all of us have a part to play' in building the foundations for victory at the next general election. The party's vision needed to embrace the aspirations of the middle classes and those whose only hope for the future was the return of a Labour government. Putting social justice and economic efficiency into action should result in decent jobs and decent wages. Mr Blunkett condemned the redistribution of wealth by Conservative chancellors, which he said had been against those who could least afford it and in favour of those making the most even when they did not deserve to do so.</p>

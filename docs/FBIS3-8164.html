			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Vienna, March 6 (AFP) -- The head of the Bosnian  Croat delegation at talks here on details of a future  Croat-Moslem federation said Sunday [6 March] he was optimistic  they would be concluded by the March 15 deadline for signing a  final agreement in Washington. Talks began here Friday after  the Bosnian Croats and mainly-Moslem Bosnian government signed  an initial agreement there last Tuesday to form a federation.    Delegation leader Ivo Sanader, Croatia's deputy foreign  minister, said it was "difficult to say" when the new federation  would actually be set up, but "the most important thing is that  we have to find a solution which can satisfy the new federation  and the Republic of Croatia. All of us are ready to do this."    Bosnian Justice Minister and delegation head Kasem Trnka and  Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak however refused to comment  on the negotiations, saying it was "too early."    One of the most difficult issues at the talks, held at the  U.S. Embassy here, is how to carve up the cantons which will  form the Swiss-style federation. The U.S.-sponsored plan,  agreed in principle by Croat and Moslem leaders, aims to  establish a federation inside Bosnia-Herzegovina made up of  autonomous Moslem and Croat cantons. This would later form a  looser, mainly economic confederation with neighbouring Croatia.  The Serbs would be encouraged to accept a two-way division of  the territory with the federation existing alongside their own  Bosnian Serb republic.    U.S. officials here said Saturday they would attempt to  persuade Bosnian Serbs to back plans for the Croat-Moslem  federation. [passage omitted]</p>

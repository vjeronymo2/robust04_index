			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Property shares lost in space - Bottom Line Property shares outperformed the wider equity market by almost 50 per cent last year, so the sector was due to catch its breath. Its slight underperformance in the first half of the year appeared to be just such a pause. Yet the sector's 6 per cent slide over the last two weeks - bringing its underperformance since the middle of July to around 10 per cent - looks like a more serious loss of wind. The key to this sudden disillusionment lies with the split personality of commercial property as a financial asset. When rents are rising property has a lot in common with equities. Rising rental income drives capital values higher, just as dividend growth drives share prices, making property an effective hedge against inflation. Thanks to the practice of long-term leases with upwards-only rent reviews, though, property provides its owners with a fixed income even when rents are falling. Under these circumstances it has much more in common with bonds. The bond-like nature of property worked to its advantage last year. Property yields fell in line with bond yields, which meant that values rose even though rents were still falling. But for property values to detach from bonds investors have to believe that rents are going to rise. Optimism on this score was enough to keep values stable through the first half of this year in spite of turmoil in the bond markets. The snag is that optimism about rental growth now looks misplaced. In January most stockbrokers assumed that rents would be rising across all types of commercial property by the end of the year. Yet up to the end of August rents were either falling or flat. The upturn in rents looks unlikely to come until the middle of next year. Against that background the property market looks becalmed. If bond yields are reasonably stable there is no reason why commercial property values should actually fall. Rents are bound to rise as economic recovery takes hold and businesses start to expand. But that prospect is too far distant to justify pushing values higher. Property company shares have suffered twice over. Net asset values (the amount which could, in theory, be raised if the company was broken up and its assets sold) were forecast to rise by anything up to 15 per cent both this year and next. The outcome this year looks likely to be more like 8 per cent. Forecasts for 1995 now range from 6 per cent to 12 per cent. Moreover, shares were already expensive when measured against the value of their underlying assets. Before the recent slide the sector stood at a discount of 7 per cent per cent to net assets. With no immediate prospect of rising rents and property prices, that rating became impossible to justify. Even now the sector is hardly cheap. The discount to net assets has widened to around 13 per cent, but that compares to a long-term average of 20 per cent. Since the upswing of the property cycle is still in its early stages, shares might be expected to trade at a narrower discount than the average. But they will have to fall further before bargain-hunters step in. 'The outlook for capital and rental growth has got a lot duller over the summer,' said Chris Turner, analyst at BZW. 'Under those circumstances the shares are just not cheap enough to encourage buyers.' Even when rents start to rise the benefits will not be spread evenly across all types of commercial property. Modern office space is already in short supply and should perform well. Yet there is an overhang of older offices which could take years to let. Retail warehouses are in demand but there are plenty of empty high street shops. Property companies which own new portfolios and manage their assets energetically are most likely to flourish. The stock market has already realised as much. Even now Pillar and Argent, two of the sector favourites, trade at around net asset value. Alec Pelmore, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'If the property markets is not helping, it is the ability of management to add value to their assets which really counts.'</p>

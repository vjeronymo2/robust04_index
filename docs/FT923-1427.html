			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The cynical view of yesterday's base rate cut is that it was timed to distract attention from a particularly poor set of trade figures. Doubtless the government is glad to have got the cut away with scarcely a murmur from the exchange markets. Perhaps that leaves room for further reductions, but the spike in index-linked gilts shows the financial markets are not oblivious to the inflationary risk. And the trade figures point to caution down the road. The most obvious explanation for the weakness of manufacturing exports and strength of imports in the run-up to the ERM crisis - that the exchange rate was overvalued - is also the least likely. There was precious little complaining from industry on that score. The trend could mean some flickering of recovery in which case the devaluation was less necessary than it seemed. That would be borne out by the August retail sales, but contradicted by survey evidence and other indicators. Or there could be a structural weakness, whereby even a recession-bound Britain is forced to supply itself abroad. In that case, recovery will quickly make the trade figures worse in spite of the devaluation, and not just because of the infamous J-curve effect. From the new year there will be an unnerving information vacuum while the statisticians adjust for the European single market. By then worries about Britain's trade performance could keep sterling under pressure, upsetting interest rate hopes.</p>

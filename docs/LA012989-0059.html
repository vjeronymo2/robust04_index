			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD  </P> <P> Let us pray for and work toward building a "kinder and gentler nation." As a  saddened combat veteran of Vietnam, I am acutely aware that instead of honoring  our nation's courage, bravery, and humanity we celebrate excitement, wild  action, and our American sense of unassailable certitude. We glorify  "Rambo-style" attacks as solutions to our problems.  </P> <P> Now, sadly, we have a man who tried to solve his own problems by using a  "Rambo-style" attack on our children.  </P> <P> STEVE BEARMAN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

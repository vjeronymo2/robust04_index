			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS: A SCORE OR TWO MAY DO IT  </P> <P> Once upon a time they used to advertise football games featuring a great  offense against a great defense as "the irresistible force vs. the immovable  object."  </P> <P> When a lousy offense faced a lousy defense, the wags would turn it upside down  and bill it as "the resistible force vs. the movable object."  </P> <P> Today's game between the Steelers and the Chargers at Three Rivers Stadium is  "the resistible force vs. the even-more resistible force."  </P> <P> The Charger offense has gained fewer yards than any team in the NFL this  yearexcept Pittsburgh, a team that has also scored the league's fewest points.  The Charger offense has scored seven touchdowns in its past six games. The  Steeler offense has produced one touchdown in the past nine quarters.  </P> <P> This is a game between two 4-6 teams that appear to be going nowhere. The  Steelers appear to be getting there faster.  </P> <P> Three of the four shutouts in the NFL's 140 games this year have been at the  expense of the Steeler offense. Last week, Chicago beat the Steelers, 20-0,  taking the ball away six times, and prompting Steve Hubbard of the Pittsburgh  Press to write: "The only object on earth whitewashed more often than the  Steelers' offense is the graffiti on New York's subways."  </P> <P> "I just wish I could play, 'I Dream of Jeannie' and flip all this stuff out of  the way," said Tim Worley, Pittsburgh's rookie running back.  </P> <P> "Right now, everything's going backward," said Steeler defensive back Rod  Woodson. "Everything's going the wrong way."  </P> <P> And it doesn't figure to turn around for the Pittsburgh offense against the  Chargers, whose defense has allowed the fewest points in the league the past  eight weeks (111). That's fewer than 14 points per game.  </P> <P> The Chargers have won two consecutive games -- upset victories over  Philadelphia and the Raiders. But Coach Dan Henning admitted last Monday it's  more important for his offense not to "screw it up" for the defense than it is  to score touchdowns.  </P> <P> "It's been a bumpy road," says Charger guard David Richards. "You can win more  games playing great defense than great offense. But we need to carry our share  of the load."  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, Charger linebacker Gary Plummer, the team's leading tackler,  told quarterback Jim McMahon that "all we need is 20 points a week."  </P> <P> If the Chargers had scored just 20 points in each of their 10 games this year,  their record would be 7-2-1 and they would be in first place in the AFC West  (one of those victories would have been against Denver, which would have  dropped the 8-2 Broncos to 7-3).  </P> <P> Oddly enough, the last time the Chargers played in Three Rivers Stadium it was  "the movable object vs. the even-more movable object."  </P> <P> The two teams combined for 867 yards of offense. But the Chargers turned the  ball over five times, quarterback Dan Fouts left the game early, and they lost,  52-24.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh's quarterback that day was Mark Malone, who completed 18 of 22  passes for 253 yards and four touchdowns. Malone wound up being traded to the  Chargers before the 1988 season, and he failed miserably as Fouts' successor.  Now the Chargers find themselves with McMahon, who has the birth certificate of  a 30-year-old, the body of a 50-year-old and the sense of humor of a  three-year-old.  </P> <P> Speaking of youth, Charger rookie Burt Grossman bruised the egos of several  Steelers this week when he alternately ripped Worley, former Pitt teammates Tom  Ricketts and Jerry Olsavsky and the Steeler personnel department.  </P> <P> Those remarks, his own team's inconsistency on offense and the fact that two of  Pittsburgh's four victories have come against Super Bowl contenders --  Cleveland and Minnesota -- have Henning worried.  </P> <P> Henning is a good worrier. He got a lot of practice in Atlanta while coaching  four seasons for the Rankin Smith family. The Smiths own the hapless Falcons  and are referred to in impolite Atlanta society as "The Clampetts," a  comparison that reflects poorly on Uncle Jed, Granny, Jethro and Elly May of  the "Beverly Hillbillies."  </P> <P> Henning is also worried about the artificial turf at Three Rivers Stadium. He  says it is "old and slick." It is only the second game off natural grass for  the Chargers this year.  </P> <P> This is also the first of four road games in five weeks for the Chargers, a  team that is 3-3 at home and 1-3 on the road.  </P> <P> Grossman aside, the Chargers would like to enter quietly, win easily and sneak  out of town before the winter arrives or the artificial turf gets any slicker.  </P> <P> "They (the Steelers) will definitely use what Burt said to motivate their  players and fans," Richards says. "It's difficult enough to play in that  stadium. My motto is: Praise 'em, play 'em, and praise 'em after you play 'em."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Running back Tim Worley, the Steelers' No. 1 draft choice, is the team's  second-leading rusher with 300 yards on 91 carries. He is unhappy he isn't  getting the ball more. "I've never known a back worth his salt who didn't want  the ball more," says Charger Coach Dan Henning. . . . Charger cornerback Gill  Byrd is tied for the AFC lead with five interceptions. Defensive end Leslie  O'Neal leads the conference in sacks with 10.5. . . . The Chargers have  outscored opponents, 67-46, in the fourth quarter this year. Opponents have  outscored them, 59-13, in the second quarter. . . . The Steelers have been held  under 100 yards rushing seven times in 10 games.  </P></p>

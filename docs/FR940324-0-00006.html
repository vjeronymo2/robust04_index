			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee needs such information for the purpose of computing and collecting assessments, which are necessary to finance the program. When the reporting requirement was first implemented, the Committee believed that the best method for obtaining the necessary information was to require handlers to report to the Committee the volume of fresh market shipments at the end of each week during the harvesting and shipping season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also uses the information from the reports in planning and evaluating market development activities and recommending production research projects. This information is also made available to the industry on a composite basis to aid growers and handlers in planning their individual operations and making marketing decisions during the season. At the time of implementation, the reporting burden was estimated to be five minutes for a handler to complete each weekly report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee was experiencing problems in receiving the reports on a timely basis from many handlers. Many of the handlers not reporting were smaller grower-handlers (2 to 10 acres) who only operate two or three weeks of the year and do their bookkeeping at the end of the season. During the harvest season, these small handlers, mostly family-run operations, are very busy and have complained that weekly reporting is burdensome to them. These reports are used by the Committee in calculating the assessments owed by each handler. Thus, it is important that the reports be filed on a timely basis. Because many handlers filed reports late, the Committee experienced difficulty in collecting all assessments. The Committee expended much time and effort in identifying and locating these handlers. In addition, handlers who filed their reports on a timely basis complained to the Committee that others were not being assessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met on August 28, 1993, to discuss these complaints and reporting problems and unanimously recommended revising the administrative rules and regulations by expanding the period of coverage of the reports to be filed from one week to one month. This reduced the number of reports filed on an annual basis from approximately 24 to approximately 6. Prior to the issuance of the interim final rule, the reporting process for the 24-week period expended approximately 203 reporting hours annually. The interim final rule reduced the reporting hours to approximately 93, a reduction of 110 hours on an annual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also recommended that the report be required to be filed no later than seven days after the end of each month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee believed that its recommendation would decrease the reporting burden on handlers by eliminating unnecessary reporting while still providing the Committee with the information it needs to properly administer the order. The interim final rule brought the reporting requirements into conformance with current industry operating practices and provided an acceptable time frame for the submission of reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee believed that this relaxation would enable the small family-run operations to file reports and pay assessments on a timely basis, and reduce the time and effort the Committee expends on locating handlers who have not filed reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee expressed concern about the effect monthly reporting will have on their marketing efforts. The weekly reporting provided a good source of information that was used in their marketing decisions. It was determined that the monthly reporting will provide sufficient information to assist the Committee in its marketing efforts and if any problems arise at a later date, alternate sources of obtaining this information on a weekly basis can be explored. The Committee continues to believe, at this time, that it is more important to ensure that all handlers are properly filing reports with the Committee and paying assessments that are due on a timely and equitable basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

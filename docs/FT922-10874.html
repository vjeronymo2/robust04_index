			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: Important issues raised by lease assignment argument Sir, The letters from John Banham (April 10) and David Lewis (April 22) raise important issues. The whole question of privity of contract has been reviewed by the Law Commission and in carrying out that review it has consulted interested parties. The government is due to consult further on the commission's recommendations before publishing any proposals for change. This is undoubtedly an issue which landlords and tenants will approach from very different perspectives. The landlord, perhaps a pension fund looking to meet long-term obligations, when agreeing the terms of the original long-term contract will have taken account of the status of his tenant. The terms agreed will need to satisfy his requirement for an income stream from the investment throughout the term of the lease in order to meet those pension obligations. If the tenant seeks to assign the lease before it expires, the fund would probably agree more readily because of the protection available to it by current law on privity of contract. On the other hand, changing economic circumstances can produce apparent absurdities such as those highlighted by John Banham. These can fall in what seems an unfair way on a business which has changed significantly since it signed the original lease. Two points stand out. First, David Lewis is right to oppose abolition of privity for existing contracts. Such a move should not be contemplated without permitting the investment funds also to reconsider retrospectively their agreement to lease assignment. Contracts freely negotiated between parties having equal bargaining power should not be interfered with at some later date. Second, there may be an argument for abolishing the privity principle for new contracts for the reasons spelled out by John Banham, although this would certainly change the structure of UK property investment. Setting aside any contract inevitably results in unfairness to one of the parties. If the government chooses this option, then it must, at the very least, do all it can to minimise the degree of unfairness through, for instance, a long transitional period.

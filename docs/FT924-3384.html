			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Solid State Farm rides out the hurricane - How the US insurer can absorb billions of dollars of catastrophe losses ROGER Joslin, treasurer of the giant State Farm Insurance Company, looks pained. He has just been asked about the size of the catastrophe claims which the US's biggest car and home insurance provider has faced this year. Mr Joslin does not know the precise figure, but a few clicks on the calculator provide the answer: Dollars 3.24bn. The bulk of this - more than Dollars 2bn - comes from Hurricane Andrew, which devastated southern Florida in late-August. Even in the sanguine world of insurance, where disasters are everyday business, Andrew caused unprecedented upheaval. Within days, State Farm, the largest writer of homeowners' policies in the 'sunshine state', had drafted in almost half its 4,000 loss-adjusters. By late-October, it still had 2,300 extra employees in the area. In the meantime, 110,000 individual claims had flooded in. But if administering the disaster was an unparalleled immediate task, the financial implications are a longer-lasting problem. The cash drain from Andrew - which some estimates now put at around Dollars 14bn for the US insurance industry overall - not only followed large catastrophe losses earlier in 1992, but came after a spate of tough years. Most big US insurers flinched publicly when the hurricane compounded this run of ill-fortune. Allstate and The Prudential, two of State Farm's largest rivals, had their debt ratings lowered. But State Farm, a mutual, owned by its policyholders rather than by shareholders, made little public comment, despite the lack of catastrophe reinsurance cover. Rating agencies made no changes: AM Best, for example, which specialises in the insurance sector, retained an A-plus rating for State Farm's fire and casualty arm, its second-highest level. What kind of company can absorb multi-billion dollar losses? The answer lies in the unassuming mid-west town of Bloomington, about 100 miles from Chicago, where State Farm has its headquarters. The business was founded in 1922 by a retired farmer, Mr George Mercherle, who thought that existing insurers were offering country folk a bad deal by charging them the same rates for car insurance as city dwellers. So, on the back of cheaper premiums and using the federal Farm Bureau network as a distribution source, he started State Farm. The organisation quickly proved a success. It added a life insurance division in 1929; had established a substantial local head office within a decade; and finally set up an agency sales force in 1949. Today, the scale of State Farm is difficult to grasp. In terms of market share, according to A. M. Best, it accounted for 21.4 per cent of all private passenger car premiums in the US in 1991, and 20 per cent of homeowners' policies. This easily outstripped Allstate, its nearest rival, which held 12.5 per cent and 12.4 per cent respectively. State Farm's car and home insurance divisions are augmented by a large life business and a much smaller health operation. Assets in the three main units  -car, homeowners, and life - stood at Dollars 42.7bn, Dollars 11.9bn and Dollars 14.1bn respectively at end-1991, while policyholders' surpluses were Dollars 11bn, Dollars 2.8bn, and Dollars 1.64bn. Sales are handled by about 18,000 independent, self-employed agents, who keep a percentage of the premiums which they bring in. But, solid and admired as State Farm may be, it has not always had an easy ride. Its old-fashioned, mid-western culture has come under attack, and competitors, long resentful of the insurer's go-it-alone stance in a generally clubby industry, have been quick to point to the flaws. Most notably, there has been a lawsuit which claimed the insurer discriminated against the recruitment of women agents. In 1985, a judge found State Farm liable, and earlier this year the company finally negotiated a Dollars 157m settlement. It was the largest sum ever paid in a case brought under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Management succession has been another touchy area. In the 1950s, the task of heading State Farm passed from the Mercherles to the Rust family. But Mr Edward Rust, the second generation in his family to run the company, died suddenly in 1985. He was replaced by a third-generation Rust, Mr Edward B. Rust Jr, who was just 35 years old when he took up the reins. This raised eyebrows outside the company, although insiders say little has changed internally. 'They've been very conservative, and they've pursued a very straightforward, consistent strategy,' says Mr Jack Snyder, senior vice-president of the property-casualty division at A. M. Best. While such issues have niggled at the public image, State Farm has confronted more fundamental problems in its main business areas. Car insurance has become a fraught political issue - with the industry anxious to push up premiums, citing rising claim costs and consumers arguing that affordable insurance is virtually impossible in some areas. In California, matters came to a head four years ago when the electorate passed Proposition 103, demanding that local insurers 'roll back' their rates and pay out rebates. Some insurers - but not, so far, State Farm - have reacted to the problem by walking away from certain states. 'We've certainly talked about it,' says Mr Joslin, though he admits that no such move is seriously contemplated. The company is contesting a Dollars 235m rebate demand by the Californian insurance commissioner, claiming it has never made an 'excessive' return on its business there. Nevertheless, matters on the car front improved substantially last year. The underwriting loss at State Farm's car division fell from more than Dollars 1.6bn to around Dollars 525m following improvements in claims experience and rate increases. The division posted a Dollars 1.3bn profit after tax, against a Dollars 261m loss the previous year. By contrast, the fire and casualty business - which includes homeowners' insurance - remains bleak, partly because of the catastrophe losses. With underwriting losses increasing in 1991, this division produced an after-tax loss of Dollars 235m last year, and the combination of Hurricane Andrew, the earlier catastrophe losses, and subsequent storms (including Hurricane Iniki) has put paid to any recovery in 1992. 'We'll face a substantial loss,' says Mr Joslin, 'but not one which will destroy our financial foundation.' But, for all these problems, the company seems to have little intention of ploughing new furrows. 'We've prospered by sticking to our knitting,' says Mr Joslin, looking askance when subjects like international expansion - even as close to home as Mexico - are mentioned. But, as Mr Snyder points out, 'there's still a lot of markets State Farm can penetrate. There's still more scope for cross-selling. After all, everyone with a State Farm car policy does not yet have a homeowners' policy.'  --------------------------------------------------------------- MARKET SHARES FOR STATE FARM  AND ALLSTATE (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                 HOMEOWNERS                PRIVATE CAR Year     State Farm    Allstate   State Farm     Allstate  --------------------------------------------------------------- 1991       20.4          12.4        21.4          12.5 1990       19.0          12.4        21.0          12.4 1989       18.4          12.0        20.4          12.1 1988       18.3          11.5        19.5          11.7 1987       18.9          10.8        18.8          11.2 1986       17.5          10.4        18.9          10.8 1985       18.2           9.6        18.6          10.4 1984       17.2           9.3        17.7          10.5 1983       16.8           9.3        17.8          10.8 1982       16.4           9.6        17.5          11.0  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: AM Best  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

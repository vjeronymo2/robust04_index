			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Tilting windmills The UK government will shortly begin to consider which renewable energy projects should qualify for subsidies under the latest round of the non-fossil fuel obligation. The Noffo, as it is known, obliges electricity companies to buy some of their power from generation sources other than coal, oil or gas, and it finances the extra cost by imposing a levy, currently 10 per cent, on electricity bills. Although the greatest proportion of the levy goes to the nuclear power industry, about Pounds 20m a year is available to support 'green' energy. The money is allocated through a combination of competitive bidding by applicants and ministerial judgments. By all accounts, the new Noffo round will be heavily oversubscribed. Applicants are proposing a variety of projects ranging from solar and tidal power to landfill gas and coppicing. But the most numerous contenders by far are wind farms. In the past, the subsidy has been seen as a benign element in a worthy environmental cause. But this time it coincides with an upsurge of public concern about the proliferation of wind farms in some of the country's most beautiful landscapes. The allocation of contracts will therefore be subject to close public scrutiny. Contrary to the impression environmentalists would like to convey, the case for renewable energy is not very strong. There is no shortage of energy (the UK's oil and gas reserves continue to grow, and output is about to set new records), and there is little domestic technology to protect. The environmental argument carries some weight, but far greater gains could be achieved by raising the performance of existing plant than by encouraging uneconomic green projects. An efficiency gain of only 3 per cent in energy use would save more electricity than could be produced from all the renewable energy sources likely to be up and running by the year 2000 - and would avoid the visual blight of much green power. Unfortunately, Noffo money can only be spent on renewables. There is some consolation in the fact that the system of competitive bidding is a spur to efficiency. But since the government sees Noffo as a talisman of its commitment to environmental matters, there is doubt about the rigour with which it vets the projects which come before it. The only justification for subsidising any power project, renewable or otherwise, is if it can stand on its own feet within an acceptable time frame. The taxpayer owes no favours to green power.</p>

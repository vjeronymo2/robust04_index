			<p>BFN     [Text] The PLO representatives have reached agreement with  the Zionist regime on maintaining security and dealing with  judicial matters in Gaza and Jericho. On the basis of this  agreement, the PLO police are not authorized to arrest or  question the Zionists living in these regions, even if the  Zionists sabotage security. On the other hand, the Zionist  regime forces are allowed to arrest the Palestinians living in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho, without handing them over to the PLO  police. It has been arranged that Rabin, the prime minister of  the Zionist regime, and 'Arafat, the PLO leader, should meet in  Cairo tomorrow to finalize the outcome of the two sides' talks.  Our correspondent in Beirut has interviewed the secretary  general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad Movement [Dr. Shaqaqi] in  Beirut on this meeting and the possible agreements at the  meeting. We draw your attention to his report:    [Correspondent] Good evening, dear viewers of the Islamic  Republic of Iran's television news. According to the remarks  made by the secretary general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad  Movement, tomorrow is the day of signing the final accord on  Gaza and Jericho in Cairo. This will be classed as another day  of defeat in the history of the Arabs and Palestine. During a  telephone conversation with the Central News Unit office in  Beirut today, he said: The issue of Palestinian self-rule in  Gaza and Jericho is nothing more than a tool in the hand of the  Zionists; and establishment of such an autonomous government  does not realize the aspiration of the Palestinian mojahedin and  combatants to create a true Palestinian state and government.    On the role played by the Palestinian forces opposed to the  Gaza-Jericho accord, Dr. Shaqaqi said: At this stage the goal  of all the combatants should remain continuation of the struggle  and jihad for the unchanging Palestinian aspiration. It is up  to the forces opposed to the peace with the Zionist regime to  compile a comprehensive and calculated plan to fight the Zionist  regime, even if such a struggle were to continue for another 20  years.    On the future of the intifadah after implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord, he said: Far from being cxurtailed, the  military operation will -- in my opinion -- intensify, even  though continuation of the military operations under these  circumstances will be difficult. We will, however, exert every  effort.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Bankers called to account for investor unease: Barclays to balance its portfolio and make managers responsible for credit risk SIR Peter Middleton, Barclays' deputy chairman, had a simple answer yesterday to the question of why the bank had not changed its senior management as a result of making a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss. 'There have been some management changes at the top. This was my first year,' he said with a chuckle. Such sentiments did nothing to comfort the man sitting next to Sir Peter yesterday. Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, was already having a difficult time explaining when and how he will split his two jobs. He has promised to do this because of investor unease. Sir Peter came to Barclays in 1991 from being permanent secretary at the Treasury. After pressure grew on Mr Buxton to split his jobs, there was speculation that Sir Peter might take over as chairman. Mr Buxton insisted yesterday that he could say little about future corporate governance. Mr Buxton and Barclays' board had already given the market more to feel unhappy about by halving the final dividend to limit the reduction in the bank's tier 1 capital ratio. This was in spite of earlier indications that 1993 would provide enough of a recovery to maintain the final dividend. Yet first indications were that the dividend cut had not increased investor dissatisfaction with Barclays' management. 'I don't think it will have a direct effect on Buxton's position,' said one fund manager, 'He was around when the lending was made, but you can't blame one man alone'. Other investors will take convincing that the internal culture and controls that allowed Barclays to make so many bad loans related to UK property and construction are being changed. The UK property and construction sectors account for more than 40 per cent of domestic bank provisions of Pounds 1.96bn. The fact that Mr Buxton was managing director when much of this lending was made has led to ill-feeling. 'I feel very strongly about the fiefdom at Barclays,' says one investor. 'Buxton played a crucial role in setting the strategy in the 1980s, but there does not seem to be accountability.' Mr Buxton himself put a rather different interpretation on his involvement in this lending yesterday. 'I was clearly involved in the decisions that came to the board, but credit decisions were not a board matter. I was not on the credit side of the bank during that period,' he said. Barclays has taken some steps to allocate responsibility for the past. It has reviewed all loans of more than Pounds 250,000 which went wrong, and managers involved in more than their fair share of poor lending have been warned. 'Some careers have suffered,' said Mr Buxton. Yet the bank has faced a difficulty in altering the past for two reasons. One is that the bank encouraged lending growth before and after a Pounds 922m rights issue in 1988. 'If we fired everybody who made a bad loan, we would be a very small bank,' said Mr Peter Wood, Barclays' finance director. The second reason is that high exposure to the property and construction sectors was a tradition in the bank before the problem period of the late 1980s. When Sir John Quinton, the former chairman, sanctioned an expansion, the property sector was the natural place for the bank to start. The cost of this strategy was made clear in the figures yesterday. Compared with National Westminster's Pounds 1.6bn specific bad debt provision for last year, which was spread across many sectors with 47 per cent on loans of under Pounds 50,000, Barclays' bad debt was boosted by more poor large loans. Almost Pounds 600m of the UK specific charge of Pounds 1.96bn was created by 27 loans of more than Pounds 5m. This figure includes Barclays' single provision of Pounds 240m on a Pounds 422m loan to the property developer Imry. The Imry loss was made worse because the bank failed to syndicate its loans. Mr Buxton does not believe the lesson is that Barclays should reduce its future exposure to property lending to proportions held by other banks. But he thinks the bank must instead rely less on the residual valuations of property schemes based on what they might earn when completed. The biggest reform that has sprung from the problems is a change in the system of assessing risk, and balancing the bank's lending portfolio. Both tasks used to be carried out by a central advances department, which had to assess large corporate loans after they had been proposed. The first problem with this system was that there was too little analysis of the balance of the portfolio, allowing property loans to grow disproportionately. The bank has just appointed Mr Alan Brown to the new post of director of credit policy to reinforce its analysis of the portfolio. The second problem was that managers in branch banking had little incentive to be careful about corporate loans. Because the central department assessed credit away from the point at which loans were made, responsibility was diffused and nobody was individually accountable. Barclays is trying to alter this by ensuring that line managers who make loans are also responsible for credit risk. 'There was not enough responsibility for individual accounts. If someone is really put in charge of a loan, he jolly well makes sure he carries it through,' said Mr Buxton. The underlying question is whether this type of reform will convince investors that the pain of the dividend cut is worth bearing in the expectation that management will improve. Mr Buxton is not offering much hope of a substantial recovery this year, and emphasises the uncertainty of bad debts. The problem he faces is that reforms of credit assessment and the balance of lending will not take effect for several years yet because of the lag in loans going wrong. There is plenty of scope yet for questions about Barclays' senior management structure before such effects are seen. Details, Page 20; Lex, Page 16; Observer, Page 15</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Experts at </F> China Academy of Social Sciences Publish Pessimistic Forecast,  Expecting Social Instability in Rural Areas This Year"]    [Text] A blue paper on current social conditions --  written recently by Lu Xueyi, director of the Sociology  Institute of the China Academy of Social Sciences, and his  colleagues -- predicted that China's rural communities would  face many problems in 1994, and that it would be hard to effect  a fundamental turn for the better in the situation, which might  even get worse.    When reviewing the situation in 1993, Lu Xueyi, an expert in  rural society, and his colleagues said: Last year, the social  situation in the Chinese countryside was more serious than the  economic situation. Although the situation of agricultural  production was basically stable, social stability worsened. "It  was a year full of worrisome events, but it was fortunate that  no major trouble occurred."    They predicted that this year, town and township enterprises  in China would continue to develop at a high speed, but that  agricultural production would remain stagnant. According to Lu  Xueyi's prediction, China's cotton production will pick up in  1994, but will reach only the 1992 level. The grain production  situation, however, will not be satisfactory because of the  continued decrease in the area of farmland, plus other reasons.  It is likely that gross grain output will decrease by 10 to 20  billion jin.    They held that along with the appearance of stagnation in  agricultural production, the grain supply will become more  strained. It is expected that this year's grain output will  reach some 440 billion jin, and if the reserve in the state  granaries and in the hands of peasants are put together with  imported grain, demand and supply still may be basically  balanced. However, the degree of strain in the cotton supply  will not be mitigated in 1994, so if things are not handled  properly, another "cotton war" may be triggered.    Another problem that makes the rural situation worrisome is  that in 1994, although town and township enterprises will  continue to develop rapidly, peasants' income still will  increase slowly and the rural market will continue to be less  brisk then the urban market. On the other hand, it will be hard  to lessen the burdens imposed on peasants, and such burdens may  exceed 5 percent of the net annual income per capita.    A particularly worrisome fact is that the contradiction  between the local governments, on one side, and the individually  run and private enterprises in rural areas will become the focus  of the social problems in 1994. In some localities, this may  bring about social conflicts.    Lu Xueyi pointed out: The implementation of the tax-division  system will become a serious test for most individually run and  private enterprises in the vast central and western regions, as  they have just started operation, and it also will become a  serious test of the relationship between the local governments  and these individual-run and private enterprises. The  authorities concerned must pay sufficient attention to matters  in this regard because the sentiments of private entrepreneurs  will affect the vast peasantry.    He held that in order to mitigate the contradiction, it is  necessary to do a good job in the following three aspects:    First, reducing the burdens imposed on peasants and removing  charges according to the relevant policies.    Second, developing town and township enterprises, especially  those in the central and western regions.    Third, streamlining government institutions and reducing the  staff there. Those that can be merged should be merged, so that  the number of people to be fed by government finances can be  reduced. This is certainly an important way to lessen burdens on  peasants.</p>

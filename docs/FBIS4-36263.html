			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Khalayla] </F>   [Excerpts] Over the weekend, the Jordanian authorities did  not allow a delegation of Israeli Arabs from the triangle area  to visit their country. Twenty-three people joined the  delegation headed by Jalal Abu-Husayn, Labor's party secretary  in Baqa al-Gharbiyya. After receiving permission from the  Israeli authorities to travel to Jordan, the delegation met on  Jordanian soil with Ratib 'Amr, the minister in charge of the  occupied territories [name and title as published], who  allegedly told them that King Husayn and Prince Hasan were out  of the country. Seeing that you are here to see the king to  offer him your condolences on the death of his mother there is  no sense in your visit, 'Amr is said to have told them. [passage  omitted]    It has been learned from sources close to King Husayn in  East  Jerusalem that the king actually was in Jordan but decided not  to grant an audience to the delegation when it transpired that  they did not represent the Israeli Arab community and were  affiliated with the Labor party. Furthermore, the sources  noted, the visit was banned in view of reports on Qol Yisra'el  in Hebrew and Arabic that the delegation was carrying a  political message to the king from Israeli government sources.    Jalal Abu-Husayn would not say whether he had been bearing a  political message. Waqf Council sources in East Jerusalem (who  arranged the visit of previous delegations) made it  categorically clear that the Jordanian authorities were no  longer interested in the arrival of condolence delegations  calling on the king.</p>

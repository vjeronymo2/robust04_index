			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE EAST GERMANS POUR INTO CAMPS IN HUNGARY  </P> <P> Hundreds of East Germans poured into refugee camps in Hungary on Saturday,  joining thousands of others waiting for an unprecedented exodus of East Bloc  citizens to the West.  </P> <P> More than 3,000 East Germans already were inside the camps in and near  Budapest, awaiting passage to West Germany under an arrangement between Bonn  and Communist Hungary.  </P> <P> Authorities will not say when the transfer is to take place, although it is  believed it will begin within days.  </P> <P> It is the first time a Warsaw Pact nation and a North Atlantic Treaty  Organization country have worked together to move huge masses of people from  another Warsaw Pact nation.  </P> <P> Hungarian Red Cross official Andras Kovacs, in charge of the Csilleberc refugee  camp in Budapest, said Saturday that six buses carrying about 250 people had  departed for Zanka, a new camp opened 90 miles to the southwest to house the  overflow from the Budapest camp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crowded Emergency Quarters  </P> <P> For weeks, thousands of East Germans have crowded emergency quarters in  Hungary, refusing to leave unless guaranteed safe passage to the West.  </P> <P> About 6,000 already have fled to West Germany through Austria. The exodus  started shortly after Hungary began removing barbed wire and other barriers  from its westernmost border in May.  </P> <P> West Germany grants East German refugees automatic citizenship and assistance  in starting a new life. The influx has generated resentment among some West  Germans, who feel that the large number of East Germans coming into the country  will strain its resources.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl alluded to this concern on Saturday during a  speech in Cologne. He urged West Germans to show more tolerance for German  refugees arriving from the East in search of a better life.  </P> <P> "We would be going a bad way if we didn't now help the Germans from East  Germany and Poland," he said, adding that the emigrants should not be looked  down on as economic refugees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Vacation Spot  </P> <P> Hungary has been a traditional vacation spot for East Germans who have  difficulty getting permission for legal travel to the West from their hard-line  Communist government but can come to the liberal Soviet Bloc country relatively  easily.  </P> <P> About 200,000 East Germans are now in Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Miklos  Nemeth has estimated that up to 20,000 want to go to West Germany.  </P> <P> In Bavaria, West Germany's main border state with Austria, hundreds of Red  Cross personnel began work Saturday on a fifth "tent city" for the expected  influx of East Germans.  </P> <P> A West German spokesman said work was on schedule, with all five tent  communities expected to be standing by late today with a capacity of 5,000.  Austrian railway officials, meanwhile, kept up to 50 train cars ready for quick  movement to border points with Hungary when the transport starts.  </P> <P> Austrian border officials said about 50 more East Germans fled illegally from  Hungary overnight.  </P> <P> Under a bilateral agreement, Hungary is obliged to send East Germans trying to  flee to the West back to their Communist homeland.  </P></p>

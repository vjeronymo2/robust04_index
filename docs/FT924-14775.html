			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Redrawing the Pentagram blueprint For years, Pentagram has been a beacon of stability in the turbulent world of the London design industry. Pentagram has clung to its original, early-1970s concept of operating as a partnership of studios, run by individual designers. It was criticised for being too cautious in the bullish 1980s. But at a time when the rest of the industry has been blitzed by receiverships and redundancies, Pentagram has been unscathed by recession and is seen as a role model by the young designers of the 1990s. There have been changes over the years. Pentagram has taken on three new partners in London and has opened offices in New York and San Francisco, run as independent partnerships. But the structure has stayed the same and the five founders - Theo Crosby, Alan Fletcher, Kenneth Grange, Mervyn Kurlansky and Colin Forbes - have all remained. Pentagram is now poised for change. Fletcher is leaving to go freelance. Forbes, who opened the New York office in 1987, retires next autumn. Kurlansky is assessing the feasibility of opening an office in continental Europe which would involve him leaving London. The London office is taking on two new partners - Daniel Weil and David Pocknell. Pentagram is about to discover whether its structure really is a durable formula, or if its success so far has been due to the individuals involved. The blueprint for Pentagram was invented by Forbes and one of his clients, Ian Hay Davidson, then a partner at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy group. They devised a cellular structure, based on legal and accountancy partnerships, whereby individual designers worked from their own studios while sharing central resources such as accounts and public relations. The main difference between Pentagram and its role models was that there was to be no hierarchy. This egalitarian ethos has dominated public perceptions of Pentagram ever since. The partners at each office receive the same salaries and equal shares of annual profits. They work for large commercial clients such as Kodak, Boots and Reuters, but also have strong creative credentials. Crosby and Weil both teach at London's Royal College of Art as well as running commercial studios. But behind the liberal facade lies a labyrinth of rigid financial controls. Pentagram, one of London's larger design groups with turnover of just under Pounds 5m last year, is run much more rigorously than most conventional design companies. Each partner is set the financial target of covering costs and making a 25 per cent profit margin. Costs are calculated according to the number of people in the partners' studios - with employees graded in five salary bands  -and their proportionate share of central overheads. This system is self-supportive, in that it can cushion partners through difficult years, but also ensures there is strong peer pressure on them to meet their targets. New recruits are subject to the same rigorous scrutiny. They join as 'partners-elect' on the same salaries as full partners but with no profit share. They then have two or three years to prove that they can perform financially. So far, Pentagram has had mixed success with newcomers. There have been seven partners-elect in London since 1972 and only three - John McConnell, David Hillman and John Rushworth - have so far become full partners. 'It is a risk when we take on new people,' says McConnell. 'But we've got to do it to make sure that Pentagram has a future. That's why we've brought in Daniel Weil and David Pocknell.' Meanwhile, the three international offices must fill the vacuum left by Forbes. Although Pentagram purports to be non-hierarchical, Forbes has always acted as de facto chairman. His retirement has forced the other partners to question whether they can continue without a formal structure for decision making. Their solution is to create a steering committee of representatives from the three offices which will elect a chairman for a three year period, the first being McConnell. The combination of these changes in personnel and structure present a formidable challenge for Pentagram. 'The next few years are certainly going to be interesting,' says McConnell. 'Although that's probably a rather coy way of describing it.'</p>

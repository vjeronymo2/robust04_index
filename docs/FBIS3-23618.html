			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Yevgeniy Olkov, chief, Firefighting </F> and Rescue Service, Central Missile Fuel and Fuel Directorate,  Ministry of Defense, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Petr  Altunin: "Standing on a Rim of Fire: More Frequent Fires Causing  Alarm"; date and place not given; first paragraph is KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA introduction]    [Text] Colonel Yevgeniy Olkov is chief of the  Firefighting and Rescue Service, Central Missile Fuel and Fuel  Directorate, MO [Ministry of Defense]. He is devoted to his work  and a patriot to his service. Below are his thoughts on this  service which he expressed in an interview granted in response  to a request submitted by the editors.    [Altunin] Yevgeniy Pavlovich, if you do not mind, I will  start off with an old humorous saying: "Firemen do nothing but  fall into and out of snoozing."    [Olkov] There is an element of truth in that saying. The  truth is, it came about at one time in a rural area, where long  intervals would pass before a fire would break out. People were  lulled into a false sense of security, and firefighters  themselves would become lax. However, someone eventually would  take it into his head to "put the torch" to something, and a  breeze would come along to help the fire burn down half a  village.    Today, a time of technical revolution, the situation is  different. At one time, the means of starting a fire were a  match or flintstone. Now, no matter where you go, there are  these means: electricity, gas, fuel, oils. Just look at the  numbers: There are 5.5 million fires occurring every year in the  world; that is more than 500 fires an hour. In this connection,  incidences of fire in industrially advanced countries are  increasing by 5 percent a year, with the damage caused growing  by 10 percent. People lose their lives. In the month of January  in Moscow alone there were 34 deaths and 37 persons suffering  burn injuries.    [Altunin] It may be said that your service is highly  involved  with fires, what with fuel stored in depots and bases and highly  flammable liquids present there. How do you cope with that?    [Olkov] It is not easy. What we have is described by the  words in the song: "We are standing on a rim of fire." We -  firefighters and fuel people - are subjected to conditions  peculiar to us. While most people can get along with putting out  fires with water, we have in our inventory special apparatus and  means, equipment to lift and deliver foam, foam generators, and  various powders. In addition, we are organized differently. For  example, take the mutual cooperation with firefighting teams of  the MVD, activities which are governed strictly and responsibly  in compliance with the respective orders issued by Russia's  ministers of defense and internal affairs. Plans for combined  operations also exist.    It is quite a matter for firefighters to work in casemate  tanks. They use special tools - ones that do not produce sparks.  In the former ZakVO [Transcaucasus Military District], for  example, why did a fire and then an explosion occur in a  casemate? Safety rules were not observed. One enlisted man died,  three suffered burns of various degrees of severity, and the  fuel burned up.    We are involved with lightning protection. To do this work,  one must possess knowledge and know how to perform special  calculations. But what can happen? Commanders, in their desire  to "take their chances" in the good old Russian way, weld some  pieces of a pipe together and stick it into the ground without  much ado. This was the case in the ZakVO when lightning entered  a casemate space to set off saturated fuel vapors, thus wreaking  havoc on a fuel tank.    We also provide static electricity protection for filling  and  draining devices, pipelines, and pumping and storage tank  facilities. This also pertains to a fuel truck, which should  drag a chain on the ground.    [Altunin] Is there something new with which to extinguish  fires?    [Olkov] The traditional substances are the chemical and  air-mechanical foam mixtures. At our recent training sessions  held in St. Petersburg, we demonstrated the Shlem  fire-extinguishing substance, a "light water" type, which is  delivered by hose directed to the base of the tank, directly to  the fuel layer. Combustion abatement of the kerosene in the 25  cubic meter tank started five minutes after inflammation (the  same time required for firetrucks to arrive), with the flames  extinguished in one minute.    What is noteworthy here is that the new substance is simple,  inexpensive, and, most important, the fluorine-containing foam  is inert with respect to petroleum products, does not mix with  the latter, is not contaminated by hydrocarbons, and does not  harm the environment.    [Altunin] How do you organize your work?    [Olkov] We observe all the rules. We mount firefighting  guards to provide a 24-hour watch; they maintain a log by  entering into the latter all their observations and call out a  firefighting team in the event a fire breaks out. If an  occurrence is serious, they contact local teams and report to me.    [Altunin] Have there been any serious occurrences recently?    [Olkov] Knock on wood, no. Since I took over my post - in  1989 -there have been no major fires.    [Altunin] How demanding are you of commanders in your  inspections of fire safety in military units?    [Olkov] We demand, without exception, that fuel depots and  bases be equipped with fire warning systems; aboveground tanks,  with stationary fire extinguishing equipment; and that  firefighting teams be kept up to strength.    Nonetheless, Minister of Defense Order No 450 presently in  effect is often violated. Teams are made to do irrelevant jobs  and trucks are used to deliver water for flushing drainage  systems. There is poor supervision over manpower required for  observing monitoring devices and checking on the condition of  electric power systems.    I tell you frankly that everything depends upon the  commander. For example, Colonels A. Makarov and A. Kustov and  Lieutenant Colonel A. Remeshevskiy took over facilities where  there were many violations, but they soon took matters in hand  such that their bases are in excellent shape with respect to  fire safety. This cannot be said in the case of the enterprises  commanded by officers A. Pobegayev and V. Bogatov.    My subordinates and I accept no compromises in our  inspections - that is the kind of service in which we are. All  one need do is realize that a single spark is sufficient to  start a flame, and a big one, at that!    [Altunin] Does the Central Directorate's leadership support  you in your demands?    [Olkov] Absolutely. And in deed, not word. The directorate  chief, among other things, remains constantly in strict  compliance with the defense minister's order, which stipulates  that fire safety constitutes a major criterion in performance  evaluation. Any unit given the "unsatisfactory" rating is rated  "unsatisfactory" in general, regardless of the ratings it earns  in other areas of activity.    [Altunin] Are there any problems?    [Olkov] The principal one is that of understrength  firefighting teams. The defense minister's order calls for at  least 12 men per team, but some of them consist of only four.  How much can be done with that kind of manpower? Putting out a  "small" fire, perhaps. We are thinking about modern firefighting  teams in garrisons and introducing alternative service  (something which does not yet exist) - something must be done.    [Altunin] Yevgeniy Pavlovich, now for the last question.  Many  servicemen have an automobile, dacha, or garage, and they  constantly face a problem: Where and how to store fuel?    [Olkov] I am fully aware of their difficulties; it is a fact  that motor fuel prices are rising every month and everyone  wishes to stock up. The men often store fuel in amounts you  could not imagine. They forget about safety measures, and the  consequences are fires. Just look at Moscow, at its fire-damaged  balconies and burned-down garages; they are places where fuel is  traditionally stored.    The fire safety rules (PPB) strictly forbid the storing of  fuel-filled containers on balconies, loggias, and in corridors.  Storage in garages is permitted, but in amounts not exceeding 20  kg of motor fuel and 5 kg of oil in metal (never polyethylene)  containers that are tightly sealed.    It is forbidden to paint motor vehicles in parking areas or  garages, refuel vehicles, wash parts in kerosene or gasoline,  and dump used petroleum waste products into sewer systems or in  the proximity of a garage.    In the case of dachas and small houses located at small  garden plots, fuel may be stored only in facilities so  designated, with the metal containers tightly sealed, in amounts  up to 10 kg. In this connection, it must be kept in mind that  the use of gasoline in kerosene, Primus, and  pressurized-kerosene stoves is strictly forbidden. The approved  product is lighting-grade kerosene, which is sold in special  outlets located in villages and rural settlements.</p>

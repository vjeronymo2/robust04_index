			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grazing preference <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be revised to mean the priority to have a Federal permit or lease for a public land grazing allotment that is attached to base property owned or controlled by a permittee or lessee, or applicant. The proposed revision would better match the language of section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. The definition would drop the reference to a specified quantity of forage, a practice that was adopted by the former Grazing Service during the adjudication of grazing privileges. Like the Forest Service, the BLM would identify the amount of grazing use (AUMs), consistent with land use plans, in grazing use authorizations to be issued under a lease or permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interested public  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be added to mean an individual, group or organization that has submitted written comments to the authorized officer regarding the management of livestock grazing on specific grazing allotments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Land use plan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be revised to remove the inference that all management framework plans would be replaced by resource management plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Permitted use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be added to define the amount of forage in an allotment that is allocated for livestock grazing and authorized for use, or included as suspended nonuse, under a grazing permit or lease. The definition was added to those included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The term replaces the animal unit months of forage use previously associated with grazing preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Range improvement  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be expanded to include protection and improvement of rangeland ecosystems as a purpose of range improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Suspension  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be revised to reflect the revision of the definition of the term ``preference.'' The term ``preference'' would be replaced with ``permitted use.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Temporary nonuse  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be added to refer to permitted use that may be temporarily made unavailable for livestock use in response to a request by the permittee or lessee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unauthorized leasing and subleasing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be defined to mean leases or other agreements that have not been approved by the authorized officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utilization <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be amended to mean the consumption of forage by all animals consistent with the definitions in the BLM Technical Reference 4400&hyph;3 and the Bureau Manual System for Inventory and Monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4100.0&hyph;7&blank;Cross-References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended to guide the public to the applicable sections of the 43 CFR part 4 when considering an appeal of a decision relating to grazing administration, and to 43 CFR part 1780 regarding advisory committees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4100.0&hyph;9&blank;Information Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be added to conform to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The section discloses to the public the estimated burden hours needed to comply with the information collection requirements in this proposed rule, why the information is being collected, and what the information will be used for by the BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 4110_Qualifications and Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 4110.1&blank;Mandatory Qualifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although most applicants for grazing use would be engaged in the livestock business, the proposed rule would clarify that mortgage insurers, natural resource conservation organizations, and private parties whose primary source of income is not the livestock business, could meet the criteria for qualification for a grazing permit or lease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

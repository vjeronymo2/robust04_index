			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Settlements system may be run by Bank THE Bank of England is trying to resolve complaints about competing commercial interests vying for a role in Crest, its new paperless settlements system, by proposing to run the core of the system itself for the first few years. The Bank's Crest committee task force will meet in October to consider a computer design model of City settlements as they now are and discuss the way forward. The committee members include representatives of some of the commercial interests with the strongest stake in the outcome of the project. However, the committee is acting in an advisory and informative capacity to a core of Bank of England staff who will ultimately make the decisions about the project's specifications. Current proposals, still in the very early stages, call for a model with a core to be operated by the Bank but allowing competing commercial vendors to provide other essential services. Two or three commercial vendors not represented on the committee are said to be pressing the Bank vigorously for a role in project design. The system, whose design details are to be presented in irrevocable form next May, is intended to be a more flexible successor to the ill-fated Taurus system that the Stock Exchange tried to set up. Committee members are said to be generally opposed to offering the exchange any central role in operating the new system. After a year or two of smooth operation, the Bank would sell its ownership of the central system, which would provide transfer-of-title functions and communication of payments information, to the system's users. Other functions such as electronic trade confirmation, and messaging between counterparties or registrars could be provided commercially. Meanwhile, the committee is said to be favouring a design element that is likely to inflame a portion of the fund management industry which, in deference to its clients' wishes, keeps the name of each stock certificate in the individual client's name. Under the proposal, any fund manager wishing to use the quicker and cheaper settlements service to be provided by Crest would have to hold clients' securities in the name of a nominee company. While the majority of institutional funds are held in nominee name, a significant minority are not.</p>

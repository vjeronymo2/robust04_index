			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 1. -- Air India [AI] and Indian  Airlines [IA] today, formally, began functioning as two public  limited companies, paving way for what is widely perceived as a  new chapter in better management and more competitive  functioning in aviation.    While Government control over the two airlines continues, it  is believed to be only a matter of time before private  participation is invited -- through widening of capital base of  IA and A-I -- in running the air carriers.    According to an official announcement here, while A-I, IA  and  Vayudoot will continue to provide scheduled air transport  services, air taxi operators (ATO) have been permitted to apply  to the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation [DGCA] for  permission to operate private scheduled airlines.    The ATOs would, however, have to first comply with certain  guidelines and regulations laid down by the Ministry of Civil  Aviation for obtaining permission. The guidelines, according to  officials, have been given the official seal after subjecting  them to discussion with the key player of the domestic aviation  industry last month.    The rules of operation are:     -  A fleet strength of at least three aircraft registered in  India with an all-up-weight of more than 5700 kg each    -  Not less  than Rs 15 crores subscribed equity capital in respect of  operators having aircraft of all-up-weight exceeding 40,000 kg,  and not less than Rs 5 crores for operators having aircraft of  all-up-weight not exceeding 40,000 kg    -  Not less than three sets  of flight crew and cabin crew per aircraft.    -  An approved  maintenance organization and facilities to carry out maintenance  of aircraft up to 500 hours inspection or Check "B" for Boeing  737 aircraft.    -  Approved manuals for operations, training and  quality control-cum-maintenance.    -  Cells for pre-flight medical  examination of crew, flight planning and despatch, reliability,  analysis of aircraft components and systems, detect  investigation, compliance of service bulletins and modifications  and records of major components.    -  Security programme approved by  the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and trained security  personnel at all operating stations.    The Ministry has also laid down certain conditions for  operating on different sectors.    (a) Those operating scheduled air transport service on any  route specified under Category - 1, will be required to provide  a minimum scheduled service in Category II and Category III  sectors. For rendering the prescribed minimum service on routes  in Categories II and III, an operator may have the option to  provide the service either by aircraft in his fleet or in  another operator's fleet on mutually agreed terms. In the latter  case, the arrangements should have prior approval of the DGCA.    (b) Operators shall abide by any further conditions which  the  DGCA may consider necessary for monitoring of scheduled air  transport service and operation.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DADDY TRACK  </P> <P> An employer who is flexible enough to allow employees to be part of their  families will be rewarded with many benefits, including loyalty. All  institutions experience times of hardship, and during such times those who feel  a kinship with the workplace will stand by their employers while the others  head out the door. The ability to occasionally work at home and have flexible  hours is what most of us need to succeed on the Daddy Track and in our careers.  </P> <P> WAYNE BRINER, Glendale  </P></p>

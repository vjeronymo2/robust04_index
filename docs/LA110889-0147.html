			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHAMIR'S OFFICE LOBBYING TO AVOID A SNUB BY BUSH  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office, fearing a diplomatic snub from  President Bush, today urged the American leader to invite the Israeli leader to  Washington during his U.S. visit.  </P> <P> The lack of an invitation from Bush, less than a week before Shamir flies to  the United States for private meetings, was front-page news in Israeli  newspapers.  </P> <P> "Bush still balking at inviting Shamir," the Jerusalem Post said in a lead  article that attributed the delay to U.S. irritation at Israel's position on  Middle East peace talks.  </P> <P> Shamir is to leave Monday for the United States to speak to Jewish  organizations.  </P> <P> "We have not yet received word from the White House about a possible meeting  with Mr. Bush. If invited, of course, Mr. Shamir will go to Washington," said  Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman.  </P> <P> Pazner described Bush's latest comment on the possible meeting as  "non-committal" but the Israeli media said Shamir's staff appeared surprised by  the cool tone.  </P> <P> "I'd like to feel that a meeting would be held and that it would be  constructive, that we'd have something positive to talk about," Bush said at a  news conference Tuesday.  </P></p>

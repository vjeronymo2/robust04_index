			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Quintal] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- The preliminary  hearing of the Goldstone Commission into the Zulu march through  Johannesburg on March 28 began at the commission's Sandton  offices on Monday morning. The march resulted in 53 deaths and  more than 200 injured.    The South African Police [SAP], the Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] and the kwaZulu government will make their submissions to  the commission on Monday and Tuesday.    The SAP, represented by Mr B. Roux, handed in a bulky  document detailing the police version of events. Mr Roux told  the commission that, contrary to newspaper reports, the IFP had  applied to the Johannesburg City Council for permission to hold  an anti-election meeting at Library Gardens, and not a march.  Permission for the meeting had been granted. Mr Roux stressed  the police had had no idea before the meeting that snipers would  gun down Zulus on city streets.    Mr Maurice Basslian is representing the kwaZulu government  and the IFP, and Mr George Bizos the African National Congress.  The hearing is being attended by observers from Jamaica,  Germany, Great Britain and the United States.</p>

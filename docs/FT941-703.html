			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Technology: German sites for Japanese Japanese companies are continuing to locate more new research, design and development (RD&amp;D) centres in Germany than in any other European country, in spite of its current economic problems. Spain became the second favourite site for new facilities last year, with the UK dropping to third equal with the Netherlands. Britain still has the largest number of established Japanese RD&amp;D centres - 83 out of the European total of 264 - but Germany, with 53, is slowly narrowing the gap: until 1992 Britain had almost twice as many. France, with 34, remains in third place, but Spain, now with 26, is catching up rapidly. These trends emerge from the latest annual survey of Japanese manufacturing companies' European operations, recently published by the Japanese External Trade Organisation (Jetro). It shows that there was a further slowdown in the rate of new RD&amp;D centres across Europe last year. After a doubling in 1990, and rises of 48 per cent in 1991, and 20 per cent in 1992, only 24 facilities were opened last year, a rise of 10 per cent. The Jetro survey is not definitive: only about 61 per cent of the 728 Japanese manufacturers in Europe replied to it. But it does suggest the beginnings of a new trend: a small decline last year in the number of RD&amp;D units not linked to a Japanese company's European manufacturing operations. For the first time the number of such stand-alone units fell from 67 to 65. Several European governments have been pressing Japanese companies to establish integrated RD&amp;D facilities, rather than stand-alone units which feed all their work to operations in Japan. On the other hand - surprisingly in view of the strong yen - the proportion of companies with a 50 per cent plus ratio of local parts and materials content in their European manufacturer eased slightly in 1993, from 76 per cent to just under 74 per cent.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tibbett makes Austrian purchase from Unilever Tibbett &amp; Britten International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UK-based distribution group Tibbett &amp; Britten, is to acquire Eskimo-Iglo Tiefkuhllogistik (TKL), a distribution and logistics company within Unilever's Austrian frozen foods division. The deal will be completed on January 1 1995, when an initial cash payment of Sch100m (Pounds 5.9m) will be made from the parent group's existing resources for 70 per cent of the Vienna-based company. A further Sch100m is payable on the final day of the year. The remaining 30 per cent of TKL's shares will be acquired by January 1 1997 for a performance-related figure of not more than Sch125m, payable in instalments between 1997 and 2000. Mr John Harvey, TBI chairman, said: 'This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of development within our established business sectors while translating our experience into new markets by working with existing multinational clients.' The acquisition will give Tibbett a long-term contract with Unilever and a well-developed national network. The deal will also see 500 employees and about 250 refrigerated vehicles transfer to TBI.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / US leads the art market recovery: Saleroom THE US seems to be leading the recovery in the art market. Sotheby's held its best auction of American pictures for 2 1/2 years in New York at the weekend, producing a total of Dollars 11.1m (Pounds 7m) with 21 per cent unsold. Private collectors rather than dealers were the main buyers. 'The Unruly Calf', painted in 1875 by Winslow Homer, was nicely within forecast at Dollars 1.21m (Pounds 765,000), and among the new artist record prices were the Dollars 1.15m paid for 'Abstraction' painted in 1913 by Marsden Hartley, and the Dollars 825,000 for 'Welcome to Our City' by Charles Demuth. Christie's sale in the same area was less successful, totalling Dollars 11m, but with 31 per cent unsold. 'Ritz Tower, Night', a Georgia O'Keeffe skyscraper scene, made Dollars 1.21m. Sotheby's was selling two important private collections in Monaco at the weekend, furniture from the Cap d'Antibes villa of the late Helene Beaumont and the French silver of Pierre Jourdan-Barry. The furniture did well, with only 3 per cent unsold, totalling FFr32.3m (Pounds 3.8m) with FFr8.4m being paid for a bureau plat writing table made by Weisweiler in 1778 and decorated with gouaches under glass. The silver made FFr15.4m, but was 27 per cent unsold.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1861(m)(4) of the Act provides that before Medicare will cover home health aide services, the home health aides must successfully complete a training and competency evaluation program approved by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1861(dd) of the Act defines hospice care and sets forth the Medicare hospice care provisions. Under section 1861(dd)(1)(D)(i) of the Act, the services of a home health aide are covered as a hospice service only if the aide has successfully completed a training and competency evaluation program that meets the requirements established by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Medicare Home Health Care Initiative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the challenges facing the delivery of home health care, HCFA has recently undertaken the Medicare Home Health Initiative to identify opportunities for improvement in the Medicare home health benefit. In our effort to identify, develop and implement improvements, the initiative takes an integrated approach to the policy, quality assurance, and operational elements of the benefit. To ensure that recommendations for improvement reflect the everyday experience of individuals and organizations involved in home health care, we will include representatives of home health consumers and providers as well as professional organizations, intermediaries, and States (including State Medicaid agencies) in the ongoing development and implementation of improvements to the Medicare home health benefit. The initial meeting between HCFA and these representatives was held on May 16, 17, and 18, 1994. Additional meetings are planned in the coming months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although we proposed this rule before the Home Health Initiative began and so developed it independent of the initiative, we consider the rule's provisions to be consistent with the goals of the initiative. A major goal of the initiative is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Medicare home health benefit operational and administrative activities. By clarifying several aspects of Medicare home health policy, this final rule promotes the consistent administration of the home health benefit and therefore constitutes a significant effort to meet this goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Provisions of the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 27, 1991 (56 FR 49154), we proposed to revise home health services regulations contained in 42 CFR part 409, subpart E; part 418, subpart D; and part 484, subpart C. The reader can find all of the details of our proposal in that document. The proposed revisions involved a reorganization of the existing provisions, technical and editorial changes, and the following substantive additions or revisions to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Home Health Aide Duties and Supervision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;We proposed to define the duties of the home health aide as including, but not limited to, hands-on personal care, simple procedures that are an extension of therapy or nursing services, assistance in ambulation or exercise, and assistance in administering medications that are ordinarily self-administered. We also proposed that written patient care instructions for the home health aide had to be prepared by the registered nurse or other appropriate professional responsible for the supervision of the aide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We proposed to modify the requirements governing supervision of home health aide services to require the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> + If the patient is receiving skilled care as well as aide services, the registered nurse or other appropriate professional must make a supervisory visit to the patient's home at least once every 2 weeks. If the aide is an employee of the HHA or hospice, at least one of these visits each month must be made while the aide is providing care to the patient. If the aide is not an employee of the HHA or hospice, the HHA or hospice must perform all supervisory visits of that aide while the aide is providing care to the patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> + If the patient is receiving home health aide services but is not receiving skilled care, the supervisory visit must occur not less than once every 62 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We proposed to identify the responsibilities of an HHA or hospice that chooses to provide home health aide services under arrangements with another organization as ensuring the overall quality of care provided by the aide, supervising the aide, and ensuring the aide has met the training requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Conditions for Payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, we proposed the following requirements for payment of home health services:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A requirement that the services must be furnished to an eligible beneficiary by, or under arrangements with, an HHA that meets the HHA conditions of participation and has in effect a Medicare provider agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The physician certification and recertification requirements for home health services described in 42 CFR 424.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The coverage requirements discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Beneficiary Qualifications for Coverage of Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that the beneficiary must be under the care of a physician who establishes the plan of care and that a doctor of podiatric medicine may establish a plan of care under certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

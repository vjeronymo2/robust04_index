			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (5): In search of global status - Banking sector: a period of turbulence is expected THANKS largely to a strong stock market in the early part of last year, Singapore's financial services industry put in a spectacular performance in 1990, with a growth rate of 22 per cent making it the mainstay of the overall economy. That performance is unlikely to be repeated in 1991, at least by thebanking sector. The economy is growing more slowly; domestic loan demand is less robust; and the interest margins of domestic banks are narrowing as more surplus deposits are directed towards the interbank market. All these factors are likely to depress the profits of domestic banks this year, but continuing strong activity in the foreign exchange market and buoyant regional loan activity means the financial sector should still be underpinned by a solid contribution from the offshore Asia currency banking market. According to Mr Lee Ek Tieng, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the growth rate posted by the financial services sector will still be in double digits. As far as the domestic banks are concerned, it is a forecast which masks a period of turbulence going beyond the merely cyclical. It is generally admitted that Singapore's local market of 2.7m consumers is over banked with 23 full foreign banks, 14 restricted ones and 13 local banks. Bankers and stockbrokers say the authorities have begun to push the idea of rationalising the domestic banks with a view to creating institutions large enough to acquire international status. Singapore banks need to follow their manufacturing clients who are investing overseas, says Mr Richard Hu, finance minister. 'If they want to consolidate, we'll be happy. Size is an advantage, clearly.' 'We are over banked,' adds Mr Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank. 'Even local banks have to go outside Singapore.' UOB, which is Singapore's second largest bank, opened a joint-venture bank in Indonesia last year. Mr Wee says it would like to expand into Thailand and Taiwan. The details of the banking consolidation are still a matter of speculation, but the common belief in the financial community is that theso-called 'big four' will eventually be reduced from four to no more than three. One much-discussed possibility might be for the government-owned DBS Bank to absorb Overseas Union Bank, currently the smallest of the four. But the situation was complicated last year by the acquisition of Asia Commercial Bank by Keppel, the state-linked group whose activities range from finance to ship repair. Keppel's entry into the market and its desire for more acquisitions has introduced a fifth player into the equation. The debate has also focused attention on the protection afforded local banks. US bankers, in particular, complain of unequal treatment, which they say is at variance with Singapore's claim tobe an enthusiastic free-trader of services as well as goods. Though foreign banks, such as Citibank, Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered, account for 61 per cent of domestic banking assets, they face limits both on the number of branches and automatic teller machines. This has restricted their access to the retail deposit market and forced them to fund themselves on the more expensive interbank market. They say they have also been hampered by their inability to join the debit cards fund transfer network. Foreign bankers say they expect Singapore to remain under pressure to end this discrimination in the talks on liberalising trade in services in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now that they need to expand abroad, domestic banks have discovered that protection has come at a price. They have neither the size nor the skills and efficiency to compete easily in the global market place. The government last year raised the permitted foreign stake in local banks to 40 per cent from 20 per cent, a level which has since been reached only at OCBC Bank, which ranks number three of the big four. Now it sees no need for further liberalisation. One of the MAS's main concerns is to ensure sound banking in Singapore's small market. The domestic banks are required to be highly capitalised by international standards; the MAS is proud of its record as a regulator and vets would-be newcomers closely. As a result the domestic industry has been first insulated from and then dwarfed by the large international players to whom Singapore plays host. In keeping with its wider policy of trying to be a service centre for multinationals, Singapore sees itself as primarily a provider ofinfrastructure and related services to international banks rather than a playerin its own right. Much to the satisfaction of the MAS, activity in the offshore banking market has continued to grow apace. Average daily turnover in foreign exchange last year was nearly Dollars 80bn, up 30 per cent on the 1989 level. Offshore banking assets rose 16 per cent to Dollars 390bn, and fund management business isgrowing as the region becomes more wealthy. According to government figures, offshore loans to non-bank customers grew at a record 45 per cent, reflecting the rapid growth of the regional economy. Assets channelled into the interbank market grew much more slowly, at a rate of just 4.5 per cent. The interbank slowdown was marked in the second half of the year as both Japanese and US banks reined in their international business. However, there are as yet no signsthat this is spilling over into regional lending to non-banks which remains buoyant. Insurance is an example of a domestic industry whose initial development was impeded by conditions on the local market. The reason in this case was the stranglehold of the Central Provident Fund over the local savings market. Private sector economists say this hampered the development of the life insurance industry in Singapore. The affluence of recent years has changed this andlife insurance business begun to grow rapidly, helping the private sector to develop new savings industry skills. The MAS, which moved last year to subject insurance brokers to stricter regulations and capped their commissions, is keeping a strict regulatory eye on the industry. The aim is to foster a sound reputation which will help attract large players to base their regional business in Singapore. The authorities have long sought to compliment the services offered by international banks with an offshore insurance market. A series of taxbreaks is available on both reinsurance and captive insurance business. Offshore reinsurance premiums last year grew by 26 per cent to a total premium income of some SDollars 392m, but captive insurance business declined by some 2.6 per cent. Today there are still only some 44 captive insurance companies active in Singapore, way short of the critical mass needed for this particular sector.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------     ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ASIAN CURRENCY UNITS (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     1968  1970      1980      1988      1989      1990 Assets (liabilities)                     30.5 389.8  54,392.6 280,477.2 336,581.8 390,251.3 Source: The Monetary Authority of Singapore  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------      BANK LOANS AND ADVANCES TO NON-BANK CUSTOMERS (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    1966     1970     1980     1988    1989     1990 Total loans and advances including bills financing         1,026.3  2,167.7 20,206.9 41,848.8 50,785.9 57,696.4 Source: The Monetary Authority of Singapore  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

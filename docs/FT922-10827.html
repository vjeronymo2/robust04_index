			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Greek bank reports record Dr43bn profits NATIONAL Bank of Greece, the country's largest commercial bank, yesterday reported record profits of Dr43.13bn (Dollars 224.5m) in 1991, after a Dr12.27bn loss the previous year. The state-owned bank's rapid improvement follows a gradual restructuring of its loan portfolio as well as efforts to cut costs. During 1991, the bank set up a new subsidiary, National Capital, to which it is transferring non-performing loans, low-yielding shares and other non-core assets. Underlying growth in operating income rose by 65 per cent last year, while costs grew by only 13.5 per cent, a gap which accounts for much of the strong profit showing. The bank, which accounts for almost 50 per cent of lending activity in Greece, increased its provisions for doubtful debt last year to Dr45.92bn, against only Dr7.02bn in 1990. Provisions are equal to 8 per cent of loans, against 4.7 per cent in 1990. The bank will transfer Dr17bn in profits to reserves. It will pay a Dr750 dividend per share, after passing for two successive years.</p>

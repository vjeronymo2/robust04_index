			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Bank chiefs oppose resurrection of ERM European central bank governors, led by the Bundesbank, yesterday staged a mini-rebellion against efforts to resurrect the exchange rate mechanism. At a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Athens, the governors made clear that member states must cut national budget deficits and lower inflation to build a sustainable recovery as the pre-requisite for a single European currency. France, Germany and the UK lined up behind what appeared to be an emerging consensus that the road to European monetary union may no longer lie via the old narrow fluctuation bands for members of the old ERM. Last August, EU ministers agreed to introduce 15 per cent fluctuation bands for currencies inside the ERM, ending the earlier system which operated on 2.25 and 6 per cent fluctuation bands. One participant at yesterday's informal meeting said central bankers had 'cut loose' during an afternoon session devoted to the operation of the European Monetary Institute, precursor of a future European central bank. 'There is a new realism about the debate on monetary union,' he said. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said member states could no longer look to the ERM to provide external economic discipline. The new emphasis had to be on internal efforts, he said. Mr Henning Christopherson, EU economics commissioner, said it was too early to predict the end of ERM. But he agreed with Mr Tietmeyer that it was necessary to have much greater economic convergence before monetary union was credible. Ministers expressed concern that the recent rise in US interest rates could damage Europe's efforts to reduce the cost of borrowing. But hopes of 'decoupling' European rates depended on members states putting their own economic house in order. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, expressed satisfaction with the drift of debate on monetary union. He told BBC radio that he was 'in the mainstream' - a contrast with Britain's isolation in the row over voting rights in the European union. Ministers agreed separately to draw up a list of ten international road and rail projects which could be approved at the European summit in Corfu in June. France, Germany and the UK said these and future trans-European networks should be funded by the European investment and existing financial instruments rather than the European Commission raising extra money on the capital markets. Mr Christopherson said 'nothing has been ruled out', adding that some projects, including the proposed Channel Tunnel rail link in the UK, might not be able to be financed by private capital alone.</p>

As a result, signs are showing  that ROK-U.S. trade disputes will grow.    In particular, the United States is expected to try to  extensively discuss the trade disputes between the two countries  and step up its trade pressure on the ROK at the 16th ROK-U.S.  working- level trade conference scheduled to be held in  Washington on 4-5 March.    A ROK Government official concerned said on 27 March: "The  United States has complained about the ROK's 10-percent tariff  on imported U.S. cars, saying it is too high. It has strongly  asked the ROK to lower the tariff and remove such non-tariff  barriers."    He also said: "The United States is expected to warn the ROK  that it could renew the Super 301 trade provision and take other  retaliatory measures if the ROK did not accept its demand at the  Washington working-level trade conference.    This official went on to say: "The U.S. Carmakers  Association will send a large delegation to the ROK in mid-April  to ask the ROK to open its automobile market. Also, it has  asked the U.S. Government to take retaliatory trade measures if  the ROK does not open its car market any wider."    At the 20th regular ROK-U.S. Trade Council meeting held on  23  March in Seoul, the United States asked the ROK to allow imports  of corn flour and reprocessed plums and advertisements for dog  food. It also asked the ROK to reclassify imported vitamins for  pets and raised an objection to the ROK's inspection of the  viscera of pigs.    The United States also raised an objection to the ROK's  practice of allowing heat-treated frozen U.S. sausages to be  sold in ROK markets only within 30 days after they were  produced. It asked the ROK to allow them to be sold up to 90  days after they were produced.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Let's face the music, then change the tune: Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, outlines his strategies for the insurance market to Richard Lapper The year is 2003 and the losses incurred in the early 1990s by Lloyd's of London are a distant memory. A more streamlined and profitable insurance market has emerged, with its centre in the '1958 building' on Lime Street - Lloyd's former headquarters. The controversial glass and steel structure designed by Mr Richard Rogers and opened in 1986 has been transformed into an arts and leisure complex, the equivalent of the Pompidou Centre in Paris. Upstairs in the 12-storey building tourists drift through an international art gallery and Americans queue at Lloyd's 'Historic London' theme park, which has seen its popularity increase recently after rave reviews in the US. Downstairs, City workers and visitors mingle in the Lloyd's cafes, shops and sports centre, all independently owned, all meeting quality standards and controls set by Lloyd's. This may seem a far-fetched vision but it is 'not entirely a fantasy', according to Mr Peter Middleton, who has just completed his first year as chief executive of the insurance market. After fighting to ensure the market's commercial survival, Mr Middleton, a former diplomat who as chief executive of Thomas Cook, the travel services group, helped transform the fortunes of another famous UK brand, is now looking towards the longer term. The creative use of two of Lloyd's most valuable assets - its brand name and spacious headquarters - is likely to figure in future strategy discussions. 'Rather than seeing the building as an albatross, we could turn it into a revenue-raising venture,' says Mr Middleton, who, as a keen runner, confesses that he would like to see a leisure centre with a gymnasium in Lloyd's. He also muses about the absence of an art gallery and the shortage of shops in the City. For the moment, these ideas are 'theoretical options', as Mr Middleton devotes his energies to more pressing problems. His first year has been a tough one. 'It seemed as if we were climbing up a never-ending hill,' he says, reflecting on the impact in June of the market's biggest loss of Pounds 2.9bn. Coming after losses of Pounds 510m in 1988 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989, this has been a heavy blow for many of the 19,700 Names whose personal assets support the market. Legal actions and accusations of mismanagement have escalated. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating the activities of one Lloyd's syndicate. The appointment of a new management team, under Mr David Rowland, the chairman, and dedicated to root-and-branch reform, has improved the market's prospects. 'When you look back, if we hadn't done the things we did in the timescale - I think the Pounds 2.9bn loss this year could have sandbagged Lloyd's. We would have become marginal,' says Mr Middleton. 'We have built a lot of bridges to Names . . . some things are now going our way.' Although he is optimistic that Lloyd's can settle legal actions by thousands of Names out of court, Mr Middleton is adamant that Lloyd's could survive adverse court rulings if cases proceeded. Earlier this year there were fears that Names would reduce their commitments and that the market's capacity (the capital base allowing it to underwrite premiums) would shrink. Yet Lloyd's now expects its existing Names to supply sufficient capital to allow it to underwrite up to Pounds 7.5bn next year, only Pounds 1.2bn less than in 1993. 'We've been amazed at the robustness of the capital base,' explains the chief executive. The lure of future profits, as insurance and reinsurance rates continue their rise of up to eight times over the past four years, partially explains the turnround. The market's confidence has been strengthened by firm proposals from merchant banks - including Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Samuel Montagu - that they are prepared to raise capital for the market from institutional and retail investors. Earlier this month a rule book - explaining the terms on which new corporate members can participate - was published. There are signs that several investment trusts and companies could be launched before the end of the year, raising between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn of fresh capital. Mr Middleton says corporate capital will bring long-term security of funding to the market. 'We can't suppose traditional forms of capital will remain open to us for ever.' Another positive sign, he says, is that corporate financiers appear satisfied that Lloyd's plans to 'ring fence' new investors against claims for billions of pounds in US pollution and asbestosis liabilities will work. Reserves to meet liabilities arising on all insurance policies sold by Lloyd's before 1986 are to be transferred into a new reinsurance company, which should be up and running by 1996. Several hurdles must still be negotiated. Lloyd's must win Names' approval for its capital plans at a potentially stormy EGM next month, for example. But Mr Middleton should soon have more time to focus on implementing Lloyd's first business plan, unveiled in April. Mr Middleton is bluntly critical of many of the market's habits. The main areas under scrutiny are costs, including wages, professionalism and management: Costs. Wage levels are one issue. Nearly half the market's 200 or so underwriters earn more than Pounds 100,000 a year; brokers' and agents' salaries are equally high. 'I have no problem about this, when an underwriter is consistently making a lot of money,' says Mr Middleton. 'But I didn't see (the market) cutting back when times were difficult.' The level of entertainment typically enjoyed by the market is also a 'significant cost'. 'They have a taste for jamborees on a frequency and a scale that other sectors have abandoned,' he says. Tackling such abuses will involve encouraging greater transparency and accountability. Agencies and underwriters 'have to break down their expenditure. That is when the potential investor will ask what and at what cost,' says Mr Middleton. The restructuring of the market over the past three years should also help improve efficiency and save money. Many syndicates (groups of Names that underwrite business) have been closed because of losses, or merged. Next year, Mr Middleton expects there to be no more than 150 syndicates, compared with more than 400 in 1990. As a result, the average syndicate is bigger than in the late 1980s, underwriting more premiums for each unit of cost, and better managed. 'To an uncanny degree the survivors are the people who you would want to survive,' he says. Professionalism. The fall in the number of businesses will make it easier for Lloyd's to regulate the market and enforce standards. In the past, the Corporation of Lloyd's, which administers the market, has stood aside, operating in a manner similar to the civil service. In the 1990s Mr Middleton expects the relationship between the corporation and the market to become closer. Increasingly, the corporation will not only police the market as a regulator, by ensuring that syndicates do not insure too many risks compared with the size of their capital, for example, but guide and direct the type and quality of business being underwritten. Mr Middleton says the independent agencies (companies that manage syndicates) will increasingly resemble 'franchises' licensed to operate with the Lloyd's brand. In the past, agencies have jealously guarded their independence from central control. When Lloyd's has reduced its cost structure and put its quality control in place, managers will turn their attention to the next three-year business plan - which will take the market from 1996-98. 'We will concentrate on the things we are good at,' says Mr Middleton. At present Lloyd's syndicates underwrite a wide range of insurance, from high-risk reinsurance, aircraft and oil rigs at one end of the spectrum to lower-risk motor and home business, for example, at the other. Mr Middleton says that, in future, Lloyd's will exercise more pressure on the market - through adjusting fee or levy structures, for example - to leave some of these areas if returns are inadequate. Lloyd's faces an unprecedented degree of centralisation in coming years. Changes that would have been inconceivable five years ago now provide a base for an even more radical transformation. The market might jettison parts of its business, it might acquire new businesses in continental Euorpe, or invite companies from outside the market to participate and operate under its brand name. 'If we came to the conclusion in five years that what Europe needs is a single profit centre to compete internationally, I'd want Lloyd's to be part of that discussion with potential partners,' says Mr Middleton. 'I am seeing Lloyd's more and more as a company.' Lloyd's as a diversified business, with activities ranging from insurance to retailing, may be a vision Mr Middleton confines to 'his lighter moments' today. But the reality could be nearer than many imagine.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Delors prays Britain will join the flock 'ONE CAN always hope for a miracle,' said Mr Jacques Delors, minutes before the signing of the Maastricht treaty on European union. Putting his hands together and looking heavenward, the European Commission president was referring to the infinitesimal chance that Britain might undergo a last-minute change of heart and mind, and join its 11 partners on social policy - the one real bone of contention at the December summit. Maastricht is not Damascus, however, and there was no sudden Pauline conversion on the part of Britain's two signatories - Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury. They and ministers from the other 11 countries quietly signed the political and monetary union treaty - complete with its protocol allowing 11 countries to pursue their social policy ambitions without the UK - virtually as they had argued it out in the same hall of Maastricht's Provinciehuis on December 9-11. Two by two, as though entering the Ark of European Union, national pairs of ministers advanced to two books on a table in the centre of the room, accompanied by the strains of a string quartet. Ministers from Belgium's caretaker government came first. Further down the line of signatories came Germany's finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, in such a rumpled suit that it looked like physical evidence of the political drubbing which the Bundesbank is giving monetary union. When, at 6.08 pm local time, Messrs Hurd and Maude became the last to put their mark on the treaty books, Maastricht was formally signed to be presented later this year for ratification by the Twelve's parliaments. To his own mild embarrassment, Mr Hurd confessed to not knowing precisely what was in the two books he had signed. In fact, the fat book contained the actual treaty and the thin one associated protocols and annexes. But the UK foreign secretary was clear that, in spite of its provisions for a common currency, foreign and defence policies, 'Maastricht is not a stage towards a centralised Europe'. The logic of the Community soon having to take in more members ran against this, and towards a more de-centralised EC system, he said. This was not the impression given by others. Prime Minister Antonio Cavaco Silva of Portugal, which is the current EC president, and Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who chaired the Maastricht summit, spoke of unfinished integration business that needed to be completed at the next inter-governmental conference, set for 1996. Mr Egon Klepsch, the EC Parliament president, said: 'Maastricht keeps the ball rolling and strengthens the impetus behind integration . . . but must be followed by further stages.' So, with the ink still moist on the treaty, were the post-Maastricht battle lines set out.

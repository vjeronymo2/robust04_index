			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hickson chemical plant damaged by explosion HICKSON International, the speciality chemicals and timber treatment group, was hit by its second disaster within 12 months yesterday when an explosion badly damaged one of its fine chemicals manufacturing plants in the Irish Republic. The blast at the site in Ring-askiddy, County Cork, caused damaged estimated initially at several million pounds. The plant, one of two on the site, was used to make active and intermediate ingredients for pharmaceutical companies throughout the world and is the only one run by Hickson to have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Mr Michael Rowley, group finance director, said: 'The plant has been badly damaged and production will be disrupted for some months. However, we do have inventories of the finished product and the damage and loss of business is fully covered by insurance. The explosion will be a further blow to investor confidence, which was dented last autumn after a fire at another of the company's sites in Castleford, West Yorkshire, killed five staff and landed Hickson with a Pounds 250,000 fine and Pounds 150,000 costs. Earlier this week one of the Gartmore stable of investment funds, which had been a leading Hickson shareholder, placed 4.9m shares in the market and reduced its stake to 2.2 per cent. Yesterday, Hickson's share price fell 14p to 194p.</p>

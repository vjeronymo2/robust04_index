			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Net assets up 26% at Lancs &amp; London Lancashire &amp; London Investment Trust yesterday reported a net asset value of 104.8p as at December 31 1991 - an advance of some 26 per cent over the year. The figure at January 31 1992 showed a further improvement to 110.4p. The trust, which invests principally in smaller UK companies, last year fought off a bid from Anglo-Scandinavian Investment Trust. The directors maintained the total dividend for 1991 at 2.9p - via a proposed same-again final of 1.9p - despite 'difficult conditions facing smaller companies which have led many to reduce or withhold dividends'. Earnings per share improved to 2.9p (2.7p).</p>

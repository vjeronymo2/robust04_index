			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS WILL STAND TRIAL IN ATTEMPT TO DEPROGRAM  </P> <P> In a criminal case that attorneys say is unique in California for its  prosecution of parents, a Santa Cruz couple was ordered Monday to stand trial  in Vista Superior Court on felony charges that they kidnaped, falsely  imprisoned and beat their adult daughter, who they believed was in the grips of  a religious cult.  </P> <P> The pending trial is expected to pit the principles of religious freedom  against parental concern for the well-being of their children. The defense  expects to produce a parade of former members of the religious group, who are  expected to testify that they were brainwashed by the group's leader and were  under his control until being rescued.  </P> <P> The case centers on 23-year-old Ginger Brown, a member of Great Among the  Nations who was abducted in Encinitas last May and held for five days in an  Escondido house while her parents, sisters and others tried to deprogram her.  On the fifth day, Brown was released and returned to the organization, a  16-member fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry based in  Coronado that critics claim is a cult.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sole Witness  </P> <P> Brown was the sole prosecution witness against the five defendants in the case:  her parents, Earle and Dorothy Rae Brown, both 57; her sister, Holly Rae Brown,  24; Clifford Daniels, 34, of Los Angeles, a self-proclaimed deprogrammer, and  Hank Erler, 22, in whose Escondido home the deprogramming effort occurred.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys tried to show during the preliminary hearing before Vista  Municipal Judge Michael Burley that the Browns and the other defendants  believed that Ginger Brown had been brainwashed and that she was rescued for  her own good.  </P> <P> But Brown testified that she is a dedicated member of Great Among the Nations  by her own free will and had begged her parents to let her live her own life,  no matter how religiously fanatic it might seem to them.  </P> <P> On Monday, Benjamin Altschul, who leads the organization, testified that he  held no control over members' actions, and that his only requirement of them is  that "they believe in our Lord Jesus Christ."  </P> <P> One of the defense attorneys, John Patterson, said he might appeal Burley's  decision because the judge stifled interrogation into the group's behavior on  the grounds that a person's religious practices and beliefs cannot be put on  trial. That area of questioning was important to the defense, however, in its  effort to show that members of Great Among the Nations were brainwashed into  following Altschul and financing what critics say is his lavish life style.  </P> <P> Another defense attorney, Saul Wright, said afterward, "Previous cult members  will testify 100% to the contrary" on Altschul's benign characterization of the  organization.  </P> <P> Answered Deputy Dist. Atty Gary Rempel: "This is just a bunch of fundamental  Christians being persecuted by well-financed deprogrammers who are themselves  what they condemn. They (the defense) won't be able to provide a single witness  who hasn't himself been brainwashed by a deprogrammer."  </P> <P> The five defendants are scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on June 5,  although Earle Brown notified the court on Monday that he faces hospitalization  for cancer treatment.  </P></p>

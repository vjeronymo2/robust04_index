			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Marwan Kanafani, adviser to brother  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the state of Palestine  and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, made the following  statement:    It is very strange to hear this kind of logic from Shimon  Peres, Israeli foreign affairs minister, especially because  neither he nor Prime Minister Rabin have expressed any kind of  regret and condemnation when the Israeli army and intelligence  deliberately assassinated six young leaders from the Fatah  Movement in Gaza recently. On the contrary, the Israeli housing  minister expressed his appreciation and that of the government  and the Israeli army for this kind of terrorist act immediately  after the weekly meeting of the Israeli cabinet.</p>

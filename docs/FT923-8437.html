			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / The threat of regulation stirs an unfettered giant: An era of benign neglect may soon end for the derivatives industry Mr Gerald Corrigan, the powerful president of the New York Federal Reserve, could not have been more blunt: 'The growth and complexity of off-balance sheet activities and the nature of credit, price and settlement risk they entail should give us all cause for concern,' he told an assembly of top-level US bankers in New York this January. 'I hope this sounds like a warning,' he continued solemnly, 'because it is.' His comments sent immediate shock waves through the global market in financial derivatives - the complex and innovative off-balance sheet financial products such as swaps and options which have proved hugely profitable for banks and securities houses. To the professionals who handle these transactions daily, Mr Corrigan's words were a warning that, after more than a decade of benign neglect, financial regulators have their sights trained on the derivatives business. Futures exchanges, which list standardised derivative contracts requiring margin payments to be set aside, have long been the domain of regulators. Yet the derivatives business with corporate counterparties that is written by banks and securities houses may, some supervisors fear, have eluded their grasp. Regulators are now saying the time has come to re-examine the risks being taken with over-the-counter derivatives and to ensure that the nature of those risks is both understood and effectively managed. They are worried that the explosive growth in the use of derivatives in complicated hedging and arbitrage transactions poses new risks to the world's financial system. Derivative instruments, which are linked to underlying securities, allow users to bet on market movements, to exploit price variations and also to reduce financial risk by hedging positions in other markets. Because of their complex relationship with underlying markets, risk and exposure have to be calculated using specially designed computer models. Half a dozen agencies around the world - including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the General Accounting Office in the US, plus the Bank for International Settlements - are now conducting studies into the market for swaps, options, futures and other derivative instruments. The greatest fear of regulators is that the default of a handful of big derivatives players could trigger a domino-like collapse among banks, securities houses and corporations linked by a grid of interconnected payment obligations. There has already been a number of scares involving defaults by derivatives counter-parties. The collapse in 1989 of securities house Drexel Burnham Lambert left unpaid financial obligations that required careful unwinding, as did a series of US bank failures, notably the collapse of the Bank of New England. What recommendations are regulators making? First, they want banks and securities houses to record swaps and other derivative-related obligations on their balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Derivatives are described as 'off-balance sheet' because the cash flows involved in transactions are not listed in corporate accounts. To this end, the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US has already issued rules requiring balance-sheet accounting of derivatives by the end of 1993. The Bank for International Settlements is currently looking at imposing similar rules on an international basis, and also at ensuring banks are adequately capitalised to support their derivatives exposures. Regulators are also concerned about settlement risk (whether clearing and settlement systems are up to handling high-tech derivatives), about operational risk at firms (whether senior executives know the full extent of their companies' exposure to derivatives), and market risk (what happens to derivatives' positions if a sudden and calamitous move in underlying markets throws positions awry). In recent years the growth of the derivatives business has been considerable. Ten years ago the notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps was Dollars 5bn, according to the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA), the industry's trade body. By 1986 the market had grown to Dollars 400bn and, by the end of 1991, the value of outstanding swaps contracts had risen to Dollars 3,800bn. Some of the infrastructure needed to support the market's development has lagged behind. Legal and accounting practices, for example, are not always geared up to cope. In the UK, banks faced losses of close to Pounds 600m when the House of Lords ruled last year that swaps transactions undertaken by local authorities were illegal. Yet the swaps industry believes regulatory concern is overdone and is partly the result of ignorance of how the market operates. It is a point that some supervisors concede. 'We admit to being much less knowledgeable (on derivatives than specialists),' says Mr Richard Farrant, deputy chairman of banking supervision at the Bank of England and a member of the Basle off-balance sheet sub-committee. 'The very scope for variations is held to be a major advantage, enabling transactions to be structured to fit like a glove . . . but it does make for difficulties of control and risk assessment.' Since Mr Corrigan's warning in January, advocates for the industry have worked hard at promoting the benefits of derivatives. They say that swaps enhance the efficiency of capital markets by allowing for a clearer, more accurate allocation of risk. They claim that swaps have improved the quality and diversity of credit risks to which banks and securities firms are exposed. The industry's fears about regulatory encroachment may yet prove overblown. Since Mr Corrigan's blunt comments in January, regulators have appeared to soften their stance. Last week, Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked what he thought Mr Corrigan meant by his warning to bankers. Choosing his words carefully, Mr Mullins responded: 'I think president Corrigan was talking about the need for banks and regulators to understand the nature of these instruments better, and to develop the appropriate infrastructure to control and manage the risks.' To the industry's relief, regulators are increasingly taking a position of open inquiry rather than criticism. One regulator referred to the current reviews as 'a questioning . . . We need to ensure that there is no complacency.' Some bankers now see the voicing of worries by regulators as warning shots across the bows of the derivatives industry. If regulators intended to keep bankers on their toes, their strategy has worked, judging by the worried reactions of market participants. Even defenders of the industry do not dispute the positive impact of the renewed focus from regulators. As one head of swaps at a bank admitted: 'It has certainly concentrated the minds, particularly of senior management, where there has been a rather laissez-faire attitude in the past.'</p>

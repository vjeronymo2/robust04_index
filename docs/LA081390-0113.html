			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST AND WEST GERMANS MARK ANNIVERSARY OF BERLIN WALL  </P> <P> At a cross ringed with barbed wire, Germans from East and West paid solemn  tribute today to the victims of the Berlin Wall on the 29th anniversary of its  construction.  </P> <P> Eighty East Germans died trying to escape across the now-crumbling barrier that  began separating the city on Aug. 13, 1961.  </P> <P> The best-known of them is Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old East Berlin worker cut  down by Communist border guards' bullets in 1962. Fechter lay bleeding to death  for nearly an hour before he was hauled away.  </P> <P> "Here where Peter Fechter died, we can feel how much suffering the wall  caused," East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina said during the ceremony this  morning.  </P> <P> Schwierzina stood beside the cross erected as a memorial to Fechter in West  Berlin. It is near where Fechter lay dying and calling out, "Help me."  </P> <P> A weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony on Aug. 17, 1962, is  tacked to the dark wood.  </P> <P> About 300 people, most of them Germans, gathered for the brief service under a  brilliant sun. More than a dozen large flower arrangements were placed before  the cross.  </P> <P> Although the wall has disappeared there, windows in buildings on the eastern  side still have the bars that kept people from jumping to freedom.  </P> <P> In years past, the Communist East Germans marked the wall's anniversary with  bombastic military parades that drew criticism from the Western Allies.  </P> <P> With the wall vanishing and Germans rushing to unification, today's service was  the first joint memorial officially linking both sides.  </P> <P> West Berlin officials promised that part of the Berlin Wall will be kept  intact.  </P> <P> "The wall cannot disappear completely," said city councilor Erich Paetzold. He  said a remainder will be preserved "so that we don't forget."  </P></p>

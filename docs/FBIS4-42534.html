			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "French MP's Fear U.S. Expansionism"] </F>   [Text] French members of parliament [MP's] are worried by  U.S. trade ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region and believe the  Americans could use the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) as a springboard to further their aims there. This is  at least the main conclusion that comes to mind when reading the  report just released by a fact-finding delegation established by  the National Assembly's Production and Trade Committee headed by  Andre Santini (French Democratic Union -- UDF). The delegation  looked into NAFTA's "economic impact both for participating  countries and third-party countries."    According to delegation members, who visited Mexico, the  United States, and Canada from 18 February to 1 March 1994 and  met with numerous political and business officials, "since there  are no geographical requirements, one cannot rule out potential  integration of Asian countries...." Indeed, NAFTA is not  geographically limited to the American continent. The report  points out that "during preliminary talks, President Bush  mentioned South Korea, Singapore, and even Australia as  potential members."  <H5>  NAFTA Courting South Korea </H5>   Having completed their study, French MP's seem convinced  that  the next stage for NAFTA development will take place in South  Korea, even though "the most obvious candidates are countries of  the American continent." True, the U.S. Government could launch  negotiations with Chile "and possibly Argentina in the  not-too-distant future." However, "the impact of a potential  extension of NAFTA to the south of the continent would be  marginal since the volume of North American exports to this  region is four times lower than to Europe and Asia."    On the other hand, "integration of Asian countries would  definitely be harmful for Europe." Accordingly, even before it  began writing its report, the delegation reportedly told the  Foreign Ministry about this "American attempt at extending NAFTA  to Asia."    "We must bear in mind the fact that NAFTA is nothing more  than a free-trade agreement," a delegation member explained LA  TRIBUNE. "The Americans are not faced with a `deepening vs.  enlargement' dilemma. NAFTA membership criteria are quite  flexible. There is no economic convergence requirement. The  outlook is therefore relatively flexible."    This is why delegation members ask French and EU [European  Union] authorities to "read between the lines," as NAFTA is a  double-barreled trade weapon: "Mexico will be the gateway to  South America, and South Korea the gateway to South East Asia."</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK MURDERS  </P> <P> As an RN student who just finished my psych rotation at the county  mental-health facility, I did not find it surprising that someone as troubled  as Mrs. Broderick got through the system only to carry out the murders.  </P> <P> A 72-hour hold on someone so disturbed is not enough. Time after time I saw  patients released who were violent when brought in and who weren't ready to  leave after only 72 hours. I've always wondered if the paranoid schizophrenic  who was my case study ever got around to harming someone. The ACLU may have had  good intentions when they overhauled the mental-health system in the 1960s, but  they really blew it.  </P> <P> SHERRY OWENS  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / US Agriculture suspends grain credits to Russia THE US Agriculture Department yesterday suspended grain credits to Russia for failing to repay Dollars 10.9m (Pounds 7.2m) on time to four of its private lenders, clouding the future of the US-Russian grain trade relationship, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Mr Roger Runningen, the department spokesman, said Russia would be reinstated in the two-year-old credit programme as soon as its payments were up to date. Vnesheconombank, the Russian foreign exchange bank, sent in a partial payment yesterday after promising to pay in full, but failed to lift the suspension. The Agriculture Department has extended Dollars 5.7bn in export guarantees to the former Soviet Union since January 1991. But Congress, which lobbied for the programme, also worried about the credit record of the former Soviet Union and required the department to monitor repayments strictly. The banks are required to notify the department once repayment is 10 days overdue.</p>

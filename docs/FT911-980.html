			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Tate &amp; Lyle rises 8% in first half TATE &amp; LYLE, the world's largest sweeteners group, yesterday surprised the market with an 8 per cent increase in profits in the six months to March, demonstrating the resilience of food-related stocks in recessionary times. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 87.5m to Pounds 94.7m on turnover down by Pounds 196m to Pounds 1.49bn. The decline in turnover was the result of translating dollar earnings into sterling and of making some disposals last April. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 13.1p and the board recommended a 12.1 per cent rise in the interim dividend to 3.7p. The market seemed to agree with Mr Neil Shaw, the chairman, who said results were satisfactory both in the US and Europe. Shares closed up 9p at 374p. Mr Shaw also said Tate &amp; Lyle would extend its offer for Bundaberg Sugar, the publicly-quoted Queensland sugar cane miller. But he said the latest offer of ADollars 4.10 per share, valuing the group at ADollars 321m (Pounds 146.18m), would not be increased. During the year, Tate &amp; Lyle reduced interest charges from Pounds 36m to less than Pounds 20m due to disposals. At the half-way stage, gearing had risen to 81 per cent from 69 per cent last September. However, this year's interim figure was sharply down on the previous year when gearing was 107 per cent. The group's operating profits fell from Pounds 120.4m to Pounds 112.8. But before currency translations and the lost income from disposed businesses, operating profits were slightly ahead. North American sugar, UK and European sugar and European cereal sweeteners and starch operating profits all increased by more than 20 per cent. Profits from sugar trading fell due to the lack of activity. Details, Page 23</p>

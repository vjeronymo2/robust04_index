			<p>BFN     [Text] AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that Jordan will shortly  make large-scale political moves, to be spearheaded by His  Majesty King Husayn, to explain Jordan's position toward the  international embargo imposed against the Port of al-'Aqabah and  Iraq. Jordan's drive aims to enlighten the world community  about the need to apply pressures to end this embargo, which is  harmful to both Jordan and Iraq, particularly since the outlets  of the countries neighboring Iraq are wide open to trade with  Iraq, whereas only Jordan is besieged in this regard. Jordan is  next only to Iraq in terms of the harm caused by this embargo.    Responsible Jordanian sources said that the Jordanian moves  will take the form of royal visits abroad, the dispatch of  envoys carrying royal messages abroad, as well as extensive  diplomatic efforts on the international scene to be led by  Jordanian Embassies abroad.    The Jordanian campaign aims to end the blockade clamped on  the Port of al-'Aqabah and the embargo imposed on the Iraqi  people. Lately, Jordanian-Iraqi contacts have been activated.  Iraqi Culture and Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, who  is currently visiting Jordan, has relayed a message from  President Saddam to His Majesty King Husayn. Meanwhile, Deputy  Prime Minister Dr. Sa'id al-Tall is visiting Baghdad, where he  has met with several Iraqi officials.</p>

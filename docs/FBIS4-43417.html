			<p>BFN     [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis will  discuss with his U.S. counterpart defense aspects of Greek-U.S.  relations and the question of air navigation in the Aegean which  was the subject of recent remarks by the U.S. Secretary of  State. Mr. Arsenis will begin a visit to the United States on  Sunday [19 June] to attend an informal NATO conference.    The national defense minister stressed in a statement that  Greek fighter aircraft, according to NATO regulations, must be  armed if they intercept unidentified aircraft that violate the  rules of air traffic in the Athens FIR [Flight Information  Region] or violate national airspace.    On the subject of Mr. Warren Christopher's statement, the  national defense minister said that anyone who wants the  artificial tension that was recently created between Greece and  Turkey to be defused should see who is doing the violations and  infringements.    The national defense minister referred to the Turkish  maneuvers Sea Wolf and Efes-94, which are being held in the  eastern Aegean, as well as the efforts by the Turkish press  because of these maneuvers to depict Greek-Turkish relations as  tense, and he pointed out that these maneuvers were scheduled  some time ago and, as is natural, they are being followed by our  country as Turkey also follows the Greek maneuvers.</p>

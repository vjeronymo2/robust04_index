			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fininvest unveils SBE float details FININVEST, the Italian media and financial services group controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, yesterday unveiled its long-awaited plan to list its Silvio Berlusconi Editore publishing subsidiary. The flotation of SBE is linked to an offer to shareholders in Mondadori, Italy's biggest publishing group, to swap into SBE. The aim is to retain Mondadori's identity while having SBE as the eventual single quoted vehicle for Fininvest's publishing interests. Analysts were surprised the transaction was not accompanied by a placing of SBE stock by Fininvest to raise funds. Such a placing is expected soon, with Fininvest eventually divesting up to 49 per cent of SBE's capital, although the first tranche may be smaller. Trading in shares in Mondadori, which was suspended yesterday, is expected to resume today or early next week. Shareholders in Mondadori will be offered one SBE share for every one Mondadori share held. Alternatively, they will be able to exchange four Mondadori non-voting savings shares for three SBE shares. SBE has one equity category. The deal values Mondadori ordinary shares at L15,000 each, against a closing price in Milan on Wednesday of L10,825, while savings shares are valued at L11,250 each against a Wednesday close of L6,905. Should all Mondadori's shareholders accept the deal, about 9.3 per cent of SBE will be floating. The deal comes as part of a capital increase by SBE to L105bn (Dollars 68.8m) from L30bn, which will be subscribed by Fininvest in the form of Mondadori shares. The transaction marks a big strategy change for Mr Berlusconi, who has not hidden his distaste for outside shareholders in his operations. Only Mondadori and Standa, the retailing group bought by Fininvest in the late 1980s, are quoted on the stock market. The decision to float SBE and the expected placing of further stock reflects Fininvest's need for cash to reduce borrowings and finance further expansion. Mr Berlusconi is said to be keen to increase the size of his group through acquisitions. However, Fininvest has been in a 'consolidation phase' for some time owing to growing pressure on its financial resources. Fininvest, which gained control of Mondadori after a battle for control with Mr Carlo De Benedetti in 1990-91, owned almost 90 per cent of the ordinary shares and 80 per cent of the savings stock. Last month it sold 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares to SBE for L243.4bn.</p>

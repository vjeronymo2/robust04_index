			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Antonio Roman] </F>   [Text] Ocosingo, Chiapas State, 26 Apr -- In an urgent  appeal, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno asked Manuel  Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas; Bishop Samuel Ruiz; national and state human rights  commissions; the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]; the  ARIC [Rural Association of Community Interest); and even those  displaced by the armed conflict to establish, together with the  state government, the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, and other  appropriate authorities and organizations, a commission for  community reconciliation in the strife-torn area.    In a new visit to the municipality that was the site of the  1  January armed conflict, the governor met with ARIC-Union of  Unions [Union de Uniones] representatives and ranchers. He  promised the ARIC that he will try to obtain the release of four  Indians who have been in prison since May of last year in El  Carmen Patate Ejido on charges of killing two soldiers. In  addition, the official assured the cattlemen that he will  enforce orders for the arrest of those who have occupied lands  after 15 April and do his best to resolve the squatting problem.    During a brief stay in this town, the governor assessed the  reconstruction projects here and met at this city's Lions Club  office with over 20 organizations and groups, including 16  alleged Zapatists recently released from the Cerro Hueco Prison.  After having their photograph taken with the governor, the  latter demanded compensation for the moral and economic hardship  they suffered while being incarcerated for over three months  without any charges having been made against them. The state  governor agreed to grant them a loan to help them in a farming  program, and that is why they went to Tuxtla Gutierrez today.    In a radio message broadcast to all residents from the XEOCH  radio station in this town, where the constant movement of  vehicles and military troops can still be seen in the streets,  the governor indicated that if the commission for community  reconciliation in the strife-torn zone is created, it could  become the forum for reaching agreements on minimal rules to  allow reconciliation and avoid further confrontation. Lopez  Moreno added that in this region it is particularly necessary to  ensure that there will be no more evictions, invasions, attacks,  or threats on individuals or homes, personal property, or the  real estate of those living there. "We need to guarantee the  free flow of people and products, mostly consumer goods and  staple products and medicines," the governor said in his  message, which was broadcast all day long in Tzeltal.    In this new recent visit to one of the towns that was the  site of January's armed conflict, Lopez Moreno asked the sides  that have been summoned to respond positively to his appeal to  further efforts toward seeking a dignified, just, and lasting  peace and to make genuine social solidarity stronger. The  governor said the commission's goal is to set up forums for  consensus among all the parties in the most convenient places.  "We will examine the people's problems and together we will  decide what must be done. Let us put our agreement in writing  and abide by it."    From the radio station's small booth, surrounded by  announcers, photographers, and cameramen who covered his brief  working visit to the capital city of this municipality, Lopez  Moreno warned that without respect it will not be possible to go  anywhere unless we are prepared to let violence flare up again.  "We must act with haste. If we let more time go by, later will  be too late. Let us prevent a war among brothers. Let us make  a new contribution to the general peace effort in the state.  The commission I propose will allow us to prepare for the  signing of the peace agreement so all will go smoothly and so it  will take affect immediately."    He then added that Chiapas residents want peace. "We want  local residents to return to their jobs; to work the land; to  get rid of their fear and anxiety; to travel about without fear;  to be at peace in their homes; to enjoy life and the things they  own; to trade and to study; in sum, we want a return to  normalcy. We must resolve the problems down there based on an  awareness of the new situation."    The governor also mentioned last night's meeting, when the  Executive Commission for Agrarian Affairs was created. "For the  sake of peace and for the first time in our history, social  leaders, cattlemen, bankers, and peasants met with the  government last night to find together solutions to our  problems, fully aware that either we are all saved or we are all  lost."    In the meeting with ARIC-Union of Unions delegates,  president  Lazaro Hernandez Vasquez voiced the concern of the people of  Ocosingo and Las Margaritas at the delay in signing the peace  agreements. Several delegates told the governor of the  agricultural backwardness from which peasant organizations and  members of ARIC suffer. The delegates requested financial  assistance to buy land and implement production programs.  Santiago Lorenzo Jimenez, ARIC's commissioner for  reconciliation, asked the governor to intervene to secure the  release of Melchor Jimenez Lopez, Antonio Lopez Jimenez, Manuel  Lara Ruiz, and Tiburcio Ruiz Lara, who have been held in the  Cerro Hueco prison since May of last year when two military men  died during an armed confrontation with "several unidentified  individuals."</p>

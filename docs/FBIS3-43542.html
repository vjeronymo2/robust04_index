			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jose de Castro, head of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] foreign affairs department, is currently on  a tour of the country. At this stage he is in northern  Mozambique. While in Zambezia Province, Jose de Castro told  Radio Mozambique that his tour involved choosing Renamo  representatives to the National Elections Commission, among  other things.    Approximately one week after Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama  visited the city of Quelimane, the capital of Zambezia Province  -- saying the people had shown their (?gratitude) and given a  vote of confidence in his party -- is once again the stage for  yet another working visit by high ranking officials in the  [words indistinct] of the Mozambican Government. Renamo Foreign  Affairs Chief Jose de Castro has been in Quelimane on what he  described as a working visit and [words indistinct] General  Peace Accord, concerning verification of the formation of  Zambezia Province Elections Commission.    Asked by our reporters whether the people who had taken him  to Quelimane were linked to the formation of the aforesaid  commission, that Renamo official said that another reason for  his visit to Quelimane concerned the fact that the Renamo  delegate has not been given an official residence. Castro also  noted that work (?has been slow) to rehabilitate the building  which will serve as the party's headquarters in Zambezia  Province [words indistinct] that Renamo official also expressed  concern about the fact that his movement's troops are being  confined only in one of the assembly points in the province. He  said that Renamo's troops have been assembling rather slowly  because they do not have transportation and he added that the  government has been making much out of it to dramatize the  situation.    Just as Afonso Dhlakama pointed out in several speeches in  the province, the Renamo foreign affairs chief reaffirmed there  will never be war in the country again. Another noteworthy  point which came up in the interview he granted our reporters  was the fact that Indian and Portuguese citizens are being  detained in Renamo's (Mongola), in Zambezia Province's Milange  District. Castro said he knew nothing about it and he added  that matter is the responsibility of Renamo's internal  administration. He noted, however, that such matters are often  handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross,  ICRC, which takes the detainees to Malawi; from there they are  returned to their countries.    After criticizing the fact that the provincial government  had  not made it possible for him to meet the provincial governor and  that it had hampered the normal rehabilitation of Renamo's  future provincial headquarters, Jose de Castro accused the  Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, government of deliberately  seeking to jeopardize peace when it made an attempt on Renamo  leader Afonso Dhlakama's life in Nampula.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Book Review: Architects of their own downfall TOWERS OF DEBT By Peter Foster Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 312 pages In the 1980s, the international business world put Paul Reichmann on a higher pedestal than such icons of the era as Donald Trump and Michael Milken. Here was a man who had not only amassed billions of dollars, but had done it the old-fashioned way. Courtly in manner and unassuming in lifestyle, Mr Reichmann masterminded the growth of Olympia &amp; York into the world's biggest property developer. Bankers and politicians lionised him and tenants flocked to O&amp;Y's well-managed buildings. Business negotiations with the company were invariably taxing, but that only served to compound the impression that any Reichmann deal must be a good one. The Reichmann reputation has taken a battering, however, since O&amp;Y succumbed to its USDollars 11bn (Pounds 7bn) debt a year ago. During nine arduous months of debt-restructuring talks, creditors discovered one reason after another to change their minds about Paul Reichmann and his two brothers and business partners, Albert and Ralph. They were furious last April when they found out that Mr Reichmann had briefed the media on his restructuring proposals the weekend before he presented them to the banks. What is more, the data given to the banks were out of date, and failed to disclose just how desperate O&amp;Y's plight had become. The creditors became angrier as the full story emerged of how the vast Reichmann family business had been managed. O&amp;Y had always assured its lenders that each of its buildings was a separate financial entity. But the creditors discovered, too late, that as the property downturn deepened, the Reichmanns had funnelled rents from profitable buildings in New York to their tottering empire in the UK and Canada. 'The seeds of destruction lay in Paul Reichmann's unquenchable ambition,' writes Peter Foster in his book on the rise and fall of Olympia &amp; York. '(His) fatal flaws were excessive belief in his own powers, corporate acquisitiveness and a penchant for larger and larger gambles.' Those attributes were evident in Mr Reichmann's comment in 1988 on Canary Wharf, the London Docklands project which was meant to be O&amp;Y's crowning glory but ended up dragging it down. 'This is not a risky project,' Mr Reichmann is quoted as saying. 'Doing one building there would be risky. Doing a dozen is not.' Such bravado, delivered in the Reichmanns' convincingly low-key style, impressed lenders, journalists and politicians in the heady years when real estate values were soaring. The Reichmann brothers' success story began with the parcel of New York office buildings which they bought in the depths of the city's fiscal crisis in 1977, in the words of one developer, just '20 minutes before the real estate market turned around'. The family's reputation was cemented by a bold decision to begin construction of the imposing World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan as the property boom of the 1980s was lifting off. But these achievements were only one side of the Reichmann story. Towers of Debt tracks the family's mistakes back to 1981 when O&amp;Y moved away from the business it knew best to take control of Abitibi-Price, then the world's biggest newsprint producer. Four years later the family bought a 60 per cent stake in Gulf Oil's Canadian subsidiary for CDollars 2.8bn, in the biggest corporate takeover in Canadian history. The Reichmanns diversified several more times. Though hostile takeovers were not their style, O&amp;Y precipitated a messy struggle in 1986 for control of Hiram Walker, the drinks and resources group. Mr Paul Reichmann again showed poor judgment by backing the mercurial Canadian entrepreneur Mr Robert Campeau during Mr Campeau's over-ambitious takeovers of two of the US's biggest department store groups. Mr Reichmann came to regret his backing of Mr Campeau even more than he did his involvement in the Canary Wharf project. Foster, a Canadian business writer, covers all the main episodes of the O&amp;Y story. But his book lacks the immediacy and fresh detail which distinguish a riveting corporate history from a passable one. While criticising journalists for being blinded by the Reichmann aura, Foster relies heavily on newspaper reports to tell his story. There is scant evidence of original research, such as first-hand interviews, with the notable exception of his accounts of the Gulf Canada and Hiram Walker takeovers (which are reproduced from one of his earlier books). In his preface Foster takes pride in having had two long interviews with Mr Paul Reichmann in 1990. But his access to O&amp;Y insiders seems to have been more limited in the crucial two years that followed. In particular, Towers of Debt gives only a cursory - and mostly second or third-hand - account of O&amp;Y's relations with the banks, arguably the most important players in the saga after the Reichmanns themselves. Foster notes in passing that two banks, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and Bank of Montreal, received more data on O&amp;Y than other lenders. A little more digging might have unearthed the annual ritual in which O&amp;Y invited about 20 bankers to its offices to peek at an abridged version of its financial statements, which they were not allowed to take away. The book also fails to elucidate the full story of the tensions which erupted between O&amp;Y and some of its biggest lenders (and among the lenders themselves) after CIBC refused to put up more money for Canary Wharf in early 1991. While Towers of Debt does a workmanlike job of telling the Reichmann story, readers with the time or inclination to pick up only one book on O&amp;Y may wish to wait for one of the others now in the pipeline.</p>

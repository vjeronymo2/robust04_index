			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Holdings cut again - Directors' transactions HARD ON the heels of last week's significant sales in Logica, the same two directors have been cutting their holdings further. Each has disposed of a further 25,000 shares, bringing the total amount sold, over that extended weekend, to 200,000. Dealing by directors in Etam, the women's wear retailer, has been fairly modest in recent years - some small purchases in 1990 at around 70p and some fairly small sales last year at around 250p mark. But the sale by Jacob Flatau, a non-executive director, of 400,000 shares is on an altogether different scale. Shares in Etam have been on a strong upward trend since late 1990 but, recently, it has been losing momentum. Earnings are forecast to rise by approximately 40 per cent in the year to end-January 1994 and by a further 15 per cent the following year. That sort of growth should ensure the shares avoid any dramatic setback such as the ones seen in 1990, but the upside potential already seems discounted at the ground level. Court Cavendish was floated on the market on July 13 1993 and, despite the issue being over-subscribed, ended the first day dealing at a discount to the issued price of 225p. That discount has since fallen further and five directors have bought a total of 16,300 shares at 187p. So far this year, a number of nursing home companies have come to the market or raised capital.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            No of Company                    Sector     Shares   Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BPB Industries               BdMa     15,756      34           1 Delyn Group                  Pack     35,000      29           1* Densitron                    Elns    125,000      45           1 Etam                         Stor    400,000   1,000           1 General Electric Co          Elnc    175,000     580           1* Jacques Vert                 Text    500,000     548           2 Logica                       Elns     50,000     122           2 Pelican Group                 H&amp;L    250,000     155           1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aberforth Sm Cos Wt          InTr     17,000      12           1 Barlows                      Prop  1,533,238     665           1 Birkby                       Misc      7,200      11           2 BPB Ind Cnv Sub Bds          BdMa     20,000      21           1 Brit Bloodstock Agy          Misc     65,000      33           1 Burtonwood Brewery           Brew     15,000      21           1 Capital Gearing               n/a     19,500      81           1 Cosalt                       Misc     33,000      31           5 Court Cavendish              NewI     16,300      30           5 Dinkie Heel                  Misc     88,000      19           2 Geest                        FdRe     15,000      54           1 Gibbs Mew                     n/a     22,500      66           1 Legal &amp; General              InsL      3,000      15           1 Leveraged Opp Trust          InTr     20,000      21           1 London &amp; Atlantic            InTr     18,228      15           1 Mercury Asset Mgmt           OthF      4,928      27           1 Morrison (WM) S'mkt          FdRe    125,000     156           1 Neepsend                     EngG    400,000      96           1 Next                         Stor     75,000     128           1 Shoprite                     FdRe     50,000      73           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels expects rise of 20% in quarter Hilton Hotels could record a net income increase of more than 20 per cent in the fourth quarter ended December 31, despite taking a Dollars 12.5m reserve, said Mr Raymond Avansino, president and chief operating officer, AP-DJ reports from Beverly Hills. The US hotel and casino company expects to report quarterly net income of 64 to 70 cents a share, or about Dollars 30m to Dollars 33m, compared with 55 cents a share, or Dollars 26.5m, in the year-ago quarter.

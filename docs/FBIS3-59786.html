			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Institute of Applied Energy Research (director:  K. Yamamoto) recently released a report detailing its mid- to  long-term vision of business activities over the next five  years. The report touched on a number of key areas it considers  to be important for the future. In the area of nuclear power,  the report discussed making light-water reactor technology more  sophisticated and developing and evaluating new FBR  (fast-breeder reactor) technologies. In the area of fossil  energies, it mentioned research on developing methane hydrate,  the development of low-temperature carbonization methods for  low-grade coal, research on perfecting effective uses for  asphalt by-products (excess C-grade heavy oil), and research for  developing methods to make low-polluting fuels (emulsion fuels)  from ultra-heavy oil. The first mid- to long-term vision report  was created in 1987, but now five years later, with a staff of  more than 50 people and a budget for its programs reaching  &yen;1.2 billion, a complete revision of its projects was in  order.    The mid- to long-term vision report said the Institute of  Applied Energy Research was the leading research organization in  Japan in the field of energy engineering. It said that the  institute was committed to providing the most far-sighted and  best possible research to meet the demands of both the public  and private sector. In terms of business activities, the  institute is involved with the following:    (1) Collecting and evaluating data on energy technologies    (2) Conducting surveys on energy technologies and setting  directions of growth    (3) Proposing policies and strategies for developing energy  technologies    (4) Conducting international exchange programs, and  sponsoring educational programs related to energy technologies    The key research projects covered areas such as nuclear  energy, fossil fuel energy, new energy and/or energy systems, or  those that combine one or another of the above areas. The  research projects were further subdivided into those that have  already begun, those with short-term goals, and those with  long-term goals.    Nuclear power is expected to become the main source of  energy  by the 21st century, but because of the strong anti-nuclear  sentiments in Japan, the institute says it will work harder to  make light-water reactor technology more refined and  sophisticated by trying to depict nuclear reactors as beneficial  and not dangerous. Another important area of research is finding  a quick solution to the problem of treating and disposing of  high-level radioactive wastes.    In the area of fossil fuel energies, the institute plans to  continue working on research to perfect the natural gas/methanol  cycle, and at the same time promote research on methane  hydrates, which are non-conventional sources of natural gas, by  the electric power and gas companies. With respect to coal, the  institute wants to subject coals such as lignite and brown coal  to thermal decomposition and develop a low-temperature  carbonization method for making a low-grade coal in which a  15&percnt;  gasoline-diesel distillate and a 60&percnt; low-temperature coke  (equal to average coal) can be obtained. By doing this, the  institute hopes to use spontaneous combustion to find effective  uses for brown coal resources which are hard to transport over  great distances.    As for oil, in addition to looking for ways to perfect uses  for asphalt by-products, the institute will continue its  research on developing a high-efficiency garbage burning  generation system that uses oil.    In terms of expanding the range of uses for super-heavy oil,  it plans to develop emulsion fuels from asphalt distillates and  tar sand by dispersing super-heavy oils in water, or conversely,  dispersing water within super heavy oil, mixing this with  calcium ions to improve combustibility, so that it can be used  to desulfurize reactor cores.</p>

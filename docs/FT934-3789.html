			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (3): Getting the most from the least - Andrew Baxter describes the combined-cycle machines that power the dash to gas Over the past 10 to 15 years, combined cycle power generation has made a big contribution to restoring the reputation of large utilities for safe, efficient, and relatively unpollutive production of electricity. After all the criticism - unjust or otherwise - heaped on utilities for their dirty coal-fired plants or politically sensitive nuclear stations, power generation using the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) method might appear to be the answer to every power provider's prayers. It isn't, of course, but in many respects it comes closest to achieving the balance between the thermal efficiency and environmental friendliness now sought by big utilities. Combined cycle power plants use the exhaust gases from a gas turbine, which are still at a temperature of at least 500 degC, to generate steam via a waste heat recovery boiler. The steam is then used to drive a steam turbine. This means that thermal efficiency, the amount of energy per unit of fuel used, is about 55 per cent, much higher than simple cycle gas turbines or the average coal-fired steam turbine plants. These currently achieve efficiencies of 35 and 40 per cent respectively, although efficiencies of 45 per cent are claimed for the latest 'squeeky clean' conventional coal-fired plants. On top of increased thermal efficiency, CCGT power generation emits very little sulphur dioxide, and has low nitrous oxide levels compared with coal-fired stations. Assuming that efficient supplies of gas are available, a CCGT station provides efficient, flexible and clean power generation. It has taken a long time, and considerable expense by equipment suppliers, to reach these efficiency levels. In the early 1960s the efficiency of combined cycle plants in general was about 28 per cent, and by 1975 had exceeded 40 per cent. Today, the largest gas turbine currently in use is the 212-226MW General Electric MS9001F machine, which is being manufactured jointly by GE of the US and GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbines subsidiary. In combination with a 120MW steam turbine in a Vega 109F unit, efficiencies of about 55 per cent and an output of 335MW can be achieved. It is not surprising, therefore, that combined cycle is expected to play such a large part in fulfilling worldwide needs for additional power capacity over the next 10 years. GE forecasts 610GW (gigawatts, or thousands of megawatts) of capacity additions from 1993-2002, of which 207GW will be provided by steam, 179GW by combined cycle, 101GW by gas turbines alone, 85GW by hydroelectricity and renewables, and 38GW by nuclear. In the US over the same period, it expects most of the additions to be combined cycle and gas turbines. The breakdown is 64GW of combined cycle, 25GW of gas turbines, 12GW of steam, 3GW of hydro and renewables and 1GW of nuclear, amounting to 105GW of total capacity additions. The general consensus in the industry is that efficiency improvements are slowing down, and that it will take perhaps a decade for combined cycle to exceed 60 per cent thermal efficiency. But suppliers have not yet reached the point of diminishing returns, for a simple reason: even very small percentage increases in thermal efficiency can reduce a utility's annual fuel bill by millions of dollars or equivalent, or allow it to produce more power from the same fuel cost. Two developments in the power generating equipment industry this year show that none of the handful of major suppliers would be happy if any one rival was to take an unassailable lead in the thermal efficiency race - which is really a poker game where each supplier tries to meet or raise his rival's figure. In February, GE announced a worldwide licensing agreement with Exergy, a small California-based company, which will allow GE to graft the so-called Kalina cycle technology on to the combined cycle process and possibly add one or two percentage points to thermal efficiency. The Kalina cycle, developed by Dr Alexander Kalina, a Russian emigre, avoids some of the compromises inherent in the standard Rankine steam cycle by using a mixture of fluids which have different boiling points - normally, ammonia and water. Using the mixture increases the thermodynamic availability of energy transfer from the gas turbine exhaust to the steam turbine, and thus produces more electricity from the same quantity of fuel. Then, in September, Asea Brown Boveri announced the introduction of two big new turbines which it claims will achieve a leap forward by offering 58 per cent efficiency in combined-cycle plants on 60-cycle (Hz) power networks and 58.5 per cent in 50-cycle markets. ABB was worried by the GE gas turbines in the early 1990s, but did not panic. Instead, it decided to branch away from the conventional methods of raising efficiency - ever hotter gas turbines giving higher exhaust temperatures in turn - and try something different. ABB has gone back to a system it pioneered in 1948 known as sequential combustion, which uses two combustion chambers within one gas turbine. The aim is to avoid the frustrating trade-offs inherent in the conventional approach - higher temperatures risk reducing reliability, while higher efficiency can raise emission levels. In the process ABB has leapfrogged GE and can offer a 365MW combined cycle unit, including the steam turbine. With rather less fanfare, all the suppliers have also been working on improving the efficiencies of the steam turbines that are an integral part of the combined cycle process. In recent years there have been some important improvements to overall steam turbine design, with single pressure turbines replaced by a double pressure process or even a triple pressure process with reheat. These developments, says Siemens of Germany, significantly improve the overall efficiency of the combined cycle plant. There have also been improvements in individual parts of the steam turbine, notably the blading, and the aerodynamics of internal parts have been improved using computational fluid dynamics. Each of these changes has a small effect on overall efficiency, but together make a significant contribution.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Sarychev, candidate of historical </F> sciences at Russian Institute for Strategic Studies:  "Washington's `Ukrainian Card'"]    [Text] The recent American-Ukrainian summit in  Washington was not marked by the signing of sweeping agreements.  By reaffirming its commitment to the trilateral Moscow agreement  on the Ukrainian nuclear weapons, Kiev secured Washington's  consent to the offer of 700 million dollars in American aid to  Ukraine and the extension of 400 million dollars in reserve  credit in the future. From the standpoint of Russian national  interests, however, it would be wrong to underestimate the  results of the summit. The latest meeting between B. Clinton and  L. Kravchuk, just as the Washington visits of the leaders of  Kazakhstan and Georgia, suggested that the United States is  competing vigorously with Russia for political and economic  influence in the post-Soviet zone.  <H5>  Kiev as a Counterbalance </H5>   We know that in the first weeks after Clinton arrived in the  White House, he and his advisers were already making some effort  to reassess American-Ukrainian relations. Whereas the Bush  administration had conducted an uncompromising dialogue with  Ukraine, suggesting that economic and other aid to Kiev be  dependent on its renunciation of nuclear weapons and development  of relations with Russia, the Clinton team is employing much  more flexible tactics. According to the frank admission of U.S.  Deputy Secretary of State S. Talbott, "we let our Ukrainian  friends know that we are striving for broader, deeper, more  meaningful, multidimensional relations with a view to our common  interests in the spheres of economics, politics, and security."    It is precisely in this context that we must view the  congressional hearings on the state of U.S.-Ukrainian relations  at the end of June 1993, resulting in the elaboration of the  five fundamental principles of the Clinton administration's  "Ukrainian" policy:    "1. A country in the center of Europe as large and as rich  in  resources as Ukraine should be playing a decisive role in  security matters in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE);    "2. Ukrainian independence and sovereignty are important to  U.S. national interests;    "3. Our relationship with Ukraine will not depend on our  relations with Russia;    "4. In view of its history and geographic location, Ukraine  has legitimate security concerns;    "5. We believe that Ukraine's own interests would be served  by the fulfillment of its commitments in line with the Lisbon  Protocol, its ratification of the START I Treaty, and its  affiliation with the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons as a nuclear-free state."    It appears that Washington is pursuing several goals at once  in its more active "Ukrainian" policy. First of all, it wants  the complete elimination of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, with the  whole process under its own close supervision, because the state  of nuclear security in that former Soviet republic is a matter  of serious concern.    Second, it is striving for the more predictable development  of the still extremely complex political and economic situation  in Ukraine, primarily by discouraging the curtailment of reform  and preventing the country from sliding into chaos and splitting  into several states, which CIA analysts expect to occur in the  next two years. "The problem consists less in how successful or  unsuccessful America's actions are than in the uncertainty of  Ukraine's own position. It proudly declares its independence,  but it does not have the necessary experience to cope with  genuine difficulties," the WASHINGTON POST remarked.    Third, from the standpoint of American geostrategic  interests, an independent Ukraine should serve as a strong  buffer zone between CEE and Western Europe and Russia. It is no  coincidence that Washington has had a generally positive  response to the idea of establishing various types of regional  bloc structures along the western borders of Russia under U.S.  and NATO control. Furthermore, Washington's own attempts to form  groups of states of its own design in the post-Soviet zone have  been accepted by all of the countries of the East European  region without exception, including Ukraine.    In pursuit of the fourth and final goal, Washington has  given  up its earlier temporizing stance on Ukraine and other former  Soviet republics, particularly Georgia and Kazakhstan, and now  wants to take the lead in formulating and conducting Western  policy toward the CIS and to limit Russia's geopolitical  potential considerably by making the breakup of the USSR  irreversible and keeping Russia from inheriting great-power  status. As S. Talbott, the "generator" of American policy on the  CIS and Baltic countries, categorically announced, "we do not  agree that Russia has a sphere of influence allowing it to  behave in certain ways beyond its own borders with adverse  effects on the independence of these states.... We do not even  want to accept the implications of the term 'nearby foreign  countries.'"    Therefore, Ukraine is being assigned the role of a  counterbalance to possible Russian geostrategic and geoeconomic  ambitions, especially its hope of securing key positions for  itself in the post-Soviet zone. During the recent  American-Ukrainian summit, L. Kravchuk publicly agreed with this.  <H5>  `We Need a Strong Ukraine' </H5>   Officials in Washington are not concealing the fact that the  "Ukrainian card" will be played primarily in the sphere of  military policy, where financial expenditures are not that  burdensome but are extremely effective. Above all, this  presupposes the offer of security guarantees to Kiev, with a  view to its national independence and territorial integrity. As  evidence of this, Ukraine was the first of the CIS countries to  be included in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program.    In addition to this, the Clinton administration wants to  enhance its relations with Kiev with an extensive long-range  program of economic, scientific, and technical cooperation, with  a view to the impressive economic potential of Ukraine, which  accounts for around 20 percent of the GDP of the CIS countries.  In the opinion of several American politicians, during the  effort to strengthen Ukraine's economy, America should try to  lessen Kiev's dependence on Moscow by redirecting the Ukrainian  economy toward the West. According to Z. Brzezinski, who has  criticized the Democratic administration several times for  putting too much emphasis on Moscow and not paying enough  attention to Kiev, "if we do not want the revival of the Russian  empire, we need a strong Ukraine."    At this time the State Department is working on several  proposals to broaden economic aid to Ukraine and send a group of  highly professional experts to that country on the condition  that it take vigorous steps to decentralize its economy. There  is no question that the agreement signed at the  American-Ukrainian summit on the protection of foreign capital  investments in Ukraine will have a positive effect on the  development of trade and economic relations between the two  countries. Besides this, Kiev probably will get the promised  credits of 1.5 billion dollars from the IMF and the World Bank.    In view of the present disastrous state of the economy and  the mounting separatist feelings in Crimea and several eastern  oblasts, however, the Ukrainian leadership cannot put too much  hope in a strong influx of American investments or in the U.S.  offer to "usher" Ukraine into Western markets even if it does  conduct a harsh confrontational policy in relations with Russia  (which Ukrainian public opinion is unlikely to support).    Furthermore, Ukraine does not have much chance of joining  the  rapidly growing European Union or the "Visegrad Group," for  which Kiev would be too "unmanageable." In other words, the  circle is closing, and it may be impossible to escape Moscow.  <H5>  `The Hand of Moscow' </H5>   Irrespective of the wishes of the Ukrainian leadership, the  once prosperous former Soviet republic might have to rely on a  helping hand (in accordance with market conditions) only from  Russia in the near future. An economic policy with an  anti-Russian thrust would be futile and dangerous for Ukraine.  The roots of industrial cooperation are too deep, and its  dependence on Russian crude resources, especially gas, is too  strong.    This does not mean, however, that the RF Ministry of Foreign  Affairs can turn the pursuit of Russia's "Ukrainian" policy over  to Gazprom, which was so proficient in finding a solution to the  problem of Ukraine's debts for deliveries of Russian natural gas.    The fact is that playing the "Ukrainian" card, just as other  cards like the "Georgian" and "Kazakhstani" ones, could lead to  the dramatic reduction of Russia's geostrategic and geoeconomic  capabilities under some circumstances. It is in Moscow's  long-term interest to intensify integration processes within the  CIS, establish a single post-Soviet economic zone,  unconditionally give up the internationalization of problems  between Russia and Ukraine (Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet), and  support the social and economic structures in Ukraine with the  strongest affiliation with the Russian Federation. Finally, it  is time to consider more vigorous activity by Russian  transnational corporations. Russia's investment expansion  probably will produce perceptible economic advantages and  strengthen its influence in the nearby foreign countries.</p>

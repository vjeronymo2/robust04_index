			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> DON'T SHOOT AT THE MARINES  </P> <P> Irvine officials have been so concerned about Marine Corps helicopter flights  over their city that last month they asked the Defense Department to stop all  flights out of the Tustin air base. So it is hard to believe that the city  would seriously consider making the situation worse by allowing nearly 4,000  new homes to be built under the helicopter flight path -- in the Irvine Co.'s  proposed Westpark II residential village -- without requiring adequate sound  protection for all the residents.  </P> <P> That is what would happen if the city makes the mistake of not following the  reasonable recommendation of its own planning staff, and of the Marines, to  require soundproofing of all the homes. The Irvine Co. has asked to exempt a  substantial number from the requirement, and the Planning Commission now has  the development before it.  </P> <P> The city, out of concern for its residents and the Marines' vital military  mission, should turn a deaf ear to the developer's demands.  </P> <P> The area, on the doorstep of the air base, probably is not the best place in  Orange County for a new housing project. But nobody, including the Marines, is  saying that housing shouldn't be built. The reality is that residents will see  and hear the helicopters regularly; and the Marines' firm policy is not to  compromise flight safety for noise-abatement measures. Therefore, it is in  everyone's best interest to minimize helicopter noise.  </P> <P> Although prospective homeowners now must be advised of the closeness of the air  station and their homes' location beneath flight patterns, history shows that  such homes are bought, and later residents raise complaints about the noise,  demanding that flights be rerouted or halted altogether.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps is understandably concerned that this will happen again,  resulting in increased pressure on the air station's operations, which require  intensive training to maintain combat readiness. The crises in Liberia and  Kuwait offer ample evidence of the need to preserve the Marines' military  mission. Adequate sound attenuation for all the new homes could help make life  considerably more comfortable for everybody concerned.  </P> <P> In the unlikely event that the Irvine Co. could demonstrate that any part of  the area would not be subject to helicopter noise, the city might have grounds  to exempt some homes, giving buyers the choice of purchasing noise-reduction as  an option.  </P> <P> Otherwise, all homes should be built with it. Anything less would not be a  sound policy.  </P></p>

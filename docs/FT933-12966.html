			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political uncertainty upsets Tokyo PROLONGED uncertainty over the political situation and tomorrow's trial of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former kingmaker of the Liberal Democratic party, sent share prices lower in tandem with a weak futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 112.92 down at 20,038.00, having opened at the day's high of 20,123.11 and fallen to the session's low of 19,977.40 in the afternoon. Volume totalled 240m shares, against 266m. Declines led advances by 697 to 249, with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.05 to 1,634.63 but, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.02 to 1,244.36. The index was initially depressed by arbitrage linked selling, later losing further ground on profit-taking. Traders said that while prices were supported by hopes of credit easing, weak fundamentals kept the index from rising above the 21,000 level. Calls for the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, heightened. Mr Juniichiro Koizumi, stepped down from his post as minister of post and communications yesterday, adding pressure on Mr Miyazawa to resign. A fund manager at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer, said that it was not the time to increase exposure to stocks. 'The elections left us with a vague uncertainty, especially over the course of the economy,' he added. Brokerage houses declined, with the sector falling 1.4 per cent, due to prospects of weaker profits in light of the equity market's recent low activity. Nomura Securities retreated Y50 to Y2,030. Profit-taking depressed stocks which were higher early in the week on reports of the listing of DDI, a new telecom company. Ushio dropped Y19 to Y963 and Kyocera lost Y160 to Y6,300. However, trading companies with links to DDI firmed, with Itochu rising Y7 to Y572 and Mitsubishi gaining Y10 at Y1,070. Hazama, the construction concern, fell Y19 to Y457 as the company was implicated in another bribery scandal. Nikkatsu, the bankrupt movie producer and distributor, was the day's most active issue, falling Y4 to Y19. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 137.00 to 22,226.56 in volume of 23.3m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y50 to Y5,550. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets experienced mixed fortunes. HONG KONG rebounded after early weakness and the Hang Seng index was finally 33.09 up at 6,846.81 as local, Japanese and US demand picked up on expectations of positive results from the current round of Sino-British talks. AUSTRALIA pushed forward through the 1,800 level, led by strong advances by BHP and CRA. The All Ordinaries index ended 9.9 higher at 1,806.1 in turnover of ADollars 319.6m. BHP rose 20 cents to ADollars 14.68, while CRA added 24 cents at ADollars 13.60. TAIPEI edged down in turnover that shrank to its lowest level since January. The weighted index finished 9.97 lower at 3,907.84 amid concern about the economy and political tensions ahead of the ruling Nationalist party's congress in August. MANILA blue chips advanced to catch up with the strong performance of secondary issues, and the composite index rose 29.07, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,650.77. SEOUL was again restrained by the labour disputes at Hyundai and the need for financial institutions to meet by-monthly reserve requirements tomorrow, but the composite index managed a 0.5 improvement to 749.88.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Ivanovich Cherginets, chairman of </F> the Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen, by Nikolay  Matukovskiy; place and date not given: "Soldier's Last Stand"]    [Excerpts] Nikolay Ivanovich Cherginets, chairman of the  Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen -- privates and  ranking officers of the bodies of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, veterans of foreign wars who were transferred to the  reserves (or retired), and members of their families -- within  the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers has answered questions from  RESPUBLIKA columnist Nikolay Matukovskiy.    [Matukovskiy] Nikolay Ivanovich, how many people do you  oversee?    [Cherginets] One in every ten citizens of the Republic.    [Matukovskiy] Are you exaggerating?    [Cherginets] Rather minimizing, let us calculate.... The  current strength of the Belarusian Armed Forces is 260,000,  while the required strength should be 90,000 or even 60,000.  Therefore, 170,000 servicemen should be transferred to the  reserves. Next, multiply this figure by three (a husband, a  wife, and a minimum of one child). The majority of them have no  civilian professions, many of them have no housing, they will  have to leave their garrisons. Where will they go? With what  will they deal? Reaching age 45 is not the end of their lives;  this is the most productive age. It is inhumane and unbecoming  of our state. This is how I understand the reduction of the  Armed Forces. I wish that those deputies who demand that the  Armed Forces be instantaneously reduced, understood this  situation.    However, this is our tomorrow, let us speak about our today,  which is no easier. Thousands of Belarusians, who are  performing their military service in various CIS regions, would  like to return to Belarus. Many of them came back, but we have  to absorb 8,684 servicemen including 7,453 officers. As we put  it, 40,000 servicemen "are subject to dislocation" and we have  to bring back 1,000 servicemen from "hot spots...." At the same  time, we have 9,000 servicemen -- retired or transferred to the  reserves -- who lack proper housing; a third of them live in  Minsk alone. Yes, they have some sort of roof over their heads,  but can we call this housing if people are sleeping in bunk beds?    Our Republic had 251,845 soldiers fight in World War II, and  74,990 out of them are disabled. With every passing day their  ranks are reduced. In addition, there are tens of thousands of  families who lost their husbands or sons. In a word, everywhere  there are fresh war wounds....    [Matukovskiy] However, the most bleeding wound is  Afghanistan.    [Cherginets] Of course. This is our ever-lasting pain. Last  year, 30 Afghan war veterans committed suicide, more than 100  were imprisoned. Many of them became drug addicts,  alcoholics.... These people became outcasts. They are on the  edge.... [passage omitted]    [Matukovskiy] Nikolay Ivanovich, they usually say that some  30,000 foreign war veterans live in Belarus. Are we ashamed to  call them Afghan war veterans?    [Cherginets] No, we are not ashamed. The point is that our  countrymen fought not only in Afghanistan, but also in Algeria,  Angola, Vietnam, Egypt, Yemen, China, North Korea, Syria,  Mozambique, Ethiopia -- all in all, in 14 states! One  Belarusian even fought in the Seychelles! All in all, 30,577  Belarusians have fought on foreign soil. Fortunately, most of  them survived.... [passage omitted]</p>

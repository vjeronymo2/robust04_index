			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK shares reach record high as hopes of recovery rise SHARE PRICES in London closed at record levels last night on the back of optimism about recovery prospects and signs that sterling was holding on to its recent gains. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares gained 36.5 at 2,698.7 as investors took heart from Tuesday's half-point cut in interest rates to 10 per cent. The reduction in borrowing costs is expected to lead to a gradual uplift in the retail and housing markets - developments seen as helping a sustained revival from the recession that started around mid-1990. Sterling was unchanged in London against a stronger D-Mark, closing at DM2.925. That underlined the perception of many investors that, in spite of the cut in UK rates, sterling is unlikely to encounter serious strain within the European exchange rate mechanism over the next few weeks. The currency was close to its London levels in late New York trading. The possibility, viewed as remote by many economists, that the Bundesbank council might decide to increase German rates at its regular meeting today led to some switching of funds into the D-Mark. This caused the dollar to drop 1 pfennig to DM1.6305 in London. It closed at DM1.6287 in New York. But the buying pressure buoying the D-Mark was not enough to disturb sterling's position within 3 pfennigs of its DM2.95 central ERM rate. Against the dollar, the pound gained more than 1 cent in London to Dollars 1.7945. It closed at Dollars 1.7975 in New York. The rise in share prices pushed the FT-SE index above its last closing high of 2,683.7, reached eight months ago. The rise contrasted to Tuesday's tepid stock market reaction to the UK's first base rate cut since September. Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of economics research at stockbroker Charterhouse Tilney, said investors had needed time to tell whether the rate cut would damage sterling. 'If you are confident an upturn is really going to happen, the stock market looks 10 per cent undervalued.' Lex, Page 24 London stocks, Page 44</p>

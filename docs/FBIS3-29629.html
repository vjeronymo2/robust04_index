Watanabe, a former trade minister, made the remarks in a  speech in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, in northern Japan.    He mentioned Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the  parliamentary group composed of Sakigake (Harbinger) and Japan  New Party (JNP) as parties that could form single force to  maintain power against the primary opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP).    Watanabe said, "we have responsibility for merging the five  political forces into a single party prior to the April 1995  nationwide local elections and the July 1995 House of  Councillors election."    Shinseito, a splinter from the LDP, would put priority on  merging with the JNP, headed by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, and Sakigake as a first step toward reorganizing  Japanese politics, Watanabe said, adding, "we will then call on  the SDP, the DSP and Komeito to join the force."    He said the five political forces should forge a single  party  to satisfy the Japanese people.    Shinseito and Komeito have said the governing coalition  parties must unite to create a two-party system, sustain a  coalition government and prevent the LDP from regaining power.    The LDP lost its 38-year grip on power last August shortly  after its defeat in the July 18 general election.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of communique by Subcommander Marcos from the Zapatist </F> National Liberation Army (EZLN), addressed to the weekly  newspaper PROCESO, the national newspapers LA JORNADA and EL  FINANCIERO, and the San Cristobal de Las Casas newspaper TIEMPO,  dated 3 June]    [Text] Gentlemen: Communiques citing "representatives" and  information on the consultations are on their way. The clouds  lean lazily on the sides of the mountains here. The sun is  light gray and somnolent. The day is already a humid whisper  dragging itself along amid the mud and thorns. Here's to you:  health and an alarm clock (so as not to stay asleep).    From the mountains in southeastern Mexico, Insurgent  Subcommander Marcos. Mexico, June 1994.    Postscript for Nuncio, Abraham. The rocket [previous word in  English] was shot down. The antiaircraft team commanded by El  Beto (eight slings and eight very good marksmen) detected the  rocket when it was about to land, 20 meters before its tip  touched the ground. Eight stones, little stones, rough stones  gave it the kiss of death on its right flank. As someone about  to lie down, the rocket tipped to one side. Our people, as is  customary, organized a party. When they were bringing the  marimba, El Beto approached the fallen rocket and said: "It is  paper and cannot be eaten...yet." No one heard him; the marimba  was already beginning to play the song Carta Marcada and the  couples, using the rain as an excuse, squeezed closer together.  We had to wait for the arrival of the newspaper, which  absurdly, as everything here, came via facsimile. The photocopy  of the rocket remained filed under "R" (for "Rocket" as well as  "Reproaches"). Greetings to Monterrey, the land of the brave.    Cinematographic postscript.    Aerial shot. It is raining. The gray from above and the  moisture will make these lands green again. The burning of  fields is over; something new is beginning to appear amid the  rocks and mountains.    Traveling shot. [Previous two words in English] Dirt, vines,  and tall grass (they call them "houses" here). Women wash  clothes in the stream very carefully, because "if they are  scrubbed too hard, the clothes get torn and there is no thread  to mend them." A boy is pretending an empty flip top [previous  two words in English] cigarette box is a truck, loading it with  pebbles. "They are sacks of corn," he tells the EZLN guard at  the checkpoint who, amid the rain, tries to cover the boy with a  piece of nylon [previous word in English]. It is useless,  however; the truck is driving away from the checkpoint, and the  guard must return to his position. Tonita washes her face with  the rainwater she has collected in a can of light [previous word  in English] drink. In an old wooden building, the only building  with a metal roof (they call it "the school" here), amid dark  faces, black eyes, mud-laden boots, old shirts, and red  bandannas, men with mustaches discuss war and peace. The guard  at the EZLN headquarters shivers coldly under the frayed plastic  roof. The pole men from the barges arrive soaking wet: half  sweat and half rain but all mud. Cold hands gather around the  fire, weaving stories of big hats, squawk boxes [cajitas  parlantes], and women who walk at night. El Beto stretches the  opening of a balloon, which he has filled with water, and plays  at making it rain. The water falls into the puddle at his feet.  Moises and Tacho gaze at the swollen river then try to cross it  on a wooden raft. No one says a word, they stare at the brown  water as if they were looking at life.    Longshot [previous word in English]. Maria, 30 years old  with eight live children ("four of them died"), emerges at the  bend of the main road carrying a pack of wood on her back: the  weight, the leather strap [mecapal], and the mud force her to  look down. She also carries an axe in her right hand. Josefa,  15, follows her with another wobbly pack of wood. Josefa is  unconcerned about the mud; she is making sure the leather strap  does not mess up her hair or pull out the eight "hairpins" she  has fastened to her hair. Another bundle of wood follows, a  scant few feet above the ground. Underneath it, barefoot, is  Pedro, 8, one hand carrying a machete, the other holding the  leather strap to help balance the weight on his head.    Medium shot [previous two words in English]. Hortensia, an  EZLN rebel and seamstress, proudly shows off her latest  achievement: she has made a pair of pants out of five torn and  ripped pairs. When she shows the pants to the men, they all  remember they have something to do elsewhere. Hortensia remains  with the pants in her hands: It has four different colors and,  inadvertently, she says, a little flower at the crotch.    Closeup [previous word in English]. Half covered by brown  shirt sleeves, two hands use an awl and thick thread to mend a  boot that has more scars than the back of Ahab's whale. The red  bandanna provides relief for the blisters.    Upward shot. Under a puckered brow, two eyes dance from one  side to another, lips begin to move and, amid quiet, whisper:    "Let my voice rise to the mountains    and fall to the ground as thunder,    that is what my throat would like    from now on and forever."    Downward shot. Someone is reading, with a rifle across his  thighs. The words, sadly, reach out.    "Yesterday the people woke up    naked with nothing to wear, and    starving, with nothing to eat,    and today the day broke    justly stormily    and bleeding justly.    In their hands, the rifles    want to become like lions    to get rid of the beasts    they've had to face over and over.    Even if you have no weapons,    people of a hundred thousand powers,    do not let your mettle fail you,    get back at those who hurt you    as long as you have fists,    nails, saliva, and still have a    spine, heart, and guts,    your manly attributes and teeth."    A right hand reaches out and turns the page of the book by  Miguel Hernandez. The lens loses focus, hesitates, and then  refocuses, zeroing in on the paragraph:    "I am here to live    as long as my soul can dream,    and I am here to die    whenever my time is come,    in the bosom of my people,    from now on and forever.    Life is several swallows,    but death is simply one.    Audio off. "Who's there?" "The Fatherland." The echo can be  heard amid the rain and the fog; the sound of feet squishing in  the mud begins anew.    Fade out. The color green splattered with brown and red,  sort  of hidden behind the gray and the final wink of the camera  shutter.    Audio off. A faraway plane fades into nothingness in the  air....    It is over. The Sup [name as published] behind the lens  stupidly believes that the word play [preceding word in English]  on the camera really means "to play"... [jugar].</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUES;  </P> <P> CRAIG GREBECK IS CHICAGO'S LITTLE BIG MAN FOR A DAY  </P> <P> Diminutive rookie Craig Grebeck could stand on a pile of baseball record books  and still be looking up to the accomplishments of future Hall of Fame pitcher  Nolan Ryan.  </P> <P> But one day, Grebeck, who at 5-foot-6 is the smallest player in the American  League, rose above Ryan and his record collection.  </P> <P> Grebeck, the former Cal State Dominguez Hills standout, shocked Ryan with his  first major league home run, a three-run shot to help the Chicago White Sox  complete a doubleheader sweep, 5-2, 5-1, over the Texas Rangers Aug. 10.  </P> <P> "I'll remember this homer as long as I live," Grebeck said. "It came off one of  the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball."  </P> <P> Grebeck, who was recalled from the minor leagues Aug. 2, waited until his 69th  at-bat before hitting his first home run. He had a .118 batting average with  three runs batted in in 37 games before his confrontation with Ryan. He drove a  Ryan fastball into the left-field stands in the second inning after a one-out  double and a walk.  </P> <P> "Ryan had just walked a guy and with Ron Karkovice on base, I figured Ryan  wants to make a good pitch, but he made it too good," Grebeck said. "When I hit  it, I usually know the ball is going a long distance, but since I'm a little  guy I don't try to hit homers."  </P> <P> Ryan will remember Grebeck's home run as a footnote to his 269th career defeat  and his second consecutive loss since won his 300th game.  </P> <P> "When Grebeck hit that first pitch, I knew he hit it good," Ryan said. "I felt  like I had better stuff than the last three or four outings, but I simply made  some bad pitches, and it doesn't make any difference who's at bat."  </P> <P> Grebeck can't wait for another round. That night the drinks were on him.  </P> <P> No handouts -- Reliever Scott Neill, a former Loyola Marymount College  standout, continues to receive requests to hand over a baseball, but it no  longer means that he's being taken out of a game. Nowadays, Neill is being  hounded by souvenir collectors, not angry managers.  </P> <P> In the bullpen, Neill gets tapped on his cap by young fans requesting  autographs. Neill tries to ignore the fans because it's against league rules to  give away baseballs.  </P> <P> "I wish I could sign every piece of paper and hand out a ball to every fan that  requested one, but I can't," said Neill, who nevertheless enjoys the attention.  "The umpires really watch us when a foul ball goes into the bullpen. We get  fined for every ball we throw into the stands."  </P> <P> A long reliever for the Cleveland Indians Class A team in Kinston, Ohio, Neill  has an impressive 8-3 record with a 2.66 earned-run average entering this  week's games. He pitched 28 2/3 scoreless innings until Greg Blosser of the  Lynchburg Red Sox ended the streak with a home run two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It took a first-round draft pick to score a run off me," said Neill of  Blosser, who was the Boston's top pick in the 1989 June amateur draft.  </P> <P> No one thought Neill would be holding a baseball after graduating from Loyola  Marymount in 1988. He had an unimpressive 5-4 record as a senior with the Lions  and his fastball was judged to be too slow by professional standards.  </P> <P> After being bypassed in the 1988 draft, Neill played with the Santa Maria  Indians, a semi-pro team near his hometown of San Luis Obispo. Neill impressed  an umpire, who had connections with major league scouts, and was signed as a  free agent by the Cleveland Indians.  </P> <P> "It's been a really slow process," Neill said. "I started at the bottom and  have moved up one level at a time. I've been pretty close to the 10th and last  man on every pitching staff until last year."  </P> <P> Neill, 23, had his best minor-league season in 1989 when was 3-2 with a 1.80  ERA as the stopper for Watertown, N.Y. (Class A).  </P> <P> During spring training, Neill changed his delivery to become more of a side-arm  pitcher and received a promotion to Kinston where he gained popularity.  </P> <P> "I finally had to tape a piece of paper to my hat that said, 'I don't give away  baseballs,' " Neill said.  </P> <P> He hasn't been giving away too many runs, either.  </P> <P> A sign of trouble -- Taunting can get pretty bad in the minor leagues,  especially in North Carolina where Kinston plays the Durham Bulls, a team that  became popularized by the movie "Bull Durham." The field is favorite hangout  for college students attending nearby Duke University.  </P> <P> In the season's first series, Kinston reliever Greg Ferlinda walked to the  mound with the score of the NCAA basketball championship taped to his back. His  handmade sign read: "UNLV 103, Duke 73."  </P> <P> "I wasn't there, but I heard that sign silenced the crowd," Neill said. "We  already have a pretty good rivalry with Durham, but I think that added to the  intensity of our games.  </P> <P> "We seem to draw big crowds whenever we play there."  </P></p>

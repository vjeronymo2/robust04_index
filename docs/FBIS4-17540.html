			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Here is what Russian President Boris Yeltsin said  about the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon to  American television today:    [Begin Yeltsin recording] The main thing is that I realize  that he is probably one of the first politicians, one of the  first major world politicians who understood Russia, who  understood what it wants, what it is fighting for, who  understood that Russia wants rebirth, the return of what was  lost over those seven decades. I am simply grieving over  Richard Nixon's death. He had my genuine, sincere, heartfelt  respect, and I regarded him as one of the strongest, one of the  strongest politicians in the United States of America. I  sympathize with, and would like to offer my condolences to, the  family of this very much respected man and great politician.  [end recording]</p>

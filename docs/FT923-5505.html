			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Malaysian group has 5.8% of Lonrho GENTING, the Malaysia based group mainly involved in gaming, plantations and manufacturing, has confirmed that associate companies have amassed a total 5.83 per cent stake in Lonrho, the troubled British conglomerate. After a confusing 24 hours in Malaysian corporate circles, with reports and rumours giving Genting up to 10 per cent of Lonrho, Genting circulated yesterday copies of a letter it had sent the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange clarifying its position. Genting said that up to August 27 Genting Berhad, the group's investment holding company, had purchased through its subsidiaries a total of 25,366,000 Lonrho shares - representing 3.88 per cent of the total Lonrho stock. In addition it reported: 'we have been informed by Genting International Ltd. (GIL) that one of its subsidiaries has, up to August 27, 1992 purchased 12,758,000 shares in Lonrho' - representing 1.95 per cent of the total Lonrho stock. 'Therefore the combined Genting Berhad Group's and GIL Group's equity investment in Lonrho would amount to 5.835 per cent' says the letter. The move into Lonhro attracted great interest in Malaysia, with speculation the group might take its holding to 10 per cent.</p>

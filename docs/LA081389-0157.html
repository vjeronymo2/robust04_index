			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL ALIENS  </P> <P> Regarding your Aug. 6 editorial ("Keep Open a Window to Police"): "detaining  illegal aliens who had committed no crime"?  </P> <P> The last time I looked, it was a crime to enter this country without permission  and proper papers. This is why those who enter without permission are called  illegal aliens -- they are here illegally, having broken federal law in the  process.  </P> <P> DUNCAN McCARTHY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

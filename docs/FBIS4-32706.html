			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Ajanovski: "Indispensable </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] Do you remember the statements of former Greek  Prime Minister Konstantin Mitzotakis that Athens would never  negotiate with the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]? He made this statement just  when mutual dialogue for solving the Greek-Macedonian dispute  had started in New York.    Taking over the wheel of the Greek Government, Prime  Minister  Andreas Papandreou strongly accused his predecessor for  accepting such discussions, and he threatened to break them off  unless Macedonia changed its name. To show how resolute he was  to break "Skopje," and thus force it into unilateral  concessions, he imposed an economic blockade, believing that  this was the way to provide an excuse for breaking off the  dialogue.    Strongly affected and damaged, the Macedonian side clearly  stated that it would not accept any further negotiations under  the Greek embargo.    At the same time, there was a constant inflow of information  from New York and Washington that negotiations had not actually  been broken off and that we might even expect some good progress  soon.    All this indicates that, unlike the violent propaganda  confrontations between the two states, their diplomats were  clandestinely doing their jobs. That was something that  encouraged and pleased us within the overall situation.  Regardless of mutual relations, the misunderstandings, threats,  and conditioning, dialogue is indispensable, we might say  unavoidable, and it represents the only way to overcome problems  between two states. Malice, blindness, and egoism in policy  usually causes damage to one's self if reality is ignored. In  this case, that is exactly what dictates policies and it does  not admit speculation and bluffing. The fact that the Republic  of Macedonia is an independent and sovereign state, a member of  the United Nations, building relations with all its neighbors in  a democratic manner cannot be easily ignored or repudiated. It  is also a fact that Macedonia and Greece, as the closest  neighbors, cannot go on living in isolation and antagonism,  because otherwise they will contradict their official  proclamations advocating new relations in the Balkans, such as  good neighborly relations, open borders, mutual confidence, and  respect.    Because of all this there is no other alternative for  Macedonia and Greece but to accept and respect European  standards in constructing mutual confidence. Anything else  would mean the continuation of the Cold War, which,  unfortunately, is still widely accepted in the Balkans.    In this context, the pressure of the international community  and the United Nations aims at a more rapid normalization of  relations as a precondition for a wider stabilization of the  region. The main question is: How can this be achieved?  Normally, the international community would not like to take  over the role of an outside arbitrator and judge of who is right  and what should be done, but prefers to leave it up to the two  sides to search for the most suitable solutions through direct  mutual negotiations. However, it is doing its best to prevent  either of the two sides from cheating, damaging, or doing  injustices to the other. It does not want either of the two to  feel like a winner or a loser, but that there is a genuinely  acceptable formula for the two sides. The mediating activities  of the international community are aimed in this direction and  its assistance is of enormous importance.    If this approach toward the solution of the Macedonia-Greek  dispute is accepted, there are no grounds for any versions or  claims about instant recipes for the settlement of the dispute,  that is, there are no precise proposals about the name, the  flag, or other issues on which the Macedonian side is allegedly  expected to take a stance. The aims of Greek propaganda are  impossible to accept, we can even say they are cliches. They  are trying to create an impression that the whole dispute is  over these problems and that Macedonia is the one that should  demonstrate good will, after which Greece will decide what it  can and what it cannot accept. It is indicative that so far all  such speculations and alleged proposals were designed by the  Athens media. Or, as they say, like a hungry chick dreaming of  corn.    It seems that Macedonia's tentative diplomacy shares the  responsibility for this impression, because it does not want to  be involved in such speculations and it does not have time  properly to expound its own position regarding the negotiations  and the real essence of the dispute. It could do so and thus  eliminate the doubts and misunderstandings that worry part of  the Macedonian public. In the absence of complete information  on what the negotiations are about, bombarded by the abundant  Greek propaganda, our public, as well as some opposition  parties, are convinced that secret negotiations are being held  and that Macedonia's national and state interests are being  betrayed. This is particularly related to the change of the  name and the state's symbols, and the top Macedonian leadership  is being accused of making concessions "to someone, somewhere."    In a word, there is an impression that the complex dispute  consists exclusively of Greek demands, and the outcome of this  Macedonian-Greek dispute will depend on whether or not these  demands are met. It is not taken into account that the  Macedonian position is not to negotiate issue by issue on  Greece's desires and claims, but wants to put it together as a  package, dealing with all the issues that can contribute to the  normalization of relations, which would ultimately open a space  for overcoming individiual disputed questions. This agreement,  it was affirmed, would be based on the principles of the  German-Polish agreement after the World War II, tracing the  long-term development of mutual relations and a global respect  for the interests of the two states.    Naturally, other questions would be discussed within this  framework, and Athens has been avoiding them like the very  devil, being related to various discriminatory measures and laws  toward Macedonia. These measures are anachronisms in the  international legal system.    This is the only approach that provides opportunities for  getting out of the current dead end, which has been created by  senseless demands that can by no international standards or  principles be subject to negotiation between the two states.  Only by a full and principled establishment of overall  relations and by creating a real climate of confidence and  mutual respect can the current Greek- Macedonian dispute be  solved to the satisfaction of the two states, which coincides  with the efforts of the international community and its  mediating endeavors.    There remains the hope that Greece and Macedonia will find  the strength and wisdom to fight for a model that will open up  new perspectives in their mutual relations, and also in Balkan  relations in general.</p>

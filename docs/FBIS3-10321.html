The survey, conducted by the firm CID-Gallup, has shown that  during the first round of elections, Calderon will obtain 32  percent of the votes, while Ruben Zamora, candidate for the  leftist coalition Democratic Convergence, which includes the  former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  guerrilla organization, will obtain only 16 percent.    Fidel Chavez Mena, the Christian Democratic Party's (PDC)  candidate, will finish third with 10 percent of the votes, while  Roberto Escobar, of the National Conciliation Party (PCN), will  be fourth with two percent, according to the survey.    To win the Salvadoran Presidency during the first round of  elections a candidate must obtain 50 percent plus one of the  votes; otherwise, there will be a second round of elections,  according to the electoral law.    According to the survey, during which 2,100 people were  interviewed throughout the country from 18 to 25 February, 40  percent of the voters are still undecided on which candidate  they will support.    Should there be a second round of elections between Calderon  and Zamora, 37 percent would chose the official candidate, while  22 percent would vote for his opponent, and 41 percent are still  undecided, according to the survey.    In case the second round of elections is between Calderon  Sol  and Chavez Mena, the preferences would be 36 percent against 20  percent, in favor of the Arena candidate.    CID-Gallup Executive Director Olda Maria Acuna has said at a  news conference out of the 40 percent of undecided voters, four  percent chose Arena, 2 percent the leftist coalition, and  another 2 percent the PDC [figures as received].    Acuna has said the high percentage of undecided voters could  be the "decisive factor" of the 20 March elections, and she did  not rule out the possibility there could be a "surprise."    More than 2 million Salvadorans will elect a new president  and vice president, as well as 84 Legislative Assembly deputies,  262 municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central  American Parliament (Parlacen).    The electoral law prohibits the publication of surveys two  weeks before the elections.</p>

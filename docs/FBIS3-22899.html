Such consortia would have competitive advantages in Asia  when  they put to use Korea's knowhow in the fields of the  construction and operation of nuclear power plants in  combination with core technologies of U.S. corporations, the  Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said yesterday.    Cooperation in nuclear energy in third countries will be one  of the most important agenda items at a bilateral conference on  energy and environment scheduled for tomorrow and Saturday, the  ministry said.    Korea is self-reliant for 93 percent of technology required  for the construction of nuclear power plant, the ministry said.    The Korean delegation headed by Kim Tae-kon, assistant  minister for energy and resources, will also propose the import  of energy-saving and recycling technology from the United States  and the dispatch of energy experts to Korea, it said.    The United States will be represented by John Riggs,  principal deputy assistant secretary for policy, planning and  program evaluation at the Department of Energy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Package Is Device Designed To Get </F> Framework Talks Restarted"]    [Text] On 29 March the government decided on a package of  external economic measures. Commenting on the package, a  government official said: "The package is a `device' to resume  the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks."    In response to the package, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor said: "The package is not enough to resume the stalled  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks."    He made clear the U.S. negative reaction to the package.    The points of contention between Japan and the United States  are: 1) macroeconomic measures needed to stimulate the Japanese  economy; 2) the issue of opening up the Japanese market; and 3)  the handling of objective criteria.    As far as macroeconomic policy and the issue of market  opening are concerned, Japan's view is that "it has done its  utmost in the package."    On objective criteria, the most contentious issue between  the  two countries, the Japanese package carries no good answers to  the U.S. demands. It is being said, however, that the lack of  good answers on the issue is a hidden device.    On Japanese voluntary measures for three priority sectors  that were discussed at the framework talks, the package far from  satisfies U.S. demands in the automobile sector, but clearly  indicates specific objective criteria that Japan considers the  best option in present world economic conditions and in view of  the current business activities of Japanese automakers. On the  issue of government procurement, the package provides  "statistics and related information" in an abstract form, but it  does not touch on insurance at all.    The handling of objective criteria varies from sector to  sector. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  said: "We intend to look for a way to settle the issue while  presenting the United States with three alternative proposals."    Japan's tactic is that it will search for clues to the  resumption of framework talks by narrowing the gap between the  two countries over the interpretation of objective criteria  while playing its "insurance" and "government procurement" cards  on which it has left room to make concessions.    A senior Foreign Ministry official said: "The United States  has not rejected contacts with Japan on the resumption of  framework talks."    Both Japan and the United States are expected to resume  framework talks when they find areas of agreement, and the issue  of handling objective criteria was a primary cause of the  stalemate in the framework talks. Will Japan's tactics really  work as they hope?</p>

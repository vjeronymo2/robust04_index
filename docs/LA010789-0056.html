			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPONENTS, SUPPORTERS PREDICT VICTORY;  </P> <P> PAY HIKE BATTLE BREWS IN CONGRESS  </P> <P> President Reagan's endorsement Friday of a 50% pay increase for members of  Congress, federal judges and top executive branch officials is certain to set  off a full-scale political brawl on Capitol Hill early next month.  </P> <P> Both opponents and supporters of the proposal expressed confidence that their  side would prevail in the parliamentary maneuvering that will culminate on Feb.  9, when the pay hike will take effect unless both houses of Congress have voted  it down.  </P> <P> Although the Senate is almost certain to reject the raise, House Democratic  leaders have acknowledged that they are hoping to keep the issue from coming to  a vote before the deadline, much as they did a year ago when Congress received  a 15.6% pay increase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anti-Raise Efforts Pledged  </P> <P> But opponents of the raise vowed not only to lobby strenuously for its  rejection, but also to mount a repeal effort if both chambers fail to vote  against it within the prescribed 30-day period for taking such action.  </P> <P> "The public is not going to give up after 30 days," said David L. Keating,  executive vice president of the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union, which  opposes the raise. "They will just get more angry at congressional  double-dealing on the pay raise issue."  </P> <P> With the financial stakes so high and the battle lines so clearly drawn,  congressional leaders predicted that it would be one of the most bitter and  volatile fights Congress has seen in many years. "We'll be in the eye of the  hurricane, even though 80% of the people affected by this do not serve in  Congress," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento).  </P> <P> The pay increase, which was recommended initially by a presidential commission,  would give $135,000 a year to members of Congress, judges and federal officials  at the level of deputy secretary. Cabinet officers would receive $155,000. The  President's pay would rise to $300,000, but not until 1993.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letter Sent to Congress  </P> <P> Reagan announced his support of the pay hike in a letter sent to members of  Congress on Friday and pledged to incorporate the raise into the proposed  fiscal 1989 budget that he will submit to Congress on Monday. He said the  increase is necessary to assure that government service does not become "the  province only of the wealthy."  </P> <P> In exchange for the raise, Reagan called on Congress to permanently prohibit  its members from accepting honorariums from special-interest groups. House  members now can keep honorariums equivalent to 30% of their $89,500 annual  salaries, and senators can accept up to 40%.  </P> <P> House and Senate leaders already have announced that they will bring  legislation banning honorariums to a vote Feb. 10 if the 50% raise takes effect  on the previous day. Fazio and another Californian, Rep. Jerry Lewis  (R-Redlands) have been chosen by House leaders to work with members of the  Senate in developing legislation banning honorariums that is acceptable to both  chambers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Senate Rejection Expected  </P> <P> In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority Leader  Bob Dole (R-Kan.) have pledged to schedule a vote on the pay raise in early  February. Members of the Senate, about one-third of whom are millionaires, are  expected to vote against it. The chamber voted down last year's pay increase  proposal.  </P> <P> In the House, Rep. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.) is preparing to introduce  legislation to reject the increase, and Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa) has submitted a  bill that would repeal the increase once it begins. But Tauke has acknowledged  that he thinks the House Democratic leadership "is committed to making sure  there is no vote" on either measure.  </P> <P> Opponents argued that the huge pay increase cannot be justified at a time when  the federal government is struggling with enormous budget deficits. Tauke said  Reagan's support for the measure would "serve to focus even more public  attention on the issue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sway of Letter Cited  </P> <P> But supporters of the increase predicted that Reagan's strong support would  help sway many conservative Republicans who might otherwise feel obliged to  vote against it. One source predicted that many members would send copies of  Reagan's letter to constituents who complain about the pay raise.  </P> <P> As for President-elect Bush, he announced Friday that he would support Reagan's  decision but quickly added: "When the ball is in my court and the buck is  stopping on my back, I might have something else to say about that. I don't  know that we can afford anything other than to get this deficit under control."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY: 'NOT YET ENOUGH'  </P> <P> In response to "Only in L.A. -- The Mayor Is on the Firing Line but Draws  Little Flak," by John Allswang, Op-Ed Page, May 11:  </P> <P> Don't you ever believe the public is not very concerned about Bradley's  activities. The flak comes from the silent majority of citizens who could never  be heard through a newspaper which has supported the mayor all these years.  </P> <P> Bradley has been on the fence for so long, never taking a stance on any  controversial issue, he should have many pickets. But alas, grinning Tom is  finally having to say something about something.  </P> <P> Why shouldn't his relationship with the business community and power structure  be excellent, he is their man. And similar to the old Mayor Richard Daley  regime in Chicago, everything slips quietly into operation before the public is  aware.  </P> <P> Low key, of course. A sure way of not broadcasting your "errors in judgment,"  or the fact that the mayor has taken "outside employment." Give us a break,  Tom.  </P> <P> Democrat and Republican politicians alike have a hands-off policy, not unlike  House Speaker Jim Wright's dilemma, because of the "glass houses and stones"  theory. I am one of the former locals who say "get him," Tom Bradley for  starters, then get all of them. Vote out all incumbents who have even a faint  smell of corruption.  </P> <P> KATHRYN JOHNSON  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

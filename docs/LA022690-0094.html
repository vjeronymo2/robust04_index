			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> CITY GIVES $18,000 TO FESTIVAL OF CULTURES  </P> <P> The city has set aside $18,000 for its first Festival of Cultures, to be held  June 2.  </P> <P> The event would be similar to Placentia's Heritage Days, said James Soto, the  city's director of recreation and human services.  </P> <P> "We're hoping it will be so successful it will become a yearly event," Soto  said.  </P> <P> The festival will include entertainment, food, craft and game booths  representing various ethnic cultures. A portable stage will feature cultural  music and dances, and the city will display the equipment used for street  maintenance and emergency response efforts.  </P> <P> Food and craft booths will be on Santa Fe Avenue, with priority space given to  nonprofit clubs and organizations.  </P> <P> A beer garden, to be located on Main Street south of the Santa Fe intersection,  also is planned.  </P> <P> Several local clubs and organizations will be invited to operate the  concession, and a lottery system will be used to select the beer vendor.  </P> <P> The city expects to pay for the festival with revenues from renting food and  game booths to vendors, but city staff asked for up to $18,000 to cover  expenses if the number of vendors is smaller than expected, Soto said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- Jacques de Larosiere,  president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, today informed Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], that the bank cannot send  a mission for talks with Yugoslav experts on the reconstruction  of the country's monetary system because the FRY is not  currently a member of this international institution. Kontic  had sent a letter to the European Bank at the beginning of  January, requesting that a mission of this bank pay a visit to  Yugoslavia in order to discuss the reconstruction of the  monetary system with Yugoslav experts.    Larosiere believes that the FRY government should remain in  contact with the bank's board of governors concerning its  readmission, but at the same time expressed doubt that the  bank's members would wish to tackle this issue before the  sanctions against Yugoslavia are lifted and "a more favorable  international climate is created."</p>

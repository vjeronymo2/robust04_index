			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Varied response to volatility in dollar There was an awkwardly timed drop in the dollar towards the end of the European afternoon but apathy, rather than apprehension, seemed to be the order of the day in most bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. French and Spanish equities responded in varying degrees; but at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, Mr Gerhard Grebe said the Bundesbank was not unhappy with a gentle decline in the dollar, which would help to dampen German import prices; whereas, he argued, if Buba were to create money to support the US currency, its long running problem with inflated M3 growth would be exacerbated. Short term, this scenario would not be good for the German corporate sector, said Mr Grebe, but companies would adjust to the situation. PARIS blamed the dollar for a wave of futures selling which left equities off the top, the CAC 40 index ending 10.26 up at 1,888.99 after a session's high of 1,900.12; but traders said there was little weight behind the move. Turnover stayed light at FFr2.89bn. Pechiney rose FFr6 to FFr395 as it said its Pechiney International unit should see a stable first half, and a positive full year. Alcatel Alsthom recovered a further FFr4 to FFr576. MADRID's domestic bond market was pressured by uncertainty over the direction of the US dollar and slowly growing fears of inflationary pressure in Spain. The general index finished 3.68, or 1.25 per cent, down at 291.43, a new low for the year. Turnover was light at Pta28.7bn. There was no obvious pattern: in utilities, Endesa dropped Pta430, some 4 per cent, to Pta5,500 but Ibedrola rose Pta3 to Pta898. In banks, Bankinter recovered Pta200 to Pta10,800, but Santander lost Pta115 at Pta4,440. FRANKFURT was trapped in a narrow range in spite of another repo rate cut, the Dax index rising 3.01 to 2,035.70 on the session and easing to 2,031.33 in the post-bourse, although dealers had said that it would be bad for equities if the dollar fell again - as it did, in the last hour of Ibis trading. Turnover fell from DM5.7bn to DM4.6bn. Viag, the utility based combine, was one of the few stars of the day, rising DM8 to DM466.50 after forecasting higher 1994 profits and a rise in dividend next year. However, the construction group, Philipp Holzmann, dropped DM18 to DM900 after saying that orders fell in the first five months of 1994. MILAN was unable to sustain early strength as attention turned again to today's expected announcement of budget details. The Comit index added 4.35 at 695.59, although the late weakness was reflected in a 50-point fall in the real-time Mibtel index. Ina was quoted at L2,430 as it made its market debut, slightly above the L2,400 price set by the treasury for its sale of 53.5 per cent of the insurer. At the same time, Ina said that life insurance premiums grew by 25 per cent in the first five months of the year. Alitalia jumped L63, or 6.7 per cent, to L1,000 in a technical rebound from recent lows. Analysts also suggested that the government go-ahead for the modernisation of Milan's second airport, which is important for the airlines industrial strategy, overcame worries about yesterday's strike by cabin crew and threatened industrial action by flight and ground staff next Monday. ZURICH was easier in quiet trade in response to the lower dollar, a weak futures market and a continuing absence of buying interest. The SMI index gave up 10.8 to 2,598.9, with dollar related industrial issues feeling some pressure. Roche certificates fell SFr50 to SFr6,280. AMSTERDAM featured a strong performance by KLM in an otherwise subdued market and the AEX index slipped 4.34 to 385.36. Strong US demand took KLM 60 cents higher to close at Fl 52.80, after touching Fl 53.70, in response to a favourable article in an American financial newspaper, which said that its co-operation with Northwest was paying off. COPENHAGEN reflected the effect of general and specific fears in ultra-thin turnover. Topdanmark, the ailing Danish insurance and finance services group, paid the price for forecasting a current year loss approaching DKr200m on Tuesday, the shares weakening DKr76, or 9.5 per cent, to DKr724 in minimal turnover. Novo Nordisk declined DKr10 to DKr630 on dollar uncertainties, but the KFX index eased only 0.53 to 100.90. TEL AVIV extended Tuesday's 3.4 per cent recovery, the Mishtanim index rising 8.48, or 5.5 per cent, to 161.51. Turnover contracted from Shk179m to Shk163m, dealers maintaining that it would have been higher if they could have found sellers to match yesterday's buying orders. WARSAW advanced for the third day in a row, the Wig index rising 380.7, or 4.3 per cent, to 8,833.4, but volume fell a sharp 18.5 per cent to just above 1m shares. Three recently listed stocks, Amerbank, Prochem and Jelfa, rose by the 10 per cent maximum. ISTANBUL jumped 3.5 per cent as a wave of buying lifted prices towards the close, although much of the activity was attributed to investors switching issues and sellers who were bidding some stocks up to maintain higher prices before cashing in profits. The composite index rose 698.24 to 20,509.24, regaining the 20,000 level for the first time since June 21.

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Sweden moves to cut debt: Economic Watch Sweden's finance minister Mrs Anne Wibble announced further measures to tackle the country's debt load, but she has had to bow to political and economic realities by postponing implementation until the second half of the decade. Setting out the supplementary budget, Mrs Wibble said the state would bring forward SKr10bn (Dollars 1.26bn) worth of savings into the 1995-96 budget year and would adopt a further SKr20bn of budget-strengthening measures at the end of the 1990s. The additional sum means Sweden is looking to strengthen its finances by a total of SKr100bn in the next six years. The budget deficit for the year beginning July 1 1994 is predicted to be SKr150bn, or 9.7 per cent of GNP, compared with SKr198bn in the current fiscal year and the SKr172bn estimate given in January. The borrowing requirement is put at SKr195bn, compared with a SKr220bn January estimate. The government predicts 1994 GNP growth of 2.4 per cent, expanding to 3.0 per cent next year, driven mainly by exports. The markets responded coolly by marking bond yields higher, interpreting the package as a sign of the minority government's weakness and its reluctance to take a tough stance before the September General Election. Christopher Brown-Humes, Stockholm Consumer prices in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia rose 0.2 per cent in April from March and 3.0 per cent year-on-year, the state's Statistics Office said yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero on 12  April said private sector workers who earn a minimum salary will  be entitled to receive bonuses throughout the next months. The  measure will not benefit either public employees or retired  workers. The bonus proposal, which will be presented next week  to President Itamar Franco, was the solution the government  found to improve the minimum wage without causing impacts on the  social security system and the accounts of states and  municipalities. With this proposal the government expects to  convince Congress not to establish a $100 minimum wage. Ricupero  disclosed that he accepts negotiating Provisional Measure [MP]  No. 457 as long as it does not affect the budget balance and not  change the conversion of salaries based on the peak exchange  rate variation [of the previous four months].    According to Ricupero, the economic team is negotiating with  Congress the article of PM No. 457 that forbids the  readjustments of contracts established in URV's [Real Value  Unit] for periods shorter than a year. The idea, Ricupero said,  is to find a midpoint between the current strict rule and the  stability the economic team seeks for the economic plan.    The minister still is concerned about the foreign debt  renegotiation agreement, which will be signed 15 April. Ricupero  said the government still faces difficulties in convincing the  Dart family, which holds $1.4 billion of Brazilian foreign debt  titles, to accept the renegotiation terms approved by the  creditor banks' steering committee. Ricupero disclosed that he  will not travel to the United States on 15 April to sign the  agreements. Central Bank President Pedro Malan will go in his  place. "I cannot leave the battlefield right now without being  certain of our triumph," Minister Ricupero said.    The minister reasserted his strategy to give absolute  priority to the approval of MP No. 457. He wants it to be  approved before the end of the month. He asked for some credit  from Congress, workers, and business people, and more  consideration for the stabilization plan. "It would be  incomprehensible that the other economic plans, which were  authoritarian, should have been approved and that this one, the  first democratic economic plan, be distorted before proving its  merits," he said.</p>

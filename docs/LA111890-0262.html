			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERVIEW;  </P> <P> JOHN FLECK'S RADICAL SHTICK  </P> <P> The orange gargoyles on the porch overhang of John Fleck's Echo Park cottage  smirk as a visitor passes beneath their gaze.  </P> <P> "Come in," booms an unseen voice resonant with operatic timbre, the sound  emanating from the inner sanctum, through the portal of the heavy wooden door  set artfully ajar. "I've been expecting you."  </P> <P> Strewn in Garbo-like repose across a couch in a murky corner of the living  room, the performance artist-actor vamps. A plaster cherub, perched high above  the gothic candelabra on the fireplace mantle, surveys the scene.  </P> <P> Fleck meets the press dressed in striped bermudas over royal blue long  underwear. He has, after all, become mildly well known as one of the four  infamous performance artists denied fellowships earlier this year by the  National Endowment for the Arts. He has since gotten the hang of the "media  thing."  </P> <P> "Actually, I hope to exert more confidence than last time we talked," says  Fleck, seated at his kitchen table, munching almonds because he's "trying to be  a vegetarian." Outside the kitchen on the back porch, a miniature U.S. flag  rises out of the pot of an unsuspecting succulent.  </P> <P> "I've had more experience," he continues candidly. "For awhile there, I felt  like Liz Taylor, like this media celebrity. I kind of felt, 'Oh, I never have  to do anything, they just keep writing about me.' They were talking about all  this old stuff that happened years ago. Lotsa press. Yeow!  </P> <P> "I'll never forget that day when the whole NEA thing happened," Fleck  continues. "I'd just finished a show at an AIDS hospice. I was burned out. I  get home and there were 25 messages from this newspaper, that newspaper. I  hadn't even heard the news. A day later, we were all Federal Expressed our  rejection letters."  </P> <P> Dozens of newspaper articles followed. Vanity Fair did a page on Fleck and his  fellow forbidden artists -- Karen Finley, Holly Hughes and Tim Miller. "At  first it was a lot of fun," he recalls. "I was very naive. I just started  gabbing." Then CNN called in August. Then Oprah. Then the hostility from people  Fleck had never even met came streaming in.  </P> <P> Now the dust has begun to settle. And while the NEA uproar has caused Fleck a  lot of grief and certainly hasn't made him famous, there is a bit of a silver  lining.  </P> <P> Besides a few more out-of-town bookings and mildly heightened interest in his  mainstream stage and screen career, the Los Angeles Theatre Center has just  commissioned Fleck and Miller to create new works. They have each received  $5,000 to make new hourlong performances to be presented as companion pieces at  LATC in 1991.  </P> <P> The reason for the commissions, according to LATC artistic director Bill  Bushnell is to make up for NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer's unwillingness to  finance Fleck and Miller.  </P> <P> "He's fearless and he's outrageous," says Bushnell, who first cast Fleck in a  production he directed in 1978. "This (experience) is going a long way toward  politicizing an artist that didn't think of himself as political. He thought of  himself as a clown. He didn't realize some of the great social critics have  been clowns."  </P> <P> Along with his stage work, the 39-year-old Fleck has played in low- and  medium-budget films from "Hard Rock Zombies" to "Howard the Duck" to "Pink  Cadillac." He's does enough commercials to keep the residuals flowing, and he's  landed some plum television roles, such as spots on series such as "Cheers" and  a part in "Sweet Bird of Youth" with Elizabeth Taylor.  </P> <P> On the stage he really shines -- whether it's as a crazed 90-year-old woman in  Robert Cossa's "The Granny" at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego earlier this  year, or as the buff stud Matamore in "The Illusion," an adaptation of the  17th-Century work seen last spring at LATC.  </P> <P> But Fleck's notoriety, and painful lessons, have come from his work as a  performance artist. Because of the NEA experience, he's suffered the slings and  arrows of misrepresentation in the press, hate mail, menacing phone calls, and,  of course, emotional drain.  </P> <P> Most important, it has forced Fleck to rethink why he does what he does. Some  people seek an activist mindset, others have it thrust upon them.  </P> <P> Fleck's most notorious performance piece -- partly thanks to U.S. Sen. Jesse  Helms' indignation -- is "Blessed Are All the Little Fishes." It's the same  work -- as he half-jokingly admits in a self-referential monologue that makes  up the final segment of the performance -- that he's been doing in one version  or another for nearly five years.  </P> <P> In it, Fleck journeys through incarnations as a drunken human, a glamorous if  forlorn merman in a bathtub, and a crazed evangelist who has to preach in order  to urinate.  </P> <P> Lavish to the point of rococo, the performance includes a gaggle of  Vegas-worthy chorus boys and an episode in which Fleck nearly smothers an  innocent goldfish that is the object of his affection.  </P> <P> The second part of "Fishes" sees Fleck return for what many presume to be the  curtain call, only to launch into a sardonic monologue about the work just  seen, his life and sundry other 1990s topics.  </P> <P> Although popular with the critics and a cadre of loyal followers, Fleck isn't  everybody's cup of java.  </P> <P> "It got tedious when he went into this long monologue about what it meant to be  gay and his boyfriends," says critic-director Charles Marowitz of "Blessed Are  All the Little Fishes." "As a series of confessional gallery (vignettes), it  was unproductive.  </P> <P> "He's part of a gay tradition that has constantly thrown up extravagant  performers. The problem with it is, it tends to be circumscribed within gay  experience. In that show, when it was the show proper, it worked on an  aesthetic level. When it reverted to his personal screeds and diary, it lost  me.  </P> <P> "It would have lost other people who were not identifying with the gay  obsessions he was," says Marowitz, former artistic director of the Open Space  Theatre in London and one of the key players in the rise of Joe Orton and  others. "What's more interesting is to get a gay artist who is able to  extrapolate outward, than somebody who was imploding into gay concerns. It's  not only the prevailing disease, it's become the prevailing cliche."  </P> <P> Miller, Fleck's fellow LATC grantee, disagrees. "I think John is one of the  most amazingly talented thinkers and performers I've seen in this racket. The  sex stuff in his work is just more generally confusing than about gay identity.  </P> <P> "John's work is exploring his complex identity, part of which is as a gay  person and part of which is as this androgyne that he is, which is larger than  a particular gay person's experience," continues Miller, who is co-director of  Highways performance space in Santa Monica. "I've seen very diverse audiences  be totally drawn in by John."  </P> <P> Adds High Performance magazine editor Steve Durland: "What's misidentified  about Fleck is that he's been lumped in with Tim, Holly and Karen -- all of  whom are extremely outspoken and extremely political. Anybody who's familiar  with the other people knows that John's just there because they all got their  grants taken away.  </P> <P> "The (canceling of NEA funds) has forced him to talk about his work in a way  that he normally avoids, the way any artist when challenged will have to speak  about their personal political convictions."  </P> <P> Fleck was first forced to take a stand by the television coverage. "Oprah was  the peak," he recalls.  </P> <P> "She introduced me as 'an artist who deals with homosexual issues and (who) in  his last show urinated onstage and, as he was reading from a Bible, mimed  vomiting into a toilet. In another show, he made love to himself dressed as a  man and a woman in his underwear.' My mouth was just dropping. 'Thanks for the  intro, Oprah, you sow.' It was a freak show. I thought they would treat me like  an important artist. You live and you learn."  </P> <P> Fleck's gripes about Oprah notwithstanding, there were worse consequences of  the sudden celebrity. Fleck says he got up to 150 phone calls a day from  neo-Nazis during a five-day period, with over 200 calls on the final day.  </P> <P> The anonymous callers began phoning at around 8 a.m. and kept it up until 2  a.m., Fleck recalls, playing a punk song that went "We're fascist, fag-bashing  skinheads."  </P> <P> "It was driving us crazy," he says, referring to himself and painter-dancer  Ryan Hill, with whom he lives.  </P> <P> "God, I guess a lot of people are afraid of this material. I must be doing  something right to get this kind of response. I feel that if I've got a voice,  I've got to use it all the more."  </P> <P> One of the lightning rods that has drawn so much fire -- from those who've  never even seen Fleck's work -- is the religious symbolism. If those Catholic  icons seem at home in this baroque milieu, though, it's because Fleck comes by  them honestly.  </P> <P> The product of a Cleveland Roman Catholic upbringing -- in a family with six  kids and an alcoholic father -- Fleck moved around every six months or so for  the first 10 years of his life. "My father just always had to have a different  job," he recalls. "He'd build a house and we'd move, he'd build another and  we'd move."  </P> <P> Fleck makes no bones about where the dysfunctional family references in his  work come from. "(My parents) fought like cats and dogs. He was an alcoholic, a  real man's man. She had a baby every couple of years to keep the family  together. She had seven -- one died. It wasn't all that bad, but they would  have been better off if they'd gotten divorced, but they didn't do that back in  those days.  </P> <P> "I found a good escape into Catholicism," says Fleck. "My biggest prayers were,  'Oh please God' -- I said this in all earnestness -- 'let my father die.' For a  long time I used to pray, 'Oh please let me be a beautiful woman.' I used to  have this fantasy of being Constance Kennedy, John Kennedy's adopted daughter.  Then David Bowie came along and I got out of all this stuff and just dyed my  hair orange and wore my platforms and didn't have to pray anymore. I was  beeeyouteeful."  </P> <P> Fleck came to California in 1973 to attend acting school, although he'd never  acted prior to that. He was a member of the first graduating class of the  Pasadena branch of the East Coast-based American Academy of Dramatic Arts.  </P> <P> Really, though, he came to get away from his family, most of whom still live  near Cleveland. Since that entry into the West Coast whirl, Fleck has done the  California thing with a vengeance.  </P> <P> "I've done a lot of different therapies," he understates. "Gestalt,  psychotherapy, transactional analysis, est, Adult Children of Alcoholics, The  Forum, A Course in Miracles. Neuro-linguistic programming was kind of  interesting, but I couldn't get into. I've done 'em all. Right now I'm reading  'The Drama of the Gifted Child.' "  </P> <P> Seven years ago -- about the time his father died -- Fleck started making  performance art, taking the trek from club to club as he developed his acts.  He's created dozens of shows, from 5-minute quickies to full-length, often  employing his operatic singing voice and a peculiar sense of irony and the  absurd.  </P> <P> In "I Got the He-Be-She-Be's" (1986), Fleck sang jazz and pop tunes while his  male and female halves battled each other for domination of his body.  </P> <P> In "Psycho-Opera" (1987), a futuristic bank of TV monitors provided the  backdrop for the tale of Leyland, who talks to characters on the monitors,  demonstrating the lethal -- and funny -- influence of media on the American  mind.  </P> <P> Fleck manages to keep his two careers going, even with all the hullabaloo of  the past year. "Certainly Hollywood didn't come knocking," he says. "Most  casting people were reading about it and I think I got a lot of calls out of  curiosity, to see who I was.  </P> <P> "One time I felt a little odd on an audition for some producers and directors.  They said, 'Oh, now don't go peeing on the floor.' You laugh, but they went on  a little too much about it.  </P> <P> "(The NEA controversy) sure didn't get me any work, but I don't think it's  necessarily been bad for me either. I was always hoping my performance artwork  would generate more interest in TV and film, but it isn't the case  necessarily."  </P> <P> Still, Fleck has yet to land that one breakthrough role, on the boards or the  big or small screen. "He's not going to have a career unless Nicolas Cage  dies," says Durland. "They're both such distinctive people that there probably  isn't room for both having major careers at the same time."  </P> <P> "I made my mind up to let it go," says Fleck of a recent spate of call-backs,  but no big jobs. "At least I have some power and control in my own work. I did  do an episode of 'WIOU' recently -- as a homeless person who thinks he's a dog  and barks a lot. It was another freak role, but, hey, it was a week's work. I  can always kvetch about where I think I should be, but I'm doing OK.  </P> <P> "This schedule thing -- wondering if I'm far enough along -- that's what  happens when you're about to turn 40."  </P> <P> That midlife milestone, in fact, will be the subject of his new work for LATC.  Combining motifs from American folk mythology, Fleck plans to tackle both his  own personal changes and the changes he sees America going through.  </P> <P> "I love America," says Fleck. "But, hey, we've got a few problems. You have to  look at the wounds. That's the only way they'll heal. America's in a big state  of denial now about a lot of things."  </P> <P> Strong words perhaps, from someone who never thought of himself as an activist,  let alone a gay political performance artist.  </P> <P> "I don't only deal with homosexual behavior," says Fleck, now much more  articulate about his own intentions and beliefs than he was before the NEA  controversy. "I deal with dysfunctional issues like alcoholism and cultural  issues like homelessness.  </P> <P> "What's the big deal, me urinating into a toilet onstage? I think we should be  worrying about the 70,000 (homeless) people in the city that I live in, trying  to find a pot for these folks.  </P> <P> "I've been thrust in the political limelight, into this 'gay political artist'  stand. Now that's part of my work and I have to deal with it. But up until  (recently), I'd never really thought of it.  </P> <P> "I just hate these extremes: you're good or you're bad, you're gay or you're  straight, you're Democrat or Republican. There's 360 other colors in-between.  </P> <P> "You're talking to an iconoclast whose mission in his work is to turn  conventions upside down. I hate stereotypes. They limit people in their life  experience," he adds, seemingly aware he might be sounding uncharacteristically  strident.  </P> <P> "I'm a humanist that believes in the full range of human sexual expression. I  call myself a trisexual. There's hetero, there's homo. There's bi. Now there's  tri. I say try it, you might like it. But don't forget to use a rubber."  </P> <P> That's the serious, but not-so-serious, Fleck talking -- constantly  undercutting himself. Likewise, there's a moment in "Blessed Are All the Little  Fishes" -- and in several Fleck works, for that matter -- when the rational  Fleck gets the better of the goofy Fleck, a kind of psychological cruise  control that overrides his admittedly inspired theatrical hijinks.  </P> <P> Like Fleck the performer, Fleck the man is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde routine,  with the Apollonian and the Dionysian constantly duking it out for top billing  just as Fleck's male and female halves do in "I Got The He-Be-She-Be's." That's  what the notorious second act monologue in "Fishes" is really all about.  </P> <P> It's also what Fleck the unwitting activist is about. Forced into a political  identity he never intended, he's still uncomfortable with the part, as though  he could lapse into a feather-boa aria at any moment.  </P> <P> "After it all happened, I said I never want to apply for a . . . grant again,"  Fleck says, clearly less than nostalgic for his trial-by-fire introduction to  the national public eye. "Regardless of whether I get money or not, I'll do  what I have to do, even though having a money base certainly helps you to  produce and focus.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'll apply," announces Fleck, suddenly bold and maybe even a bit  surprised at his own ability to assume a rebel persona. "And I'll always be a  little footnote in NEA history."  </P></p>

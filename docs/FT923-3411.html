			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Shake-up at Nikko Securities NIKKO Securities, Japan's third largest broker, is apparently in the final stages of preparing a streamlining programme that may lead to the closing of domestic and international branches and cuts to its workforce. The company confirmed yesterday that it will transfer the operations of its Copenhagen office to London at the end of this month, and merge the business of the San Francisco office of Nikko Securities International with that of the Los Angeles office. Japanese newspapers reported that the company may reduce its 11,000-member workforce by 1,700 as part of a three-year review programme and that about 10 domestic branches would be closed, but the company did not confirm those reports. Most Japanese securities houses are being forced to review staff and branch numbers, as the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock market, combined with the rapid expansion of the industry during the late 1980s, has left companies with unsustainable personnel costs. However, in a decision that runs against the tide, Nikko said that two affiliates, Nikko Research Center and Nikko System Center, would share a new San Francisco office from January next year to research 'information technologies'. The Bank of Tokyo Ltd group has agreed to use Y2.4bn to finance Dainana Securities, an unlisted brokerage which has been hit by the ongoing stock market slump, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Dainana will increase its capital through the allocation of new shares to a third party with the support of the Bank of Tokyo group, a leading Dainana shareholder. Dainana will receive payment on September 28. With the Bank of Tokyo group's financial support, Dainana will be able to increase its capital by Y1.2bn to about Y3.28bn. Also, Dainana will be able to raise the percentage of self-owned capital to 200 per cent, and meet self-owned capital regulations. It is currently down to about 120 per cent, he added. The brokerage posted a pre-tax loss of Y2.31bn for the year to March 1992, due to the sluggish stock market in Japan. Dainana appointed as president a former Bank of Tokyo official, Mr Yoshiaki Ara, as a part of its restructuring process supported by the bank.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Warburg and Morgan Stanley seek merger SG Warburg, the largest UK investment bank, announced yesterday that it intended to give up its independence by merging with the US investment bank Morgan Stanley in an effort to create a stronger global bank. The announcement, prompted by widespread rumours in the London stock market which drove up Warburg's share price, followed three months of talks on what would be the most significant transatlantic merger the industry has seen. The investment banks said their businesses were 'uniquely complementary,' although the merger is expected to lead to cuts among Warburg's 4,472 staff and Morgan Stanley's 9,300 staff as they eliminate duplication. Investment banks have suffered from weakness and volatility in financial markets this year, and both Warburg and Morgan Stanley have recently announced sharp falls in profits. Warburg has had difficulty fulfilling its aim to rival the large US investment banks such as Goldman Sachs as a global player because of a relatively small capital base and difficulty in penetrating US capital markets. Morgan Stanley is thought to view the merger as a means of making a stronger impact in Asia and Europe. The bank has been expanding its staff recently, partly to rebuild its position in the underwriting of stocks and bonds in the US. Large investment banks in Europe and the US increasingly believe they must have a strong presence in many regions to gain business from cross-border capital flows. This has led US banks to push strongly into Europe. Heads of other UK investment banks said they thought the merger could create a strong combined force, but it would face merger difficulties. The banks said yesterday that they were 'discussing the possibility of combining their businesses' by forming a new holding company. The company will probably offer shares in exchange for existing Warburg and Morgan Stanley equity. The intended merger could be disrupted by a counter bid from another institution. However, executives of both banks believe it would be hard to mount a hostile bid, because much of the value of Warburg is in the expertise of employees. There is some uncertainty over Mercury Asset Management, the fund management business 75 per cent owned by Warburg. The merged banks could be forced by the Takeover Panel to offer to buy out minority shareholders. The London Stock Exchange, which is trying to crack down on insider dealing, contacted Warburg yesterday morning after a rise in its shares on rumours of bids by JP Morgan, the US investment bank, and HSBC Holdings, the UK bank. Its intervention forced Warburg to announce - a week ahead of schedule - the merger talks with Morgan Stanley. In London, Warburg's shares closed 119p up at 791p yesterday, after reaching a high of 830p. In New York, Morgan Stanley shares closed down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 55 1/4.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Discussing the situation  around Brcko, the Supreme Defense Council of the Republic of  Serb Krajina [RSK] said in Knin today that the defense of the  corridor was vital for the Serbian nation west of the Drina  River. In this context, the council has sent its full support  to the people and the leadership of the republic of Srpska  making it clear that the RSK was prepared to help in the  corridor's defense, as it did when the corridor was established.  The RSK Supreme Defense Council expressed support for the  efforts to prevent clashes near Brcko by deploying UN monitors,  pointing out that the corridor has to remain an integral part of  the Serb ethnic territory because of its importance, and that  this was not negotiable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kirundi </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by National Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko to the </F> National Assembly in Bujumbura on 21 March -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Thank you, president of the  National Assembly. We are currently experiencing difficult  times. I am happy to hear the words you deputies spoke on the  return of peace to Bujumbura and our country. The current  situation does not concern the military alone; the return of  peace is the duty of all Burundians from the highest ranking to  the lowest. Those who were elected by the people should be seen  to be making efforts to assist them, to prove that we are not  sitting in offices exchanging ideas which lead us nowhere.  There is little peace in the country currently. Reports from  upcountry say that in almost all areas no night passes without  people dying, without houses being burned down or demolished.  In Bujumbura, it is worse. When the president of the Republic  was sworn in we thought that things would cool down but you can  see how things are. Here in Bujumbura, in all the suburbs,  people are dying, houses are being burned down, and now they are  being burned down in the daylight. You have just seen when we  were outside how they were burning in Nyakabiga.    It is shameful that we cannot return peace to the people.  You asked me how you can help the minister of defense. I liked  the fact that you thought about helping the security services.  I also thought about requesting the same from you, but you did  it before I had the chance. I would like you to examine  together ways of meeting the people, how we can go to Musaga,  Cibitoke, and other suburbs to pacify them so that, as you said,  the culprits are arrested, tried, and jailed.    Regarding the question of how to implement this in peace, we  are going to study this situation so that we see how you can  visit suburbs in our company without endangering the security of  deputies.    I do not say that all of you can go there, but a few of you  can represent the rest so that we act quickly and see how we can  ensure your security. The other thing in which you can help us  is to support us when talking to the people in your daily  actions, in your work, because the way things are now, we should  leave aside the party questions so that people can catch up on  their sleep and can attend their work.    What took place over the weekend is a shame. Guns were fired  throughout the night, there were explosions throughout the night  and it is a shame. You can therefore see that in the whole  country, especially in Bujumbura, there are too many weapons.  It is excessive. Everyone has weapons -- Tutsis, Hutus, and  foreigners.    [Words indistinct] to return peace as soon as possible,  today  or tomorrow so that people can sleep and go to work, you should  support the idea that people who have weapons should be  (?disarmed). This question should find a solution with the help  of the people themselves. Because even if we achieved peace  today, as long as the weapons are still in circulation they  would be used later in other ways, for stealing and killing.  That question should not be left behind among the urgent  questions.    Ministers, deputies, government employees should work  together, meet the people and speak with one voice about peace  in these difficult times. People are being kidnapped in broad  daylight, but we cannot even find their bodies or know where to  start looking. This is a shame. This cannot continue while  there are services charged with security and administration. We  would be useless to the people. [passage omitted]</p>

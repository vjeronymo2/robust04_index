			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Reporting rules on pensions changed COMPANIES will be required to show the impact of post-retirement benefits such as medical costs more quickly and in more detail in their accounts, under a tough new ruling introduced yesterday by the Urgent Issues Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). Abstract 6 from the task force broadens the principles specified in SSAP 24, the accounting standard for pension costs, to include other forms of post-retirement benefits. The ruling will principally affect UK companies with US subsidiaries, where private medical costs and other benefits incurred by former employees run into many millions of pounds. It specifies that a company must show an annual charge through the profit and loss account based on actuarial assumptions of the present value of any future post-retirement benefits to be paid. It will also have to show provisional liabilities in the balance sheet to reflect these future costs, with a corresponding reduction in shareholders' funds. At present, most post-retirement benefits other than pensions are not specifically funded by the company in advance. They are simply paid for and treated in the accounts on a cash basis by being shown only in the year in which they are paid out. The new ruling instead follows the accruals principal by which accounts are generally prepared. It echoes the line taken by FAS 106, a similar standard on post-retirement benefits introduced recently by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US. The new consensus also requires additional disclosures in the accounts to show any important assumptions for the measurement of post-retirement benefits. It becomes mandatory for companies' financial year-ends after December 23 1994, with transitional requirements after December 23 this year. Separately, Fred 2, a draft financial reporting exposure draft which amends SSAP 15, the existing accounting standard on deferred tax, proposes that annual contributions on pensions and other post-retirement benefits can be paid net of tax.

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Shorter yields in Germany stage sharp rise THE D-Mark yield curve began to swing back yesterday after the recent strong advance in shorter-dated German government bonds, confirming that hopes of a rate cut at today's Bundesbank council meeting have dimmed. Yields on five and ten-year bonds had been virtually identical before yesterday, following the heavy buying of shorter-maturity paper on rate cut hopes. Yesterday, though, the yield curve retreated to its familiar inverted shape of recent times as shorter yields rose sharply. The correction was seen in the Euro-Mark contract on Liffe, where the December contract fell from an opening of 91.77 to 91.63 by the close. Longer-dated bonds also fell in reaction, though not as far. Also yesterday, the German constitutional court issued its expected ruling that tax allowances for lower paid workers should be raised. 'This is in line with what the bond market had feared - but it fell well short of the market's worst fears of the fiscal consequences,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. CANADIAN government bonds fell by more than a point during morning trading on news of the Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade. The timing of the announcement also brought fears for the outcome of a planned CDollars 1.2bn domestic 10-year note auction, due to take place yesterday. The yield on the paper, at around 7.65 the previous night, jumped to around 8 per cent early in the day. The S&amp;P downgrade is expected to have a significant effect on the Canadian government bond market, with Japanese investors the single largest holders of Canadian debt outside Canada. LONGER-dated UK gilts lost ground while shorter-maturity paper moved ahead yesterday, leaving the yield curve considerably steeper on the day. The move away from longer-dated bonds reversed some of the previous day's gains, suggesting that investors remain concerned about the outlook for inflation and at the same time optimistic about a cut in the UK base rate. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 97 1/16 , down from its opening of 97 11/32 . LONGER-dated US Treasuries rose yesterday following some weaker-than-expected economic statistics and car sales figures. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 96 13/32 , yielding 7.499 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower, down  1/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 3.999 per cent. Prices showed little reaction in early trading on news of a 0.3 per cent increase in September retail sales. Analysts had been looking for a 0.5 per cent rise. August retail sales, however, were revised from an originally estimated 0.5 per cent decline to an unchanged position, a move that offset the benefits to bond prices of the bad September figure. After holding steady for half the day, prices at the long end started moving higher during the afternoon on a combination of news of weak sales at General Motors and technical buying linked to the futures market.</p>

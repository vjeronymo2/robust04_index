			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Govender] </F>   [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] on Tuesday [26 April] accused the Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] of incompetency after ballot papers allegedly  arrived at many polling booths around Durban and  Pietermaritzburg without the party's sticker attached.    IFP spokesman Ed Tillett labelled it a "deep election  crisis". "The IEC is in complete disarray. What it boils down  to is plain incompetency," charged Mr Tillett.    He said areas such as Mpumalanga outside Durban, Umbumbulu  south of the city, Warner Beach, parts of Pietermaritzburg and  others had experienced this problem. "How can one hope to  achieve fair election results? In vast areas (IFP supporters)  cannot vote today." In Ulundi there was a shortage of ballot  papers, and in many areas people did not have voter cards, said  Mr Tillett.    He added top-level negotiations with the IEC were in  progress.    IEC spokesman Glenn Mcdougall said late changes to the  ballot  paper and logistical problems, especially transport, had caused  delays at some polling booths.</p>

The  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at once issued a statement  demanding a swift and objective investigation and also  punishment for the guilty persons.    "In any case, there must be talk of a political solution to  the problem of this city and of Bosnia as a whole. We believe  that such a solution can be found. Otherwise an armed conflict  could arise between the Serbs and the international peacemaking  forces. The Serbs have expressed readiness in principle to hand  Sarajevo over to UN control. It is necessary and possible to  urgently define the terms of such a handover. Preemptive  strikes against the positions of any one of the sides will only  exacerbate the situation."</p>

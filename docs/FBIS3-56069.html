The newspaper ABC  [literally ABV -- first three letters of Cyrillic alphabet],  published by the "Karavaninform" Joint-Stock Company, reports  that the Sokolovsk-Sarbay Production Association collective sent  an appeal to Kazakhstan's president which, in addition to  economic demands, raised the questions of dual citizenship, the  recognition of Russian (a language of international  communication) as a state language together with Kazakh, and the  appropriate amendment of Kazakhstan's Constitution.    Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, secretary of the Socialist Party of  Kazakhstan Political Executive Committee, answering questions  asked by the sociopolitical newspaper RESPUBLIKA's [as  transliterated] correspondent, stressed the need for state  bilingualism in Kazakhstan. At the same time he voiced the view  that the dual citizenship initiative should come from Russia and  Kazakhstan at once. "If Russians living in Kazakhstan want  this," Yermukhamet Yertysbayev believes, "Kazakhs living in  Russia should be accorded similar rights."    However, there is also a totally different view of the  matter. Some experts predict that dual citizenship could prove  not an advantage but grounds for restricting rights. By  becoming a Russian citizen a person, as it were, ceases to be a  "committed" Kazakhstani. Hence the authorities' attitude to him  may be that of a potential "foreign visitor." And problems may  crop up at work: Should a person, say, be allowed access to  state secrets and his career rise encouraged if he is also a  citizen of another state?    During the election campaign in Kazakhstan the questions of  state bilingualism and dual citizenship will most likely be used  by candidate deputies to win over voters.</p>

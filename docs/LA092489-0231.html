			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOST WANTED FRENCH CRIMINAL KILLS HIMSELF  </P> <P> Philippe Delaire, France's most wanted criminal, killed himself early Saturday  after he and two accomplices, cornered by police on the roof of an apartment  building, tossed part of $720,000 in ransom money to onlookers on the street  below.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor said Delaire, 28, appeared to have  committed suicide just as police burst into a building in Droixhe, near Liege,  where he had taken refuge with his two accomplices. She did not say how he  died.  </P> <P> Police said earlier that Delaire, known in the underworld as Beau Mec (Pretty  Boy) because of his good looks, had died of head wounds in a hail of bullets  after being cornered on the staircase of an apartment block.  </P> <P> Delaire, who had broken out of at least four jails in France and Belgium  including one jailbreak in Nice by helicopter, had held a woman and her two  daughters in a suburban villa for six days.  </P> <P> His two accomplices were arrested. one of them was shot and wounded by police  when he threatened them with a hand grenade, the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The three gunmen earlier released their hostages, Marie-Madeleine Bolland and  daughters Francoise, 12, and Gaelle, 10, in exchange for the ransom and a  getaway car.  </P> <P> After zig-zagging around the Liege area and switching cars several times to  throw off police, the gang headed for Delaire's hideout in Droixhe. But police  already had it staked out.  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Credit lifts Regent Corp to Pounds 5.1m Regent Corporation, the property developer formerly known as Nouvelle, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.15m for the year to end-March. The figure included a credit on voluntary arrangements totalling Pounds 4.8m. The company was transformed over the year and comparisons are not meaningful. For 1992-93 there was a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.91m after taking account of disposal losses of Pounds 3.69m. For 1993-94 pre-tax profits of continuing activities amounted to Pounds 606,000. That mainly reflected the merger of the Regent housebuilding business in 1993 together with subsequent acquisitions. Basic earnings on continuing operations emerged at 2.35p. There is again no dividend but the directors anticipate being able to resume payments in the foreseeable future. Sales totalled Pounds 3.15m. Year-end gearing stood at 53 per cent but had been reduced to nil by yesterday.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Generals quit in row over appointment The resignation of seven Ukrainian generals, reported yesterday, is raising questions about the country's security as the army - the second largest in Europe - descends into financial disarray and personnel squabbles, writes Jill Barshay in Kiev. The generals resigned in protest at lack of consultation by President Leonid Kravchuk when he appointed a new air force chief. In an effort to persuade Ukraine to rely not on nuclear weapons, but on conventional forces for its security, the west has been eager to bolster the Ukrainian army. But creating a swift battle-ready, defensive army out of the remnants of the old Soviet military machine has not been easy for the financially troubled two-year-old nation. While former defence minister Mr Konstantin Morozov is widely praised for rapidly establishing a Ukrainian army on the heels of the Soviet Union's collapse, its leadership is politicised and divided. The ranks are poorly organised and there is little money to train soldiers properly. Last week in Ukraine's military newspaper, Narodna Armia, senior generals complained that the 650,000 troops had received less than 10 per cent of their pay.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Appointments: NHBC builds on Europe Sir Norman Fowler (right), the former secretary of state for employment who resigned to spend more time with his family, has agreed to become chairman of the National House-Building Council. He takes over from former Halifax chief executive John Spalding in May, by which time Sir Norman could be in opposition - or unable to take up the post because he is back in the cabinet. He laughs off the latter suggestion: 'Goodness me. I haven't given that any thought.' NHBC, which provides insurance for owners of new homes, attracted him 'because of its contribution to ensuring high standards in house-building, and because of the very good consumer protection it offers,' he says. The Council, in turn, was pleased to lure Sir Norman, as it thinks he will be useful in the course of its planned expansion into the Continent, where Britain is well ahead of most countries in the concept of new house insurance. Sir Norman says he has 'about four' other directorships but that he is reviewing existing commitments. He accepted NHBC 'because I much prefer being chairman to doing anything else'. Trade and Industry secretary Peter Lilley is currently considering how to deal with a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report that an aspect of the council's rules is anti-competitive. Sir Norman says it has 'all taken place before I arrived', and he insists that he does not expect to play any part in the deliberations now or later. He also points out that the European move reflects a recognition on NHBC's part that 'life will not be entirely the same as before'.</p>

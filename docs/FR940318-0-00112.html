			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1989, EPA organized the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Advisory Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (STOPAC) in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. app. section 9(c). The STOPAC consisted of members selected on the basis of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional qualifications and diversity of perspectives and provided representation from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, academia, federal, state, and local government agencies, non-governmental and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental groups, as well as international organizations. The purpose of STOPAC was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide advice to the Agency on policy and technical issues related to the protection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stratospheric ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, the Agency asked STOPAC members to participate in subgroups to assist in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing regulations under title VI of the CAA. EPA established a subgroup of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standing STOPAC to guide the Agency specifically on development of the safe alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The subgroup on safe alternatives met twice. At the first meeting in May 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subgroup members reviewed a detailed description of EPA's plans for implementing section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 612. At this meeting, there was general agreement on the need to issue a request for data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the general public with an opportunity to furnish the Agency with information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes. The group also agreed on the need to review substitutes as quickly as possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid any delay in industry's efforts to phase out ozone-depleting substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the second meeting of the subgroup, in July 1991, subgroup members provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA with comments on a draft of the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was prepared in response to the conclusions of the first meeting. The comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focused primarily on the draft discussion of EPA's plans for implementing section 612 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refinements to a list of preliminary substitutes that the Agency intended to review. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received from the subgroup and other offices within EPA, a final ANPRM was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1984). Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bulk of regulatory development required under title VI has been completed, the STOPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has since been disbanded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Section 612 Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Statutory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612 of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to develop a program for evaluating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. EPA is referring to this new program as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. The major provisions of section 612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Rulemaking_Section 612(c) requires EPA to promulgate rules making it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlawful to replace any class I or class II substance with any substitute that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator determines may present adverse effects to human health or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment where the Administrator has identified an alternative that (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the overall risk to human health and the environment, and (2) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently or potentially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes_Section 612(c) also requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to publish a list of the substitutes unacceptable for specific uses. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must publish a corresponding list of acceptable alternatives for specific uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Petition Process_Section 612(d) grants the right to any person to petition EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to add a substance to or delete a substance from the lists published in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with section 612(c). The Agency has 90 days to grant or deny a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition. Where the Agency grants the petition, EPA must publish the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lists within an additional 6 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;90-day Notification_Section 612(e) requires EPA to require any person who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produces a chemical substitute for a class I substance to notify the Agency not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 90 days before new or existing chemicals are introduced into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate commerce for significant new uses as substitutes for a class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance. The producer must also provide the Agency with the producer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpublished health and safety studies on such substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Outreach_Section 612(b)(1) states that the Administrator shall seek to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize the use of federal research facilities and resources to assist users of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I and II substances in identifying and developing alternatives to the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such substances in key commercial applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Clearinghouse_Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to set up a public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product substitutes, and alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing processes that are available for products and manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes which use class I and II substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Guiding Principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has followed several guiding principles in developing the SNAP program:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Evaluate Substitutes Within a Comparative Risk Framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency's risk evaluation compares risks of substitutes to risks from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued use of ozone-depleting compounds as well as to risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with other substitutes. This evaluation considers effects due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ozone depletion as well as effects due to direct toxicity of substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other risk factors considered include effects on water and air quality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential for direct and indirect contributions to global warming, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational health and safety. Any effects found to pose a concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be evaluated further to determine if controls are required. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not believe that a numerical scheme producing a single index to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rank all substitutes based on risks is appropriate. A strict quantitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index would not allow for sufficient flexibility in making appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk management decisions that consider issues such as the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information supporting the decision, the degree of uncertainty in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, the availability of other substitutes, and economic feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Do Not Require That Substitutes Be Risk-Free To Be Found Acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612(c) requires the Agency to publish a list of acceptable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable substitutes. The Agency interprets this as a mandate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify substitutes that reduce risks compared to use of class I or II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds or to other substitutes for class I or II substances, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than a mandate to list as acceptable only those substitutes with zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risks. In keeping with this interpretation, the Agency believes that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> key goal of the SNAP program is to promote the use of substitutes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I and II chemicals that minimize risks to human health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment relative to other alternatives. In some cases, this approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may involve designating a substitute acceptable even though the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound may be toxic, or pose other environmental risk of some type,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided its use reduces overall risk to human health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment as compared to use of class I or class II substances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other potential substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

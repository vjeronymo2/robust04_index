			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank's promise carries limited effect THE weekend news that the Bundesbank would not raise its interest rates under current circumstances had a limited effect on European financial markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw it more in bonds where the Bundesbank's average yield - calculated in late morning and also reflecting last Friday's US interest rate cut - fell 10 basis points to 8.24 per cent. In the equity market, turnover fell from DM4.9bn to DM3.4bn, and the DAX index rose only 4.13 to 1,540.63. This, said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, reflected fundamental problems like the lack of German economic growth, and disappointing corporate earnings. A report that Klockner-Werke expects a steel division loss of DM180m for the year to September 30 brought KW down by DM2.50 to DM8.50; its competitor, Preussag, fell DM13 at one point before recovering to DM352, down DM8 on the day. Equities were also subdued by the question of when interest rates might actually fall. Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that this might have to wait until after German wage contract negotiations in April and May 1993. PARIS opened slightly higher but then drifted back by the close, a performance which masked severe declines in some stocks. The CAC-40 index ended 0.32 higher at 1,779.30, after a high of 1,793.52, in turnover of FFr2bn. Carrefour, the supermarket group, opened limit down on heavy selling, in particular from London, following Friday's news of a 53.3 per cent drop in first-half net attributable profit and that its chairman, Mr Michel Bon, had resigned. The stock went as low as FFr2,050 before closing FFr224, or 9.7 per cent lower at FFr2,076 in heavy volume of 199,435 shares. Eurotunnel was also a heavy faller, losing FFr2.00 or 5.4 per cent to FFr35.15, on worries about its dispute with TML. Accor, the hotels group, dropped FFr30 or 5.5 per cent to FFr520 ahead of its interim results, due today, which are expected to be disappointing. Air Liquide, ex a 1-10 scrip issue, closed a net FFr10 higher at FFr745, while L'Oreal jumped FFr33 or 3.4 per cent to FFr999 on good first half turnover figures. MILAN reflected the after hours falls on Friday, although a recovery in the lira provided some support as the Comit index fell 9.99 or 2.7 per cent to 361.52, its lowest close since mid-August 1985, in turnover estimated at more than L100bn after Friday's L117.6bn. Mediobanca, which reported 1991/92 results in line with expectations, fell L180 or 2 per cent to L8,920, but recouped L130 after hours. Dealers were disappointed that the bank did not shed light on its performance since June nor make any comment on the recent speculation of a capital increase. AMSTERDAM drifted down in quiet trading, the CBS Tendency index losing 0.6 to 109.3. Heineken fell Fl 5.70 to Fl 167.00 as investors took profits after Friday's 17 per cent rise in first-half profits. A number of analysts have lowered their full-year forecasts but remain long-term buyers of the stock. Its fellow brewer, Grolsch, lost Fl 3.00 to Fl 220.00 ahead of interim results due later this week. ZURICH rose in low volume, the SMI index ending 13.9 higher at 1,788.3. Among chemicals, Roche certificates firmed SFr50 to SFr3,440. There was talk that a new issue of covered warrants on the certificates was being prepared. BRUSSELS weakened slightly on the last day of the forward account, the Bel-20 index losing 3.60 to 1,066.76 in low turnover of BFr527m. UCB, the chemical and pharmaceutical group, advanced BFr275 to BFr21,900 ahead of interim results due on Thursday. VIENNA gained strongly as short-covering on the futures and options exchange pushed the ATX index up 14.69 to 745.17, its highest level for more than two weeks. Wienerberger, the building materials supplier, continued last week's rally, gaining Sch120 to Sch3,320 while OMV was Sch21 stronger at Sch666. STOCKHOLM fell in thin trading, as the Affarsvarlden General Index shed 6.3 to 750.7. Last week's suspension of shares in Svensk Kredit continued to plague the banking and insurance sectors. Skandia, a major shareholder in Svensk Kredit, fell SKr4.50 to SKr62.50. MADRID's general index lost 0.86 to 215.56 in turnover estimated at Pta5.5bn. OSLO's all-share index fell 4.05 or 1.3 per cent to 309.04 after the central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 11.0 per cent from 10.0 per cent. Wall Street and Toronto were shut yesterday for Labor Day.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 7                              Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm      2 pm     3 pm    close 1032.49  1030.87  1031.52  1032.73  1034.46  1033.88  1032.63  1032.28                Day's High  1034.83    Day's Low  1030.47        Sep 4       Sep 3      Sep 2       Sep 1      Aug 28       1029.27     1031.46    1011.19    1007.79     1013.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

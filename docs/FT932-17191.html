			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (25): Wild colonial boys Joachim (Joe) Brandler recalls life in Lagos nearly 50 ago . . . AT THE time of my arrival in 1947 the atmosphere in Lagos was still very colonial. The administration was totally in the hands of the Colonial Office, and so were the various bodies answerable to Government, be it Customs, Health, Police, Army, Ports, Law, Education and so on All had white officers at their head - and in key positions. There were still white locomotive drivers working on the railways; a rough lot who let their hair down in these foreign parts and the Railway Club in Ebute Metta was renowned for its wild scenes. We all walked about in shorts and open-necked shirts during the daytime; in the evening one wore long trousers, long sleeved shirts and tie. A tie was also worn with shorts if one had to call on a Government officer. Every expat slept under a mosquito net and many boiled their water and then filtered it. It was rare for whites and blacks to mix socially. The British had to ensure that they were feared and respected and undue intimacy would mitigate against that. Air-conditioning did not come in until the 1950s. Social life was active, with sporting clubs and private dinner parties within fairly narrow circles. One of the highlights was the Queen's visit in 1956. It started off in Lagos, where the streets had been gaily decorated and schoolchildren lined the roads waving little Union Jacks. From Lagos the Royal party went up-country. It was impossible then to imagine that in a few years Nigeria would declare herself an independent republic, albeit within the Commonwealth. There was not a single hostile demonstration during the whole visit.

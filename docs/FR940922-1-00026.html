			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 209 of the Act generally preempts states from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving such regulation to EPA under section 202 of the Act. Section 209 does, however, provide an exception for California to adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards where the Administrator grants a preemption waiver based on a finding that California's standards will be, ``in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.'' Further, under section 177 of the Act, any state which has SIP provisions approved under part D of title I may adopt and enforce new motor vehicle emission standards for any model year if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) California and such state adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of the Administrator).*&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has granted a waiver for California's ``Low Emission Vehicle'' program. See 58 FR 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993)(announcing availability of Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low-Emission Vehicle Standards (Jan. 8, 1993)). This program generally calls for five categories of vehicles meeting progressively more stringent emissions standards: California Tier I vehicles; Transitional Low Emission Vehicles (TLEV); Low Emission Vehicles (LEV); Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV); and Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). California has also established an overall non-methane organic gas (NMOG) standard that each manufacturer must meet for its fleet of new vehicles in a particular model year by selling any combination of vehicles certified by California as meeting standards for one of the five categories. In addition, under California's program, at least 2% of each manufacturers' new vehicle fleet sold in California must be ZEV's by 1998 and 10% by 2003.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At its second meeting on July 16, 1991, the OTC adopted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which the state and District of Columbia representatives agreed that, in view of the significant contribution of motor vehicles to the northeast ozone problem, they all support California's Motor Vehicle Control Program, and call on their jurisdictions to cooperatively evaluate the feasibility, air quality benefits, and associated costs of this Program in the OTR. At its third meeting on October 29, 1991, the OTC states agreed to a further MOU providing that each OTC state would take steps to implement California's Low Emission Vehicle program as soon as possible. New York and Massachusetts are the only states that have adopted the California LEV program in legislation and regulations without contingencies, and both states are set to implement their programs. The automobile manufacturers have challenged the legality of both programs, and both lawsuits are ongoing. Other states have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on regional program adoption, and the remaining states are at various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1993, Maine, Maryland, and Massachusetts petitioned the OTC to adopt a recommendation calling for the application of the California LEV program throughout the OTR. During the fall of 1993, the OTC held a number of public forums in various locations in the northeast, and held a public hearing in Hartford, Connecticut on December 16&hyph;17, 1993. Finally, at its winter meeting on February 1, 1994, in Washington, D.C., the OTC voted by a 9 to 4 majority to recommend that EPA mandate the California LEV program throughout the OTR. (The OTC refers to the program they recommend as ``OTC LEV.'') New Hampshire, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey voted against the recommendation. The OTC's recommendation contains the following elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The OTC LEV program would be applicable to all 1999 and subsequent model year passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the OTR;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

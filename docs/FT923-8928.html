			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The president's dilemma: Jurek Martin examines the US response to the conflict President George Bush's military and political advisers have long concurred on one thing. There is no part of the world less enticing for US military involvement than what was Yugoslavia. The hope was that Europe, with help from the US, would somehow sort out what is seen in Washington as essentially a European problem. With that hope in tatters, Mr Bush now faces the dilemma whereby to take no risks might be worse in domestic political terms and for US standing in the world than, as one senior official put it this week, 'to roll the dice'. The pressure on the president intensified sharply this week, though still perhaps not to the extent of the debate raging in Europe. It was not enough, for example, to get James Baker, the secretary of state, to cut short his holiday, but it was sufficient that no presidential response would have been unthinkable, even if this was not an election year. Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, the Senate foreign relations committee acting in bipartisan unity, Lady Thatcher, Jewish groups and leading newspapers all demanded that the US take the lead in bringing Serbian aggression to book. The administration's reaction was initially tentative and contradictory. It asserted, then denied, it had evidence of atrocities in Serbian-run camps. Before Mr Bush spoke on Thursday, the best it could do was call for an extraordinary session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. When he did pronounce, the president was conspicuously cautious, only urging a UN resolution, backed by force if necessary, to ensure humanitarian relief for Bosnia. He disapproved of the 'vile policy of ethnic cleansing' but did not say Serbia must be punished for operating the detention camps. He coupled this with a determination not to put US military personnel at undue risk. Yesterday he added that he did not want 'the US bogged down in any way in guerrilla warfare'. This means any US involvement would be mostly confined to air power. Any ground presence, the US believes, must come from European countries, under either a Nato or UN flag. The reality is that international contingency planning is in its infancy compared with the blueprints to launch air strikes against Iraq two weeks ago. Lady Thatcher may urge the use of Nato, but it matters more that John Major, Mr Bush's staunchest European ally and willing to commit British jets to any attack on Iraq, remains opposed to anything equivalent in the Balkans. French and German reservations are also strong. When a candidate in 1988, Mr Bush once confessed he did not really think he had been 'tested by fire' in his public life. The invasion of Panama and, above all, the Gulf war gave him that satisfaction. There is no sign he wants a third experience in the Balkans. By comparison, even Saddam Hussein is an inviting prospect.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Intel shares rise sharply on IBM link-up reports INTEL shares have risen sharply this week amid reports that the semiconductor manufacturer was in talks with International Business Machines about a possible manufacturing alliance. Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips used in personal computers, is unable to fulfil strong demand for its latest products. IBM, in contrast, has excess production capacity. Wall Street analysts speculated that the companies might come to an arrangement that would solve both of their problems. IBM is Intel's largest customer, and a long-time ally. IBM already manufacturers, under licence, Intel-designed microprocessors. However, the current terms of that licensing arrangement limit IBM's production to chips for use in its own products, or for sale in 'sub-systems', such as computer circuit boards. One possibility is that the licensing arrangement could be modified to enable IBM to manufacture microprocessors for sale to third parties. Analysts also suggested, however, that Intel might acquire a share of IBM's semiconductor production facility in East Fishkill, New York. A spokesman for Intel said the company had frequent discussions with IBM, but would not disclose the nature of those talks. IBM also declined comment. Intel's stock gained Dollars 4 3/8 on Tuesday and a further Dollars 1/8 yesterday, closing at Dollars 101 1/2 having earlier touched Dollars 102 1/8.</p>

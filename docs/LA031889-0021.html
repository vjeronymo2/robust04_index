			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VOTES UNCHANGED;  </P> <P> SIMI SCHOOL BOND ISSUE LOSES AGAIN IN BALLOT RECOUNT  </P> <P> A vote recount has confirmed the defeat of a Simi Valley school bond measure,  school officials announced Friday.  </P> <P> The recount by Ventura County election officials showed that Measure B, which  had to be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to pass, garnered  66.1%, or 6,929 votes, in the March 7 special election.  </P> <P> If approved, the measure would have provided $8 million to build gymnasiums and  an auditorium.  </P> <P> "It didn't change a single vote," Chet Howe, a spokesman for the Simi Valley  Unified School District, said of the recount. "But the election was so close --  we only needed 59 more votes to win -- that we felt we owed it to the 66% who  voted for it to double-check the outcome."  </P> <P> The district spent about $2,000 for the recount, including the salary of a San  Francisco attorney who specializes in election law.  </P> <P> Howe said officials are disappointed with the defeat of Measure B. But he noted  that a second school bond measure, Measure A, won handily.  </P> <P> Measure A, which will provide $35 million to upgrade the district's 27 schools,  passed last week with 70.5%, or 7,410 votes.  </P> <P> Simi Valley school officials campaigned aggressively for both bond measures.  </P> <P> A citizens committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200  volunteers, and raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay  for other campaign expenses.  </P> <P> Howe said officials will decide later this month whether to put the $8-million  bond measure on the November ballot.  </P></p>

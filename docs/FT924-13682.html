			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Arnotts shares soar after offer SHARES in Arnotts, the Australian biscuit-maker, jumped by ADollars 1.15 to ADollars 9.15 yesterday, suggesting that an offer of ADollars 8.80 a share by Campbell Soup, the US foodmaker, was too low to attract most major shareholders. However, analysts said the offer, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 0.85), may be sufficient to increase Campbell's shareholding from 32.9 per cent to 50.1 per cent, subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). Mr David Johnson, Campbell chief executive, said the offer was fair, and ruled out a higher bid. He described suggestions by Arnotts' adviser that the company was worth ADollars 12 a share as 'unreasonable'. The board of Arnotts confirmed that directors would make no official comment on the bid until after a board meeting today. However, Mr Sandy Dawson, a shareholder and former chief executive, said the offer was too low. Mr Dawson suggested Campbell would dispose of its shareholding at a substantial profit if the bid stimulated a rival offer from another company. However, analysts said Campbell was unlikely to withdraw. Campbell says it wants to use Arnotts to launch a range a biscuits in the growing markets of south-east Asia, but needs full control to justify making available technical and marketing skills.</p>

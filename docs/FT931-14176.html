			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Iraq holds out olive branches THE offer by Iraq of a ceasefire with the US-led forces, due to come into effect this morning, came yesterday amid other signs that Baghdad was attempting to reopen a dialogue with the west. Earlier yesterday the Vatican said it had agreed to an Iraqi request to ask Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, to promote talks between Baghdad and the allies aimed at ending the current crisis. Wissam Chawkat al-Zahawi, Iraq's ambassador to the Vatican, conveyed the request yesterday in talks with Archbishop Jean-Louie Tauran, the Holy See's foreign 'minister'. Last night there was further evidence that Iraq might be intent on improving relations with the Gulf war allies when Mr Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, said his country would allow UN weapons inspectors to fly directly from Bahrain, their regional headquarters, to Baghdad. The UN accepted the offer, which was made without conditions and which guaranteed the safety of UN aircraft. The offer removed a principal cause of dispute between the UN and Baghdad and Mr Ralph Ekeus, head of the UN Commission set up to identify and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said that flights would be resumed as soon as it was feasible. Baghdad says this week it has also stopped all raids across the border into Kuwait and police posts have been removed from inside Kuwaiti territory, both causes of friction with the UN. What seemed to be another olive branch was offered to President-elect Bill Clinton by President Saddam Hussein's press secretary, Mr Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, in an open letter published in yesterday's al-Thawra newspaper. 'Mr President, the people did not elect you to (continue) with these policies. . . be with change, with a real new world as you promised. . . hostility towards Iraq will deny you the realities on which the legitimate interests of your country stand,' it said. But Baghdad did not immediately renounce its rejection of the no-fly zones north of the 36th parallel and south of the 32nd parallel as illegal, and has been arguing that Washington had no backing from the UN Security Council for its recent attacks, which the Iraqis say have killed at least 45 people. A Revolutionary Command Council statement offering the mutual ceasefire said merely that 'this gives the new administration in the US time to study the no-fly zones in the north and south' and time 'to establish a constructive dialogue'. Iraq has been hit four times in less than a week by allied air attacks to enforce the no-fly zones and UN Security Council resolution 688, despite the fact that, unlike UN resolutions on Kuwait, resolution 688 contains no provision authorising states to enforce compliance. The Iraqi regime, ahead of the statement last night, had said it would continue to resist what it sees as an infringement of sovereignty. Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, had said on Monday that the no-fly zones was part of a hidden agenda by some western nations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has disclosed  that all those involved in the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church carry more than three passports. Some of them, he added,  fled to the border strip and from there to Israel and then  Australia. He added: The judiciary will decide on the matter;  investigations continue and those found to be involved will be  taken to court, regardless of who they may be. He added: We  will not cover up for anybody and our judiciary is independent.  The judicial investigator issues arrest warrants and instructs  the security agencies to apprehend the suspects, he said.    He noted that the new press law will give the press more  freedoms and will restrict the arbitrary questioning of  journalists as well as the suspension of a paper before a trial  is held. He stressed the need to organize the audiovisual  media, which are a legacy of the war and which continue to  operate from a militia-minded point of view.    Minister Dallul's remarks came in an interview with the  Kuwaiti paper AL-QABAS. [passage omitted]    Concerning the defendants who participated in blowing up the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church and who are abroad, Minister Dallul  pointed out that the defendants currently in custody had made  confessions and admitted that each participant carried more than  three passports. He added: We have information that many of  them fled to the border zone and from there to Israel. From  Israel, they left for Australia with passports under false  names. [passage omitted]</p>

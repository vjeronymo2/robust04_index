Norton and G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- Scores of Zulus --  many armed with traditional weapons -- began making their way to  Johannesburg's Library Gardens on Monday morning in answer to a  call by indunas [chiefs] to rally in support of King Goodwill  Zwelithini. A group of mostly male marchers could be seen  making their way down Commssioner Street. Pedestrians stayed  clear of the marchers.    The rally follows a call made on Saturday by the Transvaal  deputy chairman of Zulu indunas, Joseph Zulu, who appealed to  Zulus to stay away from work on Monday and rally at the Library  Gardens in support of King Goodwill. He said the rally was to  express support for the Zulu king's demand for a sovereign  kingdom in Natal and opposition to the interim constitution.    Mr Zulu said "Zulus" were also demanding President F. W. de  Klerk reply to King Zwelithini's letter on the sovereignty  issue. Also on Saturday, traditional leader Induna Sikhumbuzo  Mabizela told a press conference in Johannesburg a meeting of  indunas in the Transvaal had decided on the rally. It was  scheduled for 9 AM on Monday.    Mr Mabizela said: "We support the claim of King Zwelithini  to his land. We totally reject the constitution of F. W. de  Klerk and his colleagues of Kempton Park. We will fight to the  last atom of our stren?th if the king's demands are not met."</p>

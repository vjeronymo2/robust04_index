The summit held in the  Burkinabe capital, seat of the community, ended there "to deal  the final blow to a dying organisation", an official of the  Senegalese Ministry of Economy and Finance told PANA.    Set up on 2 June 1972 in Bamako, Mali by Burkina Faso, Cote  d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Senegal, and broadened  with Benin joining in 1984, CEAO was a community of 51 million  people spread over nearly five million square kilometres.    During its 22 years of existence, the community has endured  difficulties such as the non-payment of five months of salaries  (October 1993-February 1994) to its 450 personnel. Lately,  telephone lines and electricity were cut in its headquarters.    However, the problems were predictable following the theft  in  1985 of 6.5 billion CFA (1 U.S. dollar; 575 F CFA at today's  rate) in what has become know as the "Diawara affair." The  theft was from the Solidarity and Intervention Fund for the  Development of the Community, a specialised unit of the CEAO.  Of the 6.5 billion CFA said to have been embezzled by Moussa  Ngom (former CEAO secretary general), Moussa Diakite (Fosidec  director general) and Mohamed Diawara (businessman and former  Ivorian minister), only 400 million F CFA have been recovered to  date.    Even though the "Diawara affair" was the starting point of  the community's difficulties, its financial problems were  worsened when the member states failed to meet their financial  contributions. This led to arrears of some 65.5 billion CFA as  at 30 June 1993. Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, the two major  contributors, owe the defunct community 50 billion CFA. Of this  amount, Cote d'Ivoire owes 34 billion CFA. Only Benin was up to  date with its contributions.    However, CEAO, whose mission was to foster the development  of  economic activities in member states, had all the assets to  succeed, according to some experts interviewed by PANA. In  fact, with a gross domestic product of 4.3 billion dollars and  10 billion dollars in foreign trade (coffee, cocoa, timber,  uranium, iron, oil, cotton, peanuts, water, cattle, tourism and  cereals), the community was a real economic force the experts  said.    CEAO was strengthened in 1977 with the adoption in Abidjan  of  a nonaggression and defence assistance agreement. This was  aimed at guaranteeing the security for the community.    In order to achieve its task, the CEAO set up several  specialised institutions such as the Community Development Fund,  the School of Mining and Geology in Niamey, the Regional Center  of Solar Energy in Bamako, the Center for Higher Management  Studies in Dakar, the School of Fishing in Nouadhibou,  Mauritania.    However, hit by an economic crisis compounded by the 50 per  cent devaluation of the CFA, decided on 11 January in Dakar, the  member states preferred to sacrifice [words indistinct] and for  the West African Economic and Monetary Union, set up three  months ago and whose deadline for ratification is 30 April 1994.</p>

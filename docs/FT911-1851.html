			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Christies Intl raises client loans to Pounds 16m CHRISTIES International, the auction house, is lending more money to people whose possessions it is in the process of selling. Notes to the accounts show that year-end advances to consignors nearly quadrupled from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 15.7m. Mr Tyler confirmed that the increase was a trend and that the year-end snapshot was 'not too unrepresentative. But don't imagine that the figure is going to multiply by four each year,' he said. Christies charges 'a commercial rate of interest' on the sums advanced. Despite the increase, Christies' year-end inventory of debtors tumbled by a third to Pounds 173.68m (Pounds 260.98m). This was principally due to a sharp fall to Pounds 140.51m (Pounds 244.49m) in monies owed by purchasers, reflecting the downturn in business. Christies' 1990 pre-tax profits fell by 36 per cent to Pounds 43.09m (Pounds 66.94m) on turnover down 13 per cent to Pounds 167.77m (Pounds 192.14m). The accounts also show that Lord Carrington, chairman, last year received a 13 per cent pay rise to Pounds 165,000. The salary of the highest paid director rose from Pounds 190,000 to Pounds 226,000.</p>

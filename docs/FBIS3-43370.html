			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Maputo today, General Domingos Fondo, of the  Mozambique Armed Forces, rejected accusations by Afonso  Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, that  he smuggles large quantities of weapons to neighboring South  Africa. Speaking to the Mozambican and international media,  Gen. Domingos Fondo made it very clear that he could not care  less about Dhlakama's accusations. He added that Afonso  Dhlakama must go to court, present his case, and prove his  accusations or he will have to pay.    [Begin Fondo recording] As you know, our country has an  institution that deals with accusations such as those. He  should draw up a criminal complaint and deliver it directly to  the correct institution so it can summon Gen. Fondo to answer  those charges. He should bring the matter before the court  rather than make those comments in public. A person who accuses  another person of having committed a crime does not do so in the  street but, rather, brings the case before the competent  institution. I do not feel offended at this stage [words  indistinct] must go directly to court and if there is no  concrete evidence to back what he is saying, he will pay. When  a person makes an accusation [words indistinct] has to pay. If  you accuse someone of stealing, you go to court and say: he has  stolen from me. In turn, the court will say: well, you must  pay now. [end recording]    Asked about international media reports on his alleged  involvement in arms trafficking, Gen. Domingos Fondo said he had  nothing to say. He was also asked to comment on whether he has  business interests in South Africa:    [Begin recording] [Fondo] I do not know whether you have  come  here as businessmen. If you are here to treat me as a  businessman, then I must take off my uniform and then you must  talk to me as you would to a businessman.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Fondo] If you are here to treat me as a businessman, then  let us talk directly about what my company does. If I am here  accused of (?smuggling) arms, then that is another matter  altogether. You are here to talk to me as a member of  parliament and a member of the Mozambique Liberation Front Party.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Fondo] [Words indistinct] (?weapons), if someone gets in  touch with me, he does so in my capacity as general, to offer  weapons at that particular time [words indistinct] (?and then it  is over).

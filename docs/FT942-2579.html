			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Unisys held back by slow mainframe sales in Europe Unisys, the US computer company, has warned that slow European sales of its mainframe computers will result in lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Its share price dropped sharply to Dollars 9 from Dollars 10 3/4 when it released its statement just before the market closed on Thursday. Yesterday, in early trade, the stock hovered around Dollars 9. The group, which has been making a strong recovery after several years of heavy losses, blamed the setback on both operational and economic weaknesses in Europe. European revenues represented 25 per cent of Unisys' total 1993 revenues of Dollars 7.7bn. Sales of large computer systems in Europe continued to decline, particularly in France, Germany and Italy, Unisys said. Although the company has seen stronger demand among its European customers for desktop computers, these products carry a lower profit margin. 'The net result of this situation is lower sales margins and profits,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. In March, Unisys appointed Mr Malcolm Coster, a former Coopers and Lybrand consultant, to head its European operations. Mr Unruh said the new executive was 'taking steps to focus the business on growth opportunities and improve programme execution'. Unisys aims in particular to expand its services and systems integration businesses. 'While European orders in the second quarter may be up, year over year, and the rate of revenue decline is slowing, a meaningful business recovery is not yet under way. We will not plan on a positive turn in our European business until the fourth quarter at the earliest, which is later than we expected at the beginning of the year,' said Mr Unruh. Unisys said revenues from its services and systems integration grew strongly in the first quarter, in Europe and elsewhere, and the trend was expected to continue. However, the company noted that in the services business revenues were spread over the period of long-term contracts. Sales in the US and other international markets continued to grow and were expected to exceed last year's second-quarter and first-half figures, it added.</p>

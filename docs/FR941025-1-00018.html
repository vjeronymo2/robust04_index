The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting the nose wheel steering drive ring for cracks, and replacing any cracked drive ring. A report of the rudder pedals jamming in the central position during a takeoff on one of the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the nose wheel steering system because of a cracked drive ring, which could result in the inability to move the rudder pedals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before December 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;10&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

The CAA advises that the rudder pedals jammed in the central position during a takeoff run on a BN2B Islander series airplane. Initial investigation revealed that the nose wheel steering drive ring had fractured and the broken portion of the ring became snagged in the cut-away section of frame 19 where the steering cables pass through. This caused the inability to move the rudder pedals. Further investigation showed that the drive ring had cracked from the small radius of the left front lug across the ring and also through the grease nipple hole at the rear left side of the ring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pilatus Britten-Norman has issued Service Bulletin No. BN&hyph;2/SB.214, Issue 1, dated September 23, 1993, which specifies procedures for inspecting the nose wheel steering drive ring. In order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom, the CAA listed the actions specified in this service bulletin in the Mandatory Aircraft Modifications and Inspections Summary, Issue 8, dated March 1994, as UK CAA AD 005&hyph;09&hyph;93. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

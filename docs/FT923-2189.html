			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (3): Battling with market forces  -Merseyside needs the kind of aid that City Challenge offers / Ian Hamilton Fazey depicts a winning conurbation WHEN THE government put urban funding up for competition in 1991, it changed the rules governing City Challenge after the first 16 local authorities had been allowed into the fray. They had been picked by civil servants to fight each other for 10 prizes of Pounds 7.5m each for five years; but when the winners were announced, there were 11 - and one extra competitor had been let in, bringing the field up to 17. Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, said two local authorities had made bids of such equal merit that it would have been unfair to choose between them. He would not say which they were, but the evidence now suggests that they were Liverpool and Wirral, giving Merseyside two winners in one year, a politically surprising result. As in many a contest, coincidence and luck played an unfair part. Mr Heseltine was scheduled for a routine ministerial visit to Wirral the day after last year's local government elections, but Ms Yvonne Nolan, Labour leader of the council who supported non-payment of the poll tax, lost her seat, throwing the arranged programme into disarray. In stepped Mr Alan White, the council's thrusting chief executive, to fill the gap. He and his economic development team had been stung at being excluded from the City Challenge race so as to allow Liverpool a clear run as Merseyside's sole representative. He made the most of having a captive audience, won his argument and Wirral won the extra prize. This year, Merseyside's other dockland borough - Sefton - was also among the winners, which means the county now has three dollops of Pounds 7.5m-a-year of City Challenge money. This is on top of the annual Pounds 20m-plus that Merseyside Development Corporation has been getting since 1981 and extensive disbursement throughout the county of derelict land grants, urban development grants and city action grants for private sector projects. Merseyside needs this sort of aid, because market forces have been running against it for most of this century. The pattern of world trade changed. So did shipping technology. The resultant problems took generations to reach crisis point, but may also take generations to solve. Local political extremism is easier to understand when set against the frustrations involved. Economic structure is central to any analysis. There is too narrow a base of industries, a poor mix of big and small employers, and a tradition of low skilled labouring among too many male workers. Add social and housing distress, and the most sustained depopulation in Britain is explained: Liverpool is about two-thirds the size it was in the 1950s. The pattern and effect of targeting spending since 1979 is now emerging. Government urban policy initially concentrated on restoring the Liverpool waterfront, control of which was removed from the city council, and on several large projects in the conurbation. The Albert Dock, which now attracts more than 6m visitors a year, is one example of outstanding success. So is Wavertree Technology Park, which has brought hundreds of high-technology jobs into Liverpool; so too is Ravenhead Renaissance, which is reclaiming acres of land poisoned by 18th and 19th century glass and chemicals works in the middle of St Helens. The three City Challenge schemes will fill important gaps. All derive from the changing nature of Merseyside as a port. The port is actually thriving again now, thanks to demanning, modern technology, and Britain's most successful freeport - an area within the docks with a VAT-free internal taxation regime. But it is Merseyside's redundant dockland, designed for an age of small general cargo ships and manual handling of cargoes, that has been the root cause of physical and infrastructural problems. In Liverpool, this centred on the waterfront and several miles of small, disused general cargo docks. In Wirral, it was a half-redundant, but still active docklands area between Wallasey and Birkenhead. In Sefton, it was in Bootle - where most of the docks are still use, but their hinterland is shabby, and looks as though it has never quite got over the May blitz of 1941. Indeed, whenever the Luftwaffe bombed the port, they usually hit Bootle. The devastation was so bad that it was an official secret until public records were opened in 1971. This will even affect what happens now. Mr Chris Oldershaw, who has led most of the work on Sefton's City Challenge, says some areas may have to remain undeveloped: several large public shelters were hit by bombs and sealed with bodies unrecovered. They are unmarked war graves, but Mr Oldershaw says local people know where they are and do not want them touched. However, this will not stand in the way of council tenants being relocated away from the docks, where their lives have been blighted by dust from imported coal. A buffer zone of industry will separate docks and housing, a large business park will be built within the freeport, better roads will improve links to Liverpool and the motorway network, and Bootle town centre will get new offices and shops. The resurgent Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) will be one of Sefton's main partners, along with P&amp;O Properties and Neptune, a Merseyside property development company. The MDHC will also be prominent in Wirral's City Challenge area, which straddles Birkenhead docks. The freeport is being extended to these docklands, where dockside land is being cleared for factories. Park Food Group will also be active, expanding on to derelict land it has bought next to its premises. A sports centre will be built nearby, next to the training ground of Tranmere Rovers, the football club which Mr Peter Johnson, Park's chairman, also owns. The council has already built a strong partnership with the private sector called the Wirral Investment Network (WIN). Mr Peter Coffey, the City Challenge director, says this will play a full role, along with a Community Action Network (CAN) formed by the 29,000 people living in the area - CAN-WIN, in combination. While Sefton's challenge area also has 29,000 people in it, Liverpool's is very different, with only 4,000. Its problems are, however, just as much a legacy of changed economic structure, for the area is in the city centre. As if to underline the legacy of bygone days of frenetic Atlantic trading and emigrations to the US, there are 890 listed buildings. Keynote projects include the refurbishment of the Philharmonic concert hall, and the creation of a 'fame' school - the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts - out of a listed, disused school. Littlewoods, Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo, and Royal Insurance are all actively involved with the city council. So are the city's two universities  -Liverpool and John Moores - and the government's Merseyside task-force of civil servants. Neptune Developments and Amey Hynd, a local construction company, are other players. In spite of this necessarily large network of concerned involvement, Mr Peter Wilson, who has been seconded from the task-force to be deputy director of the challenge team, says: 'We have made the structure as simple and informal as possible. If we try to be too formal, things might become more time-consuming for senior people in the private sector.' The best news for Merseyside, however, is that in all three City Challenge areas, private-sector commitment looks large and secure. To the world at large, this is important in a community where partnership had no hope in the divisive, politically sectarian days of the mid-1980s, when Militant pulled Labour's strings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pomp Column" by Cristina Lobo] </F>   [Text] After years of shifting (and disputes) among the  various PT [Workers Party] factions, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  has decided to pay more attention to his election campaign. He  will attend a meeting of the National Executive and  congressional party bloc members tomorrow when a final decision  on the PT participation in the constitutional revision process  will be made.    The results of the meeting are more important even than the  votes of the PT during the work of the revision process. If  those attending the meeting approve the proposal to participate,  it will represent a defeat for the Shiites [fundamentalist PT  followers], those who do not want the PT involved in broader  alliances with the center-left, and those who want a radical  government program.    The so-called "flexibility" sought by some PT factions,  according to their proponents, will permit Lula to increase  support for his candidacy above the present 30 percent level.    The PT candidate is being forced to change his opinion.  After making a harsh speech against constitutional revision two  months ago, in accordance with the position of the National  Executive, Lula now wants a "political participation," which is  more in accordance with the wishes of the party bloc in Congress.    Another meeting with the same agenda took place last week  but  results were inconclusive. Lula was touring northern states at  that time. He could have attended, but preferred not to. Now  he is being forced to take sides in the PT internal dispute.</p>

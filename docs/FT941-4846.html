			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sumit Fully-diluted net asset value per ordinary share of Sumit, the development and venture capital investment trust, stood at 154p at the December 31 year end. That compared with 103p at the half year stage and 95p 12 months earlier. The announcement yesterday of a proposed placing by Partico at 200p per share will increase Sumit's fully-diluted figure to 186p. At the placing price the trust's interest in Partico, including its holding of redeemable preference shares, will be valued at Pounds 6.5m - a gain of Pounds 3m over its December 1993 valuation. Sumit has indicated its intention to sell a third of its holding in Partico's ordinary equity at the placing price which will realise Pounds 1.7m. Available revenue for 1993 improved from Pounds 161,000 to Pounds 303,000, for earnings of 4.2p (2.2p). A final dividend of 2.3p, compared with a 1.3p forecast, makes a 3p (1.4p) total.</p>

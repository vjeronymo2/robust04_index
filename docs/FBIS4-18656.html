			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "London and Dublin United"] </F>   [Text] The IRA's three-day ceasefire, due to start this  morning, has been roundly denounced as cynical and inadequate.  Ever since the Downing Street Declaration in December, it has  been made abundantly clear to the IRA's political wing, Sinn  Fein, that it can enter the democratic process only when it  unequivocally and permanently renounces violence. Sinn Fein's  aim in calling this ceasefire was clearly to try to put pressure  on the Government to fudge this fundamental precondition. That  indeed has been its intention all along; hence its repeated call  for London to "clarify" the declaration.    Dublin, however, has already provided Sinn Fein leaders with  ample clarification, and the Sinn Fein leadership can now be in  no doubt what the declaration means. They have admitted several  times that it offers a real chance of progress for Ulster, yet  cannot bring themselves to abandon their old boast that they  will eventually force their way to the peace table with a ballot  box in one hand and an Armalite in the other.    We have before expressed concern that the Irish government,  in its eagerness to get peace talks moving, would allow Sinn  Fein to think that it could somehow avoid the absolute necessity  of renouncing violence. It is therefore very welcome that over  the past week Dublin has stood four-square with London and  condemned outright this latest attempt by Sinn Fein and the IRA  to drive a wedge between the two governments on this crucial  issue.    It may nevertheless take some time before Sinn Fein finally  accepts that it must renounce violence once and for all. It may  never accept as much. A 72-hour respite from murder and  maiming, though welcome in itself, can do nothing to hasten the  negotiations which the British and Irish governments still hope  will flow from the declaration. But many in the various  constituencies that Sinn Fein and the IRA seek to cultivate --  in Northern Ireland itself, in the South and in America -- are  urging them to respond constructively to the declaration. And  that seems to be giving them serious pause for thought about  their terrorist campaign. Both governments must keep up the  pressure by continuing to refuse them any form of talks until  they forswear terrorism for ever.</p>

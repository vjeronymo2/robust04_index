			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Digital in Hughes TV deal HUGHES Aircraft is pushing ahead with a revolutionary satellite television project designed to offer more than 150 TV channels all over the US by the beginning of 1994. Hughes, the aircraft and communications division of General Motors, has already committed Dollars 500m to the project and the first of three satellites is scheduled for launch next year. The Hughes subsidiary involved, DirecTv, yesterday announced the latest stage for the venture - a deal with Digital Equipment of the US to operate the national computerised billing system for the project. Network Computing Corporation will provide the software. Mr Eddy Hartenstein, DirecTv president, estimates the US company could be reaching 10m homes by the end of the decade. Earlier this year Thomson Consumer Electronics was given an exclusive deal under which it will produce the first 1m satellite receivers, expected to retail at around Dollars 700. The scrambling equipment for the service will be provided by News Datacom, a subsidiary of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. No less than 40-50 channels will be devoted to a pay-per-view movie service with showing of popular films starting every 30 minutes. A second major slice of the system will carry subscription sports - all the games not carried on national television. DirecTv will also deliver 20 channels of cable television to rural areas unlikely to get their own cable networks in the foreseeable future. A fourth strand of programmes will be aimed at special interest groups or ethnic minorities.</p>

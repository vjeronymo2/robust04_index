			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Irish shipping group to acquire B&amp;I Ferries SHAREHOLDERS in Irish Continental Group, the Dublin-based shipping company, have approved an IPounds 8.5m (Pounds 7.9m) takeover of B&amp;I Ferries, the loss-making state-run shipping company which operates passenger and cargo services across the Irish Sea. The acquisition makes ICG the principal ferry operator between Ireland and the UK and the continent. In recommending the deal, the board said: 'Because ICG is predominantly a passenger operation, the acquisition will reduce the seasonality of the overall business'. B&amp;I's turnover is divided approximately 40:60 between passenger and cargo revenues. Under the deal, the government is to assume IPounds 35m of B&amp;I's debts, while ICG will obtain assets worth IPounds 18m. The government turned down a management buy-out offer by B&amp;I's staff last year in favour of the ICG offer.</p>

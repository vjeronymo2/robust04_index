			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of qualifying deposit will continue as stated in 12 CFR 563b.3(e). Also, the OTS believes that there is no compelling reason to eliminate or revise the current supplemental eligibility record date. Thus, supplemental eligible account holders, as currently defined in the regulation, will continue to be a category with a priority immediately following that of tax-qualified employee benefit plans. In addition, the OTS believes that there is no compelling reason to revise the current regulation that: 1) gives a purchase preference to all depositors (but not borrowers); 2) does not differentiate between eligible and supplemental eligible account holders whose accounts remain open at the voting record date over those who terminated their account relationship after board of director approval of the plan of conversion; and 3) requires the 100 share initial allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Preference for Depositors in Local Community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to promulgation of the interim final rule, the OTS conversion regulations required a converting association to conduct a community offering of conversion stock in the local community, prior to a general public offering, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  but did not permit converting associations to give account holders and voting members in those local communities a priority to purchase stock in the initial subscription offering. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  However, to minimize conversion expenses, the OTS permitted converting associations to not register under state blue sky laws in those states where there was a relatively small number of depositors compared to the overall depositor base, even though this resulted in some depositors being precluded from purchasing stock in the conversion offering. In addition, the OTS has, on a case by case basis, permitted thrift subsidiaries of mutual holding companies to prioritize stock purchases by account holders and voting members in the local communities. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 563b.3(c)(6)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 563b.3(c)(2), (4), (5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 575.7(d)(6)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> required <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that a stock purchase preference be given to eligible account holders, supplemental eligible account holders and voting members residing in the association's local community. Those having preference in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> each <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  priority group ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , eligible account holder, supplemental eligible account holder and voting member) are persons who reside in the association's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting association. The interim final rule defined ``local community'' to include all counties in which the converting association has a home or branch office, each county's standard metropolitan statistical area or the general metropolitan area of each of these counties and such other similar area(s) as provided for in the converting association's plan of conversion, as approved by the OTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over one-half of the commenters on the interim final rule expressed views on the local depositor preference (LDP) provision. Approximately one-half of those commenters supported the LDP provision for various reasons such as: it promotes local control and involvement and is more sensitive to the community's needs; it serves the community first and gives depositors in the local community a more meaningful opportunity to participate; it is a good way to maintain local control of community-oriented associations; and it deals with the problem of outside investors who tend to put undue pressure on management to achieve a higher stock value more rapidly than may be feasible through safe and sound operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A majority of the supporters of the LDP provision also suggested various changes to the interim final rule. Three suggested eliminating the 100 mile rule; one suggested using 50 instead of 100 miles; and three requested that the OTS clarify the parameters of 100 miles,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , from headquarters or branch, to residence or town of residence, within certain counties, etc. One commenter noted that the standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) is no longer in general use in delineating communities and markets and has been replaced by ``metropolitan statistical area'' and ``consolidated metropolitan statistical area.'' The same commenter also noted that the term ``general metropolitan area'' is not a term of general usage nor is it explained in the interim final rule. This commenter suggested eliminating the 100 mile priority and restricting priority to persons living within the local community defined by reference to counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested using zip codes corresponding to delineated CRA service areas, and three commenters suggested allowing each institution voluntarily to establish a local priority and identify local depositors. Four commenters requested that the rule be clarified to include, as local depositors, long-term account holders who lived in the area and kept accounts open but have retired and moved from the area, and long-term account holders who work or regularly vacation in the local community but do not reside there.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One selling agent had concerns with the definition of ``local community'' and concerns with the word ``reside,'' including the problem with multiple residences. This commenter suggested that the test for the geographic area for the domicile of an account include the whole of any zip code that is partially within the geographic area. The commenter also suggested developing an affidavit to accompany the stock order form and requested that OTS not require any independent verification by the selling agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

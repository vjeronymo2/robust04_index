			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Louw] </F>   [Text] One of the key leaders of the newly emerged African  Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), Dr Johan van der Westhuizen,  has a long record of running front organisations for Military  Intelligence [MI].    Van der Westhuizen confirmed this week that the ACDP had  approached Local Government and Planning Minister Tertius  Delport, known as a hardliner in President F.W. de Klerk's  cabinet, to join the party's leadership.    Delport has denied he was about to resign from the National  Party [NP] to join the ACDP, saying it was a community-based  party that could play a positive role in local government  elections. Delport [word indistinct] on "like minded parties to  join forces against the African National Congress" [ANC] [word  indistinct] Westhuizen, whose house is being used as the  headquarters of the new party, [words indistinct] in mobilising  anti-ANC blacks since 1986 when he was an official of the MI  front organisation Adult Education Consultants (known as AdEd),  which spent more than R[rand]150-million of taxpayers' money on  secret projects aimed at undermining the ANC and its internal  allies.    Before that, Van der Westhuizen and Delport were colleagues  at the University of Port Elizabeth, [UPE], at the time an  Afrikaner Broederbond [Afrikaner brotherhood] stronghold. Van  der Westhuizen said the new party had no links with his MI past.  "I haven't even talked to those guys for many years," he said.    AdEd Consultants was set up in 1986 by Dr Louis Pasques, a  Pretoria educationist awarded the Star of Africa in 1987 by ex-  president P.W. Botha for "service to state security". It  spawned a host of other front organisations across the country.  One of these was the close corporation Laborel in Johannesburg,  of which Van der Westhuizen was the frontman.    A hallmark of many of Pasques' organisations was the use of  the word "Christian" in their names, hiding their political  motivation behind purportedly charitable and religious work.  Most of these fell under the South African Christian Cultural  Organisation (SACCO), also founded by Pasques. SACCO's secret  and state-funded activities were exposed by the MAIL &amp;  GUARDIAN  last year.    The purpose of these "Christian cultural organisations" was  to lecture "moderates" in the coloured and black communities on  the "total onslaught on the country". Although most of the  organisations did some legitimate work to hide their covert  activities, they were largely sponsored by the South African  Defence Force from secret state funds.    As AdEd consultants' research manager, Van der Westhuizen  was  directly involved in its covert work. According to a letter  written by Pasques in June 1986 and addressed to Dr Das Herbst  of the Ministry of Defence, Van der Westhuizen and his wife were  behind a youth organisation in Port Elizabeth which was  established with the express purpose of opposing the ANC-aligned  UDF [United Democratic Front].    Van der Westhuizen was also personally involved in giving  political instruction to 200 members of Inkatha secretly trained  by the SADF [South African Defence Force] in Namibia in 1986.    AdEd also helped Allan Hendrickse's Labour Party win three  by- elections through weekend seminars in Cape Town in 1987.  SADF - printed certificates were awarded to Labour Party  organisers who successfully completed the electioneering course.  The idea behind the seminars was apparently to boost the  coloured vote to give legitimacy to the discredited tricameral  system.    Front companies were at the time used by MI to create,  train,  support, assist and advise "moderate" black organisations which  they believed would undermine the ANC. These included the black  consciousness AmaAfrica organisation of the reverend Ebenezer  Maqina in Port Elizabeth. AmaAfrica was directly involved in  violent attacks on ANC supporters. The friendship between Van  der Westhuizen and Delport goes back to the mid-1980s when both  were lecturing at the University of Port Elizabeth. Delport was  dean of the law faculty while Van der Westhuizen was a senior  lecturer in political studies at UPF.    Questions about the extend of Delport's involvement in  secret  government projects at the time remain unanswered. He is  implicated in documents released last year by Transkei military  ruler General Bantu Holomisa, but no direct evidence of his  involvement has been produced.    Delport's name is mentioned in a letter written by Brigadier  CP ("Joffel") van der Westhuizen dated June 13 1986, marked "top  secret" and addressed to the chief of the army. The letter  deals with a plan relating to "stability and state security" in  the Eastern Cape, and concludes that an alternative must be  found for unsuccessful efforts to activate "pro-RSA [Republic of  South Africa] resistance movements".    A "Professor Delport, Dean UPE Faculty of Law", is  identified  by Van der Westhuizen as one of three people who were "partly"  aware of the plan. The other two are military men -- General  Gleeson (SADF Deputy Commander) and General Van Deventer (Ciskei  Ambassador).    This week Drickus Botha, a former Armscor [Armaments  Corporation of South Africa] employee who was also an official  of AdEd, denied that he and Delport were involved in "Operation  Grammet", launched in Port Elizabeth in the mid-1980s and  described by an insider as "war games". The exact nature of  Grammet is not clear.    Botha until recently headed an AdEd front organisation in  Pretoria, registered as MMD Makealaars. Another former Armscor  employee, Peet du Preez, has been implicated in Operation  Grammet. He could not be contacted for comment.    The ACDP which was launched in December by Van der  Westhuizen, says it is strongly federalist and believes that  participation in the transition is the most effective way of  achieving its goals. since its inception it has embarked on a  membership drive, trying to attack what it believes to be a  massive constituency of undecided Christians. It was launched  in Natal this week.    According to reports, Delport was disillusioned with the  NP's  weak stand on federalism and local government and was seeking a  new political home. He was due to attend a meeting of the ACDP  recently, but pulled out at the last moment. In his press  statement on Monday, Delport emphasised that voters who  supported the same principles as the NP, but who for historical  or other reasons were not ready to support the party, were not  political enemies of the NP. He said he had no intention of  resigning from the NP and stated his unequivocal support for the  NP and its leader, F.W. de Klerk.    In political circles the establishment of the ACDP is seen  as  a panic reaction by NP-supporting whites now that it has become  clear that the party is unable to make significant inroads into  the black community. Many NP members believe the decision not  to change the party's name as part of a strategy to actively  recruit black members was a fatal mistake. De Klerk, according  to observers, did not want to allow a name-change out of fear of  losing existing white support.    He believed the NP could still solicit strong black support.  This belief was echoed by the NP's election chief, Olaus van  Zyl, who at an NP press conference in Pretoria on Wednesday  argued that his party would still make huge inroads into black  communities once its message became clear.    However, a survey carried out in November and December last  year by the Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC] indicates the  opposite. Black support for the NP has dropped steadily from  July 1992 and is currently at about one percent. Comment the  HSRC pollsters: "The fall from the NP's seven to eight percent  level of support in late 1992 to the October-November 1993 level  suggests a loss of around a million African votes -- by far the  biggest element in the NP's decline over the period."    The survey confirms serious doubts within NP circles about  the party's ability to stop the ANC from achieving a landslide  victory at the polls. NP officials are worried that the ANC may  win an outright two-thirds majority, which will allow it to  rewrite the transitional constitution without opposition.    Some cabinet members support the idea of an alliance with  homeland parties like the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP],  Gazankulu's Ximoko [Whip of the Nation] Party and QwaQwa's  Dikwankwetla [strong] Party. The problem is that these parties,  with the exception of the IFP, command very little popular  support.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our colleague Bernard Hornak is on the line from an  extraordinary news conference given by Deputy Prime Minister  Roman Kovac, who has resigned from his post.    [Hornak] At the opening of his news conference, Roman Kovac  confirmed that at 0900 today he handed his resignation letter to  President Michal Kovac. He repeated the reasons for his  resignation. The main reason he gave was that he did not wish  to be the cause of increased tension in our society. Neither  did he want to see yet another wave of confrontation between the  Cabinet and the president.    Answering a question as to what in his view is the future of  the Alternative of Political Realism, Roman Kovac said that the  Alternative was formed within the HZDS [Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia]. It has proposed a certain solution to the  political crisis and has called for a return to democratic  principles. At present, those deputies who have subscribed to  the ideas of the Alternative are not changing their view.    Speaking about his future political line, Roman Kovac said  that Slovakia needs a consensus and that, at present, on the  basis of that consensus, he has held talks with the  representatives of the National-Democratic Club [of the Slovak  National Party], the Alliance of Democrats, and some  nonparliamentary parties.    This is all for the time being from the presidium of the  government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Russia's Central Bank  developed a working programme to gradually take control over  operations with hard currency effected by resident and  non-resident entrepreneurs operating in Russia.    According to materials released by the parliamentary  committee for economic policy, this programme provides for  working out appropriate standard acts to control first hard  currency proceeds and then import and barter deals, export and  import of services, as well as movement of capital.    The programme envisages tough sanctions up to non-acceptance  exaction of funds from the banks guilty of incorrect and  untimely settlements as concerns the compulsory re-sale to the  state of part of their hard currency earnings.    To make the activities of currency control bodies more  effective, the Central Bank suggests strengthening the  legislative basis, specifically taking legal actions against  those accused of violations in the currency sphere, specifying  certain provisions of the law on currency regulation and  control, to pass legislative acts allowing to sign and ratify  international agreements on currency issues.    The programme also proposes building a database of all  foreign trade shipments and payments on the basis of the Russian  State Customs Committee's computer centre in order to check  information on money and goods movement. This will make it  possible to reveal cases of underestimated export prices and  overestimated import prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Feb (TANJUG) -- After learning about the  horrific massacre at the Markale market, the Main Headquarters  of the republic of Srpska army sent an urgent demand to the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command for former  Bosnia-Herzegovina to immediately establish a mixed team of  military experts to investigate all circumstances and find the  culprits of the crime committed against the civilian population  of Sarajevo.    "Since UNPROFOR's command did not respond by 1800 as we  demanded, I made a phone call to the UNPROFOR command in  Kiseljak. General Ramsey, the chief of staff of the UNPROFOR  command for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, told me that the Muslim  side had refused to take part in the setting up of the joint  military experts team and its activities," Major General Manojlo  Milovanovic, the chief of staff of the republic of Srpska army,  stressed.    The main headquarters [of the republic of Srpska army] is  dissatisfied with the UNPROFOR command's insufficient insistence  on the Muslim side's participation, and on the need to establish  the truth and inform the world public about it, outraged and  horrified by the massacre, for which the Serbs are being accused  without any proof, the statement by the main headquarters  stresses.    Since the Muslim side refuses to take part in the work of  the  mixed commission of military experts, the main headquarters of  the republic of Srpska is convinced that they planned and  carried out the horrific massacre. Therefore, the republic of  Srpska army categorically refutes and does not accept any  involvement or responsibility for the serious crime. The  UNPROFOR command has rejected [the proposal] that UNPROFOR's  chief of staff and the chief of staff of the so-called  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, together with the chief of staff of the  republic of Srpska army, go to the scene of the crime together  and investigate the consequences and circumstances of the  tragedy, the statement says.</p>

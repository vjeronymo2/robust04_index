			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PEERY'S RETURN PROVIDES SPARK FOR CANYON  </P> <P> The Canyon High offense, which had sputtered during much of September, was  purring like a kitten against Notre Dame on Friday night, thanks in part to a  not-so-little addition.  </P> <P> That addition was 214-pound running back Chris Peery, who played his first game  after undergoing groin surgery before the season began.  </P> <P> Peery, who got clearance to play from his doctor at 4 p.m. Friday and played in  only the second half, gained 69 yards in 13 carries and scored twice to help  lift Canyon to its first win of the season, a 45-29 win at Canyon.  </P> <P> "I just think it gives the team more confidence," Peery said of his comeback.  "It was an all-out effort but I'm a little out of shape."  </P> <P> Cowboys Coach Harry Welch noticed as much.  </P> <P> "He can't move. He's bending over and gasping for air," Welch said.  </P> <P> The final four minutes of the game was enough to leave Notre Dame fans in need  of oxygen.  </P> <P> With 3:57 to play, Peery scored from the five-yard line to cap a 10-play,  80-yard drive that used up 5 minutes and 36 seconds of the fourth quarter.  Chris Wilson, who replaced the injured Steve Mann in the second half, kicked  the conversion to give Canyon a 38-29 lead.  </P> <P> On the third play of the ensuing drive, Notre Dame tailback Errol Small fumbled  at his own 41 and the ball was recovered by Canyon's Vince Nevieux.  </P> <P> On the next play, quarterback Tim Beidle's pass was intercepted by Guillermo  Eguez at the 29.  </P> <P> Notre Dame quarterback Greg Andrachick created the third turnover in less than  a minute when his pass was intercepted by Scott Blade at the 40.  </P> <P> Five plays later, Beidle scored the final touchdown, from the 10.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (3-1) trailed, 24-14, at halftime but came out hot in the third  quarter. The Knights stopped Canyon (1-2-1) on fourth and two at the Cowboys'  23 and scored four plays later on an 11-yard run by Fano Malieitulua.  </P> <P> Canyon answered with a lengthy drive that ended on a two-yard Peery touchdown  dive with 3:04 to play in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "They controlled the first half with (receiver Clint) Beauer and the second  with Peery," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said.  </P> <P> Beauer, who scored two first-half touchdowns, caught five passes for 121 yards.  </P> <P> After Peery's touchdown, the Knights battled back with a 73-yard drive. On a  fourth-and-goal play, Small, who finished with a game-high 127 rushing yards in  22 carries, crashed in from the one. Andrachick hit Malieitulua on a conversion  pass to trim the deficit to 31-29.  </P> <P> Canyon, which took a quick 14-0 lead, increased the margin to 17 points with  5:18 to play in the first half when Beidle dumped a short pass across the  middle to Beauer, who cut to the sideline, broke up the field and outran the  Notre Dame secondary for a 56-yard score. Mann's kick made the score 24-7.  </P> <P> A scrambling Andrachick hit Matt Henry with a scoring pass for Notre Dame 55  seconds before intermission to draw the Knights within 10, 24-14.  </P></p>

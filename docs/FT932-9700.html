			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts on Sainsbury DIY talk RETAIL specialists were mostly sceptical of rumours in the market yesterday that J. Sainsbury was considering buying the Do It All interests of WH Smith. Sainsbury already owns the profitable Homebase DIY business and is known to have been looking for well-placed sites. One stores analyst said he believed that Sainsbury may have approached Smith to purchase selected stores, but that talk of a full-scale offer was probably wide of the mark. Smith owns the Do It All chain in a joint venture with Boots. The business has suffered as the recession has squeezed margins in the highly competitive sector and analysts had pencilled in losses of around Pounds 28m for this year. While Smith had been considered by the market as the more reluctant partner in the venture, many specialists had been predicting a buyout by Boots as the most likely development. It was also pointed out that the drugs group has first refusal on any deal by Smith and was not likely to want to swap one partner for another. Nor, it was argued, was it in keeping with Sainsbury's strategy to buy a 50 per cent stake in a rival business. Finally, a Sainsbury offer for a stake in a heavily indebted group such as Do It All would be seen as bad for its own shares; in fact, they rose yesterday, closing 13 ahead at 481p in 4.1m turnover. NatWest Markets, Henderson Crosthwaite and Panmure Gordon were recommending the stock ahead of today's full year results. Boots held at 439p and WH Smith 'A' shed 7 to 458p.</p>

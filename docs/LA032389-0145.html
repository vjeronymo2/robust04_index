			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER CUTBACK TO BE ASKED OF 600,000 OVER 4 DAYS  </P> <P> About 600,000 residents of areas scattered from Brea to El Toro will be asked  to cut back their water use starting Monday as the county shuts down a key  water-processing station for improvements.  </P> <P> Regions affected are the canyon areas of Brea and Yorba Linda, the eastern  portions of the cities of Orange and Tustin, the northern half of Irvine, the  city of Mission Viejo and the communities of Laguna Niguel, El Toro and Lake  Forest.  </P> <P> The 4-day closure will allow modifications to increase the efficiency of the  Robert B. Diemer Filtration Plant. The plant normally pumps about 400 million  gallons of water a day to local water districts, which in turn distribute to  county residents, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work Rescheduling Asked  </P> <P> Residents will be asked to curtail their normal water usage starting Monday  evening and ending Thursday. During that time, residents will be asked not to  water their lawns or gardens or wash their cars. They also will be asked to  reduce water usage for washing clothes and dishes.  </P> <P> Local construction companies have been asked to reschedule some work.  </P> <P> Officials of the Orange County Municipal Water District said the 25-year-old  plant must be upgraded because of booming growth in the south county. The plant  will get a new chlorination device, water pumps and several new reservoir  gates, increasing water-processing capacity by 25%.  </P> <P> Repair crews will work day and night on the project. Service should be restored  to normal by noon Thursday, according to Stanley Sprague, water district  general manager.  </P> <P> During the shutdown, the communities will continued to receive water from two  Metropolitan Water District plants in Los Angeles County, Weymuth in La Verne  and Jensen in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Additional supplies of water will come from area ground water reserves and in  part from small reserve tanks that are normally used as a backup in case of  natural disasters, according to Timothy H. Skrove, a spokesman for the  district.  </P></p>

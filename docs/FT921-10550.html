			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Activities that distort earnings SOME engineering companies are using Britain's ambiguous accounting standards to boost their earnings per share figures, a research report from Williams de Broe, the brokers, suggests. It concludes that some UK engineering groups are 'smoothing' their earnings in a way that does not fairly reflect trading performance, although it stresses that none is contravening accounting standards. Mr Mustapha Omar, an engineering analyst, highlights a series of activities which distort earnings in the companies. TI Group had made sizeable provisions over the last few years to allow it to restructure companies that it has acquired. It writes off these costs against the balance sheet and feeds them back over a period of up to four years. It is unclear how these sums allocated for restructuring are spent. De Broe estimates that TI will have Pounds 25m to spend in 1992 and beyond which will make it difficult to determine the company's underlying profitability. TI's depreciation rates on plant, machinery and equipment - at 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent - are about half the sector average of 16 per cent. Even when weighted to reflect the type of assets held within this range, de Broe estimates that TI's depreciation is still 12.5 per cent. This has the effect of increasing pre-tax profits for 1990 by Pounds 8.3m above the level that would be generated if the sector average was used. Siebe has gradually been capitalising more of its research and development costs, including prototype costs and computer software, and extending the period over which they are written off. Prototype costs have risen as a result from nil in 1988 to Pounds 33.3m in 1991. British Aerospace makes substantial provisions in the balance sheet on acquisitions which can later release to the profit and loss account to help boost earnings. For example, in 1990 it released Pounds 130m in provisions, which converted operating losses of Pounds 44m against Rover into profits of Pounds 55m. However, Mr Michael Garner, finance director at TI, said the analysis was 'pretty extreme'. He stressed that comparisons between the different companies were difficult because of the nature of their business. TI, he said, had slower depreciation rates because it was less capital-intensive than many of its counter-parts. He added that the group would be disclosing its provisions on pensions from next year, which would make the accounts clearer.</p>

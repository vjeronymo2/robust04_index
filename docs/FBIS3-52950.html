The brother Presidential Council chairman attended part of  their eminences the 'ulema's meeting in al-Janad. He delivered  a speech in which he said he was pleased to attend this meeting,  which encompasses a group of their eminences the 'ulema, in  response to the invitation they extended to him and to brother  'Ali Salim al-Bid to meet on this great day in which the Muslim  world celebrates a glorious Muslim occasion [Prophet Muhammad's  night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem].    He said: How I wished that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid was  here in order to work together to preserve the great achievement  of unity that reunited the Yemeni family after its estrangement  and ended our people's nightmare of division.    The brother Presidential Council chairman said: We have come  here to protect our homeland and spare our people the sedition  hatched by those who do not wish to see them enjoy [word  indistinct], security, and stability. Our responsibility toward  God and our people dictates that we should rise above trivial  things and give priority to the supreme national interest.    The Presidential Council chairman urged the brother 'ulema  to  say what is right and to stand against evil and (?those who  fabricate seditions), intensify them, and benefit from their  continuation.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> NBC News President Michael Gartner announced Wednesday that his unit has  undergone a "major restructuring" aimed at increasing efficiency. Miami bureau  chief Donald Browne has been named "executive news director," overseeing all  bureaus, correspondents and producers and coordinating coverage for all NBC  News programs. Browne will report jointly to Gartner and senior vice presidents  Joe Angotti in New York and Timothy Russert in Washington. The changes do not  affect anchor Tom Brokaw, who remains managing editor of "NBC Nightly News." In  a statement, Gartner said the restructuring was aimed at eliminating  duplication of effort that will "make life easier for correspondents and  producers in the field and producers and writers on the programs." Gartner also  gave "Today" show director George Paul additional duties overseeing the on-air  look of NBC News programs. Bob Keyes, director of news planning, was named  director of news operations and will serve as Gartner's special assistant. "NBC  Nightly News" has been in third place in the news ratings for more than a year,  and NBC remains the only network with no prime-time news programming, though  the new "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" is slated for later this year.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Obrenovac, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- We are not abandoning  Serb citizens in Sarajevo, nor are their lives in danger due to  the withdrawal of a part of the heavy weaponry from a zone of 20  kilometers surrounding Sarajevo, the prime minister of the  Srpska republic, Vladimir Lukic, has told Radio Obrenovac [local  radio in Serbia].    Another part of the weaponry will be placed under UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] control; therefore, the reason for NATO  air strikes no longer exists, prime minister Lukic said.    Replying to the question of when the Russian UNPROFOR  soldiers could be expected to arrive in Sarajevo, Lukic did not  specify the time but said that their deployment along frontlines  would be an opportunity for the world finally to understand that  it is not only one side -- the Muslims -- that care about peace.</p>

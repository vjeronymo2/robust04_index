			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Market profitability, not capital, the real issue for Lloyd's to confront Sir, As one of the dwindling number of Lloyd's Names, I have no small interest in the work of the Lloyd's task force and in ensuring that the flagship of the London market remains afloat. The report proved a good read and represents a creditable assembly of the many facts and possible proposals anyone responsible for governance at Lloyd's ought to know. None the less, the report was a real disappointment, concentrating as it did on suppressing the symptoms of Lloyd's problems rather than addressing their causes. For example, it is suggested that corporate membership should be introduced to replace Lloyd's declining capital backing from individual Names. This misses the point. Capital has been lost or withdrawn by Names owing to the negative or unsatisfactory return they have suffered. It is difficult to see how corporate members, required to have three times the capital backing of individual Names, could be attracted at all in the current environment. Moreover, even if corporations could be attracted, many of Lloyd's clients will take little comfort from the experience of the ill-fated New York Insurance Exchange, which collapsed on the back of corporate membership. It is market profitability, rather than capital, which is the real issue. The strength of Lloyd's does not lie in its absolute size, but rather in an entrepreneurial and innovative system capable of attracting profitable international business. It is true that the size and potential severity of the business involved requires a collective market to syndicate each risk. However, this market goes beyond Lloyd's and, consequently, so should the task force's recommendations aimed at restoring profitability. Recommended changes in tax treatment of reserves and in broker behaviour require the support and involvement of the broader London market. It is characteristic of its introspection that the Lloyd's task force report focuses on complicated restructuring within Lloyd's, requiring many years and parliamentary intervention to implement, rather than the broader issues of market practices and profitability, where positive action could be taken immediately.

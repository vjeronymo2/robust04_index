			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Observer: New European Only an eternal optimist would think that the events of the past few days make an ideal backdrop for the relaunch of yet another pan-European venture. However, John Drew, who headed the UK office of the EC Commission until a few months ago, is one such. As director designate of Europa Times, a monthly which claims to be Europe's largest circulation English language newspaper, Drew has big plans. The paper, which has been going for a year, is bankrolled by Felix Grovit, a Brussels-based business man who has made a fortune out of his 100-plus network of bureaux de change in 11 countries. Since it is handed out free, a circulation figure of half a million readers has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But its owner, who was said to be interested in buying The European at one stage, feels the time is ripe for expansion and Drew is the man for the job. Drew, who is already visiting professor of European management at the Open University and president of the Institute of Linguists, promises to give the new venture his best shot. Having spent his whole career trying to get the European message across, he says that there is nothing wrong with the concept, it's simply been put over badly.</p>

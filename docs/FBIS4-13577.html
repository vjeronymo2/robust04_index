			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Christopher and al-'Aqabah Siege"] </F>   [Text] We would have liked to welcome more warmly U.S.  Secretary of State's statements describing his country's  relations with Jordan as excellent, and to be more confident  about the promises and proposals that the U.S. secretary is  carrying regarding the naval siege imposed on the Port of  al-'Aqabah. However, what we have heard from the U.S. secretary  and other U.S. Administration officials on the siege does not  encourage anyone to be optimistic about this U.S. commodity,  which no longer has a market in Jordan. Jordan has suffered from  contradiction between the U.S. words and deeds, and between talk  and practical moves.    Jordan has become fed up with the U.S. double standards, and  this caused His Majesty King Husayn to openly announce that,  henceforth, our country's effective participation in the peace  process depends on how serious the U.S. commitments are  concerning lifting the unjust siege on Jordan's sole port.    Yesterday, the U.S. warships in the Gulf of Aqaba turned  back  a ship full of paper imported for the Jordanian press. This  makes us even more doubtful about these U.S. statements; that  is, unless the Clinton administration has reconsidered its  calculations and concluded that it is unreasonable and  unacceptable to continue sponsoring the peace process on the one  hand, and imposing a siege on a country that is very strongly  and honestly committed to the peace process on the other.    We hope that Warren Christopher will this time have  practical  and acceptable proposals that do not harm Jordan's sovereignty  and dignity concerning all that is related to the inspection of  ships heading to the Port of al-'Aqabah. We also hope that the  U.S. secretary's forthcoming visit to the Middle East will be  more successful than previous visits and that it will lead to  the aspired progress toward just and comprehensive peace in the  region.</p>

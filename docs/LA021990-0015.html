			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DRESHER'S MODERN OPERA DRAWS ON AGE-OLD THEMES  </P> <P> Funny how the next wave seems to resurrect age-old themes and archetypes. In  spite of its high-tech scenario in a biomedical laboratory, Paul Dresher's  contemporary opera "Power Failure" is yet another morality play on the  "Paradise Lost" theme. And, for all its electronic hardware and omnipresent  speakers, its musical idiom and structure paid unceasing homage to the basic  conventions of Baroque opera.  </P> <P> For Friday night's Southern California debut of "Power Failure," Dresher and  his Berkeley-based ensemble set up shop in the Spreckels Theatre, a suitably  intimate setting for his four-character opera about a research scientist, Ruth  Lehmann, who synthesizes a genetic cure-all for the diseases that plague  humanity. Predictably, the amoral drug company CEO, Charles Smithson, attempts  to suppress the discovery and sell it on a black market for the wealthy  afflicted. In this traditional view of fallen humanity, the possibility for  science to create "a heaven on Earth," as Rinde Eckert's terse but didactic  libretto reiterates, is perverted by greed, and the scientist must destroy her  miracle cure.  </P> <P> Because Dresher is a gifted melodist, his lyrical, graceful arias for each  character were the work's sturdy pillars. His few ensembles, however, were less  compelling, and the composer's inability to develop larger forms and more  complex textures muted the opera's dramatic effect. A pulsing, essentially  electronic instrumental basso continuo dominated Dresher's musical foreground,  and, although he claims to eschew the minimalist label, this aspect of his  score clearly had such a cast to it.  </P> <P> John Duykers' hefty, impressive tenor dominated the stage, as did his canny  executive impersonation, a knowing fusion of Lee Iaccoca and Robert Schuller  into a cunning, terminally smiling huckster of vapid moral uplift.  Mezzo-soprano Stephanie Friedman projected an earnest scientist, although the  musical impact of her role diminished as the opera progressed.  </P> <P> Eckert's proletarian night watchman -- actually a gumshoe manque -- benefited  from his stentorian projection, equally affecting in both his baritone and  falsetto ranges. However, his character seemed a bit too omniscient for his  role in the plot. Perhaps the audience was overly conscious that his character  was also the author's voice interpreting the piece as the opera unfolded --  hardly a compliment to the listeners' perception.  </P> <P> Soprano Thomasa Eckert used her flexible, clear voice to etch the unfortunately  modest emotional range of Judith Niles, Smithson's biographer and fantasized  love interest. Michael Olich's geometric, metallic set, with its fluorescent  lights and electronic graphics conjured the mood brilliantly, and the computer  as high altar proved a telling symbol. Larry Neff's lighting underscored the  opera's atomized, individualistic character depiction.  </P> <P> In authentic Baroque fashion, the composer directed his three other  instrumentalists (they played from each side of the stage from boxes neatly  annexed to the set) from the keyboard, although for the most part he was  playing synthesizers instead of a harpsichord. Dresher also contributed several  deft electric guitar solos, which helped quicken his overly static score.  </P> <P> Baroque opera seria flourished on a structural formula based on a string of  brilliant solo arias, but Mozart came along and proved the undeniable dramatic  strength of ensemble singing. Perhaps in writing "Pioneers," Dresher's sequel  to "Power Failure," the young composer will take a tip from Mozart.  </P></p>

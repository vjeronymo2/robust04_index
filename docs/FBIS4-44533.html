			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jin Wencheng (6855 2429 2052), Rural Economy </F> Department, State Planning Commission: "Analysis of the  Attainment of a Chinese Peasant Net Per Capita Income of 1,200  Yuan in 2000"]    [Text] Development economics maintains that growth is the  prerequisite and foundation for development. This has been  attested to in the practice of economic and social development  in every country of the world. A comparatively well-off standard  of living is a new development stage that the Chinese people  face now that the subsistence problem has been solved. It is  also the ideal and the goal of the broad masses of people for  improvement of their livelihood by 2000. Rural villages hold the  key to the whole country's attainment of a comparatively  well-off standard of living; and rise in peasant income is the  key to rural villages attainment of a comparatively well-off  standard of living. What is the minimum peasant income that must  be attained for rural villages to have a comparatively well-off  standard of living? Put another way, what is the base line for a  comparatively well-off rural standard of living? This article  seeks to make a preliminary analysis of the correlation between  increase in peasant income and a comparatively well-off peasant  standard of living, and to specify how to set a rural  comparatively well-off line.  <H5>  Preliminary Assessment of Peasant Income Situation </H5>   (1) Substantial Increase in Peasant Real Income.  Within the short space of little more than a decade, peasant net  per capita income has continuously increased first from 200 to  400, and then to 600 yuan. Income growth, which formerly derived  primarily from farming, now comes from a combination of farming,  livestock breeding and aquaculture, and from the all-around  development of farming, industry, and business.    Changes in production methods have spurred the development  of  agriculture. Outputs of principal farm products have increased.  Not only do they satisfy the production and livelihood needs of  the broad masses of peasants, but large surpluses greatly  accelerate the commercialization of agriculture. At the same  time, the broad masses of peasants have been freed from the  shackles of traditional agriculture in active response to the  new development of rural commodity markets. While producing  grain and cotton according to national plan, they strive to open  new production avenues and ways to increase income through the  development of economic diversification. In 1978, peasant net  per capita income was only 134 yuan; by 1980, it increased to  nearly 200 yuan. This increase in peasant per capita income  within two years was equal to the net increase in peasant per  capita income for the entire 24 year period from 1954 to 1978.  The increase from 200 to 400 yuan took only five years (1980  -1985), and the increase from 400 to 600 yuan took four years  (1985-1989). In 1990, peasant net per capita income reached 686  yuan for a 2.6 fold increase over 1980. After deducting for  price increases, this was an average annual 6.3 percent  increase. The entire 1980s was the decade of fastest rural  economic development, and it was also the decade in which  peasant net per capita income increased fastest, and in which  peasant living conditions improved most.    Rural economic development changed the sources of income  growth. In 1978, prior to rural reform, rural society's  production activities were largely under leadership of people's  communes and consisted primarily of the growing of staple farm  crops such as grain and cotton. Rural commodity production and  commodity business had no place; the peasants engaged solely in  agricultural production; their net per capita income derived  almost entirely from agricultural production; and the income  from agricultural production derived, in turn, from the rural  collectives' equal distribution. In 1978, when peasant net per  capita income was 134 yuan, more than 80 percent of it came from  agricultural production. Operating system reforms centering  around the output-related contract responsibility system, and a  series of reform policies that the state adopted in order to  spur rural commodity production and commodity exchange greatly  aroused the interest of the broad masses of peasants in rural  commodity production and circulation. With the fairly rapid  growth in gross output of farm products, rural secondary and  tertiary industries also began to boom, and sources of peasant  income also diversified. Now, income came not only from unified  collective farming but also from family farming that the  peasants did themselves. It came not only from farming, but also  from secondary and tertiary industries for a change of pattern  in which agricultural production and non-agricultural production  were equally important. Comparison of the late 1980's with the  late 1970's showed that income from uniform collective farming  as a percentage of peasant net per capita income had declined  from 60 to about 9 percent, and income from peasant household  activities had increased from 30 to 83 percent. Income derived  from agriculture fell from 81 to 63 percent; and income from  other than agriculture rose from 8 to 28 percent. The portion of  peasant net per capita income increase derived from other than  agriculture increased markedly, rising 23 percentage points.  Meanwhile, during the same period, the portion of income derived  from agricultural production declined 17 percentage points.    (2) Marked Widening of the Peasant Income Distribution  Gap Encouraging some people to become rich first is an  important policy that both the party and government have  consistently advocated during the new era. This policy has  played a tremendous role in encouraging "capable people" in  rural villages to come forward, which had advanced development  of the rural commodity economy. Accompanying economic growth  has been a marked trend toward differentiation among individual  peasants, peasant families, and the economy of different  regions. The economic gap between one person and another,  between one peasant family and another, and between one region  and another has been readjusted, resources being reallocated.  While adhering to unflagging implementation of plans and  policies for "some people becoming rich first," one must also  realize that a widening trend exists in the rural peasant income  gap.    1. Widening of the income gap among different peasants. The  Gini coefficient is commonly used internationally as an  indicator for judging the degree of income equilibrium. The Gini  coefficient's numerical value lies between 0 and 1. A numerical  value of 0 means absolute balance; a numerical value of 1 means  absolute imbalance. The greater the numerical value the greater  the imbalance in income. State Statistical Bureau research data  show that in China's rural villages, the Gini coefficient may be  divided into four areas: "Below 0.2 shows high balance; 0.2-0.3  shows relative balance; 0.3-0.4 shows equitable distribution;  and above 4 shows a fairly large gap." In 1980. the Gini  coefficient for peasant income was 0.24; in 1985, it was 0.26;  and in 1990, it rose further to 0.31. The entire 1980s was a  period in which peasant income was relatively equal and  developing toward rational distribution. The income gap among  different peasants has changed from the former not very great  difference toward marked difference. For the broad masses of  peasants who have "shared poverty and wealth," and egalitarianly  "eaten out of a large common pot" for so long, facing up to the  present reality is rather painful. Furthermore, since an  overwhelming majority of those peasants who have become rich  first did so not by just growing grain and cotton, or by  developing agricultural production but by developing industrial  sideline occupations, by engaging in commodity circulation, or  by going off to work elsewhere, this has somewhat intensified  the disgruntlement of grain and cotton growing peasants. In  1990, peasant household income for the country as a whole  exhibited an "inverted U" pattern. Needy households having a net  per capita income of less than 300 yuan numbered 8.59 percent;  households having a net per capita income of between 300 and  1,000 yuan numbered approximately 73.63 percent; and high income  households having a net per capita income of more than 1,000  yuan numbered 17.78 percent.    2. Regional differences exhibited a widening trend. Natural,  historical, and geographic factors produced an eastern, central,  and western zone pattern of rural economic development. As the  gap in the overall economic development of the three zones  widened during the 1980s, regional differences in peasant net  per capita income showed a widening trend. In 1980, the peasant  net per capita income ratio of the eastern, central, and western  economic zones was 1.39:1.11:1 (taking the western zone as 1).  In 1985, it was 1.54:1.21:1; and in 1991, it widened further to  1.71:1.06:1.    In terms of income category, widening of the difference  between the highest income provinces and the lowest income  provinces was even more marked. In 1980, the ratio of the  highest income to the lowest income was 2.79:1. By 1990, it  widened to 4.71:1. Simultaneous with the widening of the income  gap between one region and another, even within the same region  differences in income also exhibited a widening trend  attributable to differences in the geographical environment,  differences in the level of organization and management, and  differences in technology and human resources. Even in the  relatively developed eastern region, as the pace of economic  development quickened, a "relative hardship situation in  economic development" occurred in some areas. In the central and  western regions, such hardship situations might be considered  comparatively well-off or rich. According to data from Zhejiang  Province, Yinxian County in Ningbo, which ranked nineteenth  among the 100 strongest counties in the country, the gross  industrial output value of some towns such as Wuxiang,  Jiangshan, and Gulin reached 500 million yuan, and even as much  as 1 billion yuan, yet the output value of some other towns was  less than 100 million yuan. Net per capita income there was as  high as more than 2,000 yuan, and as low as only 600 yuan. Among  villages, differences were even greater. The gross output value  of industry and agriculture in villages that had developed  rapidly was more than 100 million. In slowly developing  villages, it was less than 100 million, and some places were  insolvent. The regional economic returns gap became the force  behind the shift of surplus rural manpower out of these areas.  The greater the gap became, the stronger the impetus for rural  manpower to flow into developed areas. Inevitably this produced  transportation and employment strains, which increased developed  areas' development pressures, and sapped undeveloped areas  development vitality.    3. Steady Widening of the Gap Between Cities and the  Countryside. In order to hasten industrialization, ever since  the founding of the people's republic the government has pursued  a "price scissors" policy in agriculture and rural villages,  which has widened the differences between city and countryside.  Prior to 1980, the government instituted a low wages system for  city staff members and workers, and practiced an egalitarian  "work points system" form of distribution in rural villages, so  the difference between city and rural wages was not great, nor  were the historical differences between city and countryside  much improved. During the early 1980s, city and town residents'  income was about 1.8 times peasant income. Rural reform and  decontrol, and rural economic development further narrowed the  difference between city and countryside. Between 1980 and 1984,  city and town residents' income increased 6.2 percent each year  while peasant earnings increased by an annual 16.7 percent,  thereby narrowing the gap between cities and the countryside by  5.6 percent. City and town residents' income was 1.7 times  peasant income. However, after 1985, the ratio between city and  countryside residents' income changed, city and town resident's  income continuing to increase faster than peasant income. In  1985, city and town residents' income grew 1.6 percentage points  faster than peasant income, but in 19.86 it increased 14.9  percentage points, and by 1990, the gap between city and  countryside income widened from the 1.8:1 of 1982 to 2.2:1. The  income gap was just one evidence of the gap between city and  countryside. An even greater difference existed between city and  countryside social welfare and social security. Peasant advances  in education, medical care, housing, and employment derived  mostly from the peasants themselves and the rural collective  economy, but in cities, they came largely from state financial  support. For the broad masses of peasants who had only just  extricated themselves from poverty and achieved a subsistence  standard of living, fine education and medical care could only  be dreams.    (3) Overall Peasant Income Level Still Fairly Low  Proper assessment of the peasants' income situation is a  prerequisite and the foundation for a correct evaluation of the  rural economic situation leading to formulation of rural  economic policy. Since the advent of reform and opening to the  outside world, peasant income has risen substantially, the  standard of living has improved markedly, and a large number of  "upper income people" have appeared. The number of peasant  households having an annual net per capita income of more than  2,000 yuan went from zero in the early 1980s to around 4.7  million, or about 22.5 million people. The appearance of rural  "upper income people" generated a misconception in society.  Seemingly, all the peasants had become wealthy. Actually, these  "upper income people" accounted for only 2.11 percent of all  peasant households, or about 2.51 percent of the rural  population nationwide. They were an extremely small minority in  rural villages. Overall, peasant households making a net per  capita income of between 300 and 1,000 yuan per year were the  largest percentage. Peasant net per capita income differs from  city and town residents' income. It has its own distinctive  character. First, peasant income is seasonal. Most of peasant  net per capita income comes from agricultural production, and  the seasonality of agricultural production means that peasants'  income is seasonal. However, city and town residents' income is  mostly wage and salary income obtained monthly. Second, some  peasant income is spent for productive purposes. The income that  peasants obtain not only has to be used for their own  consumption, but also for family-run reproduction activities. By  contrast, city and town residents' income is used largely for  consumption and savings. In addition, the payments they make for  housing and medical care as part of consumption are affected by  the national welfare system. For the same level of support they  pay less than the peasants pay. Therefore, in judging the amount  of peasant income, one must pay attention mostly to the amount  of income remaining after the peasants take care of their  subsistence needs.    Survey data verify that after deducting peasant consumer  spending, the peasants have only enough income left to maintain  simple reproduction. Therefore, the overall peasant income level  remains fairly low. Actually, in 1990, peasant per capita living  expenses were 585 yuan, 13 yuan lower than their theoretical  expenditures. One sensible explanation for this is that in order  to sustain and develop agricultural reproduction, the peasants  cut back on immediate consumption to increase investment in  production and savings.  <H5>  2. Increased Income Is the Key to a Rural Comparatively </H5> Well-Off Standard of Living    The journey from a subsistence to a comparatively well-off  standard of living is a historical development process. During  this historical advance, as the people's standard of living  rises, consumer ideas and consumer demand changes  correspondingly. Once subsistence problems have been solved,  peasant income is elevated to the main position in the weighing  of rural economic development objectives.    (1) Increasing the agricultural work force's returns is  the main line in development of the rural economy during the  1990s. If one says that increasing outputs of main  agricultural products was the main line in development of the  rural economy prior to the 1980s, then the main line in  development of the rural economy during the 1990s is increasing  the returns of workers in all rural trades and industries. 1)  This stems from the way in which agriculture develops during the  new era. The efforts made during the 1980s largely solved the  subsistence problems of the people in rural villages and  throughout the country as a whole. Not only do outputs of the  main agricultural products satisfy the needs of the people of  the whole country, but a certain amount of surplus has appeared.  People's consumption patterns have also changed qualitatively,  so the main emphasis in agriculture has shifted from quantity to  quality. Changes in the development of agriculture mean that  agriculture must follow a course in which its survival depends  on the returns it provides, and its development depends on the  quality it provides. During the 1990s, economic returns will  become the most direct motivation for the broad masses of  peasants to work in agriculture. 2) The rural socialist market  economy system makes this so. During the 1980s, enormous  successes were scored in development of the rural economy. These  provided the basic framework for the rural socialist market  economy system. The rural reform that began during the end of  the 1970s enabled the broad masses of peasants to take the lead  in becoming urban workers. They gained the right to select their  own employment, becoming relatively free professionals. Because  of the too large a number of peasants engaged in agriculture,  large numbers "went south," "went north," or "headed west" where  they engaged in non-agricultural activities, thereby forming a  large nationwide rural manpower market. This lay a foundation  for founding of the rural market economy system. A fundamental  reason for the substantial development of the rural commodity  economy during the 1980s was the state's planned decontrol of  agricultural product markets, gradually reducing and eliminating  fixed national prices for some agricultural products. The state  eliminated the centralized procurement and assignment  procurement system, replacing it with state fixed procurement  and free buying and selling in markets. By 1990, except for some  grain and cotton prices that the state continued to set, the  marekt mechanism determined an overwhelming majority of  agricultural product prices. The prosperity and development of  rural markets spurred an increase in the degree to which rural  villages became commodity economies and money economies. By  1990, the commodity rate for agricultural and sideline products  reached 62.9 percent, up 8.5 percentage points from 1980.  Peasant cash receipts and expenditures also rose from 53.5  percent in 1980 to 76 percent in 1989, a 22.5 percentage point  increase. Money became the main medium through which the  peasants sustained and developed production and their  livelihood, and commodity production became the most direct goal  of peasant production. (3) Necessity for consolidating the  worker-peasant alliance. The peasants' interests have always  been the main factor in rural and social development whether  during land reform or in the rural reforms of the 1980s.  "Adjustment and protection of the peasants' interests are  implicit motivations in rural reform and the development of  agricultural productivity." Adjustment and protection of the  peasants' interests, and narrowing the differences between city  and countryside are the foundation for consolidation of the  worker-peasant alliance, and they are also objective  requirements for building a distinctively Chinese brand of  socialism. Without rural development, development of the urban  economy, and even the entire national economy, is unimaginable.  Unless the peasants, who account for 80 percent of the country's  total population, achieve a comparatively well-off standard of  living, the people of the whole country cannot achieve a  comparatively well-off standard of living. Unless the far-flung  rural villages attain a comparatively well-off standard of  living, a comparatively well-off standard of living in cities is  difficult to imagine. Widening of the gap between city and  countryside is a most direct and most glaring indication of the  widening of the gap between city and countryside residents'  income. Not only does this affect the stability of rural  society, but also will have a serious impact on urban life. The  uneven development manifested in the decline of rural villages  and the one-sided prosperity of cities that has occurred in the  industrialization process in developed capitalist countries,  which has not only restricted further development of the  national economy but also has given rise to serious social  problems should be heeded.    (2) The key indicator of a comparatively well-off  standard of living is peasant net per capita income. A  comparatively well-off standard of living is a new stage of  development that the Chinese people face following complete  solution to their subsistence problem. It is a development phase  that must be gone through on the way from subsistence to wealth.  It is an objective necessity for realizing the second strategic  objective of national economic and social development during the  1990s. The goal of attaining a comparatively well-off standard  of living is a comprehensive socio-economic development goal  that includes the economy, the society, and the environment.  Peasant net per capita income is an important indicator listed  in the rural comparatively well-off standard of living indicator  system that all jurisdictions and departments concerned have put  forward. Its weighting ranks it first among all indicators.  Increase in peasant income is a prerequisite and the foundation  for rural attainment of a comparatively well-off standard of  living. Increase in peasant income lays a solid material  foundation for a rise in peasant productive capacity and  consumer purchasing power. It also gives impetus to early  realization of other indicators of a comfortably well-of  standard of living. Nevertheless, peasant income increase is  only a requirement for realization of a comparatively well-off  standard of living. Economic growth does not always bring an  increase in social welfare and social progress, and economic  growth frequently occasions economic phenomena such as  environmental pollution and relative poverty. It may also  occasion a loss of social precepts and ethics.  <H5>  A Peasant Net Per Capita Income of 1,200 Yuan Is a Basic </H5> Requirement for Rural Attainment of a Comparatively Well-Off  Standard of Living    Proposal of a Rural Comparatively Well-Off Line.  The idea of a rural comparatively well-off line means that  peasant net per capita income has reached the minimum limit for  being comparatively well-off. This is to say that peasant net  per capita income must at least reach a certain standard value  in order to realize a comparatively well-off rural standard of  living.    1. The national rural comparatively well-off line is 1,200  yuan per capita. Currently, society has two opinions about a  comparatively well-off rural standard of living. One is  represented primarily by the State Statistical Bureau, which  holds that in 2000 the rural comparatively well-off line will be  1,100 yuan, figured at 1990 prices. This is 414 yuan more than  the 686 yuan of 1990, an annual 4.8 percent increase. The other  is represented primarily by the State Planning Commission, which  maintains that the rural comparatively well-off line in 2000  will be 1,200 yuan figured at 1990 prices. This is 514 yuan more  than in 1990 for an annual 5.8 percent increase. We feel that  1,200 yuan as a rural comparatively well-off line is about  right. 1) A look at requirements for a rural comparatively  well-off standard of living suggests that the rural Engels'  coefficient will have to fall below 50 percent for rural  villages to attain a comparatively well-off standard of living.  For peasant per capita consumption expenditures to reach about  1,000 yuan, peasant net per capita income will have to reach at  least 1,200 yuan. 2) A look at possibilities for rural economic  development suggests that the main sources of increase in  peasant income will be agricultural production and the  development of rural township and town enterprises. According to  an analysis of data for the 12 year period 1979-1990, increase  in peasant net per capita income was very much related to the  gross output value of agriculture and the number of people  employed in township and town enterprises. Is agricultural  production and the development of township and town enterprises  up to the heavy task of bringing the rural comparatively  well-off line up to 1,200 yuan? The answer is affirmative. In  view of the requirements of the 10-year plan for rural economic  development and of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, by 2000, the gross  output value of agriculture will increase more than 4 percent  each year. The gross output value of township and town  enterprises will increase 11 percent, soaking up 47.45 million  rural laborers in 10 years and bringing the number employed in  such enterprises to 140 million in a 51.1 percent increase over  1990, a 4.2 percent annual rate of increase. Without taking  price factors into account, the gross output value of  agriculture will increase 4 percent each year; thus, peasant net  per capita income will increase 3.12 percent each year, i.e., a  cumulative 37.4 percent in 10 years. A 4.2 percent annual  increase in the number of people employed in township and town  enterprises will mean a 0.77 percent annual increase in peasant  net per capita income, i.e., a cumulative 7.96 percent in 10  years. All in all, at the planned speed of increase, by 2000  peasant net per capita income will increase 45.4 percent to 997  yuan through the development of agricultural production and  expansion of employment in other than agriculture. This is 83.1  percent of the rural comparatively well-off line, somewhat more  than 200 yuan short of the requirement for a rural comparatively  well-off standard of living. Moreover, the gap can be narrowed  only by accelerating the pace of economic development. For the  people of the whole country and the broad masses of peasants to  attain a comparatively well-off standard of living by the end of  the present century, the speed of rural economic development  swill have to be increased. The development speed that the "10  Year Plan and the Eight Five-Year Plan propose will have to be  amended. Following the high speed development of the 1980s,  agricultural production gradually entered a mature stage during  which economic growth was flat and in which maintenance of 4  percent growth was about right. Following three years of  improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic  order between 1989 and 1991, the speed of development picked up  somewhat. Under the policy of accelerting development,  development speed should have been somewhat faster, and manpower  shuold have been absorbed faster too. Preliminary calculations  show that at an annual 25 percent increase in the value of  township and town enterprises (i.e., 14 percentage points higher  than the 11 percent of the original plan), the township and town  enterprise annual rate of employment increase should reach 9.55  percent, boosting the peasant annual net per capita income rate  of increase by 1.75 percentage points. When increased income  from the development of agriculture is added in, the peasant net  per capita income rate of increase rises 4.87 percentage points,  i.e., a 10 year cumulative 60.9 percent increase, peasant net  per capita income reaching more than 1,100 yuan. The income that  laborers obtain through direct production activities comes to  91.7 percent of the rural comparatively well-off line. The  remaining approximately 9 percent can be obtained through other  nonproduction activities. (3) The trend of historical  development shows that after deducting for price increases,  agricultural production increased 6.3 percent during the 1980s,  a speed higher than necessary to reach the rural comparatively  well-off line. Township and town enterprise growth reached 30.5  percent, including the relatively slow 25 percent speed of  growth during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. This was also  higher than or equal to the speed of growth required to reach  the rural comparatively well-off line. An increase in peasant  net per capita income from 686 yuan in 1990 to 1,200 yuan in  2000, a 5.8 percent annual increase but still lower than the 63  percent growth of the 1980s, is realizable with effort.    2. The comparatively well-off line in high income areas is  1,500 yuan. For middle income areas, it is 1,200 yuan, and for  low income areas it is 1,000 yuan. The area divisions used in  this article are based on China's actual rural development. The  division is based on the peasant mean net per capita income data  for each province for 1990 and 1991. The two year mean, which  eliminates annual peculiarities, increases the credibility of  the regional division.    The whole country is divided into three categories. In the  first, peasant net per capita income ranges between 800 and  2,000 yuan. This applies to eight provinces (or municipalities),  including Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Tianjin, Guangdong,  Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Fujian (ranked by income from high to  low, and the same applies hereinafter). In these eight provinces  (or municipalities), the peasant mean net per capita income is  1,162 yuan, which is close to the national average rural  comparatively well-off line. These three areas are concentrated  in three large cities and developed coastal areas. In the second  category, peasant net per capita income is between 600 and 800  yuan. This applies to 12 provinces (or autonomous regions),  including Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Hainan, Xinjiang,  Jiangxi, Tibet, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Hebei, and Inner  Mongolia. In these 12 provinces or autonomous regions, the  peasant mean net per capita income is 687 yuan, which is equal  to the peasant net per capita income nationwide in 1990. An  overwhelming majority of these provinces (or autonomous regions)  are principal grain and cotton growing areas. They are  representative of agricultural provinces nationwide. In the  third category, peasant net per capita income runs between 400  and 600 yuan. This applies to 10 provinces or autonomous regions  including Shanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Shaanxi,  Anhui, Guizhou, and Gansu. The peasant mean net per capita  income for these 10 provinces or autonomous regions is 531 yuan.  Most of these areas are concentrated in large agricultural  provinces throughout the county, and in poorly developed areas  of western and southwestern China. This includes Guizhou and  Gansu province in which peasant net per capita income has not  yet reached 500 yuan. At 450 and 439 yuan respectively, this is  the lowest level in the country.    One cannot directly determine the separate area rural  comparatively well-off line by using the peasant mean net per  capita income. An evaluation of purchasing power is also needed  to eliminate the effect of area price differences. A so-called  purchasing power evaluation means readjusting the income of  different areas by using a standard purchasing power to make  incomes more comparable. The income of the second category  regions, which corresponds to the national average may serve as  the standard purchasing power.    Rural monetary purchasing power and the rural retail price  index show a reciprocal correlation. As the price index rises,  purchasing power declines; as the price index declines,  purchasing power rises. In order to eliminate the effect of  prices insofar as possible when evaluating purchasing power,  selection of 1978 as the base year for the rural price index is  rather appropriate inasmuch as rural reform began in 1978. Prior  to 1978 (including 1978) China practiced a low wage, low price,  and limited rural commodity economy development policy whereby  the rural price level differed greatly from place to place  throughout the country. The rural reforms of 1978 consisted  primarily of an increase in farm product prices. The reforms had  relatively little effect on the rural retail price index for  that year. Calculations yield a purchasing power for category 1  areas that is 91.76 percent of standard purchasing power.  Peasant net per capita income after adjusting prices is 1,065  yuan. In order to reach the national rural comparatively  well-off line in 2000, at the peasant net per capita income  increase, the rural comparatively well-off line will be 1,579  yuan, which is rounded down to 1,500 yuan. The category 2 areas  are at the national mean where the rural comparatively well-off  line is 1,200 yuan. In category 3 areas, where purchasing power  is 103.32 percent of standard purchasing power, peasant net per  capita income after adjusting prices is 548 yuan. Using as a  standard the peasant net per capita income increase needed to  reach the national rural comparatively well-off line, the rural  comparatively well-off line for this category is 1,062 yuan,  which has been rounded down to 1,000 yuan.    (2) Favorable Conditions for Reaching the Rural  Comparatively Well-Off Line. Attainment of the rural  comparatively well-off line requires maintenance of an annual  5.8 percent increase in peasant net per capita income, which  corresponds to the 1992 increase. Nationwide, three favorable  conditions exist for attainment of the rural comparatively  well-off line:    1. The rural economy will maintain steady increase;  potential  exists for further development. This is the basic underpinning  for peasant income increase. The gross output value of  agriculture will maintain a 5 percent growth rate during the  first three years of the 1990s (1990-1992) at comparable prices.  For the next eight years, increase in the gross output value of  agriculture will not be less than 4 percent. The reasons are as  follows: 1) As the basic industry in the national economy,  agriculture will receive close attention from the party and  government for a long time to come, and support will be provided  in many ways, such as through legislation and administration, to  develop agricultural production and to readjust and protect the  peasants' interests, which will promote steady development of  agricultural production. 2) Agricultural production holds  tremendous potential. Two-thirds of the country's cultivated  land consists of medium and low yield fields. Reserve resources  also exist in the form of large amounts of barren mountains,  unexploited water surfaces, and undeveloped flats. With full  development for agriculture, they provide substantial potential  for increased yields and increased income. 3) The structure of  agriculture is facing readjustments. Use of science and  technology to invigorate agriculture, development of high yield,  premium quality, and high return agriculture, and increasing the  added value of agricultural products have become the common  cause of the broad masses of peasants.    2. Smooth reform of the farm products circulation mechanism  will give impetus to the formation of a second upsurge in  agricultural production. The government's gradual decontrol of  procurement and marketing controls on main farm products such as  grain and cotton, and guidance given the broad masses of  peasants to enter the marketplace have accelerated the general  adoption of market principles in rural areas. This will generate  extremely great interest and impetus among the broad masses of  peasants to develop commodity production and take part in market  competition. It will bring about early completion of the task of  readjusting the structure of agricultural production, thereby  increasing peasant income. In addition, the grain reserve system  and the wholesale market mechanism that the government has set  up create a fine macroeconomic climate for the development of  agriculture that will enable smooth reform and development of  agriculture.    3. Accelerated development of township and town enterprises,  and speedy urbanization of rural villages have given powerful  impetus to a shift in surplus rural manpower, thereby promoting  a tremendous rise in peasant income. The urbanization of rural  villages and the development of rural tertiary industries  provide new employment opportunities for the transfer out of  agriculture of rural surplus manpower. In 1992, the gross output  value of township and town enterprises reached 1.7643 trillion  yuan, or one third of gross social output value. The annual rate  of increase was more than 30 percent. Development of the rural  economy has accelerated the movement of enterprises and funds to  key cities and towns, and transportation centers. The  development of rural small cities and towns has become the main  vehicle for future enterprise concentration and the shift out of  agriculture of rural surplus labor. It also enables rural  tertiary industries to abandon scattered operations in favor of  more centralized operations that offer the economies of scale.  It may be safely predicted that rural manpower will move into  non-agricultural industries on a larger scale and concentrate in  small rural cities and towns.    3) Analysis of Difficulties in Reaching the Rural  Comparatively Well-Off Line. Peasant income increases  slowly, thereby adding to pressures for reaching the rural  comparatively well-off line. The past five years of rural reform  have seen the fastest increase in peasant income, which has  grown at an average 15.1 percent per year. Between 1985 and  1988, it declined 4 percent, and for three years beginning in  1989 peasant income remained in limbo. Despite 1989's all-time  high grain output, after deducting for price rises, peasant net  per capita income was 1.8 percent less than for the previous  year. This was the first year of negative growth since the  advent of reform and opening to the outside world. In 1990,  peasant income increased only 1.8 percent over the previous  year. In 1991, it increased 2 percent over the previous year.  From 1989 to 1991, it increased only an average 0.7 percent.  Only nine years remain between now and the end of the present  century. If peasant income increases at 2 percent per year, by  2000, only half the rural comparatively well-off line can be  completed. Attainment of the rural comparatively well-off line  of 1,200 yuan by 2000 will require a 6.2 percent increase in  peasant per capita income, which is 0.4 percentage points more  than the originally prescribed plan, and 0.4 percentage points  higher than the actual 1992 increase. Second, the shift out of  agriculture of rural surplus manpower is crucial to peasant  income increase, and it is also the key to realizing a  comparatively well-off rural standard of living. Today,  approximately 100 million of China's 430 million work force are  in a state of "hidden unemployment" in agricultural production.  In addition is the 100 million rural labor force that will be  added over the coming decade, so that by the end of the present  century surplus rural manpower will increase to 200 million.  Attainment of the comparatively well-off line in rural villages  requires an annual shift of more than 13 million members of the  rural work force into other lines of work. This means a shift of  130 million over the next 10 years, thereby increasing the  number of people employed in township and town enterprises to  more than 220 million. Such a large scale transfer is  unprecedented since founding of the people's Republic. During  the 1980s, for the first time large numbers of the rural work  force entered nonagricultural industries, which grew on a fairly  large scale at fairly high speed, an average of 6.3 million  members of the work force entering them each year. Transferring  surplus rural manpower during the 1990s at twice the 1980s scale  and speed will pose substantial difficulties. Third, the  peasants' burdens are fairly heavy, thereby adding to the  difficulty in realizing a comparatively well-off rural standard  of living. The increase in peasants' burdens is essentially an  erosion of peasant's income, which has the effect of seriously  sapping peasant's ability to improve and develop production.  Peasant household survey data show that between 1985 and 1990,  peasants' burdens nationwide (including only state taxation and  collective withholdings) rose from 18.40 yuan to 38.20 yuan per  capita in a 1.1 fold increase, or at an annual 15.7 percent.  During 1989 and 1990, in particular, the per capita rate of  increase in burdens exceeded the per capita net income rate of  increase, the increase being respectively 15.5 and 12.3 percent  higher than peasant per capita net income. Even more serious is  the excessive increase in unreasonable rural fund raising and  assessments, which exceed the nationally prescribed 5 percent.  Peasant income increases with no increase in benefits.  <H5>  4. Various Policy Ideas for Increasing Peasant Income </H5>   (1) Updating Thinking, Making Readjustment and  Protection of Peasants Interests the Main Line in the  Development of Agriculture and the Rural Economy During the  1990s. The establishment and development of a socialist  rural market economy system puts an interests mechanism at the  heart of rural economic development. Protection and  readjustment of peasants interests for a narrowing of the gap  between cities and the countryside is a basic requirement for  the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. The  inauguration and implementation of reform measures including  readjustment of the agricultural production structure,  developing high yield, premium, and high return agriculture,  reforming the agricultural product procurement and marketing  system, improving the socialist market economy mechanism, etc.  as the market requires cannot be done successfully without the  active participation of the broad masses of peasants. Unless the  peasants' interests are protected, not only will the peasant's  income level and standard of living be adversely affected but,  more importantly, peasant interest in developing production and  taking part in reform will be impaired. Thus, this is not an  economic issue but a political one. Therefore, during the 1990s,  the emphasis of rural economic development and rural work has to  shift from product output to the protection and readjustment of  peasants' interests. It must change to increasing the income of  rural laborers.    (2) Maintaining the Continuity of Existing Policies To  Consolidate the Agricultural Foundation Provides the Most Basic  Underpinnings for Steady Increase in Peasant Income.  Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Greater  government protection and intervention in this foundation is  extremely necessary during the new situation in developing a  socialist market economy. On the one hand, a good job must be  done in carrying out all policy measures. Actions must be taken  in accordance with the provisions of "Agricultural Law of the  People's Republic of China," the decisions of the Fourteenth  Party Congress' decisions on the development of a socialist  market economy, and the spirit of the Central Committee of the  Rural Work Committee, using "Program for the Development of  Chinese Agriculture During the 1990's" as a blueprint for  maintaining continuity in rural economic policies, for giving  substance to all policies and measures, for paying sincere and  wholehearted attention to agriculture, for removing peasant  apprehensions, for protecting and increase peasant interest in  developing agricultural production and the rural economy, for  wholeheartedly developing agricultural production and the rural  economy, for increasing peasant income, and for creating a  relaxed policy environment for realization of a comparatively  well-off rural standard of living. On the other hand,  governments at all levels must be encouraged to improve the  agricultural infrastructure, to increase investment, to improve  agricultural production conditions, to improve ability to  prevent and withstand disasters, and to increase reserve  strength for development.    Readjustment of the Agricultural Production Structure  for the Development of High Yield, Premium Quality, High Return  Agriculture Is an Important Way To Increase Peasant Income.    Development of agriculture by emphasizing returns is the  outstanding feature of agriculture during the 1990s. The State  Council's "Decisions on Accelerating the Development of High  Yield, Premium Quality, and High Return Agriculture" provides  policy support for the development of "Three Highs" agriculture.  The key problems existing today as the peasants orient toward  the market, readjust the production structure, and develop  "three highs" agriculture is the general existence of new ways  to increase income, and worries about market risks. In the  process of developing the market economy, government has not  stood idly by but rather has done what needs to be done. Even in  developed capitalist countries, government regulation and  control of agricultural production, and protection of the  interests of farmers is fairly complete. The government must  become the leader and the protector in the peasant's development  of a socialist market economy so that the rural market economy  changes gears smoothly. Right now, it must pay close attention  to model pilot projects in "three highs" agriculture, exploring  new avenues for development of the four combinations, namely  farming, breeding, and processing; agriculture, industry, and  commerce; domestic and foreign trade; and agriculture, science,  and education, readjusting the agriculture production structure,  and increasing peasant income.    Accelerating the Development of Township and Town  Enterprises, and Accelerating Transfers Out of Agriculture of  Surplus Rural Manpower Is the Key To Increasing Peasant  Income. The success or failure of rural economic  development plans depends on whether more than 200 million  surplus rural workers can be transferred out of agriculture.  Whether the goal of a comparatively well-off rural standard of  living can be smoothly attained also hinges on this. The  development of township and town enterprises, and the widening  of rural employment avenues are necessary for an increase in  peasant income. First, the enterprise equity rights system must  be improved. Establishment of a township and town enterprise  microeconomic operating basis that is consistent with the modern  enterprise system requires step-by-step, planned development of  township and town enterprise equity rights registration work to  clarify the enterprise equity rights situation. Experiences in  the reform of the joint-stock system and the cooperative shares  system, which is already underway, must be summarized promptly,  and better guidance provided for gradual standardization of the  systems. Second is faster development of township and town  enterprises in central and western China. Special funds for the  development of township and town enterprises must be managed  well and used well as State Council "Decisions on Accelerating  Development of Central and Western Township and Town  Enterprises" requires, to raise the level of development of  township and town enterprises in those areas. Third is the need  to do a good job of building small rural cities and towns to  hasten the urbanization of rural villages. National government  agencies concerned must draw up rural small city and town  development plans, making the building of small cities and towns  the center of current economic and cultural activity. Fourth is  the need to speed up the development of rural tertiary  industries. This is a major way in which to soak up surplus  rural labor. Fifth is putting scientific and technical progress  to use in increasing the competitiveness of township and town  enterprises.    (5) Improvement of the Rural Products Circulation  System, Establishing an Agricultural Protection Mechanism Is an  Important Support for Increasing Peasant Income. First is  the need to speed up the growth of the rural commodity  circulation system. Supply and marketing cooperatives are the  basic rural commodity circulation organizations. They are the  main channels for the circulation of agricultural products. The  supply and marketing system reforms of the past several years  have begun to show results. While continuing the role of rural  supply and marketing cooperatives, people in all walks of life  and individual peasants must be encouraged to set up rural  commodity circulation organizations in order to convert product  strengths into commodity strengths that spur the development of  rural commodity production. Second is further perfection of the  basic infrastructure for commodity circulation including  national reserves and wholesale markets to provide strong  support for development of the rural market economy. The  building of agricultural products wholesale markets must become  the focus in fostering and improving agricultural product  markets during the 1990s, energies concentrated on doing a good  job of it. While summarizing experiences and perfecting the  present wholesale markets, a "Wholesale Market Law" should be  drawn up with all possible speed to establish wholesale markets  as leaders in the business realm, particularly for fresh foods,  using legal means to standardize and promote the development of  wholesale markets. Third is the need for further perfection of  the ceiling price procurement system, to control the degree of  rise in prices of the means of agricultural production and to  narrow the "price scissors" between industrial and agricultural  products.    (6) Concentration of Forces To Carry Out an Assault To  Assist the Needy and Bring About Development. More than 80  million people in China have still not found a long-term  solution to their subsistence problems, most of them living in  high mountain and border areas, and in frequent natural disaster  areas. Others live in old revolutionary base areas and minority  nationality areas. The State Council has set a seven year period  for solving the subsistence problems of these 80 million people,  i.e., the "Eighth Seven-Year Assault Plan To Support the Needy."  We must continue a good job of work-relief programs, stick to  development plans to assist the needy, reshape the economic  development mechanism in such areas, improving their  self-invigorating mechanism to ensure victory in the assault.    (8) Reduction of Peasant Burdens. Both the party  and the government have drafted a series of policy measures to  reduce peasant burdens, and limits on peasant burdens have also  been written into law. The law clearly provides that no unit may  increase peasant burdens on any pretext, peasant burdens to be  held within 5 percent of previous year peasant net per capita  income. Now the key lies in implementation. We must act in the  spirit of the Central Rural Work Conference to improve  leadership and supervision, making reduction of peasant burdens  an important task in development of the rural economy during  1990 and realizing the goal of a comfortably well-off standard  of living, putting it on the government's daily work agenda, and  paying unremitting attention to it.</p>

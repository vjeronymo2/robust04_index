			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul in </F> al-Biqa' valley, by Ramadan Husayn in Cairo; date not given;  from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Husayn] Mr. Minister, how is the security situation  in light of the Israeli raids against southern Lebanon?    [Dallul] Israel frequently perpetrates unjustified acts of  aggression against Lebanon, its land, and its people--women,  children, and the elderly. Lately, it has even burned crops to  shake Lebanon, weaken its people, disturb its security and  stability, and harm its sovereignty. We are looking to the  world community and our Arab brothers. We urgently need their  help and support. We are also waiting for the Security Council  to shoulder its responsibility, and we expect the world to  condemn the Israeli aggressions. What sin have the children,  women and old men committed that they should be shelled?  Recently, Israel attacked our children with 500-kg and 1000-kg  bombs. The soil, the crops, and the rocks have turned black.  Israel burned the crops that are the only livelihood of the  sons of Lebanon.    [Husayn] Has Lebanon held contacts with the Security Council  permanent members and other influential parties to stop the  Israeli aggressions?    [Dallul] We have filed a complaint with the UN Security  Council, and we have held contacts with the permanent members.  We also informed all influential countries of the Israeli acts  of aggression against the people of Lebanon. We hope the world,  especially the Security Council, will react favorably by  condemning Israel and forcing it to stop these repeated acts of  aggression against our people and land.    [Husayn] Mr. Minister, what do you think are the objectives  of the Israeli raids?    [Dallul] Israel wants to cause cracks in Lebanese society.  It wants to continue its occupation of Lebanese territory, and  it wants to force us to confront the Resistance, which is  performing its duty against the occupation. Resistance is a  legitimate right of every people whose land is occupied. This  has happened in Europe and the entire world. When territory  comes under occupation, the people of this territory must  confront the occupation. Resistance is a legitimate right of  our people, and what we are doing is a cry in the face of the  occupier, a cry that it leave our land and stop its aggression  against our people. Israel also wants to stir up domestic  sedition in Lebanese society. But the people of Lebanon are  confronting the aggressions with a united position bordering on  heroism.</p>

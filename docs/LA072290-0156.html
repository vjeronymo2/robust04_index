			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: VOGLER KILLED IN SPRINT CAR CRASH  </P> <P> Rich Vogler, five-time United States Auto Club midget champion, was killed  Saturday night when he crashed during a sprint car race at Salem (Ind.)  Speedway.  </P> <P> Dr. Dan Anderson pronounced Vogler dead at 11:40 p.m. EDT at the Washington  County Memorial Hospital in Salem, according to Bill Marvel, vice president of  USAC. The crash occurred about 40 minutes earlier.  </P> <P> Tony Floyd, an ambulance medic for the hospital, described the 39-year-old  Vogler as having a "severe head injury."  </P> <P> Vogler, leading the race at the time, was running alone when he crashed coming  off the high-banked fourth turn. He was about to take the white flag for the  final lap at the half-mile oval in a race televised nationally by ESPN.  </P> <P> Vogler remained motionless for several minutes before being removed by  ambulance.  </P> <P> Parts of the car were strewn about the front stretch between the turn and the  start-finish line, but the protective roll cage and the driver's pod remained  attached to most of chassis.  </P> <P> The car hit the guardrail and destroyed a section of protective fencing near  the grandstand. No other cars were involved and no other injuries reported.  </P> <P> Vogler was declared the winner when the 30-lap race was red-flagged. Under USAC  rules, the leader of the last green-flag lap before a race-ending red flag is  credited with the victory.  </P> <P> In addition to his five midget titles, Vogler won the national sprint car  championship in 1980. Before this season, he had 122 victories in sprints,  midgets and dirt cars. Last year he won 16 of the 33 races en route to his  fifth midget championship.  </P> <P> The Indianapolis native raced in five Indianapolis 500s. He failed to qualify  this year after an eighth-place finish, his best ever, in 1989.  </P> <P> Vogler's father, Don, was killed in a crash in 1981 while practicing for a USAC  midget race at the Indianapolis Speedrome.  </P> <P> Vogler had been scheduled to make his debut in NASCAR Winston Cup racing by  starting 32nd today in the AC Spark Plug 500 at Pocono International Raceway.  </P> <P> Vogler ranked second only to A.J. Foyt in USAC career victories. Foyt has 158.  </P> <P> Vogler is survived by his widow, Emily, and three sons.  </P></p>

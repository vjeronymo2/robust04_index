			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pak Chong-mun] </F>   [Text] On the afternoon of 18 May, five North Korean  loggers arrived in the ROK for the first time since the  government decided to accept North Korean loggers escaping from  North Korean logging camps in Siberia from a humanitarian  standpoint.    We cannot deny the fact that our government's diplomatic  efforts and public opinion calling for quick action for our  fellow countrymen were important factors in their arrival in the  ROK.    All facts surrounding the defection of the five North  Koreans, including Mr. Choe Chong-nam, have been kept secret.  Therefore, it has been pointed out that intelligence agencies  may have been involved in this case to an excessive degree.    The government stated they defected to the ROK through  legitimate procedures. Still, it has kept everything secret  merely at the requests of countries involved. The  reasonableness of this secrecy has been questioned.    The government stated it would arrange a news conference  with  the five defectors when a proper method is agreed upon.    It has been learned that the five loggers have not received  the right of residence or Russian citizenship, which Russia  gives to loggers who flee their camps. Therefore, it is  believed that, as a result of our government's diplomatic  efforts, they received travel permits from Russia, Kazakhstan,  or any other country where they had stayed and came to the ROK  through a third country.    This method is completely different from the way the ROK  proposed to Russia: We proposed that the loggers be repatriated  to the ROK through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  Russia's proposal that Russia and the ROK independently resolve  this issue through bilateral negotiations has been implemented.  It is very burdensome to the ROK and Russia to have bilateral  negotiations to settle this issue.    North Korea has shown great resistance several times to the  South's Government alleged policy of accepting the loggers as  defectors, saying: "If they take loggers to the South, we will  regard it as kidnapping." It has been learned that North Korea  has also called on Russia, on the basis of the treaty on  cooperation in judiciary matters, to apprehend some 40 escaped  loggers. The fact that the government has accepted five loggers  immediately after it has made a decision gives the impression it  has been excessively hasty to show off its achievements. There  are some circles calling for self-examination as to whether the  government paid a cost that we would not have had to pay if the  matter was handled in a reasonable way.    In fact, the government has not mapped out any practical  measures for procedures to smoothly accept and settle North  Korean loggers in our country. Discussions have been made on  whether to provide them with 40 million to 50 million won per  person for resettlement by applying the `Law on Protecting North  Korean Compatriots Who Have Defected to the South'; whether to  enact a new law; or how to give them vocational training. No  decision has yet been made. So far, about 600 people have  defected from North Korea for resettlement in the South. It has  been learned that in some cases, they have not received  resettlement funds due to lack of money, or in many cases, they  have become `aliens' because they have failed to readjust.    In view of this situation, some circles point out that  instead of accepting North Korean loggers without prior  arrangements, it is necessary to make swift preparations for  them to help them adjust to a new free world and to live a life  worthy of a human being.</p>

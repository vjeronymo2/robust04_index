			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium breaks stubborn resistance - Market report ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices closed firmer at the London Metal Exchange yesterday and looked set to clock up further gains, dealers said. Aluminium finally broke through stubborn resistance just above the Dollars 1,320 level, for three months delivery, and finished at the highs, with final business at Dollars 1,328, a Dollars 25 gain from last Friday's after hours 'kerb' close. 'This is a very good close, and should bring in some further buying,' one trader said. Copper lost some impetus in the afternoon, but remained underpinned by earlier speculative buying, and was content to hold just below the Dollars 1,970 level, prior to another attempt to break overhead resistance, dealers suggested. Other metals traded less actively, but were generally supported by the overall upward trend. LEAD advanced steadily in the afternoon, confirming a break above the Dollars 470-a-tonne level for the three months position, which finished at the day's high of Dollars 474, a Dollars 9 gain from pre-weekend levels. ZINC matched other metals, and was supported on dips towards Dollars 950 a tonne. Final business was at Dollars 953, up Dollars 5. TIN prices were steadier throughout but were unable to attain a Dollars 5,500-a-tonne upside target for three months delivery and the market eased back from the highs. PRECIOUS METALS trading was mildly weaker after the New York markets opened quietly and below previous closing levels. There was little obvious reaction to the continuing vote count in South Africa, which showed the ANC, as expected, winning a clear majority. PLATINUM saw some profit-taking mid-afternoon taking it back to under Dollars 400 a troy ounce and paring weekend gains. COCOA prices picked at the London Commodity Exchange in the afternoon in response to investment fund buying in New York. Near July closed Pounds 26 firmer at Pounds 885 a tonne. One trader said the latest traders' commitments report showed investment funds still had plenty of room to get into the market. But a volume of 5,249 lots, including 1,163 cross trades, reflected the fact that this was not a move generated in London, he added. Compiled from Reuter</p>

During the meeting, Henan Governor Ma Zhongchen delivered an  important speech on the province's reform and development, as  well as the armed police force's role in the new period. In his  speech Ma Zhongchen expressed his appreciation for the efforts  and contributions made by the members of the armed police force  in the past year to the province's economic construction.  Having briefed the participants on the province's overall plan  for economic development for the current year, Ma said: This  year will see Henan Province undergoing the most intensive  reform. In the wake of the introduction of some reformatory  measures and the adjustment of interest relations, it is certain  that some new circumstances and new problems will be emerging,  and some unstable factors will be coming to the surface as well.  When performing its duties, the armed police force is to do  away with these unstable factors before they gain ground. In  doing so the armed police force is supporting reform and  development. Amid the great tide of reform, the armed police  force will be playing still more important a role. Therefore  you are expected to conscientiously sum up experience, work  harder, strive for greater progress, and make greater  contributions.</p>

He has a framed  master's degree from USC to prove it. But to others who seek him out, Aguilar  is known as "the witch doctor."  </P> <P> "Some of my own colleagues call me the witch doctor. It doesn't really bother  me," he says, referring to his status in the Latino and mental-health  communities as a curandero, or folk healer.  </P> <P> Aguilar is the clinical coordinator of Amanecer, an in-patient psychiatric  program for Latinos at the Bellwood Health Center in Bellflower, where he  incorporates mainstream psychotherapy with religious and folkloric practices.  Frequently Aguilar is asked to present his unique technique at universities and  conferences.  </P> <P> Aguilar honed his skills by observing other curanderos while they performed  limpias (spiritual cleansings), which involve incense and candle burning,  praying, chanting and touching heads -- elements that help him make "a cultural  connection with patients."  </P> <P> He began incorporating "mystical, Old World" methods into his treatment regimen  19 years ago when he realized patients didn't always respond to traditional  therapy, he recalls. At the time, Aguilar, a Mexico City native, was working at  Metropolitan State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Norwalk.  </P> <P> "There were very few Spanish-speaking psychotherapists. It was then I realized  that patients were seeing curanderos and going to botanicas," he says. At  first, Aguilar would sneak curanderos into the hospital to assist in a  patient's treatment. Later, he began a treatment program exclusively for  Latinos, and eventually the hospital allowed him to blend his Latino customs  with modern medicine.  </P> <P> He left Metropolitan last year after a new administration "didn't support my  techniques," he says.  </P> <P> Bill Silva, executive director of Metropolitan, acknowledges that Aguilar "was  instrumental in the hospital's Latino program, in developing it and in  nurturing it, but we wanted to change the direction of the program."  </P> <P> "For many years we focused on patients particularly from rural Mexico and rural  Central America, and now we want to get patients in the local Hispanic  community," Silva says. "I'm not criticizing one type of treatment over  another, but matters such as a limpia haven't come up as an issue."  </P> <P> At his new post, Aguilar is once again mixing the old with the new.  </P> <P> And he has the support of Bellwood's administration, including Elvia Correa,  Amanecer's program director. Correa, also a licensed clinical social worker  with a masters in social work from USC, leads therapy groups in Spanish with  Aguilar. "I am not a curandera," she says. "I am Mexican. I understand the  culture, the language, but I am not skilled as a curandera. I observe."  </P> <P> Correa says Bellwood recently began advertising limpias in Spanish-language  newspapers as a way of reaching out to those in the Latino community who  observe such customs and rituals. Limpias are charged on a sliding-fee scale  and usually average $30.  </P> <P> Explains Aguilar: "My concept of medicine is this: There is a road to health  that a patient has to travel in order to get well. And when it comes to the  Hispanic patient, they already have their own perception of illness.  </P> <P> "In the Mexican culture, there is no such thing as mental health. Your are  crazy or you are not. Any time there is an unusual behavior, that behavior is  attached to an external force -- bewitchment, something that is out of their  control -- which is why the limpias, the herbs and the amulets are so important  in the healing process."  </P> <P> Often, Aguilar performs limpias -- individual and group -- at Bellwood Health  Center when he and the patient agree it can be a benefit.  </P> <P> Recently, such a limpia involved sweeping a patient's body with branches from a  pepper tree (believed to be the tree from which Christ's cross was fashioned)  while incense and candles burned in the dark room. The patient's family stood  nearby praying, asking God to help their loved one, who believed he was  possessed by evil spirits. Then Aguilar waved a ceramic pot with incense over  the man's body "to draw all the bad things clinging to the patient."  </P> <P> "The patient then usually goes into a trance," he explains. It is at this stage  of the limpia that Aguilar says he "manipulates the patient by praying and  touching the head and sweeping the branches. The patient actually feels that  something is happening, and of course, that is the effect you want. At the end  you cleanse the patient with holy water and a blessing, and the patient feels  protected and rid of whatever evil he felt was clinging onto his body."  </P> <P> The treatment for this patient also involved traditional therapy sessions and  medication.  </P> <P> "The ideal thing to happen," says Aguilar, "is for health care professionals  and psychotherapists to make a cultural connection because then that patient is  going to trust us and hopefully will be willing to accept orthodox treatment,  medication and psychotherapy along with their Old World practices."  </P></p>

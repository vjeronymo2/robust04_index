			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Polly Peck administrators quizzed over bribes MR MICHAEL JORDAN, ad-ministrator to Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit to electronics group, yesterday appeared before the Istanbul public prosecutor's office to answer questions relating to allegations made by Mr Asil Nadir that administrators considered bribing customs officials. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK auditors, last night claimed that the move was 'a minor attempt to put a spanner in the works in an effort to forcibly postpone Mr Jordan's visit to Cyprus'. Mr Jordan and Mr David Kidd of Coopers were visited by police in their hotel room late on Wednesday night. Police took their passports and they were requested to appear the following morning, when they were questioned for three hours. Their passports were later returned. British consular officials were last night trying to establish on what grounds the request had been made. The prosecutor's move follows a complaint lodged by Mr Nadir's lawyer connected with the continuing dispute over ownership of AN Graphics, an Istanbul printing concern claimed by the administrators. Sources confirm that the company was transferred to Mr Nadir for 'nil consideration', just three days before the courts appointed the administrators in October 1990. The bribery allegations relate to an internal memo, a copy of which Mr Nadir released yesterday. The administrators concede that the memo deployed what one official called 'loose wording', including reference to the need for bribes to Turkish customs to release a disputed piece of printing equipment belonging to AN Graphics. On Wednesday Mr Ali Riza Gorgun, Mr Nadir's lawyer in North Cyprus, said the Turkish prosecutor had issued a warrant for the arrest of all three administrators - Mr Jordan, Mr Richard Stone and Mr Christopher Morris. Mr Jordan was due back in London last night and Mr Gorgun was uncontactable. The incident forced Mr Jordan to cancel a trip to northern Cyprus to attend court hearings in Nicosia today on the injunctions over the various PPI companies on the island. It marks the latest tactic by Mr Nadir to block the administrators access to the Polly Peck companies. Mr Nadir jumped bail in May fleeing the UK where he faces charges of theft and false accounting relating to Polly Peck.</p>

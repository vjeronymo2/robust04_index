			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo busy There were distinct signs of unease around the oil exploration and production sector as first Enterprise Oil, and then to a lesser extent Lasmo, attracted sizeable selling pressure. The latter was the market's second most heavily traded stock after a block of 1.6m shares was sold into the market at 130p and quickly placed at 130 1/2 p, while a further 700,000 was bought and sold at a profit of only 0.25p. Lasmo is scheduled to announce preliminary results next Wednesday and the company's shares have held relatively steady in recent months in spite of the continued weakness of crude oil prices, currently just above their lowest levels for five years. At the close Lasmo was marginally easier at 130p after turnover of 10m shares, the highest single day's volume since December 10. Enterprise shares dipped 4 to 411p. Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 10m and the shares hardened 4 to 190p after Henderson Crosthwaite issued a buy recommendation and upgraded current-year profits estimates. The broker raised its forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 120m and urged investors to buy the stock, saying: 'Rolls-Royce is the premier investment in the engineering sector, with a major appeal to international funds.' US investment bank Lehman Brothers was also reported to have been a big buyer of the shares. Metals group Johnson Matthey firmed 3 to 568p after BZW issued a favourable review on the stock. Worries about the pressure on profits in the cable industry continued to hurt electricals group Delta. The shares gave up 13 to 509p, after a meeting with institutions. Prospects of losing the benefit of the pension surplus from the balance sheet, highlighted by Coats Viyella's figures, hurt Williams Holdings. The shares relinquished 13 to 394p. Legal &amp; General rose strongly against the market and closed 9 higher at 502p, ahead of this morning's preliminary figures and following good support from James Capel and Robert Fleming Securities. The latter, recommending the shares as a buy 'for the first time in many months', pointed to the shares' yield premium of nearly 45 per cent and the actual yield of almost 5.5 per cent. Fleming said: 'Worries about fines for pension overselling are overdone.' Stores analysts digested the details of the CBI retail sales survey, which showed sales growth slowing for the second month in succession, and the latest government figures. Great Universal Stores bucked the muted trend, the shares firming 2 to 575p, on evidence of stronger mail order sales. Brown and Jackson recovered a half-penny to 3 1/4 p after collapsing on Tuesday on revealing disagreements with its bankers. Talk of a profits downgrade in Kingfisher saw the shares slide 12 to 607p. Leisure group Granada continued to see analysts and institutional investors ahead of its closed season. The meetings kept the stock up for most of the session, although it ended a penny off at 560p. Smith New Court reiterated its positive stance, arguing that with BSkyB stripped out it deserved more than a market rating. Hotel stocks held firm, helped by Kleinwort Benson's latest research suggesting that UK room demand in December was 9.4 per cent ahead of the same period a year ago. Forte added a penny at 256p and Ladbroke was steady at 207p. Transport and property group P&amp;O, which reports next week, appreciated 8 to 689p after a BZW recommendation. The securities house expects the group to report profits of Pounds 540m (including Pounds 300m of exceptionals.) Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved ahead 3 to 544p, with SG Warburg said to have recommended the stock. Fisons added 3 at 134p as US buying led to a return of bid rumours. Reed International improved 2 to 905p ahead of figures due tomorrow. Marketmakers were preparing themselves for the first day of trading in Midland Independent, the newspaper group that includes the Birmingham Evening Mail and Daily Post. The shares were offered at 140p, and some dealers were suggesting that the shares, five times oversubscribed by institutions, might open at a hefty premium. A forecast upgrade in Cadbury Schweppes, said to be by company broker Hoare Govett, helped the shares rise 3 to 499p. United Biscuits gained 5 at 338p ahead of today's results, some buyers speculating that the rumoured provisions may not be as bad as feared.</p>

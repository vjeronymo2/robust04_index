			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Say it with chocolates It is cheaper than champagne, and more environmentally friendly than rhinoceros horn. You can eat it, drink it, cook with it, sculpt it or, following the example of contemporary artist Anya Gallaccio, melt 325 bars and paint your walls with it. Chocolate - even for the less avant-garde - is rightly among the most popular of Valentine's Day gifts. The quality and variety of chocolate available in the UK has increased greatly in recent years. Thornton's Confectionery has nearly 500 outlets throughout the UK. For Valentine's Day, it will ice a message of your choice on to a chocolate heart, which, at Pounds 2.99 including the presentation box, is hardly more expensive than a card. Belgian chocolate maker Godiva is famous for a high quality couverture and a characteristic praline filling. The pralines, moulded into Valentine hearts and covered with milk or dark chocolate, are available individually or in lavish quantity, boxed in red and gold (Pounds 15 per lb). Godiva's range also includes fillings of marzipan, liqueur, and fresh cream. Dame Blanche is a dark chocolate cup filled with coffee cream and a walnut half, covered in white chocolate. Godiva's main shop in the UK is at 247 Regent Street in London, with concessions at Selfridges and Harrods, and there are 1,400 outlets worldwide. If your tastes run to the more erotic, Aphrodisia in London's Shepherd's Market (071-499 2901) offers a chocolate selection pointedly called Avant l'Amour, at Pounds 8 for a  1/2 lb box. Vanilla, coconut and ginger are used in the centres. The most exclusive maker of fine British chocolate is Charbonnel et Walker, established in 1875 and still retaining the grace of an earlier age. Charbonnel's presentation boxes have been collectables since the days when they came with tiny silver tongs, to prevent the soiling of evening gloves and any unseemly rustling of paper in the dress circle. C&amp;W's boxes, from a miniature two-chocolate size to a 10 lb box, are still hand-made: covered in coloured silks, moire or Liberty print, and charmingly trimmed. Charbonnel's range includes a paradisal strawberry white truffle, and lips and hearts moulded in solid milk, plain or white chocolate. You could spell out your love in letters from a chocolate alphabet (all Pounds 16 per lb). C&amp;W's single shop is at 1 The Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, London, W1X 4BT and there is a mail order service (071-491-0939).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 6 May (AFP) -- Shells blasted central  Kigali as the Army and rebels fought fierce artillery duels  Friday [6 May] despite a ceasefire agreement announced by  Tanzanian officials. "There is shelling around us, and there has  been continuous intensive fighting throughout the night," UN  spokesman Abdul Kabia said. "The battle area has spread over  various parts of Kigali."    Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph Rwegasira announced in Dar  es Salaam that Rwanda's interim government had signed a document  calling for a ceasefire starting Saturday. He said the rebel  Rwanda Patriotic Front did not sign, but had promised to observe  the ceasefire. Rebel officials were not immediately available  to comment.    Kabia told AFP by telephone from Kigali that fighting had  also been reported around the northwestern town of Ruhengeri,  where relief officials said mainly Tutsi rebel guerrillas were  besieging Hutu-led government forces. Clashes also erupted  elsewhere in the country and spread in the corpse-littered and  blood-splattered capital. Shells fell near the Mille Collines  Hotel in central Kigali, where about 300 Tutsi civilians have  been holed up for weeks under UN protection. Government  soldiers and militiamen have prevented UN forces from evacuating  them.    The rebel headquarters at the former parliament building was  "very heavily shelled and received two direct hits" Thursday,  Kabia said. Casualty figures were unknown.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANATOMY LESSON  </P> <P> In Steve Weinstein's July 29 article on Mark Frost, co-creator of television's  "Twin Peaks," Frost is quoted as describing a character as a "walking  cerebellum," when he should have called him a "walking cerebrum."  </P> <P> The cerebrum, location of the cerebral cortex, is the major part of the brain  and controls thought and other intellectual processes. The cerebellum, in  contrast, is a smaller section that helps maintain coordination and facilitates  movement.  </P> <P> In Charles Champlin's "Spike Lee Gets Personal," Lee mentioned the athlete who  tears a rotator "cup" when he meant to say the rotator "cuff," tissue  surrounding the shoulder joint consisting of muscle and tendons.  </P> <P> Proper labeling of body parts makes for better filmmaking!  </P> <P> DAVID E.

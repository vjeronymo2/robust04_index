			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / People: LWT millionaire quits for the BBC Nick Elliott, managing director of LWT Productions, has become the latest senior executive to leave London Weekend Television since its takeover by Granada earlier this year. Elliott, who has worked at LWT for the past 22 years and played a leading role in developing programmes such as London's Burning, Agatha Christie's Poirot and The Charmer, is moving to the BBC as head of drama series. The head of the drama group is Charles Denton, himself a former ITV executive. Elliott, 50, is a close friend of John Birt, the BBC director general but it is believed that Birt was not involved in the appointment. Elliott was approached by a group of BBC executives including Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1. He made it clear yesterday that he was not leaving because of the Granada ownership; he had actually begun his career with Granada. After working for LWT for more than 20 years, he had decided some time ago that he would like to change his job but for the past four years was prevented by LWT's 'golden handcuffs' from moving. As the former head of drama and director of programmes, Elliott benefited greatly from a management share scheme; he made around Pounds 3.5m from it. He says he will miss LWT greatly, but adds 'the job the BBC has asked me to do is an exciting challenge that I could not resist'. His appointment is an indication that the BBC is trying to strengthen its popular drama and maintain its ratings on BBC1. Meanwhile, the LWT board is in the process of reviewing the top management structure of the company and says a key objective is to facilitate the development and growth of LWT's programme production business.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Ward note 'bogus', court told: Guinness adviser is challenged over Pounds 3m bank deposit MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer charged in the final Guinness trial with stealing Pounds 5.2m from the drinks company, was yesterday accused of fabricating evidence to mislead the Old Bailey jury. Mr Ward, who advised Guinness on its 1986 takeover of Distillers, finished giving evidence last week. However, he was recalled to the witness box yesterday to face further cross-examination over a note he had written concerning the Pounds 3m he had deposited in the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive. The prosecution claims that the money was Mr Saunders' share of the Pounds 5.2m allegedly stolen from the company after the takeover bid succeeded. Mr Ward, who denies the theft charge, had originally told the court that the note - seen for the first time last week - was the only contemporaneous evidence supporting his claim that the Pounds 3m was his and that he had borrowed Mr Saunders' account to put the money aside to pay his tax bills. However, Mr Victor Temple, prosecuting, told the court that documentary evidence showed Mr Ward could not have written the note in August 1986 as he claimed. He accused Mr Ward: 'This is a bogus document produced by you to mislead, amongst others, this court and the jury.' Mr Ward replied: 'You know that is not true.' In the note to his brother Robert, the executor of his will, Mr Ward wrote that the Pounds 3m in Mr Saunders' account belonged to him and that, in the event of Mr Ward's death, his brother should contact Mr Saunders to get the funds released. The note - dated August 20 1986 - also gave details of other bank accounts in which Mr Ward had an interest. These included an account with the National Bank of Washington. However, documentary evidence from the bank showed this account had not been opened and its account number issued until December 11 that year, almost four months later, Mr Temple said. Denying the note he produced to the court was bogus, Mr Ward said: 'I am well used to your scurrilous suggestions. I don't over-react to them, but once again you are wrong.' Later, Mr Robert Glass, a security officer with Riggs National Bank, which took over the National Bank of Washington in 1990, confirmed that the bank's records showed the account did not exist before December 11 1986. The trial continues today.</p>

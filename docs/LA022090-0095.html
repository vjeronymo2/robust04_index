			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO HEAR FRAT APPEAL ON EXPULSION  </P> <P> Two Cal State Fullerton fraternities, threatened with expulsion from their  houses on fraternity row, plan a final appeal to the City Council tonight.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge in August declared Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Pi  public nuisances and ordered them to get city permits or close.  </P> <P> The city Planning Commission unanimously rejected their requests for permits in  January, leaving an appeal to the council as the last resort. The commission  said the fraternities have a history of raucous parties and shouldn't be  allowed in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> If the council rejects the appeals at the 7:30 p.m. meeting, the fraternities  will be forced to abandon their houses across the street from each other on  Teri Place, north of the campus. The council also will consider asking Cal  State Fullerton to ban the fraternities as campus organizations.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

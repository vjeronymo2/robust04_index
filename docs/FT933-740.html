			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Akbar was 'chief engineer' on BCCI ship of fraud: John Mason profiles a central figure in the bank's misuse of Pounds 1.3bn depositor funds MR SAYED ALI AKBAR, the former head of Bank of Credit amd Commerce International's treasury division, was a central figure in the epic worldwide fraud perpetrated by the bank, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. Although he reported directly to Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the BCCI founder and chairman, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its chief executive, Mr Akbar was the 'chief engineer' of the bank's dishonest financial manoeuvring which resulted in the misuse of Pounds 1.3bn of depositors' funds, the court heard. Mr Timothy Langdale QC presented the case brought by the Serious Fraud Office after Mr Akbar had pleaded guilty to 16 sample charges of false accounting involving Dollars 745.8m and an additional Pounds 13.6m in the early 1980s. Mr Akbar, who has spent more than two years in French and British jails since his arrest, will be sentenced today. During the hearing, the court heard that while BCCI set out to hoodwink both its regulators and auditors, the Bank of England did not apply its standard test of an individual's fitness to hold their position to Mr Akbar - the Bank's supervision division considering his post as head of treasury insufficiently senior to justify such an assessment. It also learnt that Mr Swaleh Naqvi, now awaiting trial in Abu Dhabi, had made 'sweeping confessions' about his role in the bank's affairs. Although the bank grew quickly since its creation in 1972, its weak balance sheet and poorly performing loans meant that it was effectively insolvent by 1983 and possibly earlier, Mr Langdale said. To survive, it painted an entirely false picture of its profitability by inflating profits, making liabilities look like loans, and artificially creating funds. Top bank officials behaved less like financiers and 'more like a team of financial jugglers trying to keep an increasing number of balls in the air in a desperate effort to prevent their ruinous mismanagement being exposed to the world'. The frauds were sophisticated and the money movements designed to avoid detection. Carried out in a number of countries, the frauds were very difficult to detect. The bank's auditors were never given all relevant information at the same time. One example of the fraud carried out by Mr Akbar concerned his handling of funds deposited by the Saudi Sheikh Abdul Khalil. With no authority and without the Sheikh's knowledge, Mr Akbar created loans against his account. Mr Akbar then used much of the money to set up Capcom, a commodity dealer used in BCCI's dealing activities. About Dollars 60m had been diverted from BCCI to set up the dealing company, which still exists and deals in foreign exchange, Mr Langdale said. After leaving BCCI in 1986, Mr Akbar met the Sheikh and told him how his money had been misused to help conceal the bank's true financial position. He advised Sheikh Khalil to withdraw his money from the bank, Mr Langdale said. Mr Akbar told the Sheikh BCCI's management would kill him if they learnt he had passed on this information. After his departure from BCCI, Mr Akbar worked exclusively for Capcom until his arrest in 1988 for laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking. He was later sentenced to 18 months in prison. After his release in 1991, Mr Akbar fled to France. It was only in April 1993 that the SFO was able to extradite him to the UK. The cost of the SFO's investigation and preparation of Mr Akbar's case was Pounds 3,647,599, Mr Langdale said.</p>

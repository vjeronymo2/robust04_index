			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / High collection rate reported for council tax Most local councils have achieved high collection rates for council tax, the Audit Commission says in a report on the first year of the tax, published today. The local authority watchdog says that almost 93 per cent of the Pounds 7.3bn to be paid by taxpayers in 1993-94 was collected by the end of March. Under the poll tax, councils managed to collect less than 90 per cent of the tax in the year it was due. Some councils have experienced problems in council-tax collection, however, in part because of the legacy of difficulties in collecting the poll tax. Nine had collected less than 80 per cent of the tax due, with the London borough of Lambeth having brought in less than half. The report says that almost Pounds 1.8bn of poll tax remained uncollected at the end of March, a year after the tax was abolished. There is expected to be Pounds 1.5bn outstanding by the end of next year, much of which will have to be written off as too expensive to col-lect, the commission believes. According to the commission the cost of collecting poll tax arrears averages Pounds 100 per case. But targeting recovery on the largest arrears can still be cost-effective, the report says. People who owe Pounds 250 or more account for more than 60 per cent of the money outstanding. The commission says that the success of local authorities in collecting council tax has restored the credibility of local taxation. One in seven councils, however, had collected less than 90 per cent of the tax due by the end of March, and no money had been collected from a fifth of households in some authorities, largely because of poor record-keeping or slow administration. The 12 inner-London boroughs, which suffered some of the best organised poll tax strikes, are among the worst performing councils. But some rural areas such as Kerrier in Cornwall and Charnwood in Leicestershire are also among the laggards, the commission says. It says: 'There is only a very weak link between collection rates and the extent of an area's deprivation.' Collecting council tax and the uniform business rate cost local authorities about Pounds 700m last year, the commission says. This is more than is spent on refuse collection. The commission says costs vary between Pounds 7 and Pounds 30 per household. There was no correlation between cost and collection rates - one of the highest collection rates was achieved by one of the lowest-cost authorities. It says more needs to be done to use computer systems to improve collection levels. Sixty per cent of councils cannot easily identify those who have paid nothing and many fail to target persistent late payers who need firmer action to get them to pay.

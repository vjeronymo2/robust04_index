			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heidi Borud: "Differing Views in Yes and No </F> Camps"]    [Text] While the Europe Movement is jubilant about the  clear yes victory in Austria, the No to the EU [European Union]  movement has noted for its information the referendum figures.    "I do not believe that the referendum in Austria will be of  any significance for the Norwegian EU debate, but it would of  course have been an encouragement if the result had been a no,"  Kristen Nygaard, leader of the No to the EU organization, said.    Tor Wennesland, secretary general of the Europe Movement,  said that the result in Austria is much better than expected.  Wennesland believes that the foundation of the EEA [European  Economic Area] agreement as an independent alternative to the EU  has now been greatly undermined. He also said that the  possibility of expanding the EU to the east has been  strengthened by the fact that Austria has said yes to EU  membership.    "I am happy that the nationalists did not manage to achieve  a  no majority in the referendum," Wennesland said.    "No" general Nygaard is not happy about such comments.    "The yes side is now clearly now trying to portray EU  opponents as nationalists with Nazi views. Such allegations  must therefore apply to 52 percent of the Norwegian people,"  said Nygaard, referring to Opinion's latest EU membership poll  that was published in AFTENPOSTEN on Saturday [11 June].    Nygaard thinks that it is mean of the Europe Movement to  imply that opponents of the EU have Nazi sympathies.</p>

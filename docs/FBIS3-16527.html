On Wednesday, armed riot police stormed the  mayor's office and told Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and his closest  aides they were dismissed from office. First Deputy Mayor  Vladimir Gilgenberg, who put up resistance, was literally  carried out of the building by police.    This was the second armed invasion of the city  administration  building. The first occupation occurred on the night from  February 12-13, and was prompted, according to an official  version, by the need to question Cherepkov on receiving a bribe  from a certain Volkov. The mayor then remained at power thanks  to public support.    On Wednesday, the Maritime territorial administration issued  an order to topple Cherepkov, citing the documents supplied by  the city prosecutor which say criminal proceedings are being  established against Cherepkov under Article 170 (Part 3) of the  Russian Criminal Code (bribe taking).    Territorial administration members Konstantin Tolstosheyn  and  Vasiliy Terekhov have been named acting mayor and his deputy.  They had been Cherepkov's rivals in the mayor's elections, but  flopped, scoring 1.5 percent votes between them.    Supporters of the toppled mayor, including a group of voters  who nominated him to the territorial duma, have announced that  Cherepkov's toppling was an act of open arbitrariness and a  gross violation of human rights. They said they would hold acts  of protest, up to fasting at the territorial administration  building.    The first meeting of protest was held in Vladivostok on  Thursday night.</p>

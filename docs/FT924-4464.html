			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Happiness is a smoke-filled railway carriage Sir, Last Tuesday I travelled on the 17.50 from Paddington to Oxford in one of the new-style Network SouthEast trains. There was no smoking compartment. On enquiry I was told that this was 'the new policy'. Since when, may I ask? Affecting which services? Arrived at by what process of reasoning or consultation? I can find nothing about it in the Citizen's Charter, nor is it the way to woo traffic back from road to rail. I am a smoker, sir, and do not wish to be reformed by stealth, certainly not by BR who call me 'customer' to my face but decide behind my back what I should not have. What a relief it was to return to the squalor of the old smoking carriages (ca. 1948) plying between Charing Cross and Ashford, Kent, where the beer cans gently roll as the train sways from side to side, and cigarette butts float in the dregs.

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Pension funds In light of the Maxwell affair, it is worth considering what the market can expect by way of legislation affecting the UK pensions industry. The obvious point to make is that a new Pensions Act is unlikely to repeat the impact of changes 20 years ago in the US, when the introduction of prudence as an investment principle led eventually to the expansion by pension funds into overseas assets. UK funds are by comparison already well diversified by assets and markets. Tighter restrictions on self-investment apart, the main purpose of any new UK rules will be not so much to influence where pension fund money is invested as to limit the scope for Maxwell-style looting. Logically, that means addressing such obscure areas as trust deeds and the safe custody of assets, as well as the independence of fund managers. These issues have already been worked over by a parliamentary committee. Its recommendations, if implemented, would make occupational funds more secure. Trustees would have better-defined responsibilities and fund managers would have to separate investment activity from the safe custody of assets. The question is whether such measures would be as costly as the fund management community has argued. The answer is probably not. Nor is it clear that fund managers would have a case for passing on extra costs to the clients the new measures would be designed to protect. As the parallel debate on soft commissions has shown, fund managers have been remarkably adept at keeping cost savings for themselves.</p>

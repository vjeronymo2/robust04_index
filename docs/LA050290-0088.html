			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CYCLE DEATH RISK PUT AT 20 TIMES THAT OF  CAR  </P> <P> A motorcyclist is 20 to 30 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident  than a person in a car, according to a study released Tuesday.  </P> <P> Doctors described motorcyclists' injuries in traffic accidents as "the worst  trauma they treat outside of a war combat zone."  </P> <P> A total of 3,661 motorcyclists died in crashes in 1988, said Dr. Elizabeth  McLoughlin, author of "Fatal Injuries to California Motorcyclists."  </P> <P> During a news conference at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,  McLoughlin, of the San Francisco Injury Center for Research and Prevention, was  joined by motorcycle safety advocates who support mandatory helmet laws.  </P> <P> Joan Claybrook, a longtime consumer product safety activist and co-chairwoman  of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, urged Gov. George Deukmejian to "look  at the ease of enforcing such a law. Look at the families who have suffered."  </P> <P> Deukmejian has twice vetoed legislation that would have required motorcyclists  to wear helmets in California. Many motorcyclists opposed the law on civil  liberty grounds, arguing that a rider should have the personal freedom to wear  a helmet or not.  </P></p>

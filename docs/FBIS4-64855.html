			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU Commission </F> Organises Emergency Response Exercise in Case of a Nuclear  Catastrophe"]    [Text] The European Commission, the German Laender of  Rheinland-Palatine and Baden-Wurttemberg, as well as the nuclear  power plant of Karlsruhe (Germany) are organising from Thursday  [5 May], near the nuclear power plant of Phillipsburg, an  emergency response exercise, called EUROPA 94, to last until  Saturday 7 May inclusive. The object of the exercise, in which  representatives from EU [European Union] Member States,  international organisations and experts from some Central and  East European countries will take part, is to test the  implementation of different emergency plans provided for in case  of a nuclear catastrophe; it is also intended to encourage an  exchange of views and experiences between those responsible for  emergency services in the different countries, so as to  guarantee a maximum amount of cooperation and communication in  case of a real catastrophe. The European Commissioner  responsible for European policy in matters of civil protection,  Ioannis Paleokrassis, stressed the importance of such an  exercise.</p>

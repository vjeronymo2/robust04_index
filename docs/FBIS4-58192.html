			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the  state of Palestine, today sent a message of congratulations to  the members of the Ramallah Club, which this year is holding its  meetings in the occupied territories. In his message, brother  Abu-'Ammar affirms that the edification of our national  authority as a first step toward the setting up of an  independent state requires the use and mobilization of all the  energies and potentials of our people. Here is the text of the  message of brother Abu-'Ammar:    Brother and sister members of the Ramallah Club, honorable  friends and guests, greetings to you. On the occasion of the  convening of your conference for this year in Ramallah on the  soil of our dear homeland, I address my sincerest greetings, my  congratulations and heartfelt wishes to you all, to the  honorable friends and guests, and all the sons of our people in  the homeland and in the diaspora. I wish your conference  success in its work and I wish it will realize its objectives,  with the hope that your conference next year will be held on the  soil of the homeland when the long night of occupation will have  lifted for our people, who will have gained freedom and  independence and secured sovereignty over their national  territory.    Your conference is being convened at a time when we are  close  to starting to reap the first fruit of the long march of the  struggle of our people, during which they have made the greatest  sacrifices. This first fruit is the end of the Israeli  occupation of dear parts of the territory of our dear homeland  Palestine in Gaza and Jericho, and the beginning of a new stage  of struggle which is no less important and difficult, namely the  stage of edification and construction, the building of  infrastructure, and the setting up of institutions and bodies in  order to establish our national authority and entrench its bases  and foundations as a first step toward the setting up of our  independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its  capital. This requires the use and mobilization of all the  energies and potentials of our people with all seriousness and  loyalty so as to secure the success of this march and lead it to  its objective; to work with all objectivity and eagerness in  order to preserve the national unity of our people; and to  strengthen and entrench this unity, so that it may be the  guarantee of our success in building our free, civilized, and  democratic Palestinian society.    Our people are facing a great challenge, and they deserve to  tackle it, given the glorious history of our people, and given  their energies, capabilities, and potentials which enable them  to march toward the future with confident steps to succeed and  overcome all difficulties, no matter how great, to realize their  progress and prosperity, to take their proper place among the  peoples of the world, and to take part in the progress and  prosperity of the region and in the march of the civilization of  mankind.    I reiterate my greetings to you and I shake your hands. See  you soon, God willing, in our beloved homeland Palestine, within  our own independent state, to raise the high and floating  banners of our people and nation over the churches, mosques, and  walls of our holy Jerusalem, the capital of our independent  state, Almighty God willing. It is revolution until victory,  until our floating banners are raised over Jerusalem, with the  help of Almighty God.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BREAKFAST CLUB: Every year at this time the city of Santa Ana invites 1,500  employees to a free, outdoor feed -- called "The Great American Breakfast" --  where supervisors and managers flip pancakes, grill sausage and serve fresh  strawberries, orange juice and coffee. . . . A more recent tradition began last  year when some of the homeless who sleep out near City Hall joined in the food  lines and were fed, and some employees are quietly encouraging them to show up  again this morning.

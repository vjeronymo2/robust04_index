			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Lord Zuckerman: Scientist with political influence - Obituary LORD Zuckerman OM, who died yesterday aged 88, was scientific adviser to the government from 1964 to 1971. Few scientists have gained access to the corridors of power as successfully as the South African-born zoologist who began to establish an international scientific reputation at the age of 27. No scientist in modern times retained political influence for so long. Until late in his life an office and secretary in the Cabinet Office were reserved for his use. For more than 50 years Solly Zuckerman continued to tell people unpalatable truths, sometimes with charm but often with impatience. In the early 1970s he produced a report which stated that cancer research lacked enough fresh ideas to warrant any 'crash' programme at the taxpayer's expense. He also accepted a brief from the UK mining industry to 'make recommendations designed to reconcile economic and technical considerations with other requirements of national policy'. To the chagrin of conservationist interests, he refused to condemn outright the investigation of national parks and areas of great natural beauty for potential mineral wealth. He believed the public should be allowed to weigh the relative benefits. Zuckerman was born in Cape Town in 1904. He left South Africa when he was 21. During his schooldays he was interested in evolution, yet he came to Britain to study medicine at University College Medical School in London. There he met Professor Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, one of the most influential anatomists of his day, from whom the young Zuckerman learned to crusade for his own opinions. Anthropological interests form a thread that ran through Zuckerman's career. He was 27 when he published his Social Life of Monkeys and Apes. In the 1970s, as secretary of the Zoological Society of London, which runs the capital's zoon, he enjoyed a second London office in Regent's Park within earshot of his beloved apes. His research at Birmingham, where he was Sands Cox Professor of Anatomy for 25 years, led him naturally into government science at the start of the second world war. With the late J. D. Bernal, Zuckerman began to strip some of the mythology from the accepted view of the effects of bombs. His experiments showed that the wounding effects of fragmentation were much less of a hazard than was supposed. The real hazard was falling buildings. 'Don't let's fool ourselves' was one of Zuckerman's favourite phrases. Usually it presaged some unpalatable truth. 'An arrogant man, but one of great humility in the face of facts' is how one colleague recalls him from his halcyon days of the 1960s when, for 18 months, he served both as chief scientific adviser to the government and as chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence. He was notoriously impatient with civil servants who would not accept facts. He never shirked big issues. One of them concerned tactical nuclear weapons. By the 1960s an immensely expensive weapons research effort had provided Nato with nuclear versions of almost every kind of ordnance. The man who 20 years before began telling the mandarins they were overestimating the effects of high explosive bombs, told them they were underestimating the consequences of nuclear battle. No sane person could contemplate a battle in which each explosion would be able to devastate an entire town. But for one powerful ally, Zuckerman's nuclear advice might have gone unheeded. A friendship dating from the second world war with Lord Mountbatten, by then admiral of the fleet and chief of the defence staff, proved an alliance too strong for those who favoured tactical nuclear weapons. A strategy founded on the Polaris missile and its elusive submarine launchpad was to replace plans for nuclear shells. He fought a more public battle in 1967, in defence of Cornish beaches, when the Torry Canyon with 550,000 litres of crude oil aboard struck a rock in the English Channel. As the Labour government's chief scientific adviser, he recommended that the broken vessel be bombed with napalm to try to destroy the oil, revealing to many that Britain had stocks of the agent. As chief scientific adviser, Zuckerman helped create Britain's Department of the Environment in 1970. He was an early advocate of the policy that the only practical form of control over pollution was to make the polluter pay. He was made a life peer on his official retirement in 1971.</p>

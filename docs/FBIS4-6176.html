			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 19 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  will not withdraw its troops serving with the United Nations  Protection Force (Unprofor) in Bosnia-Herzegovina despite the  government's apprehension over the situation there, Prime  Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday. The government  cannot recall its troops because the move will be similar to the  measures of the United Nations which we criticise, he said when  asked to comment on the latest situation in Bosnia.    The government is aware of the dangers faced by our soldiers  but we cannot allow the Bosnians to be killed just like that by  the Serbs, he told a news conference after presenting excellence  service awards to Home Ministry staff at the Prime Minister's  Department, here.    The prime minister said the government was concerned over  the  Malaysian soldiers because they were not equipped with adequate  weapons as their duty was only peacekeeping.    He also said that if the Malaysian soldiers were entrapped,  he feared that the other UN soldiers might not go to their  assistance as was the case when the Bosnians needed help.    Dr Mahathir said that even so, the government would not  withdraw the 1,500 Malaysian soldiers, most of them from the  23rd Battalion Royal Malay Regiment stationed in several Bosnian  towns including Sarajevo, because the government did not only  speak of justice but also practised it.    Earlier, he criticised the [words indistinct] and the  Security Council for not doing anything to help the Muslims in  Goradze.    He said that they were actually not interested to help and  purposely allow the Serbs to kill the Bosnians and occupy the  town.    When the Serbs advanced, they did not put a stop to it and  now they are merely saving the UN troops and leaving the Muslims  without any help, he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WILL OF A WIDOW;  </P> <P> SINCE THE 1985 KILLING OF HER POLICE-OFFICER HUSBAND, NORMA WILLIAMS HAS PROVED  SHE IS INDEED A SURVIVOR  </P> <P> When Norma Williams heard last month that a fearsome collision between two  black-and-white police cars had killed three Los Angeles officers and widowed a  young wife, the shock and sadness she had felt Oct. 31, 1985, washed over her  once again.  </P> <P> It was on that night three years ago that her husband of 17 years, Los Angeles  Police Detective Thomas C. Williams, was gunned down. And "each time we lose an  officer . . . it brings it all back again," she said.  </P> <P> This was no ordinary police shooting. Williams, 42, was killed at his son's  Canoga Park school by a career criminal who fired 17 shots with an automatic  pistol. The assassination was in retaliation for routine testimony Williams  gave against his killer, Daniel S. Jenkins, in a robbery case that day in  court.  </P> <P> In the three years since, Norma Williams has shown that she, too, is anything  but ordinary.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old Canoga Park woman has helped her young son Ryan recover from  the trauma of seeing his father die, and she has become active in the Police  Department's support group for officers' survivors. She has taken an intense  interest in the courtroom proceedings that have so far convicted two of the  five accused in the assassination plot.  </P> <P> And she has done all of that, her friends say, with characteristic  determination and good humor.  </P> <P> "Every day has been hard for her," said childhood friend Yvonne Lewandowski,  who now lives in Valencia. "Every time I see her, every time we talk, there's  the loneliness, the hurting."  </P> <P> Lewandowski said tears flow at times. "But Norma will let it out, and then  she'll recharge her batteries and get back in there. She's no quitter."  </P> <P> Tom Williams was a man who loved family camping trips, who helped coach his  son's soccer games and who laughed at his wife's jokes. In proceedings at Los  Angeles Superior Court, Williams has seen all that, the life of a man, reduced  to official evidence: ballistics data, coroner's reports and detailed  descriptions of meetings during which the crime was planned.  </P> <P> It was also in the Van Nuys courtroom, blocks away from the Williams' first  home, where she learned that Jenkins had at one point considered the execution  of other family members.  </P> <P> "She's there in the courtroom, not only for herself, but also for us and for my  dad," said Susie Williams, 19. "No matter what she sees in court, she's  strong."  </P> <P> Perhaps the most difficult experience for Williams has been the discovery that  the justice system that her slain husband dutifully defended is not always  considerate of crime victims' survivors.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers succeeded in barring her from attending most of the trial of  Jenkins and co-conspirator Ruben A. (Tony) Moss, which opened last January,  because she was considered by prosecutors to be a potential witness.  </P> <P> From February to the trial's end in June she had to settle for detailed, daily  reports from a friend inside the courtroom. She also quizzed Deputy Dist.  Attys. Richard P. Jenkins and William Gravlin, who prosecuted the case, and  major crimes Detective Michael Thies, who investigated it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death Sentence  </P> <P> Jenkins was convicted and sentenced to death for planning and executing the  murder of Tom Williams. Moss, a Jenkins lieutenant who knew about the plot, was  convicted and was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. (Three other  men are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder; their trial  started in November and is expected to last until March.)  </P> <P> When Jenkins was sentenced last September, Norma Williams told the court about  her husband, the man, the lover, the friend. But she had to fight for that  right too.  </P> <P> Williams was told the night before Jenkins' formal sentencing that she would  not be allowed to make her statement, a right guaranteed her by the 1982  California Victims' Bill of Rights Act.  </P> <P> She was told that a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Booth vs.  Maryland had superseded California law in death-penalty cases and that  statements from survivors could not be considered before sentencing. Williams  was allowed to make a statement to the court, but only after the formal  sentencing had occurred.  </P> <P> "The defense portrayed Jenkins as a loving father, a guy who would do anything  for his children, who was torn up when his grandmother died," said Williams  bitterly.  </P> <P> "They are allowed to seek sympathy. Then why can't the victims have that equal  right to give a character reference for their loved one? Each side should be  given equal consideration."  </P> <P> When Moss was formally sentenced Dec. 15, Williams was there again. This time,  because the jury had given Moss a maximum sentence of life in prison without  the possibility of parole, Williams was allowed to make a statement before Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith M. Ashmann imposed the sentence.  </P> <P> "Tony Moss, you deserve everything you've got coming to you," she said, looking  into the eyes of the young man who sat less than 10 feet away. "You are a  calculating, cold-blooded murderer, and you deserve every bit of pain and  anguish coming to you all the days of your life."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Williams has tried on her own to restore routine family life, to  soothe a hurt and to fill an emptiness that will never truly be soothed nor  filled.  </P> <P> For three weeks after the killing, Williams and her family were under  continuous police guard. When police became convinced that the assassins had  been arrested, the guard left. But the terror continued in a different form.  </P> <P> The past three years were rough for Ryan Williams, now 10. There were incidents  of shoplifting, of lying, of destroying his belongings. "It frightened me  because I didn't know how long it would go on," Williams said.  </P> <P> The boy, who was 6 when his father was killed, is still in therapy. His father  was picking up Ryan from First Baptist Church school in Canoga Park, and he  probably saved his son's life when he yelled at him to duck.  </P> <P> Norma Williams said Ryan gradually "has evolved from being a very angry little  boy to being a very loving, very social little boy."  </P> <P> She has tried to do her husband's job, as an active team mother for Ryan, who  is developing his father's broad shoulders and long legs and becoming quite a  presence on the peewee football field.  </P> <P> But it is not easy. Ryan, Williams said, "is really having a rough time not  having a dad."  </P> <P> And, now that her children's shock has passed, "they are more aware of the  emptiness without their father."  </P> <P> One source of understanding and friendship during the past 3 years has been the  Los Angeles' Police Department's Family Support Group. The group was formed to  help surviving spouses and children of police officers who die, whether or not  it is in the line of duty.  </P> <P> When she heard about the deaths of Police Officers Derrick C. Connor, 28,  Manuel Gutierrez Jr., 26, and David Hofmeyer, 25, the morning of Dec. 11,  Williams was quick to call Detective Kena Brutsch, the department's liaison to  the group. Connor and Gutierrez had been single. But, Williams learned, Lynn  Hofmeyer was 5 months pregnant with the couple's first child.  </P> <P> Within hours after the death of a police officer, Brutsch visits a surviving  spouse to determine what the group might to do help out. Then Brutsch contacts  Williams and another group member, and they pass the news along to the rest of  the group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Contribution  </P> <P> Part of Williams' involvement is to return the concern the support group has  shown her. But she also knows that she has something she alone can contribute.  </P> <P> "What I bring to that new widow is that basic experience that no one else could  understand," she said several days before the Police Department's latest  tragedy. "I feel good that I'm able to express myself and let her know that the  feelings she's feeling or going to be feeling are very normal."  </P> <P> Brutsch said the wives of police officers are often overshadowed by their  husband's careers and that, when a police officer dies, "the first goal is to  get the ladies to feel better about themselves."  </P> <P> The second goal is to help the women see that they still have a future and to  help them seize control of their lives.  </P> <P> Within the support group, Brutsch said, Williams is a "natural leader" and  openly talks about her feelings and about her husband. Such openness, Brutsch  said, has helped other women in the group to express themselves.  </P> <P> Sandy Verna's husband, Paul, was murdered in 1983 while stopping a car for a  traffic violation. It was Verna who came to the Williams' house, representing  the family support group, soon after Tom's death, and during the past three  years, she and Williams have become fast friends.  </P> <P> "Norma's faced everything with a lot of intelligence," said Verna, 39, of  Thousand Oaks. "She was not afraid to ask for help. She was not afraid to ask,  'What did you do in this situation?' "  </P> <P> Marine Lt. Col. Roger Rowe, who grew up with Tom Williams in Van Nuys and was  his closest friend, said the most important change he has observed in Norma  Williams is "the way she has taken the helm."  </P> <P> Rowe said that before his death Tom Williams was clearly in charge in the  Williams house. Even now, his gold-plated badge, service revolver and other  keepsakes are prominently displayed in the family living room, along with  pictures of him taken during various stages of his 13-year Police Department  career.  </P> <P> Williams has surprised herself as well. She said that four years ago she never  would have thought of herself planning a major home expansion and renovation  that is nearing completion. Or planning to push for legislation that would make  killing a police officer a federal crime punishable by death.  </P> <P> (A number of states, including California, Texas, Florida and Maryland, have  such a law on the books. But, according to Susan Sawyer, the executive director  of Maryland-based Concerns of Police Survivors, not all states follow the  directives of the laws.)  </P> <P> Williams said she imagines conversations that she might have had with her  husband. "I can honestly say that the reason I have maintained my strength is  Tom, Susie and Ryan," she said. "They are my source of strength. My friends  have helped me evolve, but everything I have done has been with the thought of  Tom."  </P> <P> Despite appearing calm and determined, Williams said she feels the stress. The  Christmas holidays, she said, were particularly difficult.  </P> <P> But she is confident that her time will come. She holds a degree in counseling  from Cal State Northridge, and worked for a number of years in personnel before  her husband's death.  </P> <P> Pensions and insurance policies have left her financially comfortable, but  eventually Williams would like to return to work, to establish another  relationship, to see her children grow up and provide her with grandchildren.  </P> <P> But, whatever happens, she intends to see the legal process through. She has  attended several sessions of the second trial, of Reecy Cooper, 33, Voltaire  Williams, 25, and Duane Moody, 30.  </P> <P> The prosecution alleges that the first two had agreed to murder Williams for  Jenkins but then backed out, and that Moody assisted in the plot in other ways.  </P> <P> She plans to appear at every appeal and every hearing for Jenkins and Moss and  even, she hopes, at Jenkins' eventual execution.  </P> <P> "I hope my input will have some value," she said. "I definitely would not just  tuck it away and say, 'Well, it's over and done with.' It's not over. It will  never be over."  </P></p>

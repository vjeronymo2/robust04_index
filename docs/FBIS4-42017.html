			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of a Cuban governmental delegation, Vice  President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba  Lionel Soto, referred to his delegation's visit to Ukraine as  very important.    At a news conference in Kiev, Lionel Soto pointed out that  the main objective of the visit was to restore all the economic  relations which Ukraine and Cuba maintained during the Soviet  Union's existence. After the disintegration of the USSR, he  pointed out, these relations have been almost abolished.    The head of the Cuban governmental delegation also declared  that there are no political differences between our two states  and that our peoples are friendly peoples.    At present, Lionel Soto said, we must get down to specific  work on developing our relations.</p>

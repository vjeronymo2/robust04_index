			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: Controlled spleen - Cinema THREE COLOURS WHITE (15) Krzysztof Kieslowski SERIAL MOM (18) John Waters THE CROW (18) Alex Proyas LONDON (U) Patrick Keiller IN CUSTODY (U)Ismael Merchant Watching Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours White, I kept thinking of the title of that book by Ayn Rand: Atlas Shrugged. For years this Polish film-maker has borne the hopes of European cinema on his lone shoulders, each film more of a grand tragicomic shrug than the last. He now tells us - biggest shrug of all - that he is retiring from movie-making altogether. Is European film prepared for free fall? Perhaps the signs are already here in White. Like Blue before it and Red to come, the film is a strip torn from the French tricouleur flag. This time the theme embroidered is 'egalite'. The dumpy hairdresser from Warsaw, Karol (Zbiegniew Zamachowski), so loves the French girl he married six months before that he keeps flashbacking to that orgasmic flutter of wedding veil and white dress in a Paris church. Alas] That was the couple's only consummation to date. Unmanned by that well-known disease 'emigrant stress' - the inability to function in another country - Karol sits by, impotent in all senses, as pretty, spiteful Dominique (Julie Delpy) first obtains a divorce and then burns down their hairdressing shop. Kieslowski and regular co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz shape what follows as a kind of berserk little-man-makes-good tale. Karol returns to Poland to rebuild his life and fortune - in shady real estate deals  - after first faking death and assuming a new identity. Once rehabilitated, can he lure Dominique back to his arms? My own arms were tugged near to dislocation by opposing demons. The nice demon said: This is a sour, clever, funny satire on the new capitalist spirit in Eastern Europe, a place where everything can be bought, from fake passports to dead bodies. The nasty demon, pulling my other arm, said: This film is intellectually and dramatically slight, at least by the high standards Mr K himself has set. I must agree with both demons. White is a master-class in controlled spleen and social-psychological irony compared with most modern European films. But Kieslowski has set our hopes of him too high. The trilogy's first film Blue had a passion of sound, texture and image that bordered on the miraculous. Surrounded by an Expressionist force field, the film's protagonist (Juliette Binoche, who makes a fleeting guest appearance in White) seemed gripped by anxieties we all recognised even when her beautifully gnomic face seemed to say nothing. White changes mood, changes structure - more linear-anecdotal - and most crucially changes cameraman. Edward Klosinski is not a colour-filter freak like Slawomir Idziak (Blue, Red, The Double Life Of Veronique). The near-monochrome wash of his images suits the sly, downbeat comedy of White. But that downbeat comedy, shorn of stylistic flourishes, does not suit a feature film. White would have made a good short story in the Decalogue series. Even its ending, where 'equality' between the sexes is delivered with a clinching sour-sweet irony, seems more suited to the punchline technique of short story closures than to the sense of echoing questions with which a feature film - above all, a Kieslowski feature film - should leave us. Serial Mom is the latest American movie about the corruption lying beneath the smiling face of suburbia. How the nation's film-makers are obsessed with this] If you laid Mom's writer-director John Waters (Mondo Trasho, Female Troubles, Hairspray) end to end with David Lynch, Penelope Spheeris, Joe Dante and the rest of the 'burb-bashers, you could walk over them all the way from Baltimore, Mom's setting and Waters' home town, to that greatest of all jumped-up suburbs, Hollywood. Kathleen Turner flexes a mean pair of dimples as Beverly Sutphen, housewife-superkiller. She runs over a teacher. She skewers her daughter's jilting boyfriend (look away when his palpitating liver emerges on the end of her weapon). And raiding the fridge, she brings a lamb to the slaughter of a woman neighbour who refuses to rewind her videos. But the main murder victim is the film, done in by its own vacillations between dainty spoofery and bad-taste excess. The killing sprees belong to a different movie from the Ideal Home satire ruling elsewhere. In this heroine's house the furniture, wallpaper and dialogue are all in matching tones and the reactionary family-values pieties are also wittily in place. Best of all is the yet-unsuspected Beverly's show of chagrin over Our Lord's refusal to commit himself about capital punishment, even on the cross. 'If ever there was a time to go on record about the death penalty . . .' Say what you like about The Crow, it has a consistent style: MTV Gothic. Pour in that chiaroscuro; jump around with that camera; growl out that music, not so much heavy metal, more scrapyard noises from hell. But an irony sits, like the title bird, at the centre of this tale of a rock star back from the grave to avenge his own murder. On screen Brandon Lee's chalk-faced hero spends scene after scene bouncing back after being hit by real bullets. Off screen the star, son of the also prematurely-departed Bruce, died from what should have been a fake bullet; but the gun had a fragment of metal still lodged in its barrel. Lee was rushed to hospital; and soon after that, he was being rushed into hoped-for legend. The film will make no one immortal. Set in a nameless inner city on Halloween night, it looks like Delicatessen crossed with The Munsters. Events veer between the banal and the incomprehensible. And with Lee's role padded out with stunt double shots and hide-and-seek shadow play, Michael Wincott's gravel-voiced smoothie of a villain walks into the clear patches of light and steals the film. I wish someone had stolen Patrick Keiller's London. This feature-length essay on the city is diffidently tweaked towards fiction by a narrator's overvoice. While the static images click past like a lantern slide lecture - the famous buildings, rotting factories, glinting riverways - Paul Scofield's nameless 'I' describes a series of exploratory walks taken with gay friend and omniscient London expert 'Robinson.' The script has an appealing stock of comic ironies and literary allusions: Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Defoe. But they are regularly rolled over by the film's political agenda, caterpillar-treading through racism, Thatcherism, homelessness and all the other too familiarly crushable targets of Nineties enlightenment. In Custody is better, but only just. The directing debut of producer Ismael Merchant, its tale of an ageing Urdu poet (Shashi Kapoor) dealing with life, age, wives and - worst of all - interviewers has some of the lapidary grace of confrere James Ivory. I only wish it had some pace too. Like so many post-Satyajit Ray Indian films it suffers from that ruthless syndrome: subcontinental drift.</p>

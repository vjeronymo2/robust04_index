			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> THE BADGE OF GOOD POLICE WORK  </P> <P> Police departments all across the country are facing enormous pressures to  combat increased crime and drug-related violence in times of dwindling  resources and budgets. Yet a recent California Department of Justice report  found that two Orange County police departments were state leaders last year in  solving serious crimes, despite the increasingly difficult climate for law  enforcement. Santa Ana and Anaheim deserve a "well done" for their effective  detective work.  </P> <P> As these and other police departments have struggled to do more with less,  their caseloads have increased because of growing populations and more gangs,  drugs and related crime.  </P> <P> The same report found, for example, that the Long Beach Police Department, once  considered one of the best-run departments in the country, had deteriorated in  performance to the point where in 1989 it had the worst record of any major  city in California for solving serious and violent crimes.  </P> <P> Long Beach is a case study in what happens when a department is beset with  internal labor strife, including accusations by the chief that officers have  been involved in the use and sale of narcotics, an increase in violent crime,  and an influx of drugs. But Santa Ana and Anaheim, which have had their share  of urban problems to deal with, have managed to turn in laudatory performances,  despite the obstacles.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, for example, police solved 81% of reported rape cases, which was  nearly 30% better than police agencies on the average in the state's other 10  largest cities. And in Anaheim, police made arrests in 71% of rape cases and  lead all other major cities in cracking assault cases, solving four of five,  which was 20% more than the average.  </P> <P> Still, these successful departments have had to set priorities because of the  caseload, and the deterioration evident in Long Beach serves as a cautionary  tale. A good report on police work is a badge that, to paraphrase the old  airline commercial, has to be earned every day.  </P></p>

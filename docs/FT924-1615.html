			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unionist attacks Mayhew's 'surrender speech' SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday said the British Army presence in the province might be reduced to a 'garrison role' if there was 'a genuine and established cessation of violence'. Sir Patrick defended the rights of the province's nationalists, offered regret if Britain had contributed to the island's sadness, and said that a lasting renunciation of violence by terrorists would have 'profound consequences'. In a speech designed to make clear his strict impartiality, Sir Patrick significantly went further than any of his predecessors in insisting that he was only a 'facilitator of the expression of democratic will in Northern Ireland'. The province would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its population wanted, he said, but he indicated that he would not embrace a unionist agenda for reforming its government - in spite of the breakdown last month of the round-table political talks. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, described Sir Patrick's 'surrender speech' as 'outrageous' and said that 'no unionist will do business with him while he is stuck in a nationalist mode'. Addressing the centre for the study of conflict at the University of Ulster in Coleraine, Sir Patrick expressed 'profound respect' for Irish nationalists such as Charles Parnell and admitted that British involvement in Ireland had not all been positive. 'There is much in the long and often tragic history of Ireland for deep regret, and the British government for its part shares in that regret to the full.' He announced the repeal of 1940s legislation passed by the unionist-dominated former Northern Ireland parliament which prevents local street names being written in Irish as well as English. But Sir Patrick was careful to avoid any hint that the British government would talk to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, unless it rejected violence. Although terrorism in Northern Ireland's has continued for two decades, Sir Patrick believed its difficulties would be resolved through cross-party dialogue. He said Yugoslavia was an example of which many in Northern Ireland had taken heed. In a recognition of the fears of unionists, he said that Yugoslavia 'has perhaps created a fresh understanding here that, properly understood, 'Brits out' means the ethnic cleansing of a million human beings.' Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC has been appointed to ensure fair treatment of suspected terrrorists in Ulster's interrogation centres at Castlereagh, Londonderry and Armagh, Sir Patrick Mayhew announced last night.</p>

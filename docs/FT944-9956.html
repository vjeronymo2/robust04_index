			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: King of the cowboys - Nigel Andrews talks to veteran western movie-maker and former matador Bud Boetticher The tall, rugged, silver-haired man with the husky-rich voice says: 'A man had a job to do and he went out and did it.' What is he talking about? Plumbers? Encyclopaedia salesmen? No. This man is in California, surrounded by hills and horses; so he must be a veteran movie-maker talking about Westerns. Budd Boetticher is 78 years old and made a stream of acclaimed and characterful cowboy films in the 1950s, shot for peanuts (Dollars 400,000-odd apiece) and starring Randolph Scott. Taut tales of honour and vengeance - 'morality plays' Boetticher rightly calls them - the films became a cult: first in France, where critic Andre Bazin idolised and explicated them, later in Britain and America. This weekend Boetticher - pronounced Bettiker - gets the full hoopla as a guest lecturer at the London Film Festival. The LFF also revives his best Western The Tall T. I had thought this B-movie legend dead until I picked up a copy of Variety in Hollywood. There I read that he was limbering up for a new movie project: a Spain-made, Robert Mitchum-starring Western that begins shooting next year. I drove 150 miles to meet him at a stable/bullring complex in the majestic hills north-east of San Diego. Here Boetticher, after proudly introducing me to his Lippizaner horses, showed me the arena where he still puts in matador practice. For the Chicago-born lad began as a bullfighter in Mexico. Then he muscled into Columbia mogul Harry Cohn's office to wrangle a job as technical adviser on the bullfighting film Blood And Sand (1941). Then after shinning up the ladder from messenger boy to assistant director, he began making his own films: including two up-budget tauromachy epics The Bullfighter And The Lady (1950) and The Magnificent Matador (1955). But it was the Scott Westerns, made between 1956 and 1960, that had Boetticher's special stamp. Realism and raw authority. 'A masterly observer of primitive man,' David Thomson calls him in his touchstone reference work A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema, and talks of the films' 'consistent and bleak preoccupation with life and death, sun and shade.' What else, you may ask, would a film-maker be preoccupied with when stuck in the desert with scant funds and a scary eighteen-day schedule? But that is exactly what made those rough-and-ready 1950s westerns - Boetticher's were rivalled only by the best of Anthony Mann (Winchester 73) and Delmer Daves (Drum Beat) - so crucial a piece in the mosaic of the genre's history. Beyond the studio's long reach film-makers could go for all the bleakness and existentialism they wanted. And they could begin the subtle, radical process of equalising the genre's moral-dramatic balance between heroes and villains: even if that meant hoodwinking head office. 'On Ride Lonesome we didn't want to kill the villains, we wanted to let them escape. The studio said I couldn't. So I argued for shooting it both ways . . . Well, we shot my version in which the villains escape; but when the time came to shoot the version in which they're killed, the trucks were in the way of the setting sun and we couldn't do it. So we went back with just my scene.' Boetticher always wanted his villains to survive. He also wanted them to be as appealing and charismatic as his hero. 'Our baddies could've been sheriffs,' says the director, listing the future stars who started as Boetticher villains: Lee Marvin, Richard Boone, James Coburn . . .The idea is that the audience would like them and root for them; that they'd question the boundaries between good actions and bad. And we'd expand the bad guys' roles . . . The idea is that the villains should be cuter than the hero.' Cuter? Well, Boetticher's carefree attitude to the dodgier implications of B-movie buddyism may account for his work's charm and power. At one and the same time it seems both straight-arrow and rich with ambivalences. Boetticher never laboured the latter; they seem to grow straight up from the landscape. 'The big problem with the Western,' he says when I ask why the genre began to die after the 1950s, 'is that all these Easterners who never saw a horse starting making 'psychological' Westerns. And they confused even themselves. My characters weren't smart enough to have a psychological problem.' After Boetticher's 1950s heyday he made one praised gangster film, The Rise And The Fall Of Legs Diamond, and then acted out his own fall during seven nightmare years in Mexico. Shooting a film about his friend the bullfighter Carlos Arruza, he ran out of money, got divorced, was thrown in jail, spent a week in a mental asylum. Then he nearly died, first of malnutrition, later of a lung ailment. Meanwhile Arruza himself was killed in a car accident along with most of the film's crew. But back in Hollywood Boetticher picked himself up. He sold the odd script: notably Two Mules For Sister Sara for Clint Eastwood. And he entered the decades of European adoration. Why does he think he has become a cult? 'Because I tell the truth. If there's something phoney about me or my life, I don't know what it is. And if I found out I'd rectify it. I think that comes across in the films.' It does. But judge for yourselves. The Tall T is on at the National Film Theatre tomorrow. Boetticher talks at 2 pm. And his new film, A Horse For Mr Barnum, should be out next year.</p>

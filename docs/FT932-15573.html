			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Los Angeles tense as civil rights verdict awaited LOS ANGELES faced further tension and uncertainty last night as jurors in the controversial Rodney King civil rights case ended their third day of deliberations without a verdict. Extra police and hundreds of soldiers were deployed in the central area of the city, which was unusually quiet yesterday. The four Los Angeles police officers on trial in a federal court are accused of violating the civil rights of Mr King, a black motorist who was beaten by police following a car chase. Their acquittal in a state court last year enflamed racial tensions in the city and sparked the worst urban riots in US history, killing more than 50 people and causing an estimated Dollars 2bn in damage. The second trial has raised widespread fears of a repetition of last year's mayhem, but Los Angeles' new police chief, Mr Willie Williams, has tried to calm fears by putting police on the streets and having national guardsmen stand by. Despite videotape evidence, the outcome of the civil rights trial was difficult to predict. On Saturday, Judge John Davis announced that he would not heed requests by local and state officials, including the police, school superintendent and mayor, to delay the announcement of the verdict. Rather than keep jurors waiting, he told lawyers in the case to be prepared to appear in court at 15 minutes' notice. The court was under intense pressure to end the case as quickly as possible. On Easter Sunday church and community leaders appealed for calm, regardless of the outcome of the trial. 'We have some consensus. This is our city. We must maintain it,' said the Rev. Cecil Murray. 'We must show the nation and the world that if it can happen in Los Angeles, it can happen elsewhere. . . citizens, door to door, heart to heart, saying, 'Let's be cool'.'</p>

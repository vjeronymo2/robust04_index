			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU banana deal rejected Six Latin American banana exporting countries have rejected a recent deal between four other producers and the European Union, which ended a long-running dispute over access to the European market. At a meeting in Ecuador, commerce and foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Mexico and the Dominican Republic rejected last week's agreement with the European Commission to increase the Latin American quota to 2.1m tonnes this year from 2m tonnes. The commission had agreed with Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela to increase access after they made a complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Guatemala was also a signatory to the complaint, which was upheld by a Gatt panel. But it accounts for only 1.5 per cent of EU imports and the Commission decided to proceed in spite of its opposition.</p>

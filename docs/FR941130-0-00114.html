The FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Programs. These amendments are needed to implement certain changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), enacted August 10, 1993, and by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, enacted December 20, 1993. These regulations also amend the FFEL Program regulations to permit a lender to issue a ``master check'' to an institution for purposes of disbursing Federal Stafford loan proceeds to an institution, to prohibit a subsequent holder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a loan to bill the Secretary for any applicable interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination fees have not been paid, and to limit the collection charges that may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation. These regulations also clarify a change made to the HEA by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;382). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations take effect July 1, 1995. However, affected parties do not have to comply with the information collection requirements in &sect;&sect;682.305, 682.401, 682.404, and 682.603 until the Department of Education publishes in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  the control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to these information collection requirements.

L. 103&hyph;66) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (the Technical Amendments) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These amendments reflect changes made to the HEA by OBRA, such as the payment of lender referral fees to guaranty agencies, the reduction of the reinsurance coverage and reinsurance rates for a guaranty agency's losses on default claims and the reduction of insurance coverage a guaranty agency may pay on default claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These amendments also reflect changes to the HEA made by the Technical Amendments, such as a lender's obligation to rebate excess interest on certain Federal Stafford loans to either the borrower or the Secretary and require lenders to convert the interest rates on certain Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These amendments also permit a lender to disburse Federal Stafford loan proceeds to a school via a master check, prohibit a subsequent holder of a loan to bill the Secretary for any applicable interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination fees have not been paid, and limit the collection charges that may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These amendments also exclude loans made under a guaranty agency's lender-of-last-resort program from the guaranty agency's reinsurance percentage determined under &sect;682.404.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 13, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL Program in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 52038). The NPRM included a discussion of the issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion may be found:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Returning excess interest to certain Stafford loan borrowers or the Secretary and converting the interest rate on certain Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest rate (page 52038);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disbursement of a Federal Stafford loan via a master check (page 52038);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The obligation of an originating lender to pay origination fees to the Secretary (page 52039);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment of a lender referral fee to each guaranty agency with whom the Secretary has a lender referral agreement in an amount equal to 0.5 percent of the principal amount of a loan made as a result of the agency's referral services (page 52039);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The limitation of a guaranty agency to paying 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of each loan on default claims on loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1993 (page 52039);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The limitation of collection charges and late fees a guaranty agency may guarantee when a defaulted loan is consolidated (page 52039); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The rates at which the Secretary will reinsure a guaranty agency's default claims (page 52039).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Substantive Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has decided not to issue proposed section 682.418 which would implement section 428(n) of the HEA (State Share of Default Costs). As discussed below, the Secretary has determined that further consideration of the regulations is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> O'BYRNE HELPS WESTLAKE GRAB SHARE OF TITLE  </P> <P> Junior guard Dani O'Byrne scored a career-high 32 points and had 10 rebounds to  lead the Westlake High girls' basketball team to a 56-53 victory over visiting  Channel Islands Thursday night in a battle for first place in the Marmonte  League.  </P> <P> The Warriors (21-3, 10-2) finished tied for first with Channel Islands (20-6,  10-2).  </P> <P> Channel Islands won the other meeting between the teams.  </P> <P> Westlake led by one point at halftime but took over in the third quarter,  outscoring Channel Islands, 20-7.  </P> <P> But Channel Islands rallied behind forward Dani Brooks, who scored three  three-point baskets. Virgie Juarez added another three-point basket to bring  the Raiders to within 54-51 with 17 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> The Raiders were hurt by foul trouble. Sal Tauau, and starting guard Cee Cee  Santiago both fouled out. Channel Islands' leading scorers, Candis Carper, and  Tauau were both held to 14 points.  </P> <P> "We knew that we had to shut them down," O'Byrne said.  </P> <P> "They are tough. Our team has never won a championship. We were 0-12 my  freshman year, and there is just no feeling that can compare to this."  </P> <P> The Raiders led, 14-6, at the end of the first quarter, but the Warriors  rallied to within one point at halftime behind the scoring of O'Byrne, who had  a quick 12 points.  </P> <P> "I figured that if we were close at halftime, we could beat them," Westlake  Coach Nancy Bowman said.  </P> <P> O'Byrne sparked an 8-2 Westlake run to open the second half. But Juarez scored  a three-point basket with five minutes remaining in the third quarter to tie  the score, 30-30.  </P></p>

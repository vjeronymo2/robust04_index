			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Deadline set for Bosnia peace talks BOSNIA'S three warring factions will be asked by mediators today for a final decision on an internationally-brokered peace plan, in spite of the fact that Bosnian Moslems oppose many of its provisions. The co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have made clear that they are not prepared to extend the negotiations indefinitely and that they will give the three Bosnian groups one more chance to say 'yes' or 'no' at face-to-face talks today. Failing a favourable reply to their proposals, which include a constitutional framework, a map of the 10 provinces into which Bosnia will be divided and ceasefire arrangements, the mediators have said they would ask the UN Security Council to impose a settlement. Lord Owen said yesterday he was confident 'at the end of the day' an agreement would be reached. 'We may not reach it totally here (in Geneva), but if not, we'll reach it in New York.' Lord Owen said he and Mr Vance would report to the UN Security Council after today's meeting and might press for sanctions against any side blocking the accord. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, poured cold water on hopes an overall agreement might be reached today, following progress made towards agreement on transitional arrangements for the administration of Bosnia between application of a ceasefire and implementation of a new constitution. Under the interim arrangements, a nine-member body composed of three representatives from each ethnic group would take over from Bosnia's elected presidency after a ceasefire. Mr Silajdzic said his government could not accept either the Vance-Owen package because the Moslems considered it would lead to the ethnic division of the country and was tantamount to rewarding Serb aggression. 'We, as a member of the UN will never accept the abolition of our constitution, our legality, which is based on free and democratic elections,' he said. Yesterday ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey of Bosnia wrote to the UN calling for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to deal with 'gross manifestations of renewed Serbian and Montenegrin aggression.' The Bosnian Croats are the only ones who have so far accepted the Vance-Owen package. It was not certain last night whether the Bosnian Moslems or Serbs would bow to pressure by the mediators.</p>

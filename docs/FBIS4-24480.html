			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 31 (XINHUA) -- People in this capital of  the Tibet Autonomous Region seldom ate fresh vegetables a decade  ago, but now they have all sorts of vegetables coming from all  the other parts of the country everyday.    Qimai, a 40-year-old resident of this highland city, still  remembered her trips to the interior parts of the country and  the things she bought.    "When I returned home I brought back many things for my  family members, who appreciated the fresh vegetables most."    Vegetables are the main dishes on the tables of Chinese  families, but, located at an altitude of 4,000 m above sea  level, Lhasa has poor conditions for vegetable growing.    "We used to have radishes, potatoes and Chinese cabbage in  winter. The vegetable variety was limited even in summer,"  Qimai said.    "However, things have changed with the introduction of the  market economy and the government's efforts," she noted.    Every Sunday morning the middle-aged woman visits the nearby  Zongqolukang Market, the largest in the city with a total  transactional volume of 140 million yuan last year.    In less than one hour she returns home with two baskets of  green fresh vegetables.    "Now we can buy every kind of vegetables and fruits we need  here," she said happily.    The 100-m-long Zongqolukang Market, with five rows of  stalls,  has hotbed chives, balsam pears and "jinzhen" fungus from nearby  Sichuan Province, sweetbell red peppers from south China's  Guangdong Province, and garlic bolts, in addition to locally  grown cucumbers, pumpkins, asparagus, tomatoes and cauliflowers.    "The varieties here are similar to those in the markets in  Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province," said a Sichuan pedlar who  regularly ships vegetables from Chengdu to Lhasa by air.    At present, Lhasa has seven major vegetable markets, where  the sellers are mainly From Sichuan.    Among them is Xiang Hengguang from Chongqing, the largest  city in southwest China, who claimed to be the first vegetable  pedlar from the outside to the city.    In 1985 he rented a truck to transport vegetables from  Sichuan to Lhasa along the bumpy Sichuan-Tibet highway.    "I could not find any market when I first arrived in Lhasa,"  he said, "but my vegetables quickly sold out."    Now, about 300 pedlars specialize in transporting vegetables  from Chengdu, Lanzhou (capital of Gansu Province) and Xining,  capital of Qinghai Province, to the highland city.    Xiang said, "sometimes, we have to ship fresh vegetables by  air from southwest China's Yunnan Province or to Xining first,  and then hire trucks to carry them to Lhasa along the  Qinghai-Tibet Highway."    Once the vegetables arrive in Lhasa pedlars clean them and  put them in order at market stalls.    "It is worth doing such business when we see people happily  buying what they want and when we count the money we have earned  with our efforts," the 46-year-old man said.    To encourage more pedlars to come to Lhasa, the city  government began to lift the control of vegetable prices and  grant preferential treatment to anyone who transported and sold  vegetables in Lhasa in 1984. It also built a number of markets.    While encouraging farmers to grow vegetables, the city  government spent nine million yuan building three vegetable  farms around the city in 1986.    At present, the city produces about 30,000 tons of  vegetables  in more than 40 varieties a year.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> EVERETT WILL YELL FOR, NOT AT, MATES  </P> <P> Don't expect Ram quarterback Jim Everett to emulate Cleveland quarterback  Bernie Kosar, who went into a tirade Sunday after the Browns' sixth consecutive  loss. Kosar criticized his teammates for lack of concentration, and this week  said the Browns appear to have benefited from the lashing as they head into  this Sunday's game against the Rams.  </P> <P> "I'm sure it was out of frustration; I'm sure it's one way he wants to try to  motivate his troops," Everett said. "They've had a coaching change, and the  leadership probably is not there, so he's probably trying to take it upon  himself."  </P> <P> "I'm fortunate that we have some team leaders that are very solid individuals  here, who through thick and thin make the difference."  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson, while straining to make it clear he wasn't specifically  talking about Kosar's action, said he would never want an individual player  taking his teammates to task in the media.  </P> <P> "I think you feel betrayed when somebody does something like that, when in  essence it's behind your back, it's to the press," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Robinson also held an on-field meeting to make sure the Rams don't have a  letdown Sunday against the Cleveland Browns (2-9) after upsetting the San  Francisco 49ers.

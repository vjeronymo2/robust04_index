			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Bosnia officials fear Yugoslav war spreading THE UN decision not to send peace-keeping troops to the ethnically-mixed central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina raises the possibility of war spreading to the region, government ministers in Sarajevo said at the weekend. Moreover, Bosnian officials warned that if the European Community did not recognise the republic next Wednesday, both Croatia and Serbia would attempt to carve it up, even though this would lead to heavy loss of life. Mr Haris Silajic, foreign minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina, said the UN decision on peace-keeping troops was part of a compromise designed to persuade Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, to accept the international organisation's peace plan for Croatia. That plan, agreed earlier this month by the governments of Croatia, Serbia and the federal army, envisages the deployment of 10,000 troops in three areas in Croatia, including the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina, south-western Croatia. But Mr Silajic and Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, said in separate interviews that peace in Croatia would not mean peace throughout the rest of Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Hercegovina's coalition government consists of Moslems, Serbs and Croats, the three main ethnic groups of the republic's 4.3m population. The Bosnian Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, who is a close ally of Mr Milosevic, opposes moves by the republic's Croats and Moslems to seek EC recognition of independence. Mr Silajic said Mr Karadzic wanted to make Bosnia-Hercegovina part of the new, smaller Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. 'He has declared the independence of the Serb communities in the republic, and insists he wants this region to be part of the new Yugoslavia.' The EC's recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence would legitimise the republic's borders, and give the government in Sarajevo power to place the army under political control, or else ask it to leave the republic altogether. Government officials in Sarajevo also have no doubt that Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, wants part of Bosnia to compensate for any loss of Croatian territory to Serbia through the civil war. Bosnia's Croats are organised under the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of Bosnia, which is a member of the government coalition and is led by Mr Stjepan Kluijic. The group is the sister party of Croatia's ruling HDZ. Mr Kluijic admits he is 'a creation of Tudjman, but I do not support Tudjman's attempts to carve up Bosnia.' However, Mr Kluijic, a moderate, is under increasing pressure from the nationalist wing of his party.</p>

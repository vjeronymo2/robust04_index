			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu  (2799 2182 2976) and XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987  2639)]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- As a National People's  Congress [NPC] deputy elected in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee and state president,  attended a group discussion by the Shanghai delegation this  afternoon and discussed state affairs with them with great zest.  He stressed: The further reform is carried out, the more  extensively the pattern of interest sharing is adjusted, and the  greater the market role is, the more vigorously we should  advocate ideals, discipline, unity, and attention to national  interests, the more we should promote the spirit of helping each  other like passengers in the same boat, taking the interest of  the whole into account, and the more we should adhere to the  path of working together for common prosperity. He urged  Shanghai's working class and the broad mass of cadres and people  to continue carrying forward their fine tradition, play an  exemplary role in this regard, and make still greater  contributions to reform, development, and stability in Shanghai  and the whole nation.    At this afternoon's group discussion, the deputies earnestly  examined and discussed Premier Li Peng's "Report on the  Government Work" and freely aired their views. As Zhang Zhongli  and eight other deputies spoke, Jiang Zemin listened attentively  and took notes. He; Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal CPC  Committee secretary; Mayor Huang Ju; and Ye Gongqi, chairman of  the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's  Congress; chipped in from time to time. They talked cheerfully  and humorously and the meeting hall was permeated with a warm  atmosphere.    When he spoke, Jiang Zemin first pointed out: Taken  together,  the current international situation is good for China's  development and the situation at home is excellent. The better  the situation, the harder we should work to seize the  opportunity and take advantage of it to develop our country. We  must keep sober-minded and be fully aware of challenges faced by  China in the international community, as well as problems that  have arisen at home amid continuous progress. We should think  of danger in times of peace and work even harder and more  diligently.    Jiang Zemin said: The basic policy for and overall task of  the party's and state's work for 1994 have been adopted.  Everything we do must be subject to and serve the overall task  of "seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms,  opening up wider to the outside world, promoting development,  and maintaining stability." The Central Committee has decided  to make this the focus of work to achieve a sustained, rapid,  and healthy growth [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958  1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. This  overall task gives full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  ideas of development. We must fully understand it and implement  it comprehensively in our work. The key to successfully  fulfilling this overall task of the party and state is to  correctly handling relations between reform, development and  stability. We must, on one hand, work hard to deepen reform,  open up wider, and promote economic development; on the other  hand, we must pay close attention to maintaining a stable social  and political environment, promote reform and development amid  stability, and ensure long-term social stability through reform  and development. Reform, development and stability are like  three closely interrelated strategic pieces on a chess board.  When all three pieces are moved with skill and coordination,  the national situation as a whole will be enlivened. A wrong  move by one piece will put the two other in a tight spot,  causing a setback to the overall situation. Correctly handle  relations among the three represents an essential leadership art  in our modernization drive.    Speaking on promoting agriculture and rural work, Jiang  Zemin  said: Years of experience has told us that to develop  agriculture, there must be no wavering of the following in terms  of guiding ideology and basic policy: 1) agriculture as the  foundation of the national economy; 2) maintaining a steady  increase in the output of major farm products such as grain,  cotton, and cooking oil; 3) incremental increase in  agricultural input; 4) alleviating farmers' financial burdens  while increasing their incomes; 5) vigorously developing village  and township enterprises, encouraging rural industries to  subsidize agriculture, and creating jobs locally for the surplus  rural work force; 6) the policy of stabilizing the  responsibility system with the household contract linking output  to payment as the main form, perfecting the system of unified  management combined with independent management, developing a  network of collectivized services, and continuously enhancing  the economic strength of rural collectives; and 7) improving the  work efficiency of village-level organizations led by village  party branches. He also pointed out: Even a large industrial  city like Shanghai should uphold, without wavering, the overall  guiding ideology that takes agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy. In addition to being self-sufficient in  grain, the districts and counties in the outskirts must also do  a good job in implementing the "shopping basket" project and  ensuring an adequate supply of vegetables and other nonstable  foodstuffs in the city.    Speaking of continuing the efforts to invigorate  state-owned large and medium enterprises, Jiang Zemin stressed:  After decades of work, China has developed an independent  state-owned industrial system that is comprehensive in scope.  This is a unique advantage of the Chinese economy. Thanks to  this advantage, China has been able to steer clear of many of  the problems that are unavoidable in the course of the  development of a developing country. Large and medium  state-owned enterprises have made vital contributions to China's  economic growth. They serve as the backbone of China's economy  and will continue to play a leading role in expanding a  socialist market economy. Therefore, no matter what  difficulties we may face, we should make every effort to improve  the performance of state-owned large and medium enterprises.  Their economic strength can only be increased, never to be  weakened, because they are the lifeblood of China's socialist  economy and because they are where China's working class is  concentrated. It is true that a considerable number of large  and medium state-owned enterprises are beset with many  difficulties and urgent problems, and it is a major task of the  party, the government, and society as a whole to help them  overcome their difficulties and to quickly regain their  vitality. The fundamental solution is to deepen reform and  unswervingly separate the functions of the government from those  of the enterprise, to accelerate a change of their operational  mechanism, and to build a modern enterprise system. It is  imperative to push such enterprises onto the market place where  they should compete with one another and seek new ways to  overcome difficulties. Government at all levels must also guide  them and provide them with the needed support. He pointed out:  State enterprises, of different types and under different  conditions, can have diversified operational approaches and  varied ways to invigorate themselves; they can become very  creative on their own. However, this point should be made  abundantly clear: They must, all in all, preserve and increase  the value of state assets. This fundamental requirement must be  adhered to unswervingly. He expressed the hope that Shanghai  will accumulate more valuable experience in improving the  performance of large and medium state enterprises to usher in a  new situation.    Speaking of strengthening socialist spiritual civilization,  Jiang Zemin said: The grand goal of rejuvenating China and  accomplishing modernization has two aspects: a highly developed  material civilization and a highly developed spiritual  civilization. Socialism with Chinese characteristics calls for  the development of both civilizations. By repeatedly stressing  the need to persist in the principle of "giving equal emphasis  on two fronts and doing well in both," Comrade Deng Xiaoping  has reminded us again and again that while promoting material  civilization, we must not overlook spiritual civilization. It  would not be a comprehensive, correct implementation of the  party's basic policy if a locality, by paying more attention to  the former to the neglect of the latter over a long period, has  successfully promoted the economy but has seen a decline in  social conduct. The growth of social productive forces should  be reflected both in the accumulation of wealth and the  upgrading of the quality of workers. It will be a dangerous  deviation for a country, a nation, and individuals to emphasize  only the material side to the neglect of the spiritual side.  The suggestion that I made at last year's NPC session that we  need to promote the 64-character pioneering spirit [emancipate  the mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, dare  to innovate, work hard, press forward in the face of  difficulties, learn from foreign countries, constantly improve  ourselves, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and  impatience, work together as one, keep the national interest in  mind, be diligent and frugal, be upright and honest, work  vigorously to make the country prosperous, and serve selflessly]  has received widespread support. We all hope that this kind of  pioneering spirit will become the order of the day throughout  the whole nation and the whole society. It is hoped that we  will, as a result of the efforts in promoting spiritual  civilization, bring forth in large numbers builders of socialism  with Chinese characteristics who are well educated, self-  disciplined, and who have lofty ideals and moral integrity.    Jiang Zemin affirmed the achievements that Shanghai has  made in its work and spoke of his hopes for the city. He said:  In the past year, people in Shanghai have done good work under  the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and  government; its economic growth has been rapid, and the  situation is heartening. It is hoped that the broad ranks of  cadres and people in Shanghai will continue to exert themselves,  guard against arrogance and impatience, and create still better  performance in reform and opening up. He reiterated that  development of Pudong is a major policy decision of the central  authorities, that the development and opening of Pudong must be  carried out unswervingly, and that the central authorities'  policy toward Pudong will remain unchanged. He expressed the  hope that Pudong will become a real "dragon head" that will  bring about economic development in the Chang Jiang Valley and  that Shanghai will serve as a conduit for China's march to the  world and become a veritable international economic, financial,  and trade center. He also said that Shanghai's development can  never be separated from the support of other parts of the  country and that the latter's development also needs Shanghai's  support. Shanghai's working class and people should carry  forward the fine tradition of subordinating regional interests  to the national interest and make continuous and fresh  contributions to reform, opening up, and China's modernization  drive and to the development of other parts of the country,  especially the central and western regions.    Vice President Rong Yiren, another NPC deputy elected from  Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting. He said: China has  undergone tremendous changes in the political, economic, and  social sectors over the decades. The system of people's  democracy is being perfected daily and the economy is growing  steadily. Under this new situation, we should work with one  heart and one mind and carry forward the spirit of hard work,  plain living, and seeking truth from facts in order to turn  China into strong, prosperous country.</p>

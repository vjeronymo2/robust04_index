			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Mysterious tales VICTORIAN TALES OF MYSTERY AND DETECTION edited by Michael Cox Oxford Pounds 17.95, 578 pages OVER THE past several years Oxford University Press have brought out a series of anthologies devoted to the literature of crime, mystery and detection, specialising in the Victorian period. In collaboration with RA Gilbert, Michael Cox edited two of these volumes The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories and Victorian Ghost Stories: An Oxford Anthology. Now, on his own, he has produced a fat collection of some 31 tales, with a knowledgeable and useful introduction, under the title Victorian Tales of Mystery and Detection. The addicted reader of mysteries will find some expectable, now quaint, period elements: heathen idols, swarthy Mediterraneans, secret sects, not to mention exotic and seductive women, blunt Americans, thieving clerks (and gentlemen crooks as well). He will also find some familiar stories, favourite classic authors like Poe ('The Purloined Letter'), Le Fanu ('The Murdered Cousin'), Dickens ('Hunted Down'), Wilkie Collins ('Who Killed Zebedee?'), plus - inevitably - two contributions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, one with Holmes ('Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle') and one without ('The Lost Special'). In the 19th century when popular periodicals were numerous, the short story reigned supreme, and Sir Arthur was only the most enduring of dozens of practitioners. Various Victorian detectives, revived in this book, herald later celebrities: there are several ancestors of the elegant, flippant Sir Peter Wimsey as there is more than one armchair detective, who solves his cases without leaving his study, using only ratiocination (or 'little grey cells,' as a famous Belgian used to say). What is most fascinating about the these stories is the indirect picture of Victorian life they give. Trains figure prominently, as does the postal system (both operating with an often-remarked efficiency that today's metropolitans can only envy). Commuting was in its early stages, and the flight from the city had just begun. We not only learn about the geography of suburbia but also about its xenophobia. Cox singles out 'Alessandro Pozzone', which was published first in a monthly called Belgravia in 1878, as 'the beginnings of a new era', the heyday of the 'objective record of evidence and circumstance within a circumscribed location, and with a single ingenious idea at its heart'. But the new era was certainly as wide-ranging in its choice of subject and style as the earlier period had been, and this mammoth Oxford volume illustrates the richness of that lamented literary harvest.</p>

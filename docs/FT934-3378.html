			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Radical academic to review auditing The government is to appoint as head of an independent review of audit monitoring an academic with views radically opposed to its own belief in self-regulation. The selection of Professor Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at the University of Leeds, as a result of an open competition is expected to be announced in a parliamentary answer in the next few days. The review will focus on the degree of monitoring and supervision carried out by the self-regulatory bodies for auditors. Its conclusions are expected to be submitted early next year. Prof Moizer co-authored a study sponsored by the research board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last year. It called for an independent regulatory agency to oversee the fees and practices of audit firms, an extension of auditors' responsibilities beyond existing shareholders and the need for auditors to detect material fraud. The review will examine such topics as how frequently regulators visit the country's 14,000 registered auditors, and the nature of their inspections. It will consider the first two annual reports submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry from the two regulatory bodies: the joint monitoring unit, which represents the three chartered accountancy bodies, and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The department last night refused to confirm Prof Moizer's appointment, but when asked whether it was aware of his views, it said: 'We are well aware of his recent publications.' It added: 'The sort of person we will be looking for to provide an independent view is someone who would have a thorough knowledge of audit legislation and the regulatory regime. 'We want someone with an independent and critical outlook who will do a thoroughly professional job.'</p>

Army  spokeswoman Major Edith Vargas told ACAN-EFE that the Military  Command is coordinating surveillance along the border, which is  divided into seven military zones, although it has not felt the  need to send reinforcements.    On 1 January, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN)  declared war on the Mexican Government in the southeastern state  of Chiapas, where clashes have left more than 200 dead,  according to various sources. Since yesterday, EZLN rebels have  been present in the community of Guadalupe Tepeya, about 800 km  from the Guatemalan border north of Huehuetenango Department.  Security and defense in this area is under Military Zone No.  19, but the border area is also being guarded by troops and  detachments that are under commands [centrales] in the northern  departments of Quiche and Alta Verapaz.

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HALO HEAVEN;  </P> <P> NOW THAT ANGELS AREN'T A JOKE, THEY ARE LEARNING TO LAUGH  </P> <P> If this were last year, you'd probably be reading this on Page 9, back with the  hair-transplant ads and the Morro Bay fish counts, because by June 1988, the  Angels were no longer newsworthy. They were history.  </P> <P> Fifty games into their 1988 schedule, the Angels were 19-31, buried in last  place, already 16 1/2 games behind the Oakland Athletics. Those were the days  of whines and Rojas, of Junior Noboa and Chico Walker, of 12-4 blowouts, panic  in the outfield and seeming disarray in the front office.  </P> <P> Funny what 12 months, a change of managers, a change of catchers, two trades, a  $2.6-million free-agent signing, a reshuffled outfield and some miraculous  starting pitching can do to a team.  </P> <P> Fifty games into their 1989 schedule, the Angels have the best record in  baseball: 33-17. No Angel team has ever had a better 50-game start. The only  one that comes close, the Don Baylor-Rod Carew-Nolan Ryan Angels of 1979,  didn't log victory No. 33 until June 5.  </P> <P> These Angels have won 23 of their last 30 games, a .767 winning pace. These  Angels have already thrown 11 shutouts, two more than all of last season. These  Angels have limited the opposition to two or fewer runs 24 times.  </P> <P> So, what's right with these Angels?  </P> <P> Some play is being given the Angels' schedule, because most of it, so far, has  featured teams from the American League East. Clearly, this division is no  longer the old gray nightmare it used to be, what with Milwaukee and New York  ravaged by injury, Boston suffering the post-Bruce Hurst pitching blues,  Toronto breaking in a new manager and Detroit playing without its manager.  </P> <P> Catching the depressed AL East at precisely the right time, the Angels are 24-8  against teams from that division.  </P> <P> Against the West, the Angels are a mere 9-9 -- including a 2-5 fling with  Oakland. And they have yet to face Minnesota, Texas and Kansas City, which  opens a three-game series in Anaheim tonight.  </P> <P> The fresh-start theory must also be examined. When the Angels gave one to  Manager Doug Rader, they, in essence, gave the same to themselves. Whether it  was the fault of Cookie Rojas or not, Cookie Ball will always be remembered as  the failed experiment with the rookie manager, culminating in the confusion and  malaise that resulted in 12 consecutive season-ending defeats.  </P> <P> Symbolically, at least, the hiring of Rader wiped the Angels' slate clean.  </P> <P> In addition, the franchise cut several other ties to its past, bringing in two  new catchers, Lance Parrish and Bill Schroeder; two new starting pitchers, Bert  Blyleven and Jim Abbott; two new outfielders, Claudell Washington and Dante  Bichette, and a new left-handed relief pitcher, Bob McClure.  </P> <P> Each of those changes has helped improve the Angels. But, really, when this  group congregated at training camp in Mesa, Ariz., in late February, who would  have predicted that by June 1, the following developments would be reality?  </P> <P> The Angels lead the American League in team ERA.  </P> <P> Listen. The shelling has stopped. The 4.52 earned-run average the '88 Angels  possessed after 50 games has nearly been halved, with the '89 Angels checking  in at 2.69.  </P> <P> Now check out the individual ERA leaders in the American League. Three of the  top five wear halos on their caps -- No. 1 Kirk McCaskill at 1.49, No. 2 Chuck  Finley at 1.83, and No. 5 Blyleven at 2.36. And in the bullpen, McClure at 0.75  and Greg Minton at 1.14 are both pitching at Twilight Zone paces.  </P> <P> How this has happened has made for lively discussion.  </P> <P> Early on, there was the pitch-inside argument, which credited Parrish and  Schroeder for altering age-old Angel pitching strategy by calling a more  aggressive game, thereby indicting the pitch-calling of age-old ex-Angel  catcher Bob Boone.  </P> <P> Since Sports Illustrated and the Sporting News gave this argument a national  forum, soon followed by rebuttals by Boone, the subject has become rather  sticky with the Angels. Already, Rader and McCaskill have had phone  conversations with Boone to smooth matters over.  </P> <P> Still, the verbal volleying of early May should lend an extra edge to this  weekend's Boone reunion at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> More conventional, and considerably less controversial, is the  us-against-the-world argument, which has served to inspire Angel pitchers by  pitting them against their detractors, of which there were many before the  season.  </P> <P> "I think they looked at it as a challenge," Angel pitching coach Marcel  Lachemann said. "When we didn't sign (Bruce) Hurst or (Nolan) Ryan during the  winter, there was an outside perception of 'It's all over.' I think our  pitchers looked at this as their chance to prove something.  </P> <P> "And, not to take anything away from Hurst or Ryan, because they're both  outstanding pitchers, but I don't see how they could be doing any better than  the guys with us now."  </P> <P> In actuality, the Angels' pitching revival has happened for some simple  reasons. McCaskill is uninjured again. Blyleven is out of the Metrodome. Finley  has matured. And Abbott has finally lent stability to the No. 5 starting slot.  </P> <P> Now, if only Mike Witt can come around.  </P> <P> Wally Joyner is off to a worse start than he had in 1988 -- and no one has  noticed.  </P> <P> Popular thought holds that the Angels staggered at the gate in 1988, never to  be heard from again, because their cleanup hitter, Joyner, got off to a slow  start.  </P> <P> Now ponder these numbers:  </P> <P> After the first two months of 1988, Joyner was batting .280 with two home runs  and 19 RBIs.  </P> <P> After the first two months of 1989, Joyner is batting .249 with one home run  and 18 RBIs.  </P> <P> Obviously, what these last two months have proven is that the Angels should  not, and do not, live by Wally alone.  </P> <P> Slack has been picked up by:  </P> <P>  -- Johnny Ray, who, happy again as the second base starter, drove in 22 runs  during May after returning from the disabled list.  </P> <P>  -- Devon White, who has the numbers -- .296, seven home runs, 30 RBIs, 20  stolen bases -- of which MVP seasons are made.  </P> <P>  -- Claudell Washington, the free-agent addition who has given the Angels  consistency at .311 and punch, six home runs, at the top of the lineup.  </P> <P>  -- Chili Davis, still at his best with a bat in his hands, still driving in  the clutch runs -- 25 RBIs overall.  </P> <P> "You're not going to hold this lineup down," Finley said.  </P> <P> It has become a more effective lineup, now that Joyner is no longer required to  hold it up.  </P> <P> The entire Angel outfield, which still includes Davis, has committed but two  errors.  </P> <P> In April and May of 1988, there was nothing routine about a fly ball to the  Angel outfield. Ray spent 40 ill-advised games in left field and made five  errors. White was sidelined after knee surgery and his replacement in center  field, Chico Walker, was hardly the man. Finally, in right field, there was  Chili, with nine errors to his name by June 1, destined for a club-record 19 by  season's end.  </P> <P> If you were an Angel pitcher, would you be demoralized?  </P> <P> Credit the signing of Washington with another assist here. Washington is no  challenge to White's Gold Glove collection -- he'll still misjudge a ball now  and then -- but his presence alone has effectively improved a pair of outfield  positions.  </P> <P> Washington has solidified the right-field position -- zero errors in 36 games  -- while enabling Davis to move to left, where he has significantly narrowed  his margin for error -- two in 44 games.  </P> <P> Two full months from White has helped, too. In short, White has been his usual  scintillating self in center.  </P> <P> "Every day, he does something that either amazes you or astounds you," Rader  says.  </P> <P> Catcher has become the power position in the lineup.  </P> <P> Another change in the post-Boone era: Home runs from the men behind the plate.  </P> <P> In seven years as the Angels' starting catcher, Boone did not hit more than  nine home runs in a single season.  </P> <P> In their first two months as Boone's successors, Parrish and Schroeder have  already combined for 12.  </P> <P> Parrish, regaining his confidence after slipping into his own personal Bermuda  Triangle in Philadelphia, is batting .273 with seven home runs, including five  in his last nine games.  </P> <P> Schroeder, whose home-run ratio in Milwaukee, one every 21 at-bats, ranked near  the top among active catchers, has homered five times in his first 46 at-bats  as an Angel.  </P> <P> Such a presence cannot be overstated, according to White, particularly in the  case of Parrish, a cleanup hitter who often bats seventh for the Angels.  </P> <P> "Lance Parrish is a big man in the lineup," White said. "If something happened  to anyone up in the order, he'd be the perfect fill-in man."  </P> <P> For the time being, he has done much to fill out the Angel offense.  </P> <P> Doug Rader has fostered peace and prosperity in our time.  </P> <P> Rader continues to puff away on his cancer sticks, but he's still doing his  damnedest to kick that other habit of his -- his past.  </P> <P> Privately, Rader acknowledges his belief that people are still waiting for that  first explosion of temper, that first misstep; so publicly, Rader treads very  carefully. He won't criticize another player or manager or umpire and will  sidestep any question pointed in that direction. His new mantra seems to be, No  controversy. No controversy . . .  </P> <P> If that has sometimes made for bland copy, it has also made for a steadier  course. Said one Angel official: "Doug tempered the (Mark) McLemore-Ray  situation about as well as anyone could. He saw to it that Abbott wasn't built  up too much in the spring. And he's defused a lot of potential controversies,  like whether or not Bichette should make the team."  </P> <P> With help from such veterans as Blyleven, the inveterate prankster, Rader has  also accomplished the near impossible -- defrosting the Angels' clubhouse.  Where before the sounds of surliness dominated the atmosphere, practical jokes  are now played along with loud rock music and players actually seem to be  enjoying themselves.  </P> <P> Angel baseball has become a laughing matter.  </P> <P> "Everyone says we have a much looser clubhouse," White said. "The people in  here are like a family now. I only played here two years so I don't know what  went on before, but it seems like everybody's much closer."  </P> <P> And the reason for that?  </P> <P> "The manager is pretty loose," White said. "He lets you pretty much go out  there and do who you've got to do. So far, everything's falling just right."  </P> <P> White laughed.  </P> <P> "Of course, I haven't seen his bad side yet," he said. "I'm not jumping the  gun, saying he's a great manager or anything. Things have been going right  since spring training. Nothing bad has happened yet."  </P> <P> The same approach could be applied to the state of the Angels: Things have been  going right since spring training. Let us wait. The first slump has yet to  come.  </P> <P> When it does, how the Angels respond and recover will tell a lot about their  chances of continuing to push the A's for the division title. But until then,  the Angels have to be satisfied with whatever small steps of progress they have  managed to take.  </P> <P> At last, they're front-page news again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES  </P> <P> A.L.

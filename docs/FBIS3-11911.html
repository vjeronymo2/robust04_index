If anyone  has any doubts about that, he just needs to look at current  relations between the United States and the Russian Federation.    Everything seems to indicate that the western pretext of the  so-called "Soviet danger" is tending to change its name to the  "Russian danger." Must there always be some sort of threat?    Defense Secretary William Perry said on 14 March that there  could develop in Russia an "authoritarian, militarist, and  imperialist nation hostile toward the West." In such a  situation, "we might see the birth of a new version of the Cold  War." Perry added that his country should therefore have a  "strategy for protection."    According to the 6 February edition of THE WASHINGTON POST,  British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said before the  conference on security policy in Munich, Germany that "the most  probable threat to European security" is the potential danger  that Russia might try to recover control over the territories of  the "former Soviet empire." Has anyone ever said that is one of  Russia's intentions?    Rifkind said such signals come not only from nationalist  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy but also from Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other "moderate" officials. Are  they real signals or are they unfounded fears leading to a  search for pretexts for doing what they do in practice?    Following the Clinton-Boris Yeltsin summit in Moscow last  January, both sides agreed on the need to move on to new stages  of cooperation, including a U.S. promise to grant the Russian  Government relatively modest assistance of $2.5 billion.    New obstacles to relations emerged suddenly. One of them was  the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the ultimatum announced  by NATO, led by the United States, to initiate air attacks on  Serb positions if they did not withdraw their artillery. The  carrot comes before the stick; it was always that way.    Later a Russian initiative gave an important boost to a  solution to the controversy, at least temporarily, to avoid  further air attacks. Russia achieved a victory with this  measure.    Then something emerged by chance as if pulled out of a  magician's sleeve: the famous case of alleged spy Aldrich Ames,  a CIA official accused of working for special Soviet services  since 1985 and later for similar Russian agencies. Was it  discovered now or was it saved for the proper moment? Tempers  flared.    It seems unreal that the friendship reached after so much  "sacrifice" in the Cold War years (some people are already  speaking of a "Cold Peace") [words indistinct]. It is not known  how many they may have stored away in the drawer for a proper  moment. A Russian general said he was surprised by the U.S.  reaction, arguing that the CIA does worse things in Moscow.    But let's not fool ourselves. These are not fortuitous  incidents. It is just that the huge propaganda machinery is  cranked up when the system needs it. (That is how freedom of  the press works in that country).    At least that is how the directors of the Russian agency  ITAR-TASS think. A recent dispatch stated: "...attempts to  give a political character (to the case) have shown once again  that the intelligence service is a policy tool that can be  efficiently used at the appropriate moment."    Perhaps at another time the Ames case would not have had  such  an effect. It seems it was necessary now, especially when one  keeps in mind that the current administration has been accused  by quite a few "hawks" of being [words indistinct].    That is not the case if we are really objective. The fact  that Bill Clinton was opposed to the war in Vietnam in the  1960's (as many people were), the fact that he was in favor of  lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military, and the fact  that he is maintaining an image of almost total dedication to  domestic issues does not mean that he, as commander in chief of  the U.S. Armed Forces, is not taking "strong" measures for his  country's defense.    Only in this sense can we interpret the activities that  continue to be periodically conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces  both inside the continental United States and abroad.    According to reliable sources, even though they have pledged  not to aim their powerful rockets at Russian territory, the  country's strategic forces periodically conduct massive  deployments of planes and perform tests of nuclear attacks "on  powers abroad." They are not exactly doing this to test air  attacks on Canada, their NATO ally.    Some of these "superbombers" head south of Florida as if  familiarizing themselves with the theater of operations near  Cuba. Is this part of U.S. defense?    They are also deploying their strategic defense systems  against the nuclear arsenal supposedly launched from Russia.  Apparently their friendship is not solid enough.    The U.S. Navy maintains at its air and naval station in Key  West, Florida, an "aggressor" squadron of TA-4 and F-16N  bombers, which have red stars drawn on their vertical  stabilizers. The stars identify the Russian planes, which they  imitate. These "aggressors" are used to train U.S. pilots in a  realistic environment, and there is no doubt that they are being  trained to fight a well-defined adversary. It seems that not  only ashes remain.    Another example is the existence of units called "opposition  forces" in training sites at Ft. Irwin, California, and Ft.  Polk, Louisiana, which have foreign weapons, especially of  Russian origin. Those units employ the tactics and uniforms of  that country.    The Americans are also trying to exert a direct influence on  the Russian armed forces. To achieve this they are encouraging  the implementation of joint maneuvers in the Black Sea, the  Mediterranean, and the Baltic Sea, as well as visits by B-52  bombers, the same ones that conduct attack exercises on Russian  territory, among other activities.    These are only a few examples that show that the popular  saying may also be applied in this case. There were many years  of intense fire...and some ashes, and perhaps a few fires had to  remain. Fortunately, for the moment, there are not many...</p>

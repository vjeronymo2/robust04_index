			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: New brands help Seton Healthcare to Pounds 6m SETON Healthcare, the medical products and sports equipment group which has expanded rapidly since coming to the market two years ago, has turned in a strong growth in profits. Under FRS 3, restated pre-tax profits for the year to February 28 increased from Pounds 2.84m to Pounds 6.1m, but last year's figure was depressed by an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.49m. Adjusting for the exceptional losses, profits growth was 41 per cent. Turnover rose by 4 per cent, from Pounds 37.2m to Pounds 38.6m. The group said operating profit as a percentage of sales had increased from 13.7 to 17.1 per cent and a further improvement was predicted. Seton's acquisition focus has been on over-the-counter brands, which now account for more than 25 per cent of sales. Four acquisitions - Mycota, Betadine, Cupal and some brands from Crookes - were completed during the year at a cost ofPounds 14.2m. The healthcare division's sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 33.6m. Taking account of acquisitions and disposals, its underlying organic growth rate was 8 per cent, and operating profits rose from Pounds 4.54m to Pounds 5.98m. The group said the brands acquired had helped it to become one of the top 10 companies in terms of OTC sales to UK pharmacies. The sports and leisure division's sales dipped from Pounds 5.56m to Pounds 5m, but its operating profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 605,000, which Mr Iain Cater, Seton's chief executive, described as an outstanding performance. Adjusting for the exceptionals, earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 16.3p (12.7p). A final dividend of 4.1p (3.6p) gives a total for the year of 5.8p (5.1p). COMMENT These results maintain Seton's impressive track record. The increased profitability partly reflects the group's move towards higher-margin OTC products, but also shows the benefits of increased economies of scale in manufacture and distribution. The sports business - selling shin guards and goalkeeper's gloves - is also well placed for any recovery in spending. However, the group now has quite a lot to digest, and will invest Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m in a new facility in Oldham over the next two years. Forecast earnings of Pounds 8.1m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 19.5. That looks up with events, particularly since the company will not hesitate to come to the market to fund further acquisitions.</p>

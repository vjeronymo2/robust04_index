			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / People: Hollas Hollas, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, yesterday announced the resignation of Allan Richens as chairman and chief executive of Hawkshead Sportswear, its 50 per cent-owned outdoor clothing mail order group. The move marks the latest stage of a wide-ranging overhaul at Hollas, which began last autumn when Julian Lee was appointed chief executive. The departure of Richens - formerly finance director at Empire Stores Group and Hawkshead chief executive since November 1990 - follows trading difficulties which cost Hollas Pounds 71,000 last year. Lee, who presided over the successful sale of Bricom in 1990 and came out of retirement - at the ripe old age of 48 - to run Hollas, said: 'The anticipated improvements in Hawkshead Sportswear did not come through in the year.' Executives from Hollas, which owns Hawkshead jointly with Kleeneze, the home shopping business, will take responsibility for day-to-day operational matters at the Cumbria-based subsidiary. Clive Westbrook, Hollas's group financial controller, will look after its financial affairs, while merchandising control will pass to Kleeneze. 'With these changes, I believe we will see an improvement in Hawkshead's performance during the current financial year,' Lee said.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN ADVISES QUICK REFORM IN S. AFRICA;  </P> <P> SAYS THAT HOLDING LINE AGAINST SANCTIONS MAY HINGE ON PROGRESS  </P> <P> If acting South African President Frederik W. de Klerk fails to quickly use his  election mandate for political reform, "then holding the line against punitive  sanctions will be infinitely more difficult," Britain's deputy prime minister,  Geoffrey Howe, cautioned Thursday.  </P> <P> The remark, seen as a thinly veiled warning that British patience with  Pretoria's apartheid policy may be running out, is considered significant  because Britain has been the most adamant major Western nation to oppose  economic sanctions as a method of trying to force South Africa to dismantle  apartheid, its system of racial segregation.  </P> <P> At the same time, Foreign Secretary John Major called the results of  Wednesday's election in South Africa "a very formidable mandate . . . for  progressive change."  </P> <P> "It has no friends left these days, apartheid, and the sooner it goes the  better," Major said.  </P> <P> South Africa's ruling National Party won its 11th straight victory in  Wednesday's whites-only elections, but lost ground to opponents on both the  left and right.  </P> <P> National Party leader De Klerk, who took over as acting president last month  from the ailing Pieter W. Botha, is seen by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  government as representing the best chance for reform in the country. Officials  here have said privately for weeks that they had reason to expect dramatic  moves after Wednesday's balloting.  </P> <P> Thatcher is believed to have made such moves a condition for a state visit to  South Africa -- a visit much desired by the white regime there.  </P> <P> London has steadfastly opposed economic sanctions against Pretoria, arguing  that they would not work and that the West has a better chance to influence  positive change in South Africa by keeping open its lines of communication to  the government. Britain's position has helped to soften punitive moves against  Pretoria by other Commonwealth and North Atlantic Treaty Organization  countries, including the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defends Sanctions Stand  </P> <P> Major, in a radio interview Thursday, defended Britain's stand on sanctions and  carefully skirted the question of what specific reforms London wants. Howe, a  former foreign secretary, was more direct when he spoke at a meeting of the  Assn. of American Correspondents in London.  </P> <P> "As De Klerk himself has said, he has a mandate for reform," Howe said. "We  certainly hope, and I have reason to believe, he wants to use that (mandate).  If he doesn't, then holding the line against punitive sanctions will be  infinitely more difficult."  </P> <P> Asked what actions and what timetable the Thatcher government would consider  satisfactory in South Africa, Howe said:  </P> <P> "We, with the rest of the Free World, wish to see the release of Nelson Mandela  (the jailed African National Congress leader) and the opening up of genuine  political dialogue between the government and the black majority in South  Africa. Clearly, one would want to see that happening on a time scale that is  identifiable and visible."  </P> <P> Major said in the interview with Independent Radio News that while the election  disclosed "a rapidly changing opinion in South Africa," it will still take time  for the system to change.  </P> <P> He continued, "The important thing is to make sure that (change) comes about in  a measured and peaceful way and in a way that will stick permanently."  </P> <P> He said that Britain's "influence of restraint on South Africa over recent  years has been very useful, and I think the fact that we have not always  offered all-purpose denunciation of South Africa has enabled us to retain that  influence."  </P></p>

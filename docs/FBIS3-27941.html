			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by science and technology reporter Kazuteru </F> Yoshikawa, from the "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series, on  the Science and Technolgy Agency: "Problem With Policy on Atomic  Energy"]    [Excerpt] Hearing with 'Fairness' in Mind [subhead]    On the morning of 3 December, Satsuki Eda, director general  of the Science and Technology Agency [STA] who heads the Atomic  Energy Commission [AEC], members of the AEC including Deputy  Chairman Akira Oyama, Shoichiro Kobayashi, chairman of Kansai  Electric Power Company, and Hiroto Ishida, director of the STA  Atomic Energy Bureau, were gathered at a hotel in Tokyo. The  occasion was to hold an "open hearing" on the atomic energy  policy, and this was the first such experience for the  commission.    The purpose of holding the open hearing was for the  commission to listen to views from extensive sectors of the  people including those who are opposed to the use of atomic  energy, and thus to take wide-ranging views into the long-term  programs which will become the foundation for the nation's  atomic energy policy. The commission took caution to be "fair"  by having a preparatory committee -- consisting of academics and  specialists -- select the representatives to speak in the  hearing.    The open hearing was held in acceptance of critical voices  charging that the STA's "policies on atomic energy tend to be  decided through maneuverings of officials behind the scenes."  Director General Eda, since he was named to the post in August,  has emphasized he will conduct "open atomic energy  administration," and is known to have "instructed the officials  to make open discussions possible."    What brought a change to the STA's atomic energy  administration was the uproar over the shipment of plutonium in  January 1993. When plutonimum was shipped in from France, the  government tried to treat it as a secret, and hide, information  on the navigation plan and timetable of the plutonimum carrier  on the grounds of "needs to assure security" for it. But this  caused complaints not only from antinuclear groups but also from  the countries, waters of which the transport ship had to pass  through. Plutonium is a substance extracted from spent fuel in  atomic power stations, and the government thinks the substance  will prove to be a long-term energy resource of dependable  supply. But the uproar over the plutonium shipment in January  was something that betrayed the government's expectations very  much, and the incident has since turned into an issue which is  likely to impact the fundamentals of the atomic energy  administration of Japan.    That being the case, it can be said that a key to the  success  of future atomic enegy administration lies not only in whether  the safety of atomic energy and plutonium can or cannot be  assured but also in how well the government's intention to use  it peacefully can be understood by the people of the nation and  other countries. It was for this reason that Japan came to  present its own proposal on international control of plutonium  in September -- in beginning of the work to build up the  atmosphere of the international community toward accepting  peaceful use of the substance.    The allocation for atomic power projects in the STA budget  is  whopping, holding 55.6 percent of the total (in 1993) -- way  over 27 percent assigned to space projects. The AEC's stand of  rejecting "interferences" by any other offices has been a target  of criticism. From the first day of its birth, the AEC has been  chided as "a commission practicing Monroeism." Of course,  Ishida, director of the agency's Atomic Energy Bureau, himself  insists "Monroeism is no longer here."  <H5>  In Charge of Science-Related Budget </H5>   Lately, what has been growing in the agency is the work of  coordinating policies on science and technology. The agency is  acting as the government's traffic cop on research and  development projects initiated by ministries and agencies under  their jurisdiction. It is also helping in preparing the  groundwork for research efforts and training personnel.    The STA holds legal power to regulate policies with regard  to  making estimates on science and technology-related expenses of  the entire government. As such, it has the right to check the  contents of budget demands of the government offices, but it  does not try to exercise the right. A senior official of the STA  Secretariat explained: "We do not want to invite complaints from  other government offices by exercising the regulatory right.  After all, their increases in science and technology budget  contribute to promoting interests of the STA."    What the STA considers important is the Science and  Technology Conference (chaired by Prime Minister Hosokwa) in  which the STA and the Ministry of Education jointly serve as the  secretariat. The conference is attended by ministers of science  and technology-related offices. Projects supported by the  conference are as good as having been approved by the government  in fact. Preparing groundwork at the conference is important,  and the conference is the arena where the STA carries out its  function as a regulatory office.    One new task facing the STA is the preparation of the  foundation for research projects that transcend borders of  government offices. Kinju Atarashi, director of the agency's  Science and Technology Promotion Bureau, said a "symbolic  project" is the intra-ministry research information network  being considered as a new project of 1994. Its aim is to  connect the research information networks of all ministries and  agencies, and to put the STA in charge of making budget demands  on it.

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL BRYANT'S DOUBLE LIFE;  </P> <P> SUSPECT: NEIGHBORS WHO KNEW THE AMIABLE MAN ARE SHAKEN BY THE MURDER CHARGE  AGAINST HIM.  </P> <P> To those who knew him in Woodland Hills, Michael Bryant was a soft-spoken and  generous man who kept mostly to himself.  </P> <P> Though reclusive, he was far from unfriendly. He was quick to volunteer his  help to neighbors. He sent Christmas cards and friendly notes to his landlady.  He liked to show off the tricks he had taught his pet Doberman.  </P> <P> Bryant, 44, told people he was a free-lance photographer. But often he spent  his time gardening in his fenced back yard and was proud of the cherry tomatoes  he gave to friends. "They were better than you could buy in a supermarket," his  landlady said.  </P> <P> But authorities say Michael Bryant and the life he led in Los Angeles was a  facade; that, in fact, Bryant was Francis W. Malinosky, a Vermont school  administrator who dropped from sight in 1979 after he became the prime suspect  in the disappearance of a teacher with whom he had been romantically involved.  </P> <P> Malinosky's double life came to an end earlier this month when he was traced by  local and Vermont authorities to Woodland Hills. He was arrested and charged  with the murder of the missing teacher. And while Malinosky waits in Los  Angeles County jail for an extradition hearing, mystery still surrounds him.  </P> <P> Investigators say that when they searched Malinosky's belongings they found  cameras and a business card suggesting he, indeed, was a photographer. But the  only photos found were of him smiling amid fields of marijuana plants. No  tomatoes were found at his house, but police said several pounds of packaged  marijuana seeds were found in the garage. And in the unpretentious, 23-year-old  Volkswagen he drove, investigators found a coffee can crammed with $217,000 in  $100 bills.  </P> <P> "Finding this guy just opened up more questions," said Sgt. Leo Blais, a  Vermont State Police detective who has tracked the Malinosky case for years. "I  am trying to get an idea of what he has been doing for 10 years and it is hard.  We don't know much about him."  </P> <P> Those who thought they knew Michael Bryant of Woodland Hills have also had to  face the same enigma. A man they viewed as a good neighbor or tenant is charged  with murder and is suspected of hiding behind at least four aliases and earning  his living at least in part by selling marijuana seeds along with instructions  on their planting and cultivation.  </P> <P> "This really comes out of left field," said Lilian Darling Holt, Bryant's  landlord for nearly five years. "It is devastating. Michael was a marvelous  tenant and person.  </P> <P> "This whole thing doesn't seem right," she said. "It seems that over the years  there would have been something that would now click and I'd be able to say,  'Son of a gun, I now see how this could be.' But there is nothing like that. I  just feel very bad. I wish I could do something for him."  </P> <P> Holt is not alone in being both perplexed and supportive of Bryant. Neighbors  he was friendly with in the 4900 block of Topanga Canyon Boulevard have  volunteered to care for his dog while he is in jail. And an attorney who met  Bryant a few years ago in a coffee shop is now helping him fight extradition to  Vermont.  </P> <P> "There is complete shock among those who knew him," said the attorney, Gregg  Michael Abrams. "He was the kind of guy most people would want as a neighbor."  </P> <P> Abrams said Malinosky disappeared from Vermont and began using false names  because he was being hounded by authorities for a crime he did not commit.  </P> <P> "There is more to this case than meets the eye," Abrams said. "You don't need  to be a genius to see why he would leave Vermont. He believed a witch hunt was  under way, and he decided to leave."  </P> <P> But authorities insist they have made no mistake. Malinosky is the only suspect  in the Nov. 5, 1979, disappearance and apparent murder of Judith Leo-Coneys.  The 32-year-old mother of a small boy disappeared after telling friends she was  going to a house owned by Malinosky.  </P> <P> "Everyone out here I talk to about him can't believe it," said Blais while he  was in Los Angeles last week investigating Malinosky's life here. "They keep  telling me he isn't the type."  </P> <P> So far Blais has established that Malinosky lived in the Los Angeles area in  the early 1980s and worked as a house painter. He later moved to Utah and then  back to Los Angeles, where beginning in late 1985 he lived alone in the  two-bedroom Topanga Canyon Boulevard house.  </P> <P> Along the way, Malinosky somehow picked up one alias -- Barry Vandiver Bryant  -- that actually was the name of a real person, Blais said. The real Barry  Bryant, of Charlotte, N.C., has since changed his name because of credit  problems that began when Malinosky took his identity.  </P> <P> In 1979, Malinosky was, on the surface, an unlikely murder suspect. He had  taught for several years in Burlington area schools and was known to many in  the northern Vermont community. At 34, he was assistant director of special  education for the Burlington School Department.  </P> <P> Bearded and slightly balding, he was a man who enjoyed the outdoors. He had an  apartment in Burlington and owned a house in the rural town of Shelburne, which  was more convenient for hunting and skiing. A mellow-voiced widower, his wife  having shot herself to death in 1976, Malinosky was raising a daughter and son.  </P> <P> But in mid-1979 Malinosky's life apparently went into a tailspin when  Leo-Coneys broke off a two-year relationship with him. According to Chittenden  County court records, he was deeply hurt by the breakup, had sought psychiatric  counseling and had been seen at least once spying through the windows of  Leo-Coneys' apartment.  </P> <P> Two weeks before her disappearance, Leo-Coneys was held at gunpoint by  Malinosky for several hours while he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade her  to resume their relationship, records say.  </P> <P> On the morning of Nov. 5, 1979, Leo-Coneys told friends and relatives she was  going to drop by Malinosky's home in Shelburne to retrieve something of hers.  She chose that morning to go because she knew he was scheduled to be at work in  Burlington.  </P> <P> But Leo-Coneys was never seen again. She was reported missing by her family  later that day and investigators learned that Malinosky had not gone to work or  even called his office to explain why. That night, when he was spotted driving  his van in Shelburne and questioned by police, he said he took the day off to  go bird hunting and did not see Leo-Coneys.  </P> <P> Leo-Coney's car was found at a junkyard in the town of Roxbury the next day. A  handwritten note on the windshield said the car could be stripped for parts and  was signed "R. Peterson."  </P> <P> Malinosky was questioned repeatedly after the disappearance but on Dec. 2,  1979, he put his children on a bus to his former in-laws' home, emptied his  bank accounts and disappeared. Though Leo-Coneys' body has never been found,  authorities claim they have amassed convincing evidence pointing to Malinosky.  </P> <P> According to court records, FBI experts matched Malinosky's handwriting to the  note found on Leo-Coneys' car at the Roxbury junkyard. Investigators also found  a cab driver who reported picking Malinosky up in Roxbury on the day of the  woman's disappearance. A cab dispatcher who took the call remembered talking to  Malinosky. She had once been one of his students.  </P> <P> Detectives had also noticed while interviewing Malinosky the first time that  his parka was torn and leaking its down filling. The same type of down was  found in Leo-Coneys' car, court records say.  </P> <P> Police believed after Malinosky's disappearance that he might have killed  himself, and the case languished without any charges being filed.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Leo-Coneys case was assigned to Blais to be updated and, using a  computer search, the detective learned Malinosky was alive and had apparently  lived in Salt Lake City in the mid-1980s, where he used his own name to get a  driver's license.  </P> <P> Blais went to Utah but Malinosky was gone.  </P> <P> Once again, the case languished, until last year when a new state attorney,  William Sorrell, was appointed and made the Leo-Coneys investigation a  priority. The case was presented Feb. 20, 1990, to a grand jury, which  concluded that Leo-Coneys was dead, and a warrant was issued two days later  charging Malinosky with her slaying.  </P> <P> According to court records, Malinosky's daughter told investigators she had met  her father earlier this year at the St. Moritz Hotel in New York City. Blais  learned that the hotel room Malinosky used was paid for by a credit card issued  to a Barry Vandiver Bryant. From that point, credit card billings under that  name were traced to four private mail boxes in the San Fernando Valley and  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Members of the Los Angeles Police Department fugitive squad questioned the  private mail box proprietors who identified Barry Bryant as Malinosky. And on  April 12, the detectives were alerted by one of the mail-drop operators that  Bryant had just picked up his mail.  </P> <P> Police and FBI agents immediately went to the area on Ventura Boulevard in  Woodland Hills, but Bryant was already gone.  </P> <P> The investigators decided to check area motels, and a clerk at a Best Western  in the 21800 block of Ventura Boulevard identified a photo of Malinosky as a  guest who had been renting a room since Feb. 20 -- the day the grand jury  hearing began in Vermont. Investigators now believe he moved to the motel after  learning, possibly through friends or family in Vermont, that the grand jury  was investigating the case.  </P> <P> Police watched the motel room and Malinosky was arrested that afternoon when he  drove up in his 1967 Volkswagen. He had papers identifying himself as Michael  Bryant that showed his address as a house about five blocks away on Topanga  Canyon Boulevard.  </P> <P> In the car, police found the coffee can containing $217,000, along with a  material normally used to keep moisture out of packages. Detectives said the  powder indicates the can of money may have been buried previously.  </P> <P> Investigators were puzzled by where Malinosky had gotten the cash. But the next  day, his house was searched and dozens of packets of several different  varieties of marijuana seeds were found in the garage. Police theorized that  Malinosky may have accumulated the cache of money by selling drugs or the  seeds.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Ronald Tuckett said marijuana cultivation  instructions and other drug paraphernalia were found in the garage.  </P> <P> "It looks like he may have been in the mail order business," Tuckett said.  </P> <P> Though the drug investigation is continuing, it is unlikely local charges will  be filed against Malinosky because they could hinder his extradition to Vermont  to face the murder charge, authorities said.  </P> <P> Alerted on the morning of April 12, the day Malinosky picked up his mail, Blais  was already flying from Vermont to Los Angeles when the man he had pursued  since 1986 was taken into custody. The detective and suspect met for the first  time in a holding cell.  </P> <P> "All he did was stare at the ground," Blais said. "He was very upset. I  introduced myself and he said, 'I know who you are.' I said, 'I know who you  are, too, but do you want me to call you Frank or Michael or Barry or what?' He  said to call him Frank. It was a strange feeling to finally meet him face to  face."  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: AMB ahead despite Spanish losses Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-biggest insurance group after Allianz, reported net profits of DM85m (Dollars 50m) for last year, up from DM73m. The increase was achieved in spite of a sharp fall in operating profits from mainstream insurance activities. These fell to DM147m from DM289m. They were hit by a number of factors, including large losses at the two Spanish subsidiaries. The group has been in the throes of an intense reorganisation over the past year. The most important move was the sale of a majority interest in the BfG Bank to Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, concluded at the end of 1992. After years of losses, the group benefited from a special dividend of DM24.6m last year as part of the terms of the sale. Total unconsolidated premium income for the group was DM14.4bn, up 8.8 per cent. Pre-tax profits from continuing businesses fell to DM105.5m from DM111.3m, while the dividend for 1993 will be unchanged at DM14 a share. AMB predicted that the 1994 result would at least match 1993, in spite of the long-awaited liberalisation of the German insurance market this summer. The aim is to take premium income up to DM15.5bn in the current year. Mr Wolfgang Kaske, chief executive, said the group had implemented a wide-ranging rationalisation ahead of the opening up of the domestic insurance market under European Union legislation on July 1. He predicted competition would gradually increase in the German market over the next few years. This would be reflected in new products and pressure on prices, although he said the initial impact of the changes would be limited. It has being tidying up its group structure, acquiring majority control of the numerous satellite companies in the AMB orbit. For example, the group has taken its holding in Volksfursorge, a large German insurance company, to 75 per cent from 50 per cent. AGF, the French insurance group, owns 33 per cent of AMB, balanced by a block of shares owned by large German institutions such as Dresdner Bank.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Contracting margins: The gloom among UK builders Construction output in the UK is rising and companies are returning to profit after record losses. So why do British contractors sound so universally gloomy? Is it that, like the apocryphal farmer, they will never admit to better times, or is the structure of the industry unable to meet the challenges of recovery? Building material companies forecast a 2 per cent rise in construction this year, the first annual increase since 1990. A further rise of 2.5 per cent is predicted for 1995 and again for 1996. A survey by the Chartered Institute of Building claims that the industry hired twice as many permanent staff during the first few months of this year as at the start of 1993. Pay levels have started to rise in some companies as they seek to hold on to remaining staff to cope with the increased work. Montrose Technical Recruitment, one the largest UK construction recruitment consultants, says: 'Registered job vacancies with construction employers have risen by 44 per cent in the first quarter compared with the first three months of last year, while the number of people placed with construction companies is almost double that of the corresponding period last year.' Yet in recent weeks, as chief executives have announced profit figures for last year, their accompanying comments have been almost universally pessimistic. The reason is less the size of their UK order books than the low prices at which they are winning contracts. These leave little or no margin for profit. Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, blames low margins on contractors with high borrowings which need a regular flow of cash payments to meet interest charges; contractors have been bidding for contracts 'at the expense of profit'. He also criticises banks and institutional shareholders which, he says, support 'enfeebled contractors' and add to damaging over-capacity in the construction industry. His company, which announced a 57 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.3m, estimates that over-capacity in the industry is running at about 30 per cent. By contrast, building material companies have been much more successful in cutting capacity. Over-capacity has led to a fall in prices at which contractors win jobs, by 22 per cent since 1989; but list prices for building materials and labour have risen by 21 per cent according to EC Harris, the construction cost consultancy. Some of the difference between tender prices and costs will have been made up by claims for additional payments to meet 'unforeseen' design changes which traditionally arise after contracts have been signed. EC Harris also says there is evidence of a pick-up in construction tender prices of about 2.5 per cent since last summer. Even so, margins are likely to remain paper thin, with increases in the prices charged by building material producers and sub-contractors likely to offset any rise in tender prices. Even if tender prices were to rise sharply they might not affect published earnings figures for another two years or more because of the time lag before profits from projects are included in accounts, says Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation. Lead contractors are also being squeezed on another front. Part of their profit comes from advance payments from customers. These are held on account, earning interest, until they are passed on to sub-contractors. Falling interest rates reduce this income. As in many industries, sub-contractors complain about the length of time it takes for main contractors to make payments - another sign of cash problems. Laing's forthright comments about banks' support for weaker companies have angered some rivals. Concerns about over-capacity, however, are shared by senior executives in other companies. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the international construction company which last year made pre-tax profits of just Pounds 21m on a turnover of Pounds 2.18bn, says the industry is in need of rationalisation. Some are better placed than others: housebuilders, for instance, which are leading the sector out of recession. Sales are rising and margins have begun to improve as prices increase and builders use up expensive land bought in the late 1980s. There is nevertheless concern that land prices, which have risen by up to 50 per cent in the south-east during the past 12 months, could slow the pace of future earnings recovery. Public spending cuts, particularly on roads, could also restrict growth in the industry. Given these concerns, there can be little surprise that building shares, which have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by more than a fifth in the past 12 months, have looked more vulnerable in recent weeks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Portuguese News Agency, LUSA, has quoted a  diplomatic source as saying President Joaquim Chissano asked  London to extend the stay of British instructors who will  supervise the training of infantry battalions of the new army  scheduled to begin on 21 March. Colonel John White, British  military officer in Mozambique, told LUSA that if the request is  not successful within the next few days the team of two British  instructors, who arrived in Mozambique in early February, will  leave the country on 31 March. According to a British project  for training 15,000 soldiers, who will be part of the first  infantry battalions of the new unified army, the British  military team would only follow the training of the first three  battalions. Then training will be conducted by Mozambican  instructors trained in Nyanga, Zimbabwe.</p>

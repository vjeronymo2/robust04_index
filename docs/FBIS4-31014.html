			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/6/1994 -- Romania's  traditional relations with the neighbors, Bulgaria included,  hold an important place in the government's policy, said on June  1 Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu during his interview with  Stoyan Aleksandrov, Bulgarian finance minister.    During the dialogue that occasioned an extensive exchange of  information and views on the progress of the reform in the two  countries, they agreed that the bilateral relations were, along  with each state's development efforts, the only way out of the  economic crisis, the way of relaunching the production and  speeding up the reform. Reference was made in that context to  the possibilities of collaboration that, as agreed, would be  analyzed during the session of the joint commissions due at the  end of June.    Premier Vacaroiu noted that, although the Romanian-Bulgarian  trade has kept at a constant level lately, there were unlimited  possibilities to increase the bilateral relations, which needs  the completion of a new legal framework.    Sharing that opinion, Aleksandrov showed that during his  Romanian visit two important agreements were signed on economic  relations (the convention on avoiding double taxation and the  agreement on mutual promotion and protection of investments.)  He highlighted the necessity of periodical contacts between  similar institutions in the two countries, of a permanent  exchange of information concerning each party's positive  experience.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Yolande Snaith - Dance The annual Spring Loaded festival at The Place, in London, is a chance for the devotee to sample the sometimes weird - and sometimes wonderful - offering of new dance. It is a bran-tub, a car-boot sale, offering a little talent, many aspirations, and even more pretensions. Yolande Snaith is one of the better-known participants, her work concerned with the semantics of a dance 'language'. During the past decade she has earned a serious reputation, and her latest piece, Diction, given its first performance on Wednesday night, is an often ingenious and physically bold study. Its first half hour won all my attention and interest; a law of diminishing returns (relating to a diminishing physical interest) obtained during the remaining 30 minutes. Miss Snaith proposes dance as a riddle, a game whose laws are arbitrary, ruled by mad time-keepers. The proceedings echo something of Alice's chess-board experiences. The dance area is chequered, the white squares piled with torn-up paper. Six 'pieces' (three men, three women) are directed by the two umpires, who are also drawn into the play. Routines, frantic contests, extended repetitions of movement phrases, ensue. Wooden poles, blindfolds, red cloths, all feature in illogically logical procedures. Physical meanings - and relationships - are meaningless. It is clever and, as I have suggested, fascinating for half its length. My dissatisfaction is concerned with Miss Snaith's reliance upon the new European dance style (as explored by such creators as Wim van der Keybus and Anna Teresa de Keersmaker) of falls, leaps that degenerate into slides across the floor, and bone-jolting crashes to the ground. The 'games' in the text - passing poles from one to the other; elaborate sign sequences that are strictly controlled in rhythm; elements of contact improvisation - are hypnotically intriguing, as routines achieve a ritualistic force. It may be that Miss Snaith has restricted her movement choices in order to stress the absurdist relevance of her piece as slowly-shifting minimalism. She is, I think, too able to rely upon such constraints. The piece is a teaser. But it fascinates the eye, and it is admirably done by Miss Snaith, Lauren Potter, Jordi Cortes Molina and their five colleagues. Design is by Robert Innes-Hopkins; music by David Coulter; and there is excellent lighting by Mark Parry. 'Diction' was in part made possible by a Barclays' New Stages Award</p>

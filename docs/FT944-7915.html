			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Further drop in Sony depresses investor confidence A further decline in Sony, the consumer electronics maker, depressed investor confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground on small-lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 180.84 down at the day's low of 19,121.72. It rose just after the opening to the session's peak of 19,315.16, but profit-taking by institutional and overseas investors later hit share prices. Volume was 177.6m shares, the lowest since November 7. Traders said investors grew increasingly pessimistic as the Nikkei approached 19,111.92, the closing price for March 31 which has become a psychological support level. Investors are also wary of interim earnings announcements by commercial banks this Thursday. 'Investors fear that share prices will repeat last year's plunge following banks' profit reports, and are looking to cash their stocks,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 11.09 to 1,512.38, while the Nikkei 300 lost 2.08 at 277.65. Declines overwhelmed advances by 726 to 234, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.71 to 1,238.94. Sony, which dropped 5.3 per cent on Friday following reports of its write-off of losses stemming from its entertainment business, shed a further Y250 or 4.6 per cent to Y5,230. Other consumer electronics companies were also lower, Sharp weakening Y40 to Y1,740 and Matsushita Electric Industrial, which owns MCA, the US movie studio, Y10 to Y1,530. Bargain hunting supported Mitsubishi Estate, the 80 per cent stakeholder of the US Rockefeller Group. The company, which met profit-taking last week due to reports that Rockefeller Center may default on its mortgage payments, rallied Y20 to Y1,070 on buy-backs. Sumitomo Metal Mining, supported by strong metal prices last week, dipped Y20 to Y917 on profit-taking. Steel issues were easier. Some brokers were lower on earnings fears due to the stagnant trading volumes. Yamaichi Securities retreated Y14 to Y696 and Daiwa Securities fell Y30 to Y1,240, but Nomura held at Y1,930. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 123.92 to 21,332.04 in volume of 32.4m shares. Roundup Turnover was generally low among the region's markets, with a number still worried about the effect of higher interest rates on equity per-formance. HONG KONG fell 1.3 per cent amid worries about the impact of rising US and local interest rates on property prices. The Hang Seng index lost 124.20 at 9,303.24, erasing last week's 59.59 gain, while the property sub-index sank 343.52 or 2.0 per cent to 16,518.90. Among property issues, Sun Hung Kai Properties declined HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 54.75, Cheung Kong 80 cents to HKDollars 36 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.30 to HKDollars 48.60. Turnover totalled a preliminary HKDollars 2.4bn, down from HKDollars 3.6bn on Friday. SINGAPORE retreated 1.4 per cent, led by selling of some index stocks in a market worried about the possibility of higher interest rates. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 32.68 to 2,321.99 and the UOB OTC index, tracking Malaysian stocks, shed 9.55 to 1,171.80. KUALA LUMPUR drifted to a lower close in idle trade as investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude amid lack of fresh leads. The composite index eased 3.50 to 1,045.38 in volume that shrank to 73m shares from Friday's 105m. Selling was mostly in second-line stocks, led by Granite Industries, which fell 30 cents to MDollars 6.45. YTL Corp bucked the trend, rising 70 cents to MDollars 17.20 on rumours of a bonus issue. Malaysian Assurance climbed 30 cents to MDollars 6.30 in volume of 3.9m shares amid analysts' rerating of the insurance sector. SYDNEY declined as equities took a lead from the fall on Wall Street at the end of last week, as well as the firmer Australian dollar. The All Ordinaries index slid 12.5 to 1,909.5, its lowest level since September 16, 1993. Volume amounted to 132.8m shares worth ADollars 300m. The Australian dollar closed at a 2 1/2 -year high, with deal-ers expecting it to break 76 US cents overnight for the first time since June 1992. Analysts commented that the rising Australian dollar was not good for the stock market, especially resource shares. BHP receded 8 cents to ADollars 18.92, CRA 22 cents to ADollars 17.18 and WesternMining 11 cents to ADollars 7.35. In the media sector, which closed 2.1 per cent down overall, News Corp fell 14 cents to ADollars 5.30 and John Fairfax 7 cents to ADollars 2.71. Among banks, National Australia declined 8 cents to ADollars 10.50 and Commonwealth 9 cents to ADollars 7.25. TAIPEI was driven down by selling in the last few minutes of trading and the weighted index lost 45.06 at 6,404.62. Turnover was a thin TDollars 31.8bn. Buying was seen in industrials such as textiles, foods and plastic shares, but late profit-taking left textiles as the only gainers. Buying in textiles was triggered by expectations of an industry recovery, with the most active issue Shinkong Synthetic Fibres, up 30 cents to TDollars 30.50, followed by Hualon, which rose 80 cents to TDollars 20.90. Hopes of an announcement by China Steel that it planned to raise steel product prices for 1995 boosted minor buying in steel stocks, but they soon fell back as the impact was discounted. BANGKOK fell as market sentiment remained depressed, but scattered buying by mutual funds and possibly some foreign investors left the index above the day's low. The SET index lost 16.90 or 1.2 per cent at 1,440.59, with just Bt4bn worth of shares traded. The finance sector was the worst hit and also the most actively traded, falling 2.1 per cent on turnover of Bt587.8m. New listing Thai Rung Union finished at Bt114, against an IPO price of Bt102, and was the most active stock. TelecomAsia was actively traded ahead of the December subscription for 25m shares reserved for Telephone Organisation of Thailand employees from TA's initial public offering one year ago. The shares are not expected to trade until after January. TA was unchanged at Bt83. SEOUL edged lower after a consolidation among the blue chips took its toll, although domestic, consumption-related shares gained broadly. The composite index lost 0.50 at 1,117.08, off a day's high of 1,126.26. WELLINGTON was pressured by a number of heavyweight stocks going ex-dividend. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 21.64 to 2,031.22. Lion Nathan continued its downward drift, losing 10 cents at NZDollars 2.90, a low for the year. Port of Tauranga gained 6 cents at NZDollars 1.22 after reporting better than expected earnings.</p>

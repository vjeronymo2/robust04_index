			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan fishing boats must  be careful not to venture into foreign waters, a Taiwan  fisheries official warned Wednesday [25 May].    Li Chien-chuan, director of the Fisheries Department of the  Council of Agriculture, said that there are currently 117 Taiwan  fishing boats operating in squid fishing grounds near Argentina.  He said 42 are licensed by the Falkland Islands, 39 are  licensed by Argentina, and the remaining 36 have licenses from  neither Argentina nor the Falkland Islands and can only operate  in international waters.    Li urged the unlicensed ships to stay away from Falkland  Island and Argentine waters to avoid being attacked.    His remarks followed the attack last Friday by the Argentine  Navy on a Taiwan fishing boat that had allegedly been poaching  in Argentine waters.    The Kaohsiung-based fishing boat, the Chin Yuan Hsing,  reportedly sank off the coast of San Julian after being  attacked, and its crewmembers were rescued by another nearby  Taiwan fishing boat, the Chin Chuan Hsing.    Taiwan Government officials are still investigating the  incident.    Li said that the government will take action only after a  full investigation is completed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In an editorial entitled "The Peace Process Under  The Shadow Of Israeli Threats," AL-BA'TH discusses Israeli  officials' threatening statements. The paper says: It is clear  that with their new threats, Israeli officials want to exert  further pressure against Syria and push it to do what the others  have done, that is, abandon its rights.    The paper stresses that Syria will never relinquish an inch  of its occupied lands and that such threats will push it to  stick even further to its rights, and, consequently, to work for  the sake of a genuine peace in the region.    AL-BA'TH says: Thus, there is no doubt that Israel wants a  peace which will enable it to achieve what it failed to achieve  in all its aggressive wars against the Arabs. Consequently, it  maneuvers, procrastinates, and delays the peace process.  Whenever substantive issues are raised for serious discussion,  Israel evades them and starts raising secondary issues that do  not concern the basic principles on which the peace process is  based.    The paper adds: Syria says complete and comprehensive  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, South Lebanon, and the other  occupied Arab territories will achieve the just and  comprehensive peace. The implementation of this requirement is  the cornerstone in the peace process.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: We in Syria went to the Madrid  Conference out of a genuine and true desire to achieve a just  and comprehensive peace. We still, and will continue to, work  with everyone for the sake of achieving a peace that will  guarantee security, stability, and genuine peace to the region.</p>

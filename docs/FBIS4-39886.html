			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace] </F>   [Text] Riga, 3 Jun -- Several influential foreign  financial institutions, banks, and stock exchanges have promised  to help get Latvia's financial system in order, Minister of  Finance Uldis Osis reported at a press conference on his return  from a visit to Germany and Luxembourg.    Over a period of three years, a financial system, aimed  primarily at supporting small business, should be developed in  Latvia. Therefore, investments in the national economy are  necessary, which can be acquired from both the state budget  (approximately 3-4 percent of national product) and foreign  investments. In addition, in the future it is foreseen to  refrain from state-guaranteed foreign credits, so that Latvian  banks or businessmen can borrow money directly from abroad.  Until now, all foreign credits coming into Latvia were directly  or indirectly guaranteed by the government.    To create conditions enabling representatives of small  businesses in Latvia to obtain credits with fewer formalities,  it is necessary, in the first place, to develop and strengthen  the Bank of Investments, said Osis. As a next step, the  minister mentioned the formation of credit associations and  savings banks. In this realm, said Osis, the German Cooperative  Bank has pledged its assistance. It is also of greatest  importance to establish an association of credits and  guarantees, which would be able to provide a guarantee to small  enterprises receiving credits. Two Finnish companies are  willing to assist in establishing this kind of association in  Latvia, Osis reported. According to him, Western experts have  advised Latvia to consider the possibility of becoming an  "offshore" financial center.</p>

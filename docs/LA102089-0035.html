			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ford to End Scorpio Imports: Ford Motor Co. said it will no longer import its  German-built Scorpio luxury sedan, in effect dissolving its Merkur franchises  at Lincoln-Mercury dealers after nearly five years of disappointing results.  Ford said it will not offer a 1990-model of its $28,400 Scorpio sedan because  of the high costs of equipping it with passive restraints and decreasing luxury  car sales in the U.S. Ford executives had recently said they remained committed  to the Merkur franchise.  </P></p>

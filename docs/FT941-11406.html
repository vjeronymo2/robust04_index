			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / People: Former consultant takes top job at client Retailing group Kingfisher has appointed Tim Breene (right), currently global marketing director at Guinness's spirits division United Distillers, as strategy and international development director. Breene, 44, has known Kingfisher for some time; he worked with it as a consultant for McKinsey in the mid-1980s, and was involved in Kingfisher's defence against the unsuccessful takeover bid by electrical retailer Dixons in 1990. He joined United Distillers in 1991 as European marketing director, working under Crispin Davis, then global marketing director. When Davis was promoted to managing director, Breene succeeded him, and the two developed a close working relationship before Davis resigned last October after differences with Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive. UD says it is sorry to lose Breene, but understands he could not refuse the opportunity of a board position with a major public company. It adds that Breene helped steer the company through a very difficult time in the distilling industry, and was responsible for two very successful marketing campaigns in the US for Johnny Walker and Dewar's whisky. At Kingfisher, Breene will be responsible for formulating strategies for the group, as well as for its individual businesses, and seeking out international opportunities - although Kingfisher, which took over French electrical retailer Darty last year, says Breene's appointment does not signal that it has its sights on another imminent overseas acquisition. Breene began his career in 1971 as a senior brand manager with Unilever, before joining Mars as marketing manager from 1975 to 1978. He then joined McKinsey as a consultant partner until 1986 before being appointed chief executive of ad agency WCRS. From 1990 to 1991 he was vice-president and director of Boston Consulting Group. He will be succeeded at UD by Ian Meakins, 37, who has headed the company's joint venture with Greek wine maker Boutari since 1992. He joined UD in 1991 as marketing director for white spirits and new brand development, having previously worked for seven years as a brand and production manager for Procter &amp; Gamble, and then as a consultant with Bain before becoming a founding partner in the Calchas consultancy. Meakins is credited with helping to make Johnny Walker and Dewar's the most popular whiskies in Greece, where Scotch has become the national drink, outselling Ouzo by 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Boudiaf: war hero who refused to compromise TO THE westernised Algerian middle classes who fear a fundamentalist takeover of their country, Mohamed Boudiaf was a saviour. But the Moslem extremists suspected of assassinating the 73-year-old head of state yesterday portrayed him as a traitor to Islam and a puppet of Generals Khaled Nezzar and Larbi Belkheir, respectively ministers of defence and interior, who led the crackdown against the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) this year. When he returned to Algiers on January 16 after 28 years in exile, only a few of Mr Boudiaf's compatriots made the short journey to the airport to greet the ageing hero of the 1954-62 war of independence. That same night the tall, bald, hollow-cheeked Mr Boudiaf made the first of many public appeals for calm and reconciliation. Together, the Algerian people could overcome this crisis, he said. But they would have to satisfy their differences; and they would have to work. Although he governed at the request of the military, his presence conveyed paternalistic authority, not the compliance of a puppet. As he insisted repeatedly on the importance of security and his determination to rid Algeria of those who would harm it, his manner was solemn and his delivery was firm and careful. Mr Boudiaf was chosen for three reasons. His record as a war hero imprisoned for six years by the French was unimpeachable. In the 1960s he had refused an offer from the late Col Houari Boumedienne to lead a figurehead civilian government under military control. And unlike fellow revolutionaries tainted by the corruption and misrule of the last 30 years, Mr Boudiaf had earned an honest living in his Moroccan exile. Mr Boudiaf was an uncompromising figure: he never forgave Ahmed Ben Bella for imprisoning him. Mr Ben Bella had also returned to Algiers after a long exile but their relations this year were frosty. Most of all, Mr Boudiaf refused any compromise with the Islamic fundamentalists. He professed to believe that fundamentalism in Algeria was the result of economic crisis, the disillusionment of youth and subversion by foreign powers. He said it would diminish as the economy improved and young people found jobs. With his violent death yesterday that recovery became more elusive than ever.</p>

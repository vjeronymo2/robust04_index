			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Regions" column: "The Duma </F> Is Only Content with the `Steppe Code.' Sergey Shakhray Is  Sure: the Russian Federation Constitution Is Not a Bronze  Monument"]    [Text] Opening parliamentary hearings on the issue of  compatibility of the constitutions of the republics and the  charters of the territories as part of the Russian Federation,  Vladimir Lysenko called on the few participants to look at the  experience of China which, according to him, "has created a  liberal market economy, preserved a communist ideology and  thereby ensured the country's integrity." The thrust of Mr.  Lysenko's complaints against the republican constitutions was  that some of them enshrine what he sees as excessive  independence. An ideal regional constitution, "which draws  virtually no criticisms at all," is, in Mr. Lysenko's view,  Kalmykia's Steppe Code [Stepnoye ulozheniye] (Kirsan Ilyumshinov  even proposed that his republic be equated to a governorate). A  deputy from Tataria, Mr. Lazovoy, objected to this: "If there  are so many constitutions which contradict the Russian  Constitution, is it not easier to change it then?"    Federal Council Committee Chairman Vasiliy Tarasenko sharply  disagreed with "the introduction of a treaty-based system" in  relations between the center and the regions. Bilateral  agreements between Moscow and individual republics, in his  opinion, create "a legal system that runs parallel with the  constitution." The senator complained: The economically  stronger krays and oblasts "are justly annoyed by the fact that  the republics are in a privileged position."    The sole "high guest" at the hearings -- Sergey Shakhray --  on the other hand advocated wide dissemination of "Tataria's  experience." According to him, the contradictions between the  republics' constitutions and the federal Fundamental Law must be  adjusted through bilateral treaties. In parting, Mr. Shakhray  said that the Russian Constitution itself "is not a bronze  monument either..."    Representatives of approximately 20 regions took part in the  hearings, mainly of rank no higher than deputy chairmen, deputy  chiefs, or advisers.</p>

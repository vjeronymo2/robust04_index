			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arto Astikainen: "HS (HELSINGIN SANOMAT) Gallup </F> Poll: Support for EU Membership Drops Below 40 Percent;  Commission's Position on Agriculture Goals Is Probably Reflected  in Opinions"]    [Text] The number of voting-age Finns who support  membership in the European Union (EU) has dropped from over 40  percent to 36 percent within a few months' time and the  percentage of those who oppose EU membership has for the first  time risen to more than that of those who support it, over 40  percent.    Thus Finns' opinions on EU membership are taking the same  direction as those of the Swedes and Norwegians. Opponents are,  however, more clearly leading in those neighbor countries than  in Finland.    Commissioned by HELSINGIN SANOMAT, the Finnish Gallup  Company  polled Finns over a period of a year and a half for their views  on membership. The same question we are asking was used  throughout that period: Should Finland join the European  Community (EC) as a full member or stay out of it? The  designation EC was also still used during a poll conducted in  November. In early November the Community became the EU.    The most recent poll was conducted between 15 and 26  November. A total of 951 persons were interviewed. They were  selected with a divided sampling to represent the voting age  population outside of Aland.  <H5>  Scales Tipped </H5>   First, preliminary guesses as to the EU Commission's  position  on Finland's goals for agriculture appeared in the media while  the interviews were being conducted, and at the end of that  period Brussels made public the Commission's views on the  matter. The Commission's opinion was viewed as unfavorable for  Finland in the press.    We may assume that the public debate on agriculture most  clearly influenced the fact that the number of opponents of  membership has risen to become greater than the number of  supporters, and the situation that prevailed up to now has been  reversed.    Absolutely final conclusions on the November poll cannot be  drawn yet. The difference between the number of supporters and  opponents is only 5 percentage points and the statistical margin  for error for the results of both polls is about plus or minus 3  percentage points. Therefore, in reality there may also be just  as many supporters as opponents.  <H5>  Many Still Uncertain </H5>   The trend during the year and a half polling period was,  nevertheless, fairly clear-cut: The number of supporters of  membership was declining. The number of opponents was not  increasing as clearly, but there are more opponents now than  ever before. As the fall wore on, many people became uncertain  of where they stood on the issue: In November, one out of every  four could not say how he felt about it.    Men are still a bit more eager to join the EU than women.  Young people support membership more than adults do: While half  of those under 25 feel Finland should join the EU, only 25  percent of those who have reached pension age do.    Support for membership was strongest among Conservative  voters, university educated people, and residents of the capital  district. The same kind of situation existed in November, too.  Enthusiasm for the EU has indeed declined in southern Finland.    In November, 65 percent of all farmers opposed EU  membership;  11 percent of the farmers declared themselves to be supporters.  There were clearly more opponents among workers than supporters.</p>

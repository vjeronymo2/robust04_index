			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Home Minister's Visit to Kashmir"] </F>   [Text] It would be unrealistic to hope that Home Minister  Chavan's visit to Kashmir to review the situation there would  improve the law and order situation and that terrorism would be  controlled. The firing by the terrorists on the home minister's  caravan in Doda proves that the roots of terrorism are very deep  in Jammu-Kashmir. Chavan, who visited Jammu and Doda, said that  he felt the people there wanted to join the national mainstream,  but are afraid to speak because of their fear of rifles. The  central leaders have been making such statements continuously  for the last three years. After their trips to Jammu-Kashmir,  the central leaders always conclude that the people there do not  support the terrorists, but are afraid of revenge and lack the  courage to speak up. The question arises: Whose job is it to  take away the guns that are aimed at these people's heads? Who  is responsible for arresting the terrorists? If it is the  government, then what is the use of making such statements? Do  not government officials understand that they are sending the  wrong message to the Kashmiri people by telling them we are  helpless, and that we do want to help them, but are not strong  enough to deal with the terrorists? The image that is presented  to the world is that India has no influence here, and the people  here want to get out of India. This is the image that Pakistan  presents to Western and Muslim nations. The home minister said  that the government is willing to talk with the Huriat  Conference and other separatist groups on the condition that  they give up violence and be prepared to talk according to the  Indian Constitution. We do not know who the home minister is  trying to fool. The groups that thrive on the belief of  separatism and who believe in violence and military methods will  not accept the home minister's condition and be prepared to  commit suicide.    Chavan said that the attractiveness of terrorism was  increased because these youths were unemployed. Therefore, the  government would increase opportunities for employment. This is  also looking away from reality. Even if we grant that  unemployment is a cause for increasing violence, how can we  provide opportunities for employment in this atmosphere of  violence and anarchy? In Jammu-Kashmir, especially in the  Kashmir Valley, administration is in name only. All business is  idle, and industrial production has stopped fully. Government  and non-government offices do nominal work, and two years of  education in schools and colleges is not completed even in five  years. No industrialist is willing to invest money in the state.  Even the home minister himself has admitted that foreign  contractors responsible for building the hydroelectric project  in Dulhasti have given up the project out of their fear of  violence. In this atmosphere, what kind of miracle will Chavan,  Rajesh Pilot, or Farooq Abdullah pull to create new jobs? The  only miracle they can pull is to silence the guns of the  terrorists. But the preliminary preparations the government  should have made have never been done. The local and central  police are in a precarious condition, while the terrorists have  spread their communication network all over the state. In this  situation, the security forces' efforts to rout the terrorists  are like chasing their own shadows. Usually, innocent citizens  suffer in these efforts. Until the central government gives up  its much-abused cliches and forms an effective strategy to end  the anarchy in Kashmir, it will not be able to get out of this  mess, nor will it be able to show a path to the people.  *</p>

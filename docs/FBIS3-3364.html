			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, a top  Chinese leader, said today it is both necessary and possible to  promote progress in socialist democracy vigorously and steadily.    Addressing the Second Session of the Eighth National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) that closed here today, Li said developing  socialist democracy is an important part of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics.    It is also a common task for the Communist Party of China  (CPC) and various democratic parties, and constitutes a  prerequisite for stepping up China's economic construction and  restructuring, said Li, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.    "Without democracy, it would be impossible to fully arouse  people's initiative or realize broad-based unity; and without  democracy, there would be neither socialism nor socialist  modernization," he said.    Li, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political  Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, noted that as democracy is  historical, specific and relative, it will be certainly subject  to restraints by economic, political and economic factors in  society.    Therefore, progress in democracy cannot deviate from the  reality or transcend historical stages, he added.    Seeking democracy by neglecting specific conditions will not  only make it impossible to achieve the objective of developing  democracy, but also produce adverse effects on economic growth  and social stability, he said.    According to Li Ruihuan, China is currently deepening  reforms  and establishing a socialist market economic structure, while  the people are steadily improving their cultural standards and  enhancing their sense of becoming involved and competition  concepts.    All this has made it possible to promote progress in  democracy, he noted.    He said that studying the development of modern Chinese  democratic politics must proceed from conditions in China, be  based on the reality of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and be guided by the fundamental tenets of  Marxism. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate and  develop productive forces.    "This point of view influences and decides many aspects in  China, including the development of democratic politics," he  said.    The essence of socialist democracy is to let people be  masters of their country.    Therefore, positive and steady development of socialist  democratic politics must always adhere to the principle of doing  everything for the people and always depending on the people, he  added.    It is necessary to observe people's feelings carefully,  learn  their wishes timely, and do real things for them unswervingly.  "We should be good at pooling people's wisdom, fully respect  their initiatives and voluntarily accept their supervision. We  should cultivate a democratic style of work, boost the sense of  democracy, create and accumulate the experience of developing  democratic politics through close links with the people," he  said.    Li Ruihuan called for combining development of democracy  with  that of a legal system. It is necessary to legalize and  systemize practices and experiences which are recognized by the  public as having universal significance and which reflect the  principle of people being masters of the country.    It is necessary to establish a sound legal system so that  systems and laws will not change with a change of leadership or  with a change of the views and attention of leaders, he said.    It is necessary to maintain the authority of laws, help  people better protect their rights and interests according to  law, stop and punish any deeds that infringe upon people's  democratic rights, and ensure that people enjoy all their  democratic rights, he said.    Li said that the National People's Congress system and the  Communist Party-led multi-party cooperation and political  consultation system are the main forms of China's socialist  democracy, which must be adhered to and improved. At the same  time, various democratic forms must be established and improved  at the grassroots level to enable people to play their role as  masters of the country in grassroots-level social and political  life.    In short, Li summarized, "Based on national conditions, we  must absorb and borrow all achievements of human civilization  and make every effort to develop a socialist democracy with  Chinese characteristics, which carries forward our fine  traditions, has features of the times, reflects the basic tenets  of socialism and meets the requirements of a socialist market  economy."</p>

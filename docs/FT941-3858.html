			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Apple launches assault on Intel: IBM and Motorola's chips pose a real challenge Apple Computer's introduction today of Macintosh computers based on a new PowerPC microprocessor chip will kick off a high stakes technology battle in the personal computer industry. Apple and its PowerPC allies, International Business Machines and Motorola, aim to end the hegemony of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, which last year supplied about 80 per cent of the microprocessor chips used in PCs and recorded Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in net profits, more than the rest of the top 10 US semiconductor manufacturers combined. The PowerPC, manufactured by Motorola and IBM, is the first credible challenger to Intel's dominant microprocessors in over a decade. Based on IBM Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) technology, it is faster, smaller and cheaper than the current version of Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium chip. For IBM, PowerPC represents a chance to grab a bigger share of the profits to be made in the desktop computer business, and to be less dependent upon Intel. The new chip refreshes Motorola's fading microprocessor technology and gives the performance of Apple's Macintosh a much needed boost. Microsoft, the leading PC software company, cannot lose. Whatever the outcome of the technology battle, it is likely to remain the biggest software supplier. Motorola and IBM are drumming up support for PowerPC among computer manufacturers to establish it as a new industry standard. IBM is expected to launch its own range of PowerPC personal computers later this year. Apple's 'Power Macintosh' will, however, be the critical market test of the new technology. Apple today will introduce three new models, ranging in price from Dollars 1,819 to Dollars 5,309 and aimed at business users. Over the next three years, Apple plans to replace all its products with PowerPC versions. Apple's prices are aggressive, undercutting the well-known PC brands such as Compaq and Dell using Intel Pentium chips. However, the Intel camp has a huge advantage in the vast selection of software applications available for its PCs. Apple says that 150 independent software developers are committed to designing Power Macintosh applications over the next few months. Yet computer buyers visiting stores this week are unlikely to find any Power Macintosh programs. Early purchasers of the new computers will have to use software designed for Apple's established Macintosh computers, or for Microsoft's Windows operating system. When forced to mimic other computers, the PowerPC slows down significantly, to the speed of a low-end Intel chip or one of the older Motorola chips used by Apple. With its performance advantage stifled, the Power Macintosh becomes a less compelling product. For Apple, the introduction of 'Power Macintosh' also represents a tricky product transition. Apple has followed the 'conventional wisdom' by offering Power Macintosh to business users first. Home buyers, it believes, will be satisfied with slower Macintosh models. Only toward the end of its planned three-year transition to PowerPC does Apple plan to offer such high performance in consumer products. However, sales of existing Macintosh products to business users have slowed in the past couple of months, Mr Ian Diery, Apple's executive vice-president, acknowledges. Consumer sales are currently growing faster. Almost half of all PCs sold last year went to home users - whether for personal or home office use. Meanwhile, Intel is accelerating the pace of its microprocessor technology development in a bid to speed away from the PowerPC and mounting competition from other chip makers that 'clone' its chips. Last month Intel slashed its prices. Earlier this week, the chip maker announced new versions of its Pentium microprocessor that outperform the PowerPC chips used by Apple. While it may be several months before PCs with the new chips come to market, Intel is already working on its next generation of microprocessors, code-named P6, which are expected early next year. Even by combining their efforts, IBM and Motorola will be hard pressed to keep up with Intel's Dollars 1.1bn 1994 product development budget and the Dollars 2.4bn that it plans to spend on new plants and equipment. Last year Intel shipped more than 30m microprocessors to PC manufacturers. In comparison, Apple's goal of selling one million Power Macintosh computers over the next 12 months seems quite modest. Yet Intel is keenly aware that PowerPC could pose a real threat if it gains market momentum. IBM's introduction of PowerPC computers later this year will place Intel in the awkward position of competing with its largest customer. Unlike Apple, IBM does not plan to replace its current personal computer products with PowerPC computers. Instead, it has formed a new division that will effectively compete with its own Intel-based PCs. For Intel, therefore, the challenge is to minimise the impact of PowerPC in the personal computer market until IBM sorts out its priorities. This makes Apple, as the advanced guard of the PowerPC, a target of Intel's notoriously tough competitive tactics. Ready or not, Apple may be in for the fight of its life.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Boost for US house sales Strong sales in the northeast and south helped boost US sales of new single-family houses 2.6 per cent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 703,000, the Commerce Department said yesterday. September's increase followed a revised 7.9 per cent rise in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000. The August rise previously was reported as 9.7 per cent. New home sales have now risen for three straight months. Economists said the higher level of new home sales demonstrated the economy's vigour despite the Federal Reserve's five rounds of credit tightening so far this year. The economy 'continues to perform above the pace which the Federal Reserve has indicated it is desirous to slow it to,' said Mr Allan Leslie, chief economist at Discount Corp of New York.</p>

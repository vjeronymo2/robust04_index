			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz cuts 10,000 jobs in wake of pay deal MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, the German engineering group, is responding to the recent 5.8 per cent wage award to engineering workers by cutting up to 10,000 jobs this year. According to Mr Werner Niefer, group president, the pay deal will increase costs this year by DM600m (Dollars 373m). If the company tried to pass this on by increasing prices, customers would simply buy other makes, he told a press conference. Despite a 14 per cent increase in car and commercial vehicle sales during the first four months of this year - already slackening after the 17 per cent surge recorded in the first three months - Mr Niefer warned that 'a fundamental recovery in our most important foreign markets is not yet discernible'. The post-unification boom in the German market was also tailing off. Even so, the company, mainstay of the Daimler-Benz engineering, aerospace and electronics group, planned to sell 560,000 cars, the same as last year. The group turnover target was DM70bn, compared with DM67bn in 1991. Profits, which resisted the general economic downturn last year and matched the previous year's DM1.5bn result, would again be 'good', according to Mr Helmut Werner, deputy president. According to Mr Niefer, the international car market will at best stagnate in the current year. 'The German market shifted back into normal gear during the first four months,' he added. As a result, he expected total domestic registrations to fall by 9 per cent. They were already down 6 per cent at the end of April. Indications of a 'hesitant upswing' in other west European countries would compensate in part for the trend in Germany. The US was more encouraging, Mr Niefer said. Mercedes sales there, led by the costly S-series and mid-range cars, rose 18 per cent in the first four months while the overall market increased only 2 per cent. The early increase in world sales of commercial vehicles, up 7 per cent in the first four months to DM102m, is expected to fade later in the year. Again, falling demand at home is expected to be covered by rises elsewhere. In the US truck and bus market, which grew 12 per cent in the first four months, Mercedes increased its sales of heavy-duty lorries by 9 per cent. Confirming plans to reduce the group's workforce by 20,000 'in the coming years', Mr Niefer said most would go in Germany, where 183,000 of the total 235,000 workforce is employed. News of the the loss of between 8,000 and 10,000 his year, following Tuesday's announcement of a further 850 job cuts at Porsche, and plans for massive cuts elsewhere in the German automotive industry, indicates widespread concern at the loss of international competitiveness.  ----------------------------------------------------                    MERCEDES-BENZ           First quarter group sales (DMbn)  ----------------------------------------------------                                     1991     1992 Western Europe                     14.15    15.78 Germany                             9.36    10.60 Western Europe (excl Germany)       4.79     5.18 US                                  2.43     2.65 Other markets                       3.59     4.61  ---------------------------------------------------- Total                              20.16    23.04  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pat Jele] </F>   [Excerpt] Chief Nhloko Zwane of Mpuluzi has said there is a  plot to topple the Monarch. The chief said the plot involves  certain influential people he did not name, saying of late  meetings are being held by the plotters and that such meetings  are disguised as parties.    Chief Nhloko who is also a member of the Defence Council in  the Army made these remarks when addressing the Prime Minister,  Prince Mbilini during the introduction of National and Regional  Crime Prevention Councils at the Manzini City Council Chambers  -- for the people of Manzini. The meeting was attended by  Chiefs their Tindvuna [headmen] and Councillors -- as well as  senior Government officials and Cabinet Ministers.    He told the meeting that King Sobhuza II was fortunate  because there were no such plotters in his time -- adding that  he is still ruling the country even today.    Chief Nhloko warned Chiefs specifically, not to be involved  in the plot. "Chiefs should stand up and fight these elements.  It is their duty to protect the monarch because the elements  behind this plan are their subjects and children," he said.  [passage omitted]</p>

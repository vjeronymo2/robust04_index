			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Gaviria attacked over drug baron's escape THE ESCAPE from jail by Mr Pablo Escobar, the Medelln cocaine cartel chief, on Wednesday morning has demolished the cornerstone of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's anti-drug policy. Mr Escobar's negotiated surrender, just over a year ago, was hailed as a government victory by most Colombians, few of whom saw it as an ignominious submission. Now a storm of criticism has broken out, with leading politicians calling for the president's resignation. Mr Enrique Parejo, a former justice minister who nearly died in a drug cartel attempt on his life in Hungary, said the escape showed the government's drug policy as a 'total failure' and the president without 'all moral authority.' Mr Escobar seems to have escaped amid a gun battle while the army's special forces were trying to recapture the jail, near the city of Medelln. He and his associates had seized the director of prisons and the deputy justice minister when they entered the jail on Tuesday evening to tell Mr Escobar that he and his men were to be transferred. With the collusion of the prison guards, Mr Escobar's men remained in control of the jail through the night until the army broke in. In the ensuing mayhem, the director glimpsed a group of men in gas-masks - perhaps the last sighting of Mr Escobar and his associates. Reports that he was holding out in a tunnel under the prison appear to have been a red herring. The Gaviria government's policy of encouraging traffickers to surrender and confess their crimes, in exchange for lenient sentences and exemption from extradition to the US, was meant to stop drug terrorism. The car bombs, assassinations and kidnaps that punctuated the war on drugs in Colombia did stop after Mr Escobar had surrendered last year; there was a collective sigh of relief and little talk of the political cost. Mr Escobar seems to have expected to serve a short sentence - perhaps three years - and go free. But his confession to a single trafficking crime, of which he had already been convicted in France, made a mockery of the justice system. More than 17 investigations of his activities were in hand, and he was accused of having ordered the murder of a Bogota newspaper editor, Mr Guillermo Cano, among others. His unwillingness to confess to other crimes, thus breaching the terms of his surrender agreement, meant he had effectively forfeited the right to leniency and might have to serve 20 or 30 years. Mr Gaviria said the government had decided Mr Escobar should be transferred, having received evidence that he was continuing criminal activities from jail. National and foreign intelligence sources had been saying for months that Mr Escobar ran the prison on his own terms and continued to direct cocaine-trafficking operations. The final straw for the government seems to have been the kidnap and murder of traffickers who had worked under Mr Escobar's umbrella but were, he believed, getting too big for their boots. Several of these 'known criminals' visited Mr Escobar before their disappearances. Mr Gaviria has said that Mr Escobar's life will be respected if he gives himself up and, fearful of a revival of the Medelln cartel's drug terrorism, politicians are already talking of negotiating a new surrender. His prison stronghold suited Mr Escobar in many ways, particularly because enemies in trafficking organisations wanted to get rid of him and the police were unhappy about the surrender policy. But it is clear he had contingency escape plans: now it is thought he will remain where he has the best cover - in his own trafficking structure. The government's incompetence and shame at home and abroad will have far-reaching consequences. Congress is set to investigate not only the bungling of the military operation during the escape but also the absurdity of the luxury in which Mr Escobar was held.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Petr Gangnus, DELOVOY MIR special correspondent: </F> "Space Archeology"]    [Text] Wars pass, archives burn, witnesses of events and  their participants die, officials lose papers and the Earth's  rulers change. And all that comes to be forgotten...    In any human activity, as soon as some unseen threshold is  crossed, there is a need for a historical study of what has  occurred as a result of one's own work. This is probably the  threshold separating childhood from adulthood, when things have  already accumulated in the past about which there is a need to  ponder deeply.    If this version is correct, the space field became an adult  in the 1980's. For twenty years before this everyone launched  all kinds of objects. These launches were concealed from other  parties. Some satellites exploded. Others were lost. And now all  kinds of unknown objects are flying there above us... As a  result a new science has been born and it can be called space  archeology. Unfortunately, it is not concerned with traces of  mysterious arrivals from the outside, but with our own objects.    When the first artificial earth satellite was launched it  was  known only approximately how it would fly. Right up to the end  they were not sure that it would fly at all. The accuracy of  observation of the satellite, to be sure, was still low.    But then telescopes appeared which were capable of tracking  objects moving rapidly through the sky. It was far more  difficult to determine exactly what was flying there. Any  satellite in the strongest telescope is visible as a point --  more or less bright. And from the changes in this brightness an  effort is made to determine what it looks like. Up to the middle  of the 1970's it was possible only to distinguish a sphere from  a cylinder and a cylinder from a plane. An entire institute in  Great Britain, breaking its head over this problem, deemed a  more detailed solution to be unattainable.    But in 1981 the young Russian scientists A. Bagrov and M.  Smirnov, working in the geodynamics section, Astronomical  Council, USSR Academy of Sciences (now the INASAN), appeared on  the scene. They were able to cut the Gordian knot: they began...  to detect the sun's flashes. The fact of the matter is that the  parts of the satellite send quite conspicuous blinks earthward.  And by observing them it is possible to visualize from what  parts this satellite consists.    When observing one ordinary satellite a very strange leaping  blink was discovered. As if someone sent a flash from a hand  mirror and it oscillated slightly. An ordinary satellite cannot  produce such a picture. But it was announced as being  specifically an ordinary communication satellite. But the blinks  betrayed its secret: it was a scanning television system which  shifted its "eye" to the right and left and accordingly the  satellite oscillated and the sun flash jumped. The enemy was  thereby exposed.    Another problem. A satellite is launched. We attempt to  communicate with it, but no luck. There it is -- it can be seen  clearly, even with the naked eye. But it is silent. It is very  possible that it is talking, but not to us. That is, its antenna  is not turned in the right direction. Or the solar cells  remained undeployed, for some reason or another could not be  opened. And again the detection of the flashes makes it possible  to ascertain the truth. Then it is possible to send a correcting  signal from the Flight Control Center and the satellite will do  that which it is told to do and everything will be in order.    What good are the blinks from a satellite? They can be seen  clearly. When the light spot shines in the eye, the brightness  of the object may increase a thousandfold. You can't hide that.  Incidentally, if you saw in the sky that a moving star suddenly  appeared, and then disappeared, you know: this is not a flying  saucer, this is a simple sun flash. From a satellite.    In the late 1980's we learned to identify satellites even  without the blinks. Using a computer. The author of these lines  also was engaged in this work.    No method is a panacea. A satellite can be camouflaged. The  very same M. Smirnov mentioned a combination of celestial bodies  which it is difficult to identify. Visualize a small satellite  to which a large, several times larger satellite, an inflated  balloon, is coupled by a short tether. As much as you look at  such a formation, as many calculations are made on computers,  only the balloon can be distinguished.    But let's return to space archeology. It is necessary to  determine the configuration not only of working satellites, but  also the remnants of old ones. Some are continuing their orbital  flight in the form of a grouping of individual parts. Others  have exploded. And still others, crippled with time, fly on  intact. And there are so many of them that sometimes it is  difficult to observe the stars. The blinking of the fragments  interferes.    A new term has appeared: space trash. We already have  succeeded there, in space, in cluttering the place up. Some  regions of near space are becoming dangerous for a large object,  such as an orbital station. The velocity of a station is 7 km/s,  but toward them move tiny fragments, sharp as nails, also moving  at 7 km/s, a total of 14 km/s (for a bullet -- 800 m/s). No skin  will hold up under that.    And how many different flying objects of all types are there  in space? About 5 thousand intact vehicles alone. There are 15  thousand large pieces measuring more than 10 cm. There are more  than 100 thousand pieces of an intermediate size (1-10 cm). And  there are about a million small ones (1-10 mm). Intact vehicles  are listed in catalogues and they are observed. It would be good  to observe both the large and the intermediate fragments, but  for the time being neither we nor the Americans have money for  that.    Now these fragments are flying in small groups. There are,  for example, even permanent groups over India and Ecuador. And  if we know the shapes of these fragments we can determine how  the pressure of sunlight acts on them and where the pieces will  move in the future. M. Smirnov and his colleague A. Mikshin have  encouraging words with respect to this problem: with time all  these groups will break up, being uniformly distributed in all  of near space, and then will fall to the surface. So that we can  boldly clutter up the heavens in the future as well. It is true  that with time it will be necessary for there to be a break in  flights for some 30 thousand years, but on the other hand then  everything will be cleaned up. And over the course of these 30  thousand years space archeology will flourish.</p>

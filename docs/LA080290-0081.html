			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., JAPAN OK TELECOMMUNICATIONS PACT  </P> <P> The United States and Japan forged an agreement Wednesday to open the Japanese  market to further inroads by U.S. telecommunications firms.  </P> <P> The detailed pact, based on a March 30 accord that helped Japan avoid the  threat of U.S. trade sanctions, is designed to allow foreign manufacturers to  provide sophisticated international telecommunications services and equipment  in the largely closed Japanese market.  </P> <P> Negotiators faced an Aug. 1 deadline for reaching the final agreement.  </P> <P> The telecommunications accord would open the Japanese market for products known  as network channel terminating equipment, used by computers to talk over phone  lines. It would eliminate many of the obstacles that Japan has erected to  prevent U.S. companies from providing communications networking services, such  as voice mail and electronic banking, directly to Japanese companies involved  in international communications.  </P> <P> The agreement only applies to international communications in and out of Japan,  which is not required to open up its domestic market to foreign  telecommunications firms.  </P> <P> U.S. officials estimated that American companies, which serve only about 4% of  the market for Japan's international telecommunications, could win a  substantial share of a services market expected to grow to more than $2.5  billion annually during the next few years. They also expect U.S. firms to make  strong inroads into the $750-million market for equipment as well.  </P> <P> "This agreement represents an important step toward giving U.S. firms in Japan  access comparable to the access Japanese firms enjoy in the United States,"  U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said.  </P> <P> U.S. companies will be able to communicate electronically -- internally, among  affiliates and with regular customers and suppliers -- essentially free of  regulation.  </P> <P> "As a result, U.S. manufacturing, financial and other firms that do business  with Japan should be able to run those operations more easily and  economically," Hills said.  </P> <P> She said Japan also promised to take safeguards against anti-competitive  conduct in the telecommunications services sector.  </P> <P> "These agreements will play a growing role in maintaining the competitiveness  of American firms in providing benefits for consumers worldwide," Hills said.  </P></p>

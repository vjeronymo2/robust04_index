According to a mainland official, the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] and other  relevant departments have made a long-term economic development  strategy in a bid to attract more ROK enterprises to the Chinese  mainland. They have also designated over 80 projects that show  good potentialities as key projects for cooperation with the  ROK. As for the distribution of ROK investors on the mainland,  China wishes that they will focus on northeast and northern  China. Currently, there are nearly 1,000 ROK enterprises  investing in the mainland, with a total investment of close to  $1 billion, most of which is concentrated in such regions as  Shandong and northeast China.    The official said: There are many medium-sized and large  enterprises in the ROK. If they effectively concentrate their  investments in the coastal areas of northeast and north China,  they will be able to inject a large amount of foreign capital  into the thriving Bohai Bay economic zone. First of all, it may  counterbalance the overexpansion of Japanese investors in  Northeast China and avoid the danger of a "Japanese economic  invasion," bringing about the same kind of economic benefits as  Hong Kong and Taiwan investments do in southern parts of China.  Secondly, the overseas Chinese in the ROK mostly originate from  Shandong or Northeast China. It is therefore more convenient  for them to make direct investment or help bring in investment  by native Koreans. Thirdly, the ROK's economic development is  running into a bottleneck in the course of transformation, as  many of its economic indexes rank last among the "four little  dragons." Faced with strong rivalry from East Asian nations,  the ROK is actively seeking a way out. In this context, Beijing  hopes to attract more ROK enterprises to Shandong, Hebei, and  Liaoning, so that these provinces can obtain a large amount of  ROK capital, energize their economic situations within a short  time, and subsequently expand economic cooperation and ties in  northeast Asia, truly turning Bohai Bay into an economic center  of northeast Asia.    The official also said: Mainland authorities have not laid  down any restrictions regarding where ROK enterprises are  allowed to invest, but officials concerned from MOFTEC and  Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong will take the initiative in supply  information on major projects in a bid to obtain capital from  ROK. Since Beijing and the ROK established diplomatic relations  over a year ago, such provinces as Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei,  and Jiangsu have organized large economic and trade delegations  to visit the ROK. As many as six or seven provinces have held  economic and trade meetings in Seoul. More and more ROK  officials and entrepreneurs have been visiting provinces in the  Bohai Bay zone.    On another front, according to an official of Liaoning  Province, the flow of capital from the ROK into northeast China  used to be very slow due to misgivings about such matters as  Sino-DPRK friendship. Now, because the central policy is "going  all out to attract ROK capital," local officials may totally  ignore the reaction from DPRK, giving rise to a rapid growth in  ROK input. In some cities, ROK investments are even on a par  with Japanese investments.    It is learned that during Kim Yong-sam's visit in Beijing,  the foreign economic and trade officials of Liaoning, Hebei, and  Shandong will be meeting with ROK counterparts through the China  Council for the Promotion of International Trade to strengthen  their relations of cooperation and hold further consultations on  strengthening bilateral trade, economic, and technological  exchange.</p>

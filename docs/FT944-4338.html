			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei takes its lead from Chicago futures The Nikkei 225 eased 166.24 to 19,174.23 as traders cashed in two days of gains and arbitrageurs unwound positions due to lower overnight Chicago futures prices, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The 225 index slid from an early high of 19,305.56, traders attributing a decline of 105.42 in the first 15 minutes of trading to futures-led sales followed by a wave of profit-taking. In the afternoon the market continued its decline as the index fell to a low of 19,138.83, then recovered slightly by the close. Volume was estimated at 222m shares. The first-section Topix index slipped 10.14 to 1,525.35 and the Nikkei 300 ended at 281.45, down 1.90, while falls outstripped rises by 742 to 259, with 181 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.24 at 1,263.77. A dip in the dollar below Y100 undercut remaining bullish sentiment, and renewed exchange rate concerns. Most large exporters, including the high-technology companies which led Monday's advance, suffered. Sony fell Y180 to Y5,330 and Pioneer Electronic, which earlier in the day announced an advanced commercial karaoke on-line system, closed at Y2,300, off Y80. The major brokerage houses retreated: Nomura shed Y50 to Y2,040 and Nikko Securities Y40 to Y1,160. Steelmaker NKK, the volume leader, held at Y278. Nippon Steel, the third most active issue, was up Y1 at Y374. Privatised stocks were mixed. NTT retreated Y11,000 to Y835,000 after a newspaper reported that the government was considering the issue of bonds convertible into NTT stock. Eight years after privatisation, the government remains the majority shareholder in NTT. East Japan Railway, ending unchanged in the last three sessions, gained Y4,000 at Y473,000. Japan Tobacco firmed Y1,000 to Y956,000 and Japan Telecom, on the second section, remained at Y3.25m. Daiei moved up Y30 to Y1,430 on reports that the major retailer plans to enter the personal handy telephone system market through capital participation with Astel Tokyo, a PHS operating company. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 107.08 to 21,213.50 in volume of 53.5m shares. Roundup A weak trend afflicted much of the region. SEOUL encountered late profit-taking in blue chips and some smaller-capitalised shares after three days of gains. The composite stock index lost 6.08 at 1,068.93, after a day's high of 1,080.66. Hyundai group shares gained momentum on the belief that they had been undervalued. Hyundai Pipe went limit up by Won800 to Won167,000 and Hyundai Engineering and Construction rose Won700 to Won41,600. Hyundai Precision appreciated Won700 to Won23,600 on news that the government had given the company the go-ahead to assemble Mitsubishi's mini-van. HONG KONG was indecisive, awaiting further direction from London and Wall Street, and the Hang Seng index ended down 64.15 at 8,268.50. Turnover crept up to HKDollars 2.7bn, from HKDollars 2.6bn on Tuesday. BOMBAY fell 1.5 per cent amid widespread selling by foreign and domestic mutual funds and an absence of buying support, ahead of today's close of the monthly account. The BSE 30-share index shed 61.98 to 3,978.39. Analysts said the weakness was triggered by hectic selling of India's top two blue chip companies. Reliance lost Rs17.50 or 4.6 per cent at Rs366.25 and Tisco slid Rs13.75 or 4.9 per cent to Rs265. SINGAPORE managed to pare some of its early losses but still closed lower. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 6.69 off at 2,180.38 and the UOB OTC index, tracking Malaysian stocks, slipped 1.1 to 1,083.78. KUALA LUMPUR turned softer in the afternoon amid dwindling volume, with the composite index closing 2.0 down at 951.68, off an early high of 962.58. The index was again pulled down by falls in the utility giants Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia, which saw continued foreign fund selling. Tenaga and Telekom dipped 10 cents each to MDollars 10.10 and MDollars 17.10 respectively. BANGKOK was lower in thin turnover ahead of today's vote on a proposed constitutional amendment which could reduce the power of many local authority officials. The SET index finished 12.24 points down at 1,330.35. SYDNEY was weaker in light volume after the Reserve Bank failed to unveil a widely expected rise in official short-term interest rates before the start of trading. The All Ordinaries index ended 21.9 or 1.2 per cent down at 1,869.2, just off its intraday low of 1,868.8. WELLINGTON was pulled down to a low for the year by weakness among leading stocks, and particularly Telecom, 6 cents cheaper at NZDollars 5.16. The NZSE-40 Capital index fell 10.16 to 1,931.29. TAIPEI closed 1.0 per cent higher in heavy trade which saw the weighted index rise 68.21 to 6,777.68. Turnover amounted to TDollars 86.2bn.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RADIO EMPLOYEE WINS SUIT OVER AIRED PERSONAL JOKES  </P> <P> A jury ordered a radio station and two disc jockeys to pay $694,200 in damages  to a news director they referred to with risque jokes on a "shock radio"  program.  </P> <P> Liz Randolph, 32, claimed the jokes, which implied she was promiscuous and  mentally unstable, caused her to suffer panic attacks and led her to seek  psychiatric treatment.  </P> <P> Disc jockeys Jim Quinn and Donald (Banana Don) Jefferson, and EZ Communication,  owner of WBZZ-FM, were found liable for defamation and invasion of privacy and  ordered to pay about $260,000 in damages.  </P> <P> Randolph won an additional $390,000 from Quinn and Jefferson for intentional  infliction of emotional distress.  </P> <P> In addition, the jury awarded Randolph $30,704 for medical bills and $13,500  for lost wages.  </P> <P> Randolph said she was glad she had endured a two-week trial that made public  much of her personal life, including details of her psychiatric history.  </P> <P> "We knew it was going to be tough," she said.  </P> <P> One of her attorneys, Samuel P. Kamin, said Wednesday's verdict by the  Allegheny County Common Pleas jury sends a message to broadcasters about airing  risque humor, especially jokes that target co-workers.  </P> <P> "I think that's something the industry's going to have to think twice about  now," he said. "The signal this sends is the workplace is no place for abuse."  </P> <P> "I think there's no question this will have an impact on the kind of conduct  you'll hear on morning shows," said Jeff Pollack, a Los Angeles-based media  adviser. "It's clear this case will make a lot of people think twice what they  say to fellow workers on the air."  </P></p>

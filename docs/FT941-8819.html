			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Provisional June date for Dutch telecomms sell-off The privatisation of KPN, the Dutch state-owned telecommunications and postal company, is provisionally scheduled to take place in early June, with June 7 the most likely date for the opening of subscriptions to investors. The date is contained in a provisional timetable drawn up by the banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro, after consultations with the government. The actual date may be moved depending on the progress made in preparing for the flotation, which will rank as the largest in the history of the Amsterdam stock exchange. The finance ministry declined to comment on the date, noting only that the government has said in the past that the shares would be sold before the end of June if stock market conditions permit. The Dutch state is expected to sell a 30 per cent stake in KPN when the first tranche of shares, worth an estimated Fl 5bn (Dollars 2.6bn), is offered to investors in June. Subsequent tranches in the late 1990s will reduce the government's holding to less than 50 per cent.</p>

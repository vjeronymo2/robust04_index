			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "`American' Behaved Impudently"] </F>   [Text] As the electronic mass media have already reported,  on 7 June fighters from the Russian air defense forces forced a  Lockheed C-130 aircraft belonging to the United States which had  violated Russian air space to land at Adler Airport (Sochi).    Colonel General Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief of the  Russian air defense forces, confirmed this report. he said that  the U.S. transport aircraft was detected by forces under his  command at 1328 hours Moscow time in the center of the Black  Sea. It was flying at an altitude of 6,000 meters in the  direction of Russian territory. At a distance of 100 km from  the country's state border the crew, as stipulated under  international rules, was warned of the potential violation and  was asked for its destination and flight course.    The "American" was silent.    The duty officers at the South Russian air defense command  point put the reserve forces under their subordination on combat  alert and reported the incident to the center, asking it to  ascertain the situation, but the center knew nothing about this  flight. It was not on the plan, no one had asked our  specialists for air corridors. Moreover, the crew of the U.S.  aircraft did not respond to signals from our central command  point and, continuing to fly along its former course, was  already 80 km inside Russian air space.    The air defense command decided to ban the Lockheed aircraft  crew from flying over our territory. A flight of Su-27 fighter  interceptors took off.    At the Russian Defense Ministry information and press  directorate we were told that the Russian air defense forces  fighters did not come any closer than 50 km to the U.S.  aircraft. Nonetheless the foreign crew was warned that unless it  fulfilled the orders from our military, prescribed by  international rules, "the forces on duty would take action"  against it.    IZVESTIYA was told by Colonel General Prudnikov, commander  in  chief of the air defense forces, that "the U.S. aircraft was  forced to land." It made the landing at 1410 hours Moscow time  at Adler civilian airport.    Russian competent organs have established that the Lockheed  C-130 aircraft was intended to service the U.S. diplomatic  missions in the Caucasus. It was flying from Frankfurt-am-Main  (FRG) to Tbilisi.    The crew was unable to explain why it had violated our  border.    After all the charges had been explained and the necessary  documents had been compiled the crew was given permission to  take off and at 1745 hours they left Russian territory.    First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin has, as we  know, made a statement to Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador  in Russia, in connection with this incident.    Ambassador Pickering has promised to inform the U.S.  leadership of the incident immediately and thanked the deputy  minister for the fact that the Russian military did not shoot  down the aircraft.    Circles close to the Russian Defense Ministry leadership  have  called the Lockheed crew's behavior "impudent."    Indeed, each day at Russia's Northern and Eastern borders,  in  direct proximity to its borderline, there are five or seven U.S.  combat aircraft loitering on the verge of a "foul," carrying out  surveillance and on combat duty, and, of course, keeping the  Russian air defense duty forces in a state of heightened tension.    Our aircraft have not flown close to U.S. shores for a long  time and do not come close to U.S. state borders. The Russian  military believe that this situation does not help to strengthen  the trust we so need.</p>

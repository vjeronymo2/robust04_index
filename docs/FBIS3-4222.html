			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Respect the Law"] </F>   [Text] The plan by Dr Philip Cheng Hui-ho to sue the Hunan  authorities for illegal detention and withholding his passport  is a courageous but vital step in the long-running battle to  ensure the safety of Hong Kong businessmen working and  travelling in China. Even if his case fails, he will have struck  a blow for the rule of law and shown the way for others to try  to win redress.    The American passport holder, who arrived back in the  territory this week after having been kept in China for seven  months and virtually held to ransom over a business dispute, is  just one of a string of Hong Kong businessmen who have been held  in similar cases.    In January, another businessman, Chong Kwee-sung was  released  through the intervention of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, after he had been held incommunicado for more than 30  months.    Mr Chong's release came just three days after Secretary for  Security told the Legislative Council that at least four Hong  Kong people were in detention in China as a result of commercial  disputes. He said the Government had received eight reports  involving a total of 10 people in similar situations over the  previous three years.    It is high time the Chinese authorities involved in these  cases were asked to account for their actions in court. Hong  Kong cannot object if those suspected of breaking Chinese law  are arrested or put on trial. But it is not acceptable for  businessmen to be arrested over commercial disputes unless there  are suspicions of criminal fraud. Even in criminal cases  prisoners should not be held incommunicado for long periods or  detained with neither a trial nor an explanation.    Commercial disputes should be settled in the courts, not by  arresting a company representative and then holding him until  his family or employer bail him out or indemnify his Chinese  business partners.    China has made tremendous progress in improving its judicial  and legal systems in recent years. It should not tolerate  officials who show no respect of the law, such as those who had  detained Dr Cheng for seven months without a good reason, to  tarnish the country's reputation.</p>

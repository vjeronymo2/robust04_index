			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, Jan 26 (AFP) -- French President Francois  Mitterrand held a special cabinet meeting on Bosnia Wednesday  [26 January] attended by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Defence Minister Francois  Leotard.    Balladur disclosed the meeting took place but gave no  details. It was held after the regular weekly cabinet meeting of  the full government.    Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said there was "no  change in French policy on Bosnia" and "there is no need to  change anything at all." France was "doing its duty" even if the  results were "far from satisfactory."    After the failure of a visit here on Monday by U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher when France sought strong United  States support for a new diplomatic initiative, Mitterrand said  France would make detailed new proposals on Bosnia, after the  failure of the Geneva peace conference.    Mitterrand's spokesman said that the president had insisted  to Christopher that the situation could not be left without hope.    The president also repeated France's opposition to lifting  the international arms embargo against the belligerents, which  would mean the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers and the end of the  humanitarian relief effort.    Meanwhile the Defence Ministry said Wednesday the UN  Security  Council was expected to approve the appointment of French  General Bertrand de Lapresle to head the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in ex-Yugoslavia.

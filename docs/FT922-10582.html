			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (14): Motives for moving vary greatly - Despite financial incentives and prospects of better premises, few companies move willingly - and some relocate for the strangest reasons WHY relocate? Priorities vary considerably between individual companies, although relocation agencies are fond of listing cost-related reasons why companies generally choose to move. The relocation business is full of apocryphal and sometimes true stories of locations being chosen because the plant manager wanted to be near the sea, so he could go sailing at weekends. Or allegations that the chairman's wife wanted to be closer to her family. 'It isn't surprising that the south of France and the Mediterranean coast of Spain have attracted so many companies in recent years,' says David Rees, director of Ernst &amp; Young's European Location and Advisory Services, (ELAS). Some companies, he adds, are not so accommodating in the motives for moving  -they see relocation as a chance to 'lose the dead wood' and to introduce fresh working methods with a completely new staff. Because business relocation is often disruptive and costly in financial terms and in managements' time, companies rarely relocate willingly - and generally will only move if forced to do so by cost pressures, lease-expiry, lack of space for expansion or because of significant changes in company operations, comments John Siraut, a consultant with the ELAS team in London. Nevertheless, the strangest reasons for relocating - such as the length of golf club waiting lists and even the number of swans on a river - are among light-hearted examples listed by respondents in The Director's Guide to Relocation Management, just published by the Institute of Directors and Black Horse Relocation Services, part of the Lloyds Bank group. 'Miscalculations during the relocation process can lead to the loss of key employees, plummeting morale and escalating costs,' says John Carolan, managing director of Black Horse Relocation. "And since the average cost of relocating an employee is around Pounds 14,500, companies really should plan every aspect of their relocation very carefully indeed.' But for most companies, relocation is a rare event - often imposed by unforeseen pressures - and the majority of directors will never before had to tackle the complex issues involved. The Blackhorse guide - one of a growing number of publications available from relocation agencies - offers insights into the project management of moving to new factories and offices, ranging from finding the right location; employee assistance and communication; the role of professional advisors; the legal minefield of redundancy and how to organise the physical move itself. Inspite of the upheaval of relocation for businesses, more than 3,600 organisations in the UK, including 1,000 of the largest companies, 17 per cent reported in a new report that that they have 'firm plans' for relocation or expansion elsewhere, particularly in the areas of office accommodation and warehousing. 'Despite the recessionary climate, it is clear that the corporate relocation market remains very active,' comments Stephen Mallen, head of Research at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, which carried out the survey, in conjunction with Stanhope Properties. Among the business sectors which indicated they were most likely to relocate were energy (17 per cent), transport and communications (nearly 15 per cent), retailing and catering (14 per cent). The manufacturing sector remains the least active in relocation (at seven per cent), while only three per cent of the top 1,000 companies in the UK say they have plans to take new premises on the European continent - 'the UK relocation market will continue to be an intrinsically domestic domain,' comments Stephen Mallen. Fifty per cent of the UK companies which are considering relocation said that they hoped to implement their plans in the next 12 months, with a stronger preference for freehold property, rather than leasehold tenure. Nearly a third of the companies with relocation plans said that their prime reason for moving was the poor quality or inadequacy of current premises - 'the main concern is now the quality and suitability of new premises, rather than its cost implications,' suggests Stephen Mallen. In another new report, Jones Lang Wootton's review of property confidence lists the factors influencing the choice of location, in order of importance. They include: Accessibility and communications. Property costs. Labour availability. Property availability. Local environment. Labour costs. Image of the company. Business services available. Housing costs. Local housing supply. Schooling facilities. Employment for family members. Cultural, entertainment and shopping facilities. Regionally, the patterns for relocation vary considerably: in the south-east of England, where Jones Lang Wootton interviewed more than 650 companies, employing, in all, 600,000 office workers and occupying over 100m sq. ft of office space, less than a fifth of the companies expect to take more office. 'Demand for office space in the south-east as a whole is expected to reach 13.8m sq. ft - only half the amount of six months ago,' say JLW analaysts. Office employment in the region is expected to fall by 3.1 per cent over the next year. This, they suggest, is equivalent to the loss of 56,000 office jobs in the south-east. Nevertheless, business confidence is stabilising, with fewer than 10 per cent of companies reporting that they are 'less confident.' Nearly a third of businesses claim they are 'more confident' about the outlook for their business over the next six months, although companies in the region appear to have 'narrowed their planning horizons.' The number of occupiers with property plans extending beyond two years has fallen significantly. Companies offering guaranteed house-sale price support to relocating staff are currently voicing concern over the increasing potential for capital losses in the weak property market. In an effort to illustrate the cost-effectiveness of using relocation agencies to arrange staff housing, Nationwide Relocation has just released figures to support its claim that using an agency can provide savings of up to a third, compared with companies which attempt to arranging their own relocation. Citing an example of a client seeking to relocate an employee who wants to sell his house for Pounds 106,000, Nationwide claims it could achieve a 33 per cent saving through using its services. The agency says it would provide almost a 50 per cent savings to its client on bridging costs alone. Much of this would be achieved by a substantially reduced selling period, thus cutting the time for a client to provide a bridging loan. On a Pounds 106,000 house, this might work out at around Pounds 6,420, compared with Pounds 13,780 without using the agency service, assuming that Nationwide sold the house within seven months, compared to the present national average of 12 months. The company claims that other savings could be made on reduced legal fees, removal and survey costs. In total, it would cost the average business more than Pounds 27,000 to relocate an employee, including bridging loan, legal fees, surveys and loss on sale - compared with around Pounds 18,440 by using the Nationwide services, including fees.

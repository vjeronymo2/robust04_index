			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Touring Europe's green and set-aside land - A journey from Norfolk to Austria reveals the early evidence of farm policy reform a heavily timbered hotel in a village surrounded by snow-covered slopes in the Arlberg region of Austria. The starting point - a somewhat less pretty but well-loved village in the middle of Norfolk, England. The journey - by road and sea-ferry with a few friends as anxious as I for a temporary change of scenery and the feel of some snow under their skis. As we left home, much of the autumn-sown corn had begun to recover from indifferent planting conditions and the wettest early winter for years. But, ironically, the forecast was for snow and bitterly-cold weather, which we knew would put back that recovery as well as delaying spring-cereal planting. We would far rather go to find snow elsewhere and have it stay away from our farms in late February and early March. On the journey to the ferry, the 15 per cent of East Anglian fields left unploughed so that weeds and other green material could regenerate naturally and qualify the land for voluntary set-aside - the most visible result of the 1992 reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy - was beginning to show itself. And although the devaluation of the pound last autumn will result in increased compensation payments for UK farmers when they set land aside, none of us in the vehicle thought the extra cash made the exercise attractive. An uneventful crossing from Felixstowe to Zebrugge was notable only for the fact that many of our fellow passengers were only making day trips to fill up their cars and vans with duty-free booze and cigarettes. Then towards Brussels - the home of Eurocrats and the centre of agricultural decision-making. We did not go into the centre to throw eggs at the EC's Berlaymont building in the Rue de la Loi as some French farmers might have done. But we did say a few rude things about the lack of practicality and grass-roots agricultural knowledge of many of those who worked there as we took the many-bridged by-pass autoroute around the town. Some might say, however, that we were cursing the wrong people. For about 50 km (30 miles) south-east of Brussels, just off the main road, is the Belgian University of Gembloux. Back in the early and mid-1970s, the professor of agriculture there, a man called Laloux, developed what he called 'blueprints' for the production of cereals, the purpose of these strict planting, fertilising and spraying programmes being to maximise yields. Little calculation as to whether or not the exercise was profitable was necessary. Yield was everything and the community's guaranteed-price system ensured that profitability followed yields upwards. Other experts in other areas of the EC followed the Laloux example and developed similar blueprints for their local conditions. And we farmers adopted them with enthusiasm; they meant, after all, that we made bigger profits. But they also led to increases in production, to unsustainable surpluses and eventually to the reform of the CAP. Nobody uses the blueprints today - we cannot afford to. The emphasis is on minimising inputs and optimising yields rather than maximising production. A series of EC price cuts, which will deepen as CAP reform continues, has seen to that. And, to be fair, the result is a more sensible use of resources as well as being more environment friendly. But the Laloux blueprints of the 1970s were a necessary step to the fuller understanding of the physiology of cereals which, in turn, is helping us to survive the stringent economies of the 1990s. Moving south, through the Lorraine, across the Maginot Line, into the Moselle and Alsace and towards Strasbourg, home of the European Parliament, I found the road is much improved since I last travelled it, presumably to make it easier for the hordes of EC officials who are forced to make the journey each time the Parliament meets. The crops of autumn-sown grain were looking even sadder than those we had left at home. A few farmers were out with their fertiliser-spreaders trying to apply nitrogen to encourage them to grow. Here, too, the set-aside land is beginning to be obvious, although there is less of it than in East Anglia because of small-farm exemptions. We passed through little Luxembourg on the way; not a particularly significant agricultural member of the community but the one that has provided the new Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Rene Steichen, in succession to Ireland's Mr Ray MacSharry, author of CAP reform, who has retired to Ireland. Onwards, across the Rhine and to the forests and small farms of southern Germany. Most of the land was already covered with a light dusting of snow, so it was not so easy to make roadside judgments. Even so, the occasional farm cart, hauled by horses, reminded us of the wide range of living standards that still exist within our so-called Common Market. I remembered a speech I had heard in Berlin from out-going German farm minister and Bavarian farmer, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, only a few weeks ago at the opening of the Green Week, the annual agricultural jamboree. He had followed on to the platform Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the French Farm minister, who had declared unequivocally that there was no way France would accept the agricultural restrictions the US deal on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would impose. Mr Kiechle, in an attempt, no doubt, to cement Franco-German unity on such matters, never mind that it had already been accepted by other members, agreed that the agricultural aspects of the agreement would have to be re-negotiated. As we crossed the border into Austria and out of the European Community, I could not help reflecting on the enormous and seemingly-insuperable differences that existed between the members of the so-called European family. And yet, in 1989, Austria applied for membership of that family, we are told with the agreement of a majority of its citizens, including most of its farmers. Why? I know from previous visits that Austrian farmers receive 50 per cent more for their wheat than I do in the UK; those with dairy farms get twice as much for their milk; and instead of the detested set-aside, the Austrian government has decided to subsidise its farmers to produce non-food crops, such as oilseed rape, to refine into diesel fuel. There is an apparent acceptance by Austrians that they have a duty to ensure that the 6.3 per cent of farmers in their population are as well off as the rest of the community. Oh, for a touch of that attitude in the UK] Furthermore, partly because of a strong Austrian schilling and a weak pound, I have just paid a man who used to be just a farmer but is now the proprietor of a sports shop as well, the equivalent value of one tonne of UK wheat for a six-day ski-lift ticket and another man the world price of a tonne of wheat to hire a set of skis and sticks for the same period. The village where I am staying is packed with people from all over Europe who are queueing up to do the same thing. Austria earns more per head from tourism than any European country, in or out of the EC, and a fair proportion of the benefit of that goes directly or indirectly to agriculture. I can only ask again - why on earth do Austrians, and Austrian farmers in particular, want to risk losing their independence by joining the European Community?</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "Before Starting an Offensive Against Crime, </F> the Workers of Law Enforcement Organs Plan To Bring Order to  Their Own Ranks"]    [Text] A meeting of the republic's council to fight crime  was held on 25 May. The leaders of a number of ministries and  departments were invited to it. Kairbek Suleymenov, a state  adviser, gave a report.    The speaker noted that a lot of criticism is being directed  against the president and the government for the state of crime.  But few take upon themselves the work of analyzing how  consistently measures are being carried out that are directed at  strengthening law and order and legality. For example, necessary  changes to legislation are being made effectively. Work is  coming to a conclusion on the adoption of a crime and a criminal  procedure code. A state program of legal reforms is being  implemented. Organizational measures set forth in the anticrisis  program and the program to fight crime in 1993-1995 have been  implemented in many ways through edicts and decrees of the  president and decisions of the government. In a word, there is a  legal basis for strengthening the fight against crime in the  republic. And the references of executives of law enforcement  organs to its absence only indicates their unprofessionalism and  poor understanding of the situation, and their elementary legal  ignorance.    The speaker recalled that the February 1992 decrees of the  president proposed to discharge those who were unable to cope  with their duties from the positions they occupied. However,  there has been no work in this direction to the present day. It  is not a question of firing personnel, but it is no longer  possible to condone the obvious idleness of individual workers.  A good third of the officials on the job are of no use, but the  departmental chiefs resigned themselves to this a long time ago.  In the last two years, just in the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs], 636 extraordinary incidents and 380 violations of the  law were committed, and 215 officials were convicted for various  crimes. Four thousand and seven hundred and sixty-six persons  were discharged for unfavorable reasons. The offensive against  crime will not start until strict order is established in the  system of law enforcement and judicial organs itself.    The economic services of the MVD are not working  effectively,  where under the slogan of healthy competition they actually  continue to duplicate each other and where various organs work  on trivia.    In summing up what was said, Kairbek Suleymenov declared  that  in individual oblasts whole subunits have not given any results  for years, and a good half of the officials of the economic  services of the MVD are not worth their salt, and no one is in a  position to compel them to work on important matters. The  solution, in the opinion of the state adviser, is to unite these  services and to conduct a tough objective report on the  efficiency of the personnel.    The protection of public order is also organized with poor  results. The meager means of the budget are frequently spent on  computer equipment, which later rusts in storehouses. Acquired  motor vehicles are used by thousands of chiefs of all ranks for  personal purposes, but not for patrolling by mobile militia  groups.    It has also become the norm for the courts to examine cases  with a violation of dates. The Procuracy continues to engage in  writing concepts that are not read by anyone and in senseless  checks on the state of lawfulness. Cases of liberalism toward  dangerous criminals on the part of the courts have become  general. The Ministry of Justice does not have continuous  effective information about punitive practice.    Kairbek Suleymenov also said, in particular, that the  distinguishing feature of criminal tension is the theft of  firearms and ammunition in military units. In the last two years  and four months, more than 1,300 firearms items were stolen,  including 160 assault rifles and more than 500 pistols. In this  same period, 2,059 rifle barrels were confiscated from the  population, including 91 assault rifles and 825 pistols.  Firearms were employed in the commission of 2,465 crimes.    The state adviser proposed to carry out an action of the  voluntary surrender of firearms and ammunition, which will  promote an improvement in the situation.    Taking part in the discussion of the report were Minister of  Internal Affairs Vladimir Shumov, Procurator General of the  Republic Zharmakhan Tuyakbayev, KNB [National Security  Committee] Deputy Chairman Zhenisbek Zhumanbekov, Deputy  Minister of Defense Valeriy Sapsay, and Commander of Internal  Troops Aleksey Filistovich.    The result of the discussion of the question was the  adoption  of a protocol decision directed at reinforcing the fight against  crime and strengthening legality in the republic.</p>

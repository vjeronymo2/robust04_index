			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CANADA UNVEILS ABORTION BILL  </P> <P> The Canadian government unveiled an abortion law today that allows a woman to  end her pregnancy at any time if a doctor believes her life or health is  threatened.  </P> <P> The long-awaited legislation will fill the void created when Canada's Supreme  Court struck down a more restrictive law last year but will end what has become  a practice of abortion on demand that resulted from the lack of an abortion  law.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government had promised new legislation since  the previous law was declared unconstitutional in January, 1988.  </P> <P> "The bill introduced today establishes that the question of abortion is a  medical decision to be made between a woman and her doctor, based on health  grounds," Justice Minister Doug Lewis told reporters.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: SEMTECH REPORTS LOSS OF $152,000 IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Semtech Corp., a Newbury Park maker of rectifiers and other electronic  components, reported a $152,000 loss for its fiscal third quarter, contrasted  with a $251,000 profit a year earlier.  </P> <P> The loss in the quarter that ended Oct. 28 came despite a 12% increase in  revenue, to $5.47 million from $4.90 million. The loss partly reflected a  $300,000 charge that Semtech incurred during the quarter in connection with  closure of a subsidiary.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Semtech's net income fell to  $40,000 from $830,000 a year earlier, and its nine-month revenue edged up to  $14.8 million from $14.6 million.  </P></p>

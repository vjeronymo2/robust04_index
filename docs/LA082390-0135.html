			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS NEWS PRESIDENT RESIGNS AFTER TWO BELEAGUERED YEARS  </P> <P> CBS News President David Burke has resigned, ending a two-year reign as the  embattled head of the troubled news division, CBS executives confirmed late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> An announcement about Burke's resignation could come as early as today, sources  said. The network is expected to name Eric Ober, president of the CBS  Television Stations division and a former CBS News senior executive, as his  replacement.  </P> <P> Although Burke had his authority repeatedly challenged by CBS executives  outside the news division, sources said his resignation was not due to  differences with management on issues of budget or philosophy.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Burke's relationship with CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A.  Tisch was said to be increasingly antagonistic, and periodically over the last  six months rumors flared of Burke's impending resignation.  </P> <P> Why he chose this time to suddenly resign is unclear, but sources speculated  that Burke, a former aide to ex-Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York and Sen. Edward  M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), may be planning to re-enter politics. His name has often  been mentioned in connection with a possible presidential bid by New York Gov.  Mario Cuomo, a good friend.  </P> <P> Sources did not say exactly when Burke would leave, but several people said he  is expected to stay on until late September to conclude a public service  campaign at CBS News that he has spearheaded. That would also give the incoming  CBS News president time to participate in formulating the division's 1991  budget.  </P> <P> Burke, the No. 2 executive at ABC News before being recruited almost exactly  two years ago, was seen as a no-nonsense type who ended the incessant leaking  to the press that had come to characterize the news division.  </P> <P> Nearly a decade of wrenching changes in the broadcast industry and increased  competition in television news have contributed to instability within CBS News.  The division has had five presidents the last seven years.  </P> <P> CBS News was once considered the model network news organization, but years of  budget cutbacks, mass layoffs and defections have badly tarnished CBS News'  reputation.  </P> <P> To some extent, Burke had halted the turmoil at CBS News.  </P> <P> He immediately made it known after coming aboard in August, 1988, that any news  division employee who was caught -- indeed, even suspected -- of leaking  stories or making unauthorized contacts with the press would be out of a job.  </P> <P> And he set the example himself by turning down virtually all requests for  interviews, except during official CBS News functions.  </P> <P> Though he helped shore up the news division's public image, and pushed for more  exhaustive coverage of news events, Burke nonetheless was considered within the  CBS News organization to be a remote manager who largely delegated day-to-day  operations to his chief lieutenant, Joseph Peyronnin.  </P> <P> One joke had it that Burke could walk through the halls of the Broadcast  Center, as CBS News headquarters in New York is known, without being  recognized.  </P> <P> Burke may best be remembered as the CBS News president who succeeded in  teaching anchorman Dan Rather who was boss, CBS insiders say.  </P> <P> Before Burke's arrival, Rather's blessing was frequently needed for management  changes. That changed under Burke, and some CBS insiders thought that Rather's  new status was underscored by the fact that the decision on Burke's resignation  was apparently reached while the anchorman was covering the Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> Under Burke, CBS News returned to a more hard-edged kind of coverage than had  existed under the division's previous two presidents -- Howard Stringer, now  president of CBS Broadcast Group, and Van Gordon Sauter. Still, Burke was  unable to stop "CBS Evening News' " slide from first to second place in the  ratings, or develop a new hit news program akin to CBS's "60 Minutes" or ABC's  "Nightline."  </P> <P> Eric Ober, who is expected to succeed Burke, comes into the job with two  advantages that Burke did not possess. First, he has good relations with the  inner circle of top CBS executives -- Tisch, Stringer, Senior Vice President  Jay Kriegel and CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky. And, second, he is  highly regarded by many inside the news division, where he was a vice president  of public affairs between 1984 and 1987, overseeing such programs as "60  Minutes."  </P> <P> Whether those advantages are enough to overcome the obstacles ahead remains to  be seen.  </P> <P> Although frequently thought of as a glamorous job that entails such  responsibilities as defending the First Amendment before Congress, network news  division presidents today spend most of their time quelling turf wars and  lobbying parsimonious corporate managers for more money to cover news.  </P> <P> Moreover, Ober will have to show that he can move CBS News, and particularly  "CBS Evening News," closer to first place -- a difficult task, given that ABC's  "World News Tonight" has solidified its No. 1 position and, with it, the  perception that ABC is the best-run network news organization.  </P></p>

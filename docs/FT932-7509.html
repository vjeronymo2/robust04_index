			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Offspring of Thatcherism ON THE day after Mrs Thatcher announced her resignation from office as Prime Minister, I was teaching history to a group of 18-year-olds; and I asked them to discuss what the Thatcher years had meant to them. They all carried on about the iniquities of the poll tax, were otherwise more or less 50/50 for and against her achievements, and all remarked that they had no memories (and little knowledge) of politics before Thatcherism. In this new work, Trevor Griffiths charts the lives of seven children who are several years older - aged 15 when Thatcher became Prime Minister - from 1979 to 1993 (plus a prologue in 1973 and an epilogue in 1999). Thatcher's Children is often entertaining, and for anyone in the audience aged 30 or more it provides the incidental fun of connecting the events onstage with those of our own lives. (I too received a Kissogram in 1983.) But this project - one offspring of the Arts Council's 'Be Bold' scheme, which has been lending a new spurt to several regional theatres  - is fraught with problems. Are these really Thatcher's children? On the brink of leaving school in 1979, their minds have surely been formed chiefly by years of Labour governments. And how to handle seven separate lives over thirty years? Griffiths's text is full of short episodes that should connect more seamlessly than they do in Andrew Hay's clunky, messy staging, which makes a long evening longer with jerky scene-breaks, semi-audible audiotape, uninteresting lighting. Each of Griffiths's characters is complex, 3-D, surprising (and well acted). These 'Yorkshire' children are an engagingly motley group: Afro-Caribbean, Pakistani, Welsh, Jewish, et al. Hester grows up to be a black lesbian power-dressing Thatcher-supporter; Daisy becomes a left-wing journalist; Sandra is beaten by her father and, later, her husband; Mona takes to prostitution; 'Girly' becomes a pusher; Wayne becomes a cop (but goes to jail for killing his baby); Tom keeps trying to shake off his conformist middle-class roots. Hard, however, to believe that they could all have been pals even at school; and impossible that they should all keep in touch 10 or more years later. Unreal though the set-up is, it proceeds with the air of a documentary - a series of short clips taken from separate lives, adding up to a complex picture. Yet not complex enough for its subject; though Griffiths makes Hester (the black lesbian) interesting to us, her Thatcherism is the least interesting, and the least 'felt', thing about her. The intense conviction to which Mrs Thatcher inspired her supporters is absent. The evils of Thatcher's Britain, however, are very present: race riots, drugs, Clause 28, child abuse, police brutality, the me-me-me mentality. Yes, quite a litany - and it omits the poll tax] - but highly partial. At its most obvious, Thatcher's Children is just a crude socialist documentary - is virtually Agitprop. But its many strands include some poetry, much comedy, and memorable imagery. You remember afterwards the plaits of hair that the Pakistani boy cuts off in an effort to conform; the black prostitute who, while masturbating a customer, remarks 'Where I come from, it's all hands to t'pump'; the girl who remembers her Jewish grandmother's advice that 'Truth swims, but lies float'; and more. Nonetheless, it only flickers fitfully into life. Though you admire its ambition, you cannot miss the fact that it has bitten off more than it can chew. At the Bristol, Old Vic, until June 12</p>

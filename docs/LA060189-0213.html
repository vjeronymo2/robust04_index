			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PITINO VOWS TO KEEP WINNING IN KENTUCKY  </P> <P> Rick Pitino, who has made a career of rebuilding basketball programs, vowed  today to immediately turn around the downtrodden Kentucky program, the  winningest in college basketball history.  </P> <P> "When people say we can't be competitive, let's prove them wrong. And that's  what we're about to do," Pitino said. "It's been a tradition with me to say,  'We will win, and we will win right away.' "  </P> <P> Kentucky's Athletics Board unanimously approved Pitino's hiring earlier today.  He was given a seven-year contract with a base salary of $105,000, but that  will grow with income from coaches shows and endorsements.  </P> <P> "It was a lateral move economically," said Pitino, who resigned as coach of the  New York Knicks on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Pitino will spend his first three years dealing with NCAA probation --  including a two-year ban on postseason tournament play and no live television  next season -- for recruiting violations under Coach Eddie Sutton, who resigned  in March.  </P> <P> "The sanctions and probation just make it tougher," Pitino said. "But we will  overcome all obstacles to make Kentucky basketball rich again."  </P> <P> He warned boosters to keep their enthusiasm in the stands. "Come to the games  and cheer as loud as you can. But stay away from our practices; stay away from  my players," he said.  </P></p>

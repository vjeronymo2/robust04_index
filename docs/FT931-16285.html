			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Second tier stocks continue to lead DIVERGENCE between blue chips and second tier stocks continued to widen in London yesterday as the market's top 100 stocks backed away on currency and interest rate uncertainty while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which ranges further down the list of London quoted stocks, extended its recent gain to close at a new peak. Attention now focuses on this morning's policy meeting at the Bundesbank, in the hope that a cut in German rates will open the way for rate reductions in the UK. As expected, the Footsie stocks responded yesterday to moves in the March futures contract on the FT-SE Index, which improved briefly but then led the stock market lower. An erratic session saw the FT-SE Index peak early for the day at 2,839.2 before drifting down to a close of 2,826.0, a net loss of 7.6. The index has fallen by around 1.2 per cent from its all-time high of 2,861.5, reached on January 4. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, gained a further 9.1, or 0.2 per cent, at 2,919.3, yet another record high, as investors continued to buy the domestically orientated stocks thought likely to benefit from the signs of improvement in the UK economy apparently signposted by the outcome of consumer spending at the UK stores over Christmas. The increased significance of the second tier stocks was reflected in plans for a new futures instrument to incorporate the smaller stocks. From today, Smith New Court, one of London's most aggressive marketmakers, will make markets in futures contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index and five sector indices - banks, electricity, health and household, oils and water indices. Seaq volume of 701.0m shares provided another indication of the underlying strength of the stock market. Tuesday's Seaq total of 769.1m shares was worth Pounds 1.42bn in retail business, one of the best daily totals for the past four months. However, traders were still inclined to caution, pointing out that Scottish institutions have not yet returned to full working levels, and that many London-based fund managers are on holiday until the end of the week. Firmness in sterling, conventionally a support for base rate optimism, was overshadowed by developments in other European currencies and by caution ahead of the Bundesbank meeting. The absence of the rights issue from a blue chip company with which the market had been threatened on Tuesday brought only temporary relief since many strategists believe that equity fund-raisings, together with government financing, will provide a serious threat to progress in share prices in the early months of this year. Store shares, which provided much of the momentum for the pre-Christmas advance in the UK stock market, drifted yesterday as they awaited further confirmation of improvement in consumer spending. At NatWest Securities, the equity strategy team suggested that 'the fun is over' for UK equities, following the 25 per cent upsurge in the market during the latter part of last year. If shares advance further on the expectations of lower interest rates, then the NatWest team advises selling into strength. It comments that any UK recovery will be export-led, with only modest improvement in consumer spending.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI at Pounds 327m and disposals planned Thorn EMI said yesterday that it was negotiating to sell its security business and part of its defence subsidiary. A sale of the businesses could precipitate a demerger of its core music and rental divisions. The group said it was interested in entering book publishing, if it could find the right company to acquire. Thorn yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 326.5m for the year to March 31. That compared with a restated Pounds 273.5m last time, but fell below market expectations. The shares fell 28p to Pounds 10.68. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said the group was in 'detailed negotiations' to sell a majority stake in its security business. Thorn would retain a minority interest, he said. He added that the group was negotiating to sell part of its lossmaking defence business, which has been on the market for several years. Sir Colin said the negotiations were with a continental European defence group. Negotiations with GEC have taken place on several occasions over the past few years. Sir Colin said about Pounds 400m of turnover came from activities regarded as peripheral. Thorn was currently negotiating to sell businesses representing just over half that amount. Total turnover for 1993-94 was Pounds 4.3bn, compared with Pounds 4.5bn last time. Mr Simon Duffy, finance director, said the group was interested in moving into book publishing, a field in which it could use its expertise in copyright management. He added: 'We're looking at opportunities in the book publishing business. It's got to be available, it's got to be the right fit and the right price.' The group has renamed its rental business Thorn Group, differentiating it more clearly from EMI Music. Thorn Group is run from the UK, while the music subsidiary has its headquarters in New York. Sir Colin said yesterday that splitting the two divisions could only be considered when the peripheral businesses have been sold. Mr Duffy said that once this had happened, media or film companies which were not in the music business might be interested in linking up with EMI. Operating profits were Pounds 382.5m, compared with Pounds 379.3m. Music profits were Pounds 246.1m (Pounds 196.9m) and those for rental Pounds 130.2m (Pounds 115.3m). The recommended final dividend is 25p, bringing the total pay-out to 34p (32p). Fully diluted earnings per share were 47.7p (43p). Sir Colin said the increased dividend reflected the group's confidence in its prospects during the current year. See Lex</p>

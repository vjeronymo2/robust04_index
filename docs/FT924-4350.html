			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Competition cuts phone charges MANY TELEPHONE bills will be reduced from January after British Telecommunications and Mercury Communications yesterday announced a series of price changes. Further cuts in phone bills are in prospect later next year as a result of vigorous competition between the two telecommunication companies. In a break with its traditional pricing policy, BT said it might reduce its prices by more than required by Oftel, the industry regulator, in order to persuade customers to make more calls. The change in BT's pricing policy has been prompted by a combination of increased competition, tighter regulation and the arrival of executives who have experience of market driven industries. Prominent among these is Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, who was chairman of Lloyds Abbey Life until last year. BT yesterday announced a freeze on call charges, bigger discounts on its standard rates for customers who make many calls and improved terms on its optional pricing packages. Calls to the US and Canada will be cut by between 3 and 10 per cent. But BT said line rental charges would be increased by 5.9 per cent. As a result of the changes, businesses will see their phone bills fall by between 0.6 per cent and 4.1 per cent, depending on their size, BT said. But the average residential customer's bill will rise by 2.4 per cent. Mercury pre-empted BT's price changes by announcing improvements to its own optional pricing packages, which it said would give customers extra savings of 5 per cent. Optional pricing packages are a new feature in the UK telecommunications market which allow customers to pay cheaper call rates in exchange for higher standing charges. Mr Hepher said BT had more price cuts 'up our sleeve' which it did not want to reveal for competitive reasons. According to preliminary calculations by Oftel, BT must cut its prices on average by a further 2 per cent before the end of next July to comply with regulations. This would reduce phone bills by another Pounds 150m. But Mr Hepher said BT might go further than required if it found that customers were responding to lower call charges by increasing the use of their phones. 'There is no doubt that prices for telephony are coming down and the more people use the phone, the more they will come down' said Mr Hepher. He added that BT would be testing various measures to stimulate phone usage, such as cheaper European calls throughout January and discounts for customers with a second telephone at home. Since last month it has introduced cheap calls on Sunday afternoons, which has led to a doubling of call volumes. The moves were generally welcomed by telephone user and consumer groups, although some expressed concern about the increase in line rental charges which will disproportionately fall on poorer residential customers. BT's share price fell 4p to 414p. Cable and Wireless, which owns Mercury, suffered a 16p fall to 643p, although much of this was accounted for by the uncertainty in Hong Kong.

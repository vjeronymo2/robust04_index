The Armenian side has realized the weakness of  its military forces and moved to disseminate unfounded  information in order to mislead its own people and the world  community.    Quoting Armenia's news agencies, Russia's television network  reported today that one of Azerbaijan's fighter aircraft has  been shot down over Khankendi [Stepanakert]. The Azerbaijan  Armed Forces Command Headquarters has disclosed that all of the  Republic's military aircraft are ready for action.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Abidjan La Chaine Nationale Une  Television Network in French on 7 February carries in its  regular 2000 GMT newscast a report on the final obsequies of the  Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny at the Our Lady of  Peace Basilica in Yamoussoukro. The announcer says the ceremony  "started this morning at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Foundation  for the Promotion of Peace, where the wake continued throughout  the night Saturday, 5 February, until this morning. The remains  were then transferred to the Our Lady of Peace Basilica for the  requiem mass."    The video shows Houphouet-Boigny's coffin, which is draped  in  the national colors, being carried by military officers in  ceremonial dress to the basilica. A long procession of about 15  Catholic bishops from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo,  and Senegal and a representative of the pope, as well as priests  and mass servers, precede the coffin, which was immediately  followed by the widowed first lady, Marie-Therese  Houphouet-Boigny, who is flanked by President Henri Konan Bedie  and his wife.    The announcer says that "many foreign heads of state came to  join us in our pain to participate in this requiem mass. They  include Togolese President Gnassignbe Eyadema, Cameroonian  President Paul Biya, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba,  Guinean President Lansana Conte, Niger President Mahamane  Ousmane, Gabonese President Omar Bongo, Cape Verdean President  Antonio Monteiro, Chadian President Idriss Deby, Namibian  President Sam Nujoma, Guinea-Bissau President Bernardo Vieira,  Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, Burkinabe President Blaise  Compaore, Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, and French President  Francois Mitterrand." He continues: "Also to be noted is the  attendance of Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Zairean  President Mobutu Sese Seko, Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare,  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, and other high-ranking  political personalities," adding that the presence of all these  foreign dignitaries shows "how much President Houphouet-Boigny  was held in high esteem outside our country."    In his homily, Monsignor Bernard Aggrey, bishop of the  Yamoussoukro Diocese, who co-celebrated the mass with Cardinal  Bernardin Gantin, special representative of Pope John-Paul II,  said: "That President Houphouet-Boigny was a prestigious  traditional and modern chief, acclaimed worldwide, testifies to  this rainbow of personalities who have come from all over the  world to pay their last tribute. Houphouet-Boigny, who, in his  lifetime, was overwhelmed with honor, loaded with glory, and  covered with praises from everywhere, breathed his last during  the early morning of 7 December 1993 and then joined God the  Father, who created him, like other men, in his image and  likeness."    After the mass, the long procession of clergy left the  basilica, followed by the immediate family of the deceased, who  then lined up in front of the building to receive the  condolences of all the heads of state and the delegations who  attended the mass. The coffin was then carried out of the  basilica by the same group of military officers and handed over  to the family. The cloth of national colors in which the coffin  was draped was neatly folded and handed to Marie-Therese  Houphouet-Boigny, according to the announcer. The coffin was  then placed on an Army vehicle and driven to the gates of the  president's personal residence, where the coffin was formally  handed over to the family. The video shows a large crowd  watching the coffin as it is taken into the compound of the  residence. The announcer says the burial will be restricted to  family members.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Lloyd's inquiry starts as insider row grows SIR David Walker's independent committee investigating Lloyd's meets for the first time this morning amid mounting controversy about whether insiders had an unfair advantage in trading at the insurance market. Official Lloyd's figures show that nine catastrophe reinsurance syndicates which face serious losses in 1989 contained a disproportionately low number of working Names, individuals who have at some time had jobs with agencies, syndicates and brokers at Lloyd's. Names are the individuals whose personal assets back underwriting at the insurance market. Equally, of the six most profitable syndicates in 1988 - the last year for which final results are available - five contain significantly more than their proportionate share of working Names. However, trends emerging from the data, which Lloyd's is to make available to all Names, are so far not as clear-cut as these isolated statistics make it appear. For example, a number of syndicates attracting large numbers of working Names performed badly in 1988. Syndicate 764, an average-sized marine syndicate made a loss of more than three times its premium income when it increased its reserves against future claims from asbestosis and pollution. Of its 624 Names, 259 - about 40 per cent - are working members, giving it the fifth-highest proportion of apparent insiders in the market. Taking the 10 syndicates with the highest proportion of working Names in 1988, however, seven returned profits for their Names. Over 35 per cent of the 581 Names on syndicate 45, which was the market's best performer in 1988, are working members. Lloyd's has admitted that some syndicates with a greater than average participation of external Names have incurred heavy losses from catastrophe business. However, it insists that in the market as a whole working Names do not benefit to the detriment of outsiders. It says that the conclusions of a recent extensive investigation into business practices at Lloyd's, which show that on average outside Names obtained better results than working Names in two of the last three years, are still valid. Further problems with interpreting the data include: The fact that not all working Names still have jobs at the market. They include a number of working Names who have retired or who had only fleeting involvement. Syndicates that have performed outstandingly well or badly are unrepresentative of the market's overall composition. All six of the most profitable syndicates in 1988 were smaller than the average which is capitalised at about Pounds 27.5m. Relatives of working Names are categorised as outsiders even though, it is alleged by Lloyd's critics, they have preferential access to better syndicates and information. It is believed that some categories of working Names - underwriters - do better than others, for example, brokers. The composition of Sir David's committee came under fresh attack last night in a letter to Mr Coleridge from Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs spokeswoman. Ms Mowlam questioned the suitability of Mr John Lock and Mr Leslie Lucas, two of the four committee members. These individuals 'represent companies which are deeply involved in the LMX (reinsurance) spiral and any confirmation of allegations concerning possible malpractice and mismanagement might have a direct bearing on their firms.' Mr Lock is chairman of Mercantile and General, Britain's largest commercial reinsurer. Mr Lucas is chief executive of Norwich Winterthur Reinsurance. Ms Mowlam also questioned the involvement of Mr Jonathan Foster, a member of Lloyd's legal department. who is to act as secretary. The other two members are Sir William Clark MP, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee and a consultant to Commercial Union Assurance, and Mr Peter Mynors, a senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- A meeting held here  today marked the 46th anniversary of the historic joint  conference of representatives of political parties and public  organisations in North and South Korea.    The conference convened in Pyongyang in April 1948 discussed  measures to frustrate the moves of the U.S. imperialists and the  traitors for a permanent split of the nation and establish a  unified democratic government with concerted efforts of the  patriotic forces in North and South Korea.    In his historic report "The Political Situation in North  Korea" at the conference, President Kim Il-song laid bare the  sinister intention and true color of the U.S. imperialists and  the traitors in South Korea seeking the division of Korea and  indicated epoch- making nation-saving measures for all patriotic  forces in North and South Korea to unite and fight a nationwide  struggle with a common fighting goal to oppose the separate  "elections" in South Korea and establish a unified democratic  government.    Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central  Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the  Fatherland, in his report at the meeting said the joint  conference was a brilliant example of a political consultative  conference in which representatives of political parties,  groupings and strata in the North and South with different  ideologies and political views sat together and discussed  measures of a joint struggle.    "The conference convinced people that when the patriotic  forces in the North and South united and waged a joint struggle,  they could frustrate the nation-splitting moves of the U.S.  imperialists and traitors and reunify the country," the reporter  said.    He described "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the  Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" put forward  by the respected leader President Kim Il-song last year as a  banner of national unity calling for the great unity of the  whole nation based on patriotism and the spirit of national  independence and as a brilliant embodiment of the great  all-embracing policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on  magnanimously embracing even those who once committed crimes  against the nation and achieving broad unity.    He said, "The South Korean rulers have ignored our sincere  efforts for he great unity of the whole nation, turned  North-South relations into hostile relations of confrontation,  totally blocked North-South dialogues and staged hysteric war  exercises against the North, follwing outside forces."    "If the entire nation is to unite into one," he continued,  "The principle of national independence must be observed. The  Koreans at home and abroad must reject the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique's policy of depending on outside forces and vigorously  fight to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from  South Korea and turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free,  peace zone."    The reporter said the South Korean authorities, though  belatedly, must discard the foolish dream of realising their  sinister intention in reliance on outside forces, join hands  with fellow countrymen from the position of national  independence, accept the 10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation and respond to the historic proposal for a  national conference.</p>

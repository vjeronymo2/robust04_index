This found expression chiefly in  China-made rolling stock meeting the demand of railway  transportation at home, with an increasingly greater volume of  exports overseas.    China Railway Rolling Stock Industrial General Company,  which  has a reputation of being China's "railway transportation  equipment department," possessing 35 factories manufacturing  railway rolling stock, four repair workshops, and four research  institutes. In recent years, the company has pushed the  operational strategy "proceeding from the railway, facing the  whole country, advancing toward the world," and has scored  eye-catching results. Last year, under the conditions of short  supply in raw materials and grave shortage of funds, 220  electric locomotives, 670 internal-combustion locomotives, and  1,847 passenger cars were turned out, up from the previous year  by 10, 19, and 11.8 percent, respectively; 28,968 new freight  cars were built, an increase of 7,332 from the previous year, up  by 33.9 percent; thus making great contributions to meeting the  demand of railway transportation resulting from national  economic growth. Last year, the whole company achieved an  income of 13.7 billion yuan through marketing, up by 66.7  percent; all- personnel labor productivity increased by 27.2  percent; profit realized was 240 million yuan, up by 114.9  percent; the enterprise retained a profit of 160 million yuan,  up by 36.3 percent, and the enterprise's development capability  was augmented markedly.    While meeting the needs of domestic railway transportation,  the China Railway Rolling Sock Industrial General Company took  an active part in developing the overseas market. Last year,  both locomotives and passenger and freight cars, as well as  parts, were exported to eight countries and regions, including  Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong, with a transaction volume of  $70.72 million, up by 70 percent from 1992.</p>

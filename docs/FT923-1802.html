			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Ex-soldier uses political instinct - Profile of Michael Mates WHEN Mr Michael Mates was appointed to hold the security portfolio at the Northern Ireland Office in April, hopes and apprehensions were stirred in equal measure on the two sides of the religious divide in Ulster. A former lieutenant-colonel in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, Mr Mates is no newcomer to the province, having served there with his battalion in the early 1970s when the 'troubles' were at their peak. His 20-year military career saw him serve in Germany and Cyprus as well as Ulster and finally brought him on to the team of the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff at the Ministry of Defence, before he entered politics as a Conservative MP in 1974. For the Ulster Unionists, Mr Mates' appointment to oversee security in the province was a signal that their appeals for a tougher stand against the IRA had been heard. An ex-soldier/politician would be more amenable, so they thought, to their insistence that selective internment and covert operations must become the new weapons with which to break the back of the IRA. The SDLP and the nationalist community were meanwhile apprehensive that such a 'get-tough' policy would sweep away much of what had been achieved in recent years through painstaking work in trying to reduce tensions in the Catholic community and simply fuel a new recruitment drive for the IRA. On appearances alone, Mr Mates' burly frame and defiant paratrooper's jaw would suggest that the Unionists might have cause to celebrate. His political instinct, however, has been honed by almost two decades in parliament. Since winning Petersfield for the Tories in 1974, Mr Mates has become a familiar sight in Westminster corridors and committee rooms. He has been secretary of the Conservative parliamentary Northern Ireland Committee from 1974-79, its vice-chairman from 1979-81 and is currently the chairman of the all-party Anglo-Irish parliamentary group. He has also been secretary of the influential 1922 backbench committee in the Conservative party, and chairman of the Conservative Home Affairs Committee. He has sat on the Commons Select Committee on Defence since its formation in 1979 and been its chairman since 1987. In the latter role, he has been critical of the government's plans to cut the British Army strength from 156,000 to 116,000 by the mid-1990s and from his new vantage point in Ulster, he can be expected to argue even more forcibly against the cuts. An ally of Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Mates was passed over numerous times for ministerial appointment during the Thatcher years. So after nearly two decades on the backbenches, he now has the first opportunity to prove his ministerial mettle. 'This is the biggest challenge of my career,' he said. 'I am here to do things and I feel I can get on and do them. There is an urgency and vibrancy here where events often require immediate action and decisions.' There will be no headlong rush for a military solution to the province's problems, however. 'There is no question of a military victory against the IRA. The only way to defeat them is by a combination of economic, social and political development and in the meantime we have to redouble our efforts to contain the violence,' he said. Significantly, Mr Mates also holds the finance portfolio at the Northern Ireland Office, making him responsible for the allocation of its entire Pounds 7bn budget. Does not that put him in the role of both gamekeeper and poacher? 'We have to ensure that health, education and housing and the like have their share but we can't compromise on security.' Some business leaders and politicians believe the government is indeed compromising on security - a view reinforced in some minds by Mr Mates' recent statement that it is 'impossible' to stop the bomb attacks in Belfast city centre. He is unrepentant. 'The IRA wants to make life intolerable. I want to make it tolerable. We could easily put a cordon around Belfast, but in doing that the IRA would have achieved its objective.' Mr Mates thus sees his job as one of ensuring the security forces are adequately resourced to contain and weaken the paramilitaries while the province's politicians thrash out a solution. As chairman of the Commons Select Committee on Defence, he is acutely aware of the budget restraints facing the armed forces and the restraints that this places upon Northern Ireland's security policy. 'I do not want to see British soldiers in the streets and countryside of Northern Ireland any longer than they need to be. The day I can send a battalion home I shall be very happy, and when I can send two battalions home I shall be even happier.'</p>

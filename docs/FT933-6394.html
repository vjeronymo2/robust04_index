			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Arnotts lifts payout in spite of second-half loss ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, has raised its annual dividend despite dipping into the red in the second half following heavy asset write downs. Reporting yesterday for the first time as part of the of Campbells Soup, the US food company, Arnotts announced an 18 per cent net profit rise to ADollars 47.2m (USDollars 31.8m) for the year ended June on a 4 per cent sales slide to ADollars 662.1m. The company made a loss of ADollars 6.6m in the second half of the year compared with a profit of ADollars 17.2m last time. However, the annual dividend is going up from 23.5 cents a share to 29 cents. The year's result included abnormal losses of ADollars 32.9m (ADollars 18.7m loss previously), mainly reflecting a ADollars 47.9m assets write-down. Mr Paul Bourke, managing director, said the company had now completed most of its programme to divest non-core activities and focus on biscuit making. 'We are now in great shape to concentrate on our three key strategies for the remainder of the 1990s,' he said.</p>

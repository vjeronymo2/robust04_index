			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television Virtual Reality could be the next clacker ball craze (though considerably more expensive), the next electric car, or the successor to television. There is a tremendous amount of talk about this 'three dimensional experience' developed by chaps in the computer and computer games businesses, but very little on offer to the public. Horizon (8.10 BBC2) investigates, promising that 'Sir Michael Hordern is tour guide to the electronic frontier of cyberspace'. Hmm. Channel 4 aims to show what private investigators are really like in Watching The Detectives (9.00), a five-part series using verite techniques to record the activities of three American gumshoes and two British. Today's subject is a former jockey who repossesses cars, follows a woman whose husband is suspicious, and tracks down cut-price kitchen units. With its eye on the local elections on May 2, Panorama (9.40 BBC1) has a studio debate about the future of local government. To mark the 70th birthday of Satyajit Ray, Channel 4 has mounted a season of his films, prefaced tonight (11.00) by a documentary in which Shyam Benegal interviews Ray and shows extracts from many of his works.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Europe's uneven playing field THE HABIT, common among Europe's governments, of giving handouts to industry has never been good. Such handouts usually waste taxpayers' money and breed a dependency culture among the recipients. But the potential damage of state aid to industry is compounded by the start of the single market earlier this month. The removal of trade barriers means that inefficient companies subsidised by one member state could drive more efficient enterprises elsewhere out of business - exactly the reverse of what the single market is intended to achieve. The need for an assault on subsidies has never been greater. But the omens for effective action by the European Commission, which is responsible for policing state aid, are not good. First, Mr Karel van Miert, the new competition commissioner, has indicated that he may take a softer line on aid. Second, the deepening recession is leading to clamours for assistance throughout the Community. Finally, the Commission's overall ability to take controversial decisions has been undermined by the widespread feeling that Brussels is interfering in national affairs. Meanwhile, the balance of opinion among member states is fluid. The UK, which has traditionally taken a robust line against aid, is wavering. Having lobbied the Commission to approve subsidies for its coal industry, it will not be in a position to lecture others for giving excessive handouts. On the other hand, the Italian government, which has been generous with aid, seems to be changing tack and the same could happen in France after March's election. Subsidy wars In theory, there should be no problem. Rules banning most types of government assistance to industry are set out in the Treaty of Rome. There is little wrong with the rules and the debate on 'subsidiarity' does not, in this area, provide any excuse for giving the power to enforce them to national governments. The only chance of preventing subsidy wars is action at Community and, ideally in the long run, global levels. But there is still an enforcement problem, because of heavy lobbying by vested interests. The large and often state-owned companies which receive the bulk of aid are effective at extracting assistance from their national governments, which then lobby the Commission for approval. Meanwhile, the general public - who pay for the subsidies in the form of taxes, price rises or unemployment in other parts of the economy - do not know what is going on, because decisions are taken behind closed doors. The result is that even a determined competition commissioner such as Sir Leon Brittan had only limited success in cutting the overall level of subsidies which averaged Ecu89bn a year between 1988 and 1990. Transparent process The solution is to make the whole process of policing state aid more transparent. Much of the aid currently approved would probably not survive the full glare of public accountability. Australia's Industry Commission, an independent body which scrutinises all forms of assistance to industry, is an example of what can be achieved through openness. Before reaching a view, it holds public hearings and publishes consultative documents. It also regularly reviews aid cases after they are approved to assess costs and see whether assistance has had its intended effect. The result of this rigorous and open process has been to cut Australian industry's dependence on state aid by about two-thirds in the last 20 years. It is doubtful whether there would be political support for establishing a similar institution in the European Community. Even if there were, it could be difficult to ensure its independence from political interference by national governments. But the Commission should certainly take steps in this direction by opening up its decisions on state aid to public scrutiny - which would also help reduce the Community's democratic deficit - and reviewing aid cases after they have been approved. Without action on these lines, Mr Van Miert will have great difficulty creating a level playing field. And, without that, the single market could fall into disrepute.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BM to reduce debt via Pounds 17m disposal The prospect of a rights issue this year to complete the revival of BM Group, the engineering company in refinancing talks with its bankers, receded yesterday as the group announced the surprise sale of its dumper truck manufacturing business. BM had been widely expected to announce a Pounds 20m rights issue as part of the refinancing. The sale of Benford to Powerscreen, which makes screening and stone-crushing equipment, for a net Pounds 17m in cash and shares now makes a rights issue to reduce debt unnecessary. However, BM could still call on shareholders next year for funds to expand its ongoing businesses. Mr Cliff Walker, chief executive, said the group would 'not shy away' from a cash call if the appropriate opportunity arose. 'I can see a situation, once the right acquisition is in our sights, where we may need to return to shareholders.' BM almost collapsed last year from the effects of the Pounds 60m acquisition in 1990 of Blackwood Hodge, the construction equipment distributor, which, it has been estimated, has cost BM up to Pounds 100m. It is considering possible litigation against Hambros, the merchant bank which recommended the purchase. Under new management, virtually all of the Blackwood Hodge businesses have been sold or closed down. As part of the restructuring programme in 1993 - which guaranteed bankers' support for short-term finance to the end of this December - the group pledged to withdraw from distribution and reduce the Pounds 120m debt. The disposal announced yesterday, combined with the sale of a US distributor in July, will cut some Pounds 28m from the Pounds 65m debt to be announced at the annual results in October. Net assets are estimated to be about Pounds 70m, including a Pounds 31m pension fund surplus. BM will receive Pounds 12.8m in cash and 1.4m Powerscreen shares with a guaranteed disposal value of at least Pounds 4.2m. The cash will be used to eliminate the Pounds 12.9m intercompany loan from BM to Benford. BM is expected to take a Pounds 1.1m write-down on the disposal. Mr Walker said BM expected more than Pounds 4.2m from the sale of the shares over a six to nine-month period. BM has written to shareholders reassuring them of its commitment to its other core industrial machinery manufacturing businesses. Mr Walker also said the refinancing talks were progressing well and an announcement was hoped for soon. BM is expected to sell at least one of the last three small Blackwood Hodge businesses shortly.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / PowerGen boosts dividend by 27% PowerGen, the electricity generation company, yesterday provided a fillip for shareholders, including the government, by announcing an interim dividend rise higher than expected, at 26.6 per cent. Shares in the company rose 8p to 559p. National Power which announced its half-year results on Thursday, also rose, by 7.5p to 502p. PowerGen said it had benefited during the half year from a 3 per cent increase in national electricity demand and 'above average' performance of its two new gas-fired power stations. Market share was higher than expected, at 24.5 per cent, although for the first time in any half Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company, produced more electricity than PowerGen. PowerGen also announced an agreement had been finalised to make it the lead project developer for a 900MW gas-fired power plant in Portugal. It also ruled out more buy-backs before the government's sale in February of its 40 per cent stakes in PowerGen and National Power. 'The market conditions are not right,' said Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive. This is likely to be welcomed by some potential investors who would have viewed with anxiety the effect of buy-backs on the share price in the run-up to the 40 per cent share sales. The dividend rise to 5p (3.95p) for the six months to October 2 comes at an awkward time politically as the Labour Party has gone on the offensive over some payments to shareholders by privatised companies. PowerGen's 9.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 118m (Pounds 108m) would have attracted little attention but the dividend rise will fuel criticism of the industry. PowerGen said that the dividend rise was partly due to its previously stated policy of decreasing dividend cover to between 2.5 and 2.7 times and partly due to introducing a more 'appropriate balance' between dividends in the two halves of the year. Mr John Rennocks, finance director, said: 'There is no intention to increase the full-year payout by the same amount.' Mr Rennocks said market share next year would be 'markedly below' 25 per cent.

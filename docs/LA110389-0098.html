			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPAQ EXPECTS PROFIT TO DROP; STOCK SLIDES;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS: THE FIRM'S PREDICTION FOR THE 4TH QUARTER IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES  OF ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT UPSET WALL STREET.  </P> <P> Compaq Computer Corp., which has enjoyed years of stellar growth, became the  latest victim of the computer industry's woes Thursday when it announced that  fourth-quarter earnings will be less than a year ago due to a slowdown in U.S.  sales.  </P> <P> The news represents the first time in five years that the personal computer  maker's quarterly profits have failed to exceed those of the prior year's  period. Last year the Houston-based company posted profits of $91.9 million on  sales of $667.6 million in the final three months, and analysts had generally  been estimating that this year's fourth-quarter earnings would top $105  million.  </P> <P> However, in the wake of Thursday's announcements, analysts lowered their  projections to between $62 million and $80 million for the final quarter.  </P> <P> Compaq's disclosures sent its stock tumbling more than 15%, dropping $16.875 to  close at $89.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively  traded issue. Other technology stocks, including International Business  Machines, Apple Computer, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, also fell, as fears  that the forces behind Compaq's problems would affect a wider range of  high-tech companies.  </P> <P> The announcement was the second in two weeks from Compaq to stun Wall Street  and send its stock skidding. Last week the company posted disappointing  third-quarter profits and revealed that a flaw in the microprocessor for its  top-of-the-line personal computer would probably delay shipments. In the last  two weeks, Compaq's stock has dropped $19.50.  </P> <P> "It's been an amazing fall from grace," said Peter Rogers, a technology analyst  at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage. "As far as Wall  Street is concerned, the bloom is off the rose."  </P> <P> Although the industrywide sales slowdown has affected a wide range of computer  makers throughout most of the last year, Compaq had seemed immune from the  problems to many analysts. The tightly managed and sharply focused company has  traditionally made the hottest-selling products in today's market: high-powered  desktop models and portables.  </P> <P> However, in its announcement Thursday, the company said sales last month were  10% below its expectations, with no sign of immediate improvement for the  remainder of the year. Still, the company said it expects the problems to be  resolved by 1990.  </P> <P> "This is a fourth-quarter issue and when that's over, these problems should be  gone," said Michael Swavely, president of Compaq North America.  </P> <P> Swavely listed three primary causes of the company's current problems: slower  growth of personal computer sales in the United States; the current transition  in Compaq's product line, and uncertainity about the availability of Intel's  486 microprocessor needed for Compaq's new top-of-the-line PC scheduled for  unveiling Monday. Intel acknowledged last week that two design flaws will delay  volume production of the chip until late this month.  </P> <P> In addition, Swavely acknowledged that aggressive price cutting by IBM on  certain PC models has cut into the company's sales.  </P> <P> According to Scoreboard, a Dallas market research firm, IBM has moved ahead of  Compaq in sales of high-powered desktop machines containing the Intel 386  microprocessor. IBM's share of this market, which Compaq has dominated for the  last year, climbed to 38% in the third quarter, compared to 35% for Compaq.  </P> <P> The aggressive competition among PC makers has been sparked in large part by  the falling rate of sales growth in the United States. According to Scoreboard,  sales growth in the first three months of 1989 was 26% above that of the prior  year's quarter. In the second quarter, the rate was 11% higher, but in the  third quarter it was just 5%.  </P> <P> "In the long term, nothing has changed for Compaq," said Richard Shaffer,  editor of an industry newsletter. "The technology still favors the type of  machine that Compaq produces. But this news just shows that the slowdown has  finally caught up with Compaq, and that even the strongest companies in the  industry aren't immune."  </P></p>

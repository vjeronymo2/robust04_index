			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Companies neglecting tax rebates Millions of pounds in value added tax rebates are unclaimed across the EU, according to a survey by accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Nearly 60 per cent of companies do not reclaim all the VAT they are entitled to receive from countries in which they are not registered, and more than 20 per cent do not claim any of their rebates. The survey, which questioned more than 600 companies, notes that almost a quarter of businesses pay VAT in countries where they are not registered, on transactions such as one-off purchases, hotel bills and travel. About 8 per cent are paying more VAT than they were before 1993. Most say the primary reason is that recoveries would cost too much. A number of companies highlighted administrative difficulties in receiving rebates in Italy, Germany and France. 'The system clearly needs to be simplified,' Deloitte said. Across the EU, British companies are the most likely to fail to make refunds. The survey showed that just 23 per cent of companies said they had found their transport costs becoming cheaper as a result of the new system, although 39 per cent said goods reached their destinations more quickly.</p>

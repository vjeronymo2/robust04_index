			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Exchange considers code compliance considering publicising companies which fail adequately to explain reasons for divergence from the Cadbury code on corporate governance. It has all but ruled out the ultimate sanction of de-listing any companies that do not provide a statement of compliance with the code, which was published in December. But it may circulate lists of companies which have not complied and highlight individual accounts which do not include a statement.</p>

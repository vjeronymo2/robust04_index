			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOLE SAYS HE WOULD SUPPORT GAS TAX HIKE  </P> <P> Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said Sunday that he would support a rise in  gasoline taxes to rebuild America's roads and bridges, including those damaged  by the Bay Area earthquake.  </P> <P> The Kansas lawmaker said that the American people "would understand, not only  in earthquake areas, but all across America," the need for such a tax.  </P> <P> But he said that he would oppose using the increased revenues as a way to cut  the budget deficit.  </P> <P> Dole's suggestion, during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," could open  the way for new bipartisan efforts to raise government revenues despite  President Bush's rejection of a tax increase.  </P> <P> Dole and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) agreed that  everything should be "on the table" in negotiations on fiscal 1991 federal  spending -- including taxes and curbs on entitlements, such as Social Security.  </P> <P> While he opposed raising income tax rates, Dole said, "there are a lot of  loopholes just begging to be closed out there. . . . That's billions of  dollars."  </P> <P> In the past, Dole has favored an oil-import fee and certain taxes earmarked for  specific needs, but Sunday marked the first time he had mentioned an increase  in the gasoline tax publicly, spokesman Paul E. Jacobson said later.  </P> <P> The senator said that he did not know how Bush would react, but added: "That's  not a major tax increase."  </P> <P> David P. Prosperi, a Department of Transportation spokesman, said Secretary  Samuel K. Skinner had backed the President's opposition to any new federal  taxes, including an increase in the gasoline tax.  </P></p>

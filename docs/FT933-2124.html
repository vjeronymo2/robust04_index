			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Ministers admit ban on exports to Iraq THE GOVERNMENT yester-day confirmed that it was revoking all export licences for Iraq after the discovery of fraudulent United Nations and Department of Trade and Industry documents. The DTI said yesterday: 'It has come to our attention that there may have been falsification of certain UK licences to Iraq.' It added: 'We have therefore decided it would be prudent to revoke existing licences and issue new licences.' The fraud involves the doctoring of documents to give false statements of export volumes on goods classified as humanitarian aid. Under the sanctions regime which was imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990 humanitarian aid includes medicines and baby food. The move is believed to concern borderline cases where the aid could have a defence-related application, such as vehicle spare parts and concrete. These particular cases are subject to UN scrutiny and require a UN letter of authorisation. It is understood that British officials have been debating how to prevent the fraud from spreading. One problem facing Whitehall is that some of the fraud appears to have involved go-betweens in Jordan, which is being viewed by the government as a potential ally in the Middle East. British officials also had to consider the consequences of being seen not to take action once the fraud had come to light. It is understood that the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry was an influence on some officials, forcing an early decision to stamp out the fraud. The present head of the Foreign Office's UN department is Mr William Patey. During the 1980s Mr Patey was chairman of the Whitehall inter-departmental committee which vetted export licences to Iraq.</p>

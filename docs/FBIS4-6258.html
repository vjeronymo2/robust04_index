			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Former  Governor-General of Canada Edward Schreyer on a visit to Korea  told a press conference here on April 15 that the reports of the  West about Korea were distorted and the impressions he got from  his current visit were so deep that they were beyond wordy  description.    "What I have seen in your country is quite different from  what I have heard through the Western media," he said, and  continued:    "While staying in your country, I have been deeply impressed  by the fact that the Korean people live with smiles and enjoy  happiness to the full unlike what I have heard in the West.    "Your people live with their own aim and have successfully  built their country with industrious and creative activities.    "The grand and beautiful architectures built by your people  made me think a great deal.    "The wonderful architectures are rich in content and  peculiar  in architectural beauty, to say nothing of the external style.    "We do not want the outbreak of a war in your country but  hope that the Korean people will live in peace"</p>

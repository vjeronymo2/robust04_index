The latest round came last Friday [7  January] when he launched a public relations campaign entitled  "The Likud's Information Airline," consisting of flights from  Tel Aviv's Sede Dov Airfield to Jericho and back to illustrate  the security dangers looming over Israel as a result of the  implementation of the agreement with the PLO. "Netanyahu failed  to get the masses out on the streets, and he is now trying his  luck in the skies," said a senior Likud member commenting on the  campaign. "A folly," said Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon. The  latter does not take part in the airborne campaign and will  continue his independent public relations campaign on the  ground. As he usually does, he will stop at the same old spot  near the settlement of Bet Arye overlooking Ben-Gurion Airport  and lecture his audience about the dangers posed by a  Palestinian state.    Sharon brought the internal ferment against Netanyahu's  leadership to a peak last week when he announced his plans to  run for the premiership. Two days earlier he described  Netanyahu as "a man who got caught with his pants down, in more  ways than one, but put the blame on others." Not to be outdone,  Netanyahu retorted by accusing Sharon of "relentless subversion  which began under Menahem Begin and continued under Yitzhaq  Shamir, and now it is my turn." Over the weekend he even went as  far as warning that "the Likud might once again enter a  collision course."    His associates say that Netanyahu will henceforth change his  ways and fight back. "I will not agree to be the punching bag  of frustrated Likud members, as Yitzhaq Shamir was," he told his  associates last week as he launched his counteroffensive. His  men accused Sharon of encouraging a group of U.S. businessmen to  accuse Netanyahu of diverting money collected for the Council of  Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to the Likud's  coffers. Sharon categorically denied it, but Netanyahu's men  persisted. They leaked to the press that the Likud was forced  to pay 40,000 shekels for a private information campaign Sharon  conducted on the eve of the last Knesset election. This claim,  too, was emphatically denied by Sharon. A journalist who  nevertheless published it without seeking Sharon's comment was  reprimanded after Sharon complained.    Netanyahu will hold his fire against the other "subversives"  -- David Levi, David Magen, and Dan Meridor -- as long as they  do not come out against him in public. Still, Netanyahu's men  have already warned them "not to stoke the fire." Rumors at  Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv have it that "Netanyahu's  followers have compiled a dossier about each rival." Perhaps  this is the reason why Magen refuses to be interviewed for  Friday night's weekly newsreel on Channel 1. He asked the  television people "to wait until February," by which time he  will have finished gathering the data about the number of  drop-outs from Likud ranks and exposing them to the public as  part of his campaign to bring about new primaries. It is  estimated that some 100,000 of the Likud's 250,000 registered  members will have dropped out by then.    David Levi has adopted different tactics from that of Sharon  and Magen, but not because he fears Netanyahu's reaction. His  associates claim that his thundering silence is a calculated and  well-planned move. Levi has learned from experience and is no  longer willing to be the main opposition activist, with all  others hiding behind him. His associates say that this time  around Levi is waiting for others to do the job for him.  However, most of those senior Likud members who question  Netanyahu's leadership and sharply criticize him still prefer to  do so off-the-record and in private meetings.    In the wake of the HA'ARETZ report about the secret  contacts Magen has been holding in a bid to bring about new  primaries in the Likud, in which Dan Meridor would run,  Netanyahu's associates began collecting signatures against such  a move. As was expected, Levi and Sharon did not sign it.  Meridor and Beni Begin did, and went on to side publicly with  Netanyahu in order to dispel reports that he had lent a hand to  Magen's secret contacts. Some of the signatories sharply  criticized Netanyahu in off-the-record talks, nevertheless,  arguing that new primaries before the next Knesset elections are  inevitable if the Likud really wants to return to power.    However, holding new primaries is not that simple. A clause  Netanyahu introduced in the Likud's constitution actually  guarantees his election as chairman of the Likud -- who also is  its candidate for the premiership -- until the year 2000. A  decision to hold new primaries before an elected chairman ends  his term requires a 75-percent majority in the 3,600-member  Likud Central Committee and such a majority would seem  unattainable at the moment.    According to a poll conducted by Channel 2 over the weekend,  Netanyahu still commands the support of 49 percent of the Likud  (he got 52 percent in the primaries), compared with Sharon's 15  percent, Levi's 7 percent (as opposed to 27 percent in the  primaries), and Meridor's 7 percent. Levi's men claim that the  poll does not reflect reality and that support for Levi is  larger. However, they too understand that he does not yet have  the required majority to bring about new primaries, even if his  followers were joined by those of Sharon and Meridor.  Nevertheless, "when the time comes," Levi's followers (and not  just them) plan to submit a motion to the Central Committee to  hold primaries. Their idea is to attain over 50 percent of the  vote, and depict it as a show of no confidence in Netanyahu. As  they see it, such a move would pressure him to agree to  primaries.    At the same time, Sharon's and Levi's followers are  examining  alternative scenarios and are not ruling out the possibility of  a split. A group of Levi's followers, which includes his  brother Maxim, believes that if the peace process succeeds the  entire political map will change, and then it will be possible  to set up a new political movement led by David Levi which will  focus on socioeconomic issues. Maxim recently asked his brother  to tone down his pronouncements against the peace process so as  not to impair the chances of such an independent movement to  attain the support of the political mainstream. However, it  would seem from David Levi's latest statements that he has not  been heeding this advice.    Ari'el Sharon has been saying that he will not bring about  the disbandment of the Likud, and stressing that if and when he  decides to run for the premiership he will want to do it only in  the framework of the Likud. At the same time, he said he had no  idea how to go about it in view of the obstacle posed by the  Likud constitution. His followers argue that if he fails to  bring about new primaries in the Likud he may collect 50,000  signatures to present his candidacy for the premiership in  accordance with the new law. Likud members claim that through  such a move Sharon would be driving himself out of the Likud.  Despite Sharon's and Refa'el Eytan's denials, rumors persist in  the political establishment about an ongoing dialogue between  the two concerning the establishment of a new right-wing  political movement. It has even been speculated that in such an  event Eytan would be willing to give up running for the  premiership and become Sharon's second-in-command. However,  some in the Likud believe that Sharon's move was merely designed  to neutralize Netanyahu through the creation of a collective  leadership which would include all those who served as ministers  in the Likud government, including David Levi.    Everybody agrees that developments in the Likud depend on  the  date of the next elections to the Knesset and the premiership.  If Yosi Sarid's predictions come true and elections are brought  forward either to the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995 in  anticipation of the signing of peace agreements, Netanyahu's  rivals stand a very slim chance of challenging the Likud's  leadership. It is believed that in such an event a formula will  be found to reinstate Levi in the Likud's leadership as  Netanyahu's second-in-command, perhaps on the basis of a  proposal consolidated by Tzahi Hanegbi and Re'uven Rivlin. If  the elections are held on schedule in 1996, some people in the  Likud assess that the infighting at the top will lead to a new  contest for the leadership of the party.</p>

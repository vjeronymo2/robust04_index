			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Observer: April folly Oh to be in England now that April's here . . . and with it the annual chore of completing tax returns. But it's more than a chore for those who set the tax exams; knives are being sharpened as the two main professional institutes battle for supremacy. The 7,000-strong (and growing) tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is already considering the content of its own tax exam to be introduced as early as 1995. But the Institute of Taxation - whose exam is taken by more than 8,000 practitioners including accountants and lawyers - is peeved. Both bodies have issued bitter public statements and yesterday the Institute of Taxation let it be known that it would not co-operate on the development of a joint exam with the faculty. 'It is essential that we retain our independence and control of our own examination that we have developed to such a high standard,' a terse press release warned. But if the tax faculty goes its own way, and continues to increase its membership, it could still undermine its rival. Expect more taxing times ahead.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHS CELEBRATE 1945 -- AND FREEDOM TO CELEBRATE  </P> <P> Thousands of Czechoslovaks joined U.S. veterans Saturday for a sun-kissed  streetfest in the first celebration ever of the liberation of this beer-brewing  city by American troops in World War II.  </P> <P> Pubs were turned into imitations of Wild West saloons and youths with U.S. Army  paraphernalia rode the streets on vintage Harley-Davidson motorcycles inherited  from their parents.  </P> <P> Up to 150,000 visitors are expected to descend on Pilsen, a city of 130,000,  today, including President Vaclav Havel and U.S. Ambassador Shirley Temple  Black.  </P> <P> Gen. George C. Patton's 3rd Army liberated Pilsen on May 6, 1945, just three  days before World War II ended in Prague.  </P> <P> By agreement with the Soviets, American troops came to a halt at a demarcation  line cutting southwest through Czechoslovak territory, leaving the Red Army to  conquer the capital.  </P> <P> The Communists barred any commemoration of the U.S. liberation of about 3,600  square miles of Czechoslovak territory and marked May 5 as a day of liberation  by Soviet troops.  </P> <P> Six months after Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution in December, however, the  atmosphere in this grim industrial city had changed remarkably.  </P> <P> American flags adorned the former bastions of Communist officials, and scores  of U.S. veterans were in town for the celebration. Tens of thousands of people  turned out Saturday morning to see the ceremonial inauguration of a monument to  the 2nd Infantry Division on Pilsen's downtown Republic Square.  </P> <P> Those who lived long enough to see the return of Patton's men still remember  the postwar atmosphere.  </P> <P> "It felt so right that our town was freed from the Nazis by a Western army,"  Frantisek Kotva, a pensioner, mused over a mug of the city's famous beer. "We  all loved the GIs, but then we had to forget about them for a long time," he  said.  </P></p>

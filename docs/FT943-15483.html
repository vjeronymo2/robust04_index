			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Global investment flows bypass poorer developing nations Finance ministers in the poorer developing countries, who have recently been lamenting the diversion of foreign investment from their regions to more developed countries, have had their fears confirmed by a study on global investment flows. Although foreign direct investment destined for developing countries continued to rise rapidly between 1985 and 1992 at an annual rate of 23 per cent, the smaller and least developed received very little. The study, by the International Finance Corporation, found that the increase reached 37 per cent in 1991 and 33 per cent in 1992. From a level of Dollars 8.4bn in 1985, net foreign direct investment in developing counties had expanded to Dollars 36.3bn in 1992. East Asia and Latin America were the main recipients of foreign direct investment, taking about 80 per cent. 'While investment to Latin America and East Asia continues to dominate flows, as has been true throughout the 1980s. . . sub-Saharan investment has been declining in relative terms, a characteristic shared by Europe, the Middle East and North Africa since 1989,' the report says. 'On the other hand, there has been a rapid rise in foreign direct investment destined for east European countries following the disintegration of communism.' The poorer among the developing countries are at the bottom of the list because of a combination of infrastructural and policy deficiencies. Although foreign and domestic investors are influenced by much the same factors, foreign investors differ in that they look at market size, actual or potential, as one criterion, the report says. They also tend to be sensitive to specific policy issues such as those related to foreign exchange availability and operational freedom. Consequently, private investment tends to be more attractive in regions where strong growth has occurred and seems likely to continue, or where there are promising prospects. These regions include many of the East Asian countries, Chile, Argentina and Mexico. 'There is evidence as well that private investment is a function of relative stability in country economic policies and, to some extent, in political stability more generally,' it says. 'Moreover, recent research has confirmed that income inequality, by increasing the likelihood of instability, also tends to reduce private investment activity. Compared with any other region, private investment in sub-Saharan Africa remained low relative to average gross domestic product. The study found a correlation between the deregulation of developing country economies, particularly the privatisation of state-owned economic enterprises, and the pattern of foreign investment flows. These policy changes have also encouraged increased domestic private investment. Trends in Private Investment in Developing Countries 1994, Discussion Paper Number 20.

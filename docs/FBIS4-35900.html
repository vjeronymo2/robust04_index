			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq </F> by Alon Ben-David, at an Armored Corps gathering in Latrun on 2  June -- recorded]    [Text] [Baraq] After midnight last night, the air force  attacked a Hizballah training base from which terrorists come to  kill IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army]  soldiers in the security zone. We simply acted on the rule:  Get up before your murderer and kill him first. It was a very  successful action based on pinpointed air force activity and the  precise intelligence we have lately had on Hizballah activity in  the al- Biqa'. The outcome is several dozen terrorists killed  -- apparently 30 -- and about 60 casualties. In response to  that activity, Hizballah fired several Katyusha volleys on the  western Galilee. In some areas of the north, inhabitants are  spending the night in underground shelters and security rooms.  We will deal with any developments as necessary.    [Ben-David] Was the Katyusha shelling a violation of the  understandings in Lebanon, and will the IDF respond to it?    [Baraq] There is no doubt that Katyusha shelling inside  Israel is a grave violation of the understandings reached after  Operation Accountability. We have no interest in escalating the  situation for its own sake. The blow Hizballah received is one  of hardest it has sustained in recent years. If they continue  to act against us, we will know what to do, and we have a wide  range of measures to use.    [Qol Yisra'el correspondent Karmela Menashe] Do you think  that the attack in an area under Syrian control can lead to an  escalation in relations with Syria?    [Baraq] We attack Hizballah wherever they are. I am sure it  is not the last time we will have to take action and make use of  the IDF's long arm to strike Hizballah, even in areas under  Syrian control. That does not violate our understandings of  what we are permitted to do. In my view, the Syrians understand  that Hizballah is not immune to attack anywhere.</p>

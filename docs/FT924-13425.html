			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bank of New York rises 66% in third quarter BANK of New York, which last spring agreed to buy more than 60 branches from the US subsidiary of Barclays Bank, yesterday unveiled an impressive 66.1 per cent jump in third-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 98m. The profits rise - which translates into earnings per share of Dollars 1.07 against 72 cents a year ago - was attributed to stronger fee income, wider interest spreads, cuts in operating expenses and reduced bad debt provisions. Net income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 264m, or Dollars 3.09 per share, compared with Dollars 56m, or 45 cents, in the same period of last year. Last year's results included a Dollars 343m bad debt provision. Non-performing assets, excluding Third World loans, were Dollars 13m lower at Dollars 906m. This brought the percentage of non-performing assets against total assets down to 3.6 per cent from 5.3 per cent a year ago. Total bad debt provisions in the third quarter were Dollars 105m, compared with Dollars 252m. Net interest income rose to Dollars 325m in the third quarter, compared with Dollars 314m a year ago. Non-interest income was 10 per cent higher, year-on-year, at Dollars 297m. Bank of New York's share price was marked Dollars 1 higher to Dollars 45 1/8 , a high for the year.</p>

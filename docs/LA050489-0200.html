			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LOGGING PROTESTER CLAIMS CREDIT FOR TREE SPIKING  </P> <P> An unidentified letter writer claimed responsibility for pounding bridge spikes  into trees in the Clearwater National Forest to prevent a proposed timber sale,  endangering those who log the trees, officials said.  </P> <P> Margie Ewing, district ranger for the Clearwater Forest at Powell, 12 miles  west of Lolo Pass near the Idaho-Montana state line, said officials received a  letter last week warning them the tree spiking had occurred.  </P> <P> "We have verified that the trees were spiked," Ewing said. "We're not sure of  the extent of it yet."  </P> <P> The typewritten letter said 500 pounds of bridge spikes were hammered into  trees at the proposed Post Office timber sale near Powell on the Lochsa River.  </P> <P> The letter was signed, in type, by George Hayduke, the fictitious hero of  Edward Abbey's book "The Monkey Wrench Gang."  </P></p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 3: Export-led exit from recession - Businesses in the county sense a turning point has been passed Mr Geoffrey Nicholls, chairman of the East Midlands CBI, emerged from the latest meeting of the regional council with a smile. It was, he said, the most positive meeting for two years. Leicestershire business is caught in this upturn of regional confidence. It was reflected by Mr Alan Green, chief executive of the county's chamber of commerce, as he considered the raw data from the latest, so far unpublished, survey of local business trends. The returns show that more than 58 per cent of companies in the county are working at or above 80 per cent capacity. The chamber's export documentation, provided for the Far East, Latin American and Middle East markets, has been running 15 per cent higher in the first quarter of this year compared with last. 'The turning point came in January as the lower value of the pound manifested itself in overseas markets,' says Mr Green. As for two of the county's most significant industries, Mr Nicholls reports how busy the Leicestershire knitwear industry has been, while Mr Green's surveys suggest shoe companies had been enjoying fresh demand in the export markets. Advance Tapes, the Leicester adhesive tapes company whose spread of customers across industry makes it a useful barometer, has scented an upturn for a year. 'The majority of increased orders, until the last three months, have been in overseas markets. Since mid-January we've started to show an upturn in the rate of UK orders,' says Mr David Ayres, the chairman. In the machine tool sector, a monitor of investment intentions, Mr John Wareing, managing director of Jones &amp; Shipman, notes that there has been more quotations activity in recent weeks, and that prices among the company's sub-contractors have started to harden. 'There are signs of an upturn in UK demand, and in the US, but, with the exception of France, the rest of Europe is not encouraging,' he warns. The caveat about the European downturn notwithstanding, there is a clear impression in Leicestershire that the force of recession is on the wane. Given that manufacturing accounts for 33.3 per cent of Leicestershire employment, compared with 27.4 per cent for the East Midlands and 22.5 per cent for the UK as a whole, the reasons for relief are obvious. But the recession has done little to change the structural imbalances in the county's industrial base. The strengths and weaknesses remain intact. In spite of the recession's litany of job cuts, employment remains skewed towards the textiles, clothing and footwear sector. At the last employment census the proportion of such jobs in Leicester was higher than in other traditional textile districts such as Nottingham, Manchester, Bolton and Bury. Yet, in terms of gross output, the contribution to the county economy of the textiles, clothing and footwear sector is less than that of either the combined engineering industries, long a pillar of the industrial base, or the food and drink industry, where, although employment has fallen, there have been marked increases in output and productivity. The weakness for the future is the relatively slow growth of high technology industry. 'New technology industries are under-represented in the county, although the number of jobs in these industries is growing,' according to the county council. In Leicestershire such industries accounted for 9.5 per cent of manufacturing jobs against a national average of 13 per cent. The obvious growth has been in the distribution sector - a recognition of the fact that 88 per cent of the UK population is within four hours drive by heavy goods vehicle - in tourism, and in the services sector. By no stretch of the imagination, however, can Leicestershire be seen as a focal point for financial services. The abiding characteristic of Leicestershire's corporate structure is the high number of small and medium-sized companies. To be sure, the county is the headquarters for British Gypsum, British Midland Airways, British Shoe Corporation, Fisons Pharmaceuticals and United Biscuits. And the county industries include well-known names such as Bridgport, Brush, Caterpillar, R. Griggs (maker of Doc Martens), Evans Lifts, Triumph Motorcycles and Walkers Crisps. But few companies employ more than a few hundred and 75 per cent of companies employ fewer than 25. Arguably, the recession has caused further fragmentation of the corporate structure. 'Much is to do with redundancies of departmental managers in larger companies. The only choice for them is to go into business on their own account,' says Mr Green. Take spare parts for knitting machines: a machinery maker goes into liquidation, but because knitting machines can have an almost limitless life, there is a demand for spare parts, which can be filled by a small company spun out out of the liquidating company. This predominance of companies is, in one sense, a source of strength. 'When recovery comes, it will not be the larger companies which recruit, but the smaller companies,' comments Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of Pal International, the Oadby hygiene and protective clothing manufacturer, and chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council. But a weakness is that one of the strongest fountains of small company growth has been in the textiles, clothing and footwear sector, which remains under pressure from imports and in long term decline. And small companies are likely to remain dependent on the UK market and vulnerable to its erratic cycles. It is precisely the need to succour the small company sector which has led Leicestershire enthusiastically to espouse the cause of the One Stop shop. Although there are a plethora of national and local initiatives in place to help small companies with exporting, technology transfer, business planning and the rest, the need to draw together the facilities for small companies has been obvious and pressing. Application has been made to the department of trade and industry for its support in establishing one of its chain of One Stop shops in the county. But, even if that fails, the county council, Leicester City Council, Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Council and the Chamber of Commerce will go ahead on their own.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Study criticises Bank approach to repos The Bank of England's approach to a domestic securities repurchase market is misconceived, argues a study on the role of derivatives in Europe's securities markets, commissioned by the International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the Zurich-based trade association. The Bank's 'policy of restricting access to repos in order to subsidise the gilt market-makers' restricts the ability of other derivatives operators to hedge positions. 'Their ability to hedge in the cash market is greatly reduced and they are forced to operate in the gilt futures markets when, on occasion, it might be more appropriate to use an underlying gilt-edged bond as a hedging instrument.' In a repo operation, holders of securities sell them for an agreed period of time, at the end of which they buy them back at an agreed price. The report emphasises that cash securities markets, derivatives on securities and securities lending markets form an 'indissoluble triangle'. Where minimum reserve requirements prohibit a repo market, as in Germany, the volume of derivatives business means the repo market must exist elsewhere, the report states. Bundesbank restrictions have driven the repo market for bunds, which has seen 'explosive' growth largely attributable to derivatives activity, offshore to London. Authorities' neglect of securities lending may pose systemic risk to the financial system, argue the authors of the report, Professor Brian Scott-Quinn and Mr Julian Walmsley of the University of Reading. 'It could be argued that the biggest systemic risk in connection with derivatives is from irresponsible action from governments which fail to understand the complex linkages between cash, securities lending/repo and derivatives markets,' the report states. The study also identifies a regulatory problem emerging in connection with over-the-counter equity derivatives. Because the majority of OTC derivatives trades are conducted by banks rather than securities houses, stock exchange authorities in most European countries are unaware of the trades, which are reported to the banking authorities, the study states. As a result, there is a danger that trades which would normally be conducted in the cash equity market might be deliberately channelled through the OTC market to avoid being caught by the reporting requirements of the usual regulatory bodies. Restrictions on foreign shareholdings and insider dealing could thus be circumvented by means of derivatives. *'Derivatives in the Context of a Single European Securities Market' available from ISMA; Tel 41-1-363 4222</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y. TRADITION / HERO'S WELCOME;  </P> <P> PAPER TO RAIN ON PARADE -- THIS TIME FOR MANDELA  </P> <P> A paper blizzard will fall from the high-rise buildings that line lower  Broadway today when Nelson Mandela receives the greeting that New York City  reserves for its special heroes.  </P> <P> Such greetings can be traced to the welcome for the Marquis de Lafayette, the  French hero of the American Revolution, when he returned for a visit to the  former colonies in 1824. One hitch: There were no high-rise canyons or ticker  tape, so Lafayette had to settle for cheering crowds.  </P> <P> The first paper shower, said to be spontaneous and still lacking ticker tape,  was bestowed on President Theodore Roosevelt in 1910.  </P> <P> In 1919, ticker tape became a part of the tradition, pouring down on the Prince  of Wales. The idea was credited to New York's official greeter, Grover Whalen,  who wanted to stir up enthusiasm for the visitor. At the time, New York's Irish  population wasn't feeling very hospitable toward British royalty because  British troops were occupying Ireland.  </P> <P> "I simply started a word-of-mouth campaign and the (ticker-tape) idea filtered  through the thousands of offices that line the canyon," Whalen said. "The  workers also tore up phone books, waste paper, any kind of tinsel, and made the  confetti snowstorm."  </P> <P> Since then, thousands of tons of torn paper have drifted down on hundreds of  noteworthy people, celebrating the end of World War II and heroic feats on  land, sea and in the air and beyond. Recipients of the tribute ranged from the  "Lone Eagle," Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, in 1927 to war heroes to astronauts to  baseball and Olympic champions and, in 1985, to Vietnam War veterans. Among  numerous notables who have received the confetti greeting were Gens. Dwight D.  Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle in 1945, Winston Churchill in 1946, Queen  Elizabeth in 1957, astronaut John Glenn in 1962, the "Miracle Mets" World  Series champs in 1969, Pope John Paul II in 1979 and U.S. hostages freed from  Iran in 1981.  </P> <P> City sanitation officials say the most paper ever tossed onto a motorcade  floated down on Glenn -- a total of 3,474 tons.  </P> <P> That record seems virtually impossible to match because many new office  buildings have sealed windows. And ticker tape is vanishing, too. The blizzard  that greets Nelson Mandela will more likely be made of shredded computer  printouts and torn up telephone books.  </P> <P> Source: Times Wire Services  </P></p>

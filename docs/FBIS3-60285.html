			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed J.-P.D.: "Sixteen Research Projects In </F> Cooperation With the European Union"]    [Text] Many companies are already cooperating with the  authorities in the Chernobyl region. A research center -- the  CHERCIR [Chernobyl Center for International Research] -- has  opened at the site under the aegis of the IAEA [International  Atomic Energy Agency]. The European Union, which has been  working there since 1990, decided to go further and in June 1992  signed an accord with Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia.    Since 1991, Europe has invested a total of ECU14.2 million  (Fr95 million) in order to finance 16 research projects. A  laboratory is currently being set up in the exclusion zone and  an office and housing facilities are available to researchers at  Zeleny Mys, on the edge of the zone. Together with health  problems, much of the work is devoted to mapping out the  contaminated areas, modeling the transfer of radioactive  nuclides from the soil to plant life and then to animals and  man, the study of their migration in the soil and the water  systems, decontamination tests, etc. The researchers certainly  have their work cut out. At the time of the accident, the  "liquidators" had other concerns than the long- term protection  of the environment. Reactor waste, the earth removed from the  most contaminated areas, and the trees from the "red forest"  burned by radiation were all buried, high and low radioactive  waste all mixed in together. A total of 24 sites with 840 pits  or trenches containing waste have been identified in the  exclusion zone (10 km around the nuclear plant), explains Boris  Prister, first deputy to the Ukrainian minister responsible for  Chernobyl: "Studies are being carried out to determine if this  waste must be treated separately from or included in the new  entombment project."    In the meantime, readings have already shown a certain  plutonium contamination (37 becquerels per liter) of the water  circulating beneath the "red forest" burial sites. The ditches  in this area which contain the waste have, however, been lined  with clay -- unlike those at other sites. "I do not believe  that there is an immediate danger, but serious problems could  arise within 10 to 15 years," believes Jaak Sinnaeve, head of  the "Research Actions for Radiological Protection" unit at the  European Commission. "In any event," he adds, "there is an  urgent need for a thorough inventory." For the moment, the river  Pripyat, which flows into the Dnieper and which could therefore  contaminate the Kiev basin, is protected by a "geotechnical  barrier" (waterproof underground wall) some 2.1 kilometers long.  But that is no more than a temporary measure.    "In the short term, it is the strontium 90 which is causing  us the most concern, because it is soluble and thus migrates  much more easily than cesium which is insoluble," explains Boris  Prister. "After every period of heavy rainfall, we see major  increases in the strontium concentration in the river." This is  all the more worrying as the sandy soil favors the migration of  radioactive nuclides, adds Nikolay Arkhipov, an expert in  nuclear contamination who has been working at Chernobyl since  May 1986, after having spent nearly 30 years studying the  effects of the Kyshtym nuclear catastrophe in the Ural Mountains.    "We want to pursue genuine cooperative research," explains  Lucien Cecille, project coordinator for Europe. "There is an  enormous amount which our radiation protection researchers can  learn. They could come here for several months each year. One  day, we also hope to extend this network of laboratories to  include the Kyshtym site." Rather an ambitious objective,  perhaps. Although professing a commitment to cooperation, the  project leaders from the three countries do not always show  great enthusiasm for cooperating in the field. The  Ukraine-Belarus border, which is to the north of the 30 km  exclusion zone around Chernobyl, sometimes seems impenetrable  for men and information.</p>

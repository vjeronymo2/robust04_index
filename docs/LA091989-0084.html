			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: COMMITTEE OF HCC BOARD RETAINS BEAR, STEARNS  </P> <P> HCC Industries of Encino announced that a committee of its board of directors  retained Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. to help it consider a leveraged buyout offer  worth about $10.5 million made by a group of top HCC executives in August.  </P> <P> The management group, led by HCC Chief Executive Andrew Goldfarb, bid about  $8.50 per share for the stock it does not already own.  </P> <P> A number of public stockholders then filed suit in Court of Chancery in  Delaware to block the bid. The suit maintained that the bidding managers and  other HCC officials, including Chairman Jack Goldfarb, had breached their duty  to stockholders and that the price offered was "grossly inadequate."  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The taxman's error THE Inland Revenue has recently insisted that when losses have been created in a previous year and carried forward to the following year, any profits earned in that following year must be deducted from the losses. However, it was my understanding that the limit, presently Pounds 5,800, was available for use before gains should be deducted from losses. Am I right? We suggest that you write to the District Inspector at your tax office (marking both the letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the District Inspector'), asking him or her to draw section 3(5) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (formerly section 5(4) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979) to the attention of the officer who signed the recent letter to you about old years' losses. The law says: a) where the amount of chargeable gains less allowable losses accruing to an individual in any year of assessment does not exceed the exempt amount for the year, no deduction from that amount shall be made for that year in respect of allowable losses carried forward from a previous year . . . shall not be greater than the excess. You could ask the District Inspector also to check other cases handled by the officer concerned, in accordance with the Taxpayer's Charter, to make sure that nobody else had had allowable losses wrongfully restricted. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

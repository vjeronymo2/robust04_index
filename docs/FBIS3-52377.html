At the meeting, which was also attended by governors general  of Khorasan, Gilan, and Mazandaran and a number of Interior  Ministry directors general and officials, Mr. Kasymov referred  to the effective role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the  region. He said: Iran is a powerful economic and political  country in the region, whose benefits can be enjoyed by her  neighbors, including Turkmenistan.    Referring to the affection of the people of the people of  Turkmenistan for the great Iranian nation, the Turkmen interior  minister added: One priority policy of the Turkmen Government is  to establish warm and sincere relations with the government and  people of Iran. I hope that these trips and exchanges of  delegations will result in the further strengthening and  expansion of ties between the two countries.    Referring to the good relations between the Islamic Republic  of Iran and its neighbors in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Mr.  Besharati said: In the course of the expansion of commercial and  economic relations, we should be watchful of suggestions and  temptations by those opposed to the friendship between the two  countries. At this sensitive juncture when most countries in  the world are facing major economic and moral crises,  neighboring countries should strive to solve the problems of one  another.    Recounting the dangers of narcotics and arms contraband, the  interior minister called on the Turkmen authorities to deal  seriously with that phenomenon. He declared Iran's readiness to  supply the experience gained in that field.    At the meeting the governors general of the two countries  discussed issues of interest, including creating facilities in  matters relating to border transit and visas, opening  consulates, expanding railway lines, and setting up maritime  communication.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Ukraine accuses state oil officials UKRAINE's state oil monopoly, Ukrneftokhim, was dissolved yesterday amid allegations that senior officials had amassed huge personal profits by reselling oil purchased from Russia at subsidised prices. The allegations, made at a press conference yesterday by Mr Yuli Ioffe, deputy prime minister, are part of a wider anti-corruption drive launched by the new government of Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's recently-appointed prime minister. Mr Ioffe alleged that a senior Ukrneftokhim official had pocketed Dollars 4m by re-exporting oil to a middle-man in the US. Mr Ioffe also accused the energy ministry of skimming off profits through complicated barter arrangements for the sale of electricity to eastern Europe. He said the state prosecutor was investigating these cases of alleged government corruption and was likely to press charges.</p>

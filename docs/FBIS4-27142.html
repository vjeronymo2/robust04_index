			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The government is  preparing for every possible contingency following the breakdown  of negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    President Kim Yong-sam presided over a security-related  cabinet ministers' meeting Monday morning to discuss various  means of coping with the nuclear dispute.    The government decided to strengthen cooperation with the  countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States,  Japan, China and Russia -- and study possible action in case the  issue is referred to the U.N. Security Council, presidential  press secretary Choo Don-shik said.    It was also decided to convey South Korea's position agreed  at the meeting to the Governments of the United States, Japan,  China and Russia, Choo said.    Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok,  Deputy  Premier and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi  Hong-ku, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi  Pyoung- tae and other ministers and secretaries.    President Kim said, "The efforts of the government and the  international society to peacefully solve the North Korean  nuclear problem are faced with a grave challenge as Pyongyang  ignored the international society's demands and pushed for  replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon."    Kim instructed the ministers to prepare for any emergency  which might be created by North Korea in a crisis.    President Kim urged North Korea to immediately stop  discharging the fuel rods, saying that selection, storage and  measurement of fuel rods are indispensable to securing the  transparency of past nuclear activities as well as ascertaining  the non-diversion of nuclear material.    Kim instructed the ministers to maintain close cooperation  with related countries to achieve tangible results and to work  out countermeasures for every possibility, including referral of  the nuclear issue to the Security Council again.    The government, however, decided to continue trying to solve  the problem through dialogue ahead of the IAEA's regular Board  of Governors' meeting slated for June 6, since the nuclear  dispute cannot be considered a catastrophe as Pyongyang still  wants to hold a third round of high-level talks with Washington,  according to the official.    "The results of today's meeting will be conveyed to related  countries including the United States," Choo said.    The government plans to hold a unification and security  policy coordination meeting this week to draw up detailed  measures on the basis of the results of the security-related  ministers' meeting.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A little life-cover lends privilege - Investing offshore, single-premium insurance bonds / Since the bond has been turned into a life insurance vehicle, the income or gains are judged to belong to the bond rather than the individual Nimble-footed investors make some of their best gains by switching in and out of world stock markets when they are at their most volatile. In order to shelter these profits from the taxman, an increasing number are making use of offshore single-premium insurance bonds. In fact, the bonds have become so popular that the Pounds 2bn market is expected to double in size over the next two years as more life insurance companies jump on to the bandwagon. The big attraction of offshore single-premium insurance bonds is that investors can switch between the individual life company's offshore funds without crystalising any tax charge and, generally speaking, accumulate income and gains tax-free. These fiscal privileges are allowed, because the bond has been turned into a life insurance vehicle, and therefore the income or gains are judged to belong to the bond rather than the individual. In reality, the life-cover element is usually only a nominal 1 per cent of the investment premium. Clive Cowdery, managing director of the Dublin-based J. Rothschild International, describes the offshore single-premium bond as a protective wrapper around a collection of funds. He adds: 'Many investors want to reposition their portfolios and switch the geographic weightings in the light of changing circumstances. But the prospect of having to pay tax on the gains every time acts as a deterrent, and tax therefore plays a part in what should be a pure investment decision. Hence the offshore insurance bond.' There is another important tax break attached to the offshore bond. Cowdery explains: 'The Inland Revenue extends certain UK tax privileges to policies issued from offshore centres such as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Dublin and Luxembourg. Under the 5 per cent rule, investors can withdraw 5 per cent of the initial value of the bond 'income' tax free. For instance, if the capital investment was Pounds 100,000 the investor could take Pounds 5,000 a year. The 5 per cent concession can be carried forward over a number of tax years, and this is a particular advantage to those who have not yet retired.' The choice and range of offshore funds available varies between life companies, and the minimum investment is generally around Pounds 100,000. J. Rothschild International, for example, offers its own in-house range of 22 unit-linked funds, and investors are allowed up to 20 free switches a year. Other insurance companies in the offshore single-bond market, such as Clerical Medical, Eagle Star and AXA Equity &amp; Law, also offer their own in- house funds. Other offshore bond providers, such as Royal Life and Royal Skandia, tend to use third-party fund managers. The Isle of Man-based Royal Life, which has more than Pounds 600m invested in single-premium bonds, offers a choice of 60 funds from investment houses that include Jardine Fleming, Barings, Gartmore, Fidelity and GT. As far as UK residents are concerned, Royal Life actuary Gary Boal comments: 'We would never promote offshore single-premium bonds on the grounds that the tax breaks are better than those available with Tessas or personal equity plans. But they do offer a compromise, because they provide exposure to a mixture of cash, equity, bond and currency funds.' According to Boal, the fastest area of growth for the life companies selling offshore single-premium bonds is the expatriate market. 'Very often,' he says, 'these people work in a tax-free environment and have accumulated a sizeable chunk of capital. That is particularly true of the Far East. Hong Kong is probably the biggest single market for these bonds. 'The appeal is that the lump-sum investments can be transferred from any particular country in the world under the protective umbrella of the bond. This is a great comfort factor to those investors who live in politically sensitive regions.' However, many of the bonds sold in the expatriate market are not, as is common, based on the pooled investment fund principle, but rather used as a shelter for an investor's own personal portfolio of shares. Although most life companies allow free switching between in-house pooled funds for lump-sum investments of Pounds 10,000 or more, there are inevitably charges involved. But, says Boal: 'Royal Life, in common with most of our competitors, has spread the up-front charges over a period of up to five years, rather than deducting the full amount straight away.' In some cases the initial charges can be as high as 7 per cent. But, no matter how attractive the tax breaks may seem, the offshore single-premium insurance bond is not a suitable investment vehicle for everybody. Andrew Jones, a director of the David Aaron Partnership, a firm of independent financial advisers, argues: 'This is a specialised and sophisticated area of tax planning, and investors must seek advice first. The tax breaks may be common to all of these bonds, but it is just as important to pick the particular company with a range of funds best suited to individual needs, and one which one has a consistent performance track record. That said, those bonds which are based on pooled investment funds can be just as effective for UK residents seeking to mitigate income, capital gains and Inheritance Tax liabilities as they are for expatriates.' Finally, Jones also advises caution to UK residents tempted to use a personalised bond, as opposed to one linked to a pooled fund. He points out: 'The Inland Revenue has laid down some very strict guidelines on their use.'</p>

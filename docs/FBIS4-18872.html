			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has welcomed  the NATO air strike against Serbian positions near the east  Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde. This was an understandable  step taken by the United Nations, Government Spokesman Dieter  Vogel stated in Bonn on Monday. The Serbian side had been  warned but failed to heed the warning. Bonn was hoping that the  Serbs would now come to reason and that the hostilities could be  ended quickly. Vogel would not comment on the Russian protests  against the military action. He said that the Federal  Government recognized them.</p>

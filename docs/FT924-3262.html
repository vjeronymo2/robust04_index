			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Business fears temple crisis could hit economy INDIAN businessmen fear that the crisis sparked by the destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya by Hindu militants could harm the economy if the government does not rapidly move to restore stability. They fear that the riots, curfews and strikes which have followed Sunday's assault on the mosque will damage business confidence and jeopardise the reform programme of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. They said much would depend on how quickly order was restored. 'The next two days are vital,' said Mr V. Raghuraman, secretary general of the Assoc-iation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Finance Ministry officials also acknowledged the crisis could affect sentiment if it were allowed to drag on. The mood was particularly bleak in Bombay, which has borne the brunt of the riots. Many offices in the city were closed yesterday after disturbances in which at least 50 people were killed. The incident was already having an effect on business life: Hindustan Aluminium, an aluminium producer, postponed the pricing of a planned Dollars 100m Euro-equity issue because the Bombay stock market was closed so no price quotations were available. Stockbrokers prepared for a sharp drop in share prices today, the first day the market is due to open since the mosque's destruction. Hotels reported many cancellations. Mr Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, India's largest company, said from his Bombay office: 'The world is going to look at India as an unstable country. Political stability is one of the main considerations governing foreign investment.' Mr Nimesh Kampani, head of J M Financial and Investment Services, an investment broking company, said the incident would probably affect India's international credit rating - and make it more difficult for Indian companies to raise funds overseas. In Calcutta, Mr Mumtaz Ahmed, a spokesman for the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: 'Foreign investors don't just look for favourable government policies. They watch the situation on the ground. Foreigners will be in no hurry to invest after the Ayodhya incident. We tend to forget that India is just one of many investment options available to foreign investors.' Mr Jahar Sengupta, chairman of ICI India, an affiliate of the UK chemicals combine, was less glum. He forecast that there would be a serious setback in foreign investment in India only if Mr Rao's government falls - an event which yesterday seemed unlikely. Mr Ashok Desai, the the Finance Ministry's chief economic adviser, said the main impact of the crisis on foreign investment would be on portfolio investment. Businessmen who knew India well and were considering specific direct investments would not be so easily put off. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, who is in Washington, said yesterday that now that the liberalisation measures 'are seen to work, the reforms can only go forward'. The mosque's destruction has held up government business, including economic policymaking, with ministerial timetables cleared of routine work to make room for considering the crisis. The parliamentary committee probing the Bombay securities market scandal has postponed its meetings. If they are not resumed soon, that will delay MPs' final report which is expected to contain firm recommendations about financial reform. Without those recommendations, the finance ministry may have to delay its financial deregulation programme, including measures essential to further economic liberalisation.</p>

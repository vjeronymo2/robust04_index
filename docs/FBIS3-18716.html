			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Phillipe Seguin, president of the </F> French parliament: "`We've Had To Pay for That'"]    [Text] Phillipe Seguin was the spokesman for the  French opponents of the Maastricht Treaty, who barely lost in  the European referendum on 20 September 1992 with 48.95 percent.  The campaign, which peaked in a TV debate with President  Francois Mitterrand, made a national figure of the former social  minister. In public opinion polls a year after the referendum,  54 percent of the French people declared themselves in favor of  the Seguin line against Maastricht. Born in Tunis, Seguin, whose  father had died in action in 1944 as a volunteer in de Gaulle's  army, worked on behalf of an open, leftist Gaullism. Because of  his protectionist tendencies, the mayor of Epinal, whom LE MONDE  characterized as "le colosse," was reproached for being a  nationalist and populist. Following the election victory of the  right wing in March 1993, the popular, self-confident  nonconformist took on the office of president of the parliament  instead of heading up a ministry. From this politically neutral  base, Seguin, 50, could become a compromise candidate of the  right wing for the presidential elections in 1995--in the event  that the top candidates, Jacques Chirac and Edouard Belladur,  block one another.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, when you were six years old,  you  accepted a medal on behalf of your father, who had been killed  by the Germans in France in 1944. Have your pain and memories of  this time shaped your attitude toward the Germans?    [Seguin] My father died in a war. I have never felt ill will  toward the Germans. Quite to the contrary: The memory was a  special incentive for me to work for reconciliation and  cooperation.    [DER SPIEGEL] The usual harmony between Bonn and Paris has  given way to a kind of disenchantment of late. Is the  German-French relationship damaged?    [Seguin] There have always been differences of opinion and  difficult periods. But I don't see any reason for alarm just  now. Our special relationship arose during the Cold War. Thus we  have to put it on a new basis now. Germany is no longer in the  position it was in during the sixties, and France is beset by  moral doubts that have thrown it into an identity crisis.    [DER SPIEGEL] Both states suspect one another of national  egoism. The Germans accuse the French of selfishness and  protectionism. The French are suspicious that the Germans have  been seized once again by the drive to the east. Do the two  partners still have a common concept of Europe?    [Seguin] The end of the Cold War changed the old roles. Many  of the French fear a return of German nationalism.  Paradoxically, the most ardent French proponents of the  Maastricht Treaty used the argument that Germany had to be  contained. We French are displeased by the occasional German  reproach that we have a Grande Nation complex. We stand before a  turning point of history. There is thus indecision in the two  countries concerning the future path. But this onset of  insecurity is not dramatic.    [DER SPIEGEL] The opposition by President Francois  Mitterrand  to German unification perplexed, even shocked many Germans. Were  Mitterrand's delaying tactics a mistake?    [Seguin] Yes, and we have had to pay for that. I, too, was  very shocked that in the symbol-laden moment of the fall of the  Berlin Wall, the reaction of the French head of state was to  first pay a visit, during a curious tour, to those who in East  Berlin wanted to maintain the GDR, and then in Kiev to induce  Gorbachov to join an alliance of opponents to German unity.    [DER SPIEGEL] Doesn't that show that France had gotten to  like the division of Germany?    [Seguin] We should have shared the joy of the Germans, and  that was also the spontaneous feeling of many French citizens  when they saw what was taking place on the Wall in November  1989. On the other hand, the Germans probably wouldn't have  completed the unification so hastily, so precipitately, if they  hadn't felt this antipathy, if not to say hostility, on the part  of their most important European partner. They believed they had  to move quickly to create irrevocable facts.    [DER SPIEGEL] In any case, Mitterrand did not try--as  Margaret Thatcher later accused him in her memoirs--to block  German unity. Didn't his ambivalent behavior nevertheless create  lasting mistrust?    [Seguin] I hope not, but in the aftermath our concepts of  the  makeup of Europe in particular have changed. From that point on,  we urged acceleration of the establishment of the European  Union. In this way we wanted to counteract all the dangers that  could arise from German unification. This haste was our second  mistake.    [DER SPIEGEL] But Chancellor Kohl participated in this as  well. Maastricht was to be the compensation, the tranquilizer  pill, for German unity.    [Seguin] The way things were handled didn't do a service for  the development of Europe. The reason may have been that the  responsible politicians belong to generations that were marked  by history. Only this can explain the all too famous remark by  Francois Mauriac: "I love Germany so much that I am happy there  are two of them."    [DER SPIEGEL] How long will this kind of thinking last?    [Seguin] It no longer exists in my generation. Even if my  struggle against the Maastricht Treaty was not understood  correctly in Germany at the outset--I resisted the idea of  imbedding Germany in Europe, because that is a curious way of  keeping up friendly relations. The notion that the European  Union was an instrument for containing Germany was publicly  espoused even by such serious-minded politicians as the former  Socialist prime minister, Michel Rocard.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will the Paris-Bonn axis hold, or does it need  new bearings--less sentimentality, a greater convergence of  interests?    [Seguin] We have to renew it without abandoning the  emotional  ingredient. It is reassuring that for a long time relations,  beyond the level of government, have become a matter of the  peoples....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...despite the occasionally flickering fear of  the French people that the old German demons could be  resurrected?    [Seguin] As far as right-wing extremism in general is  concerned, the French people have no lessons to teach the  Germans.    [DER SPIEGEL] As the leader of the Maastricht opponents, who  barely lost the European referendum in September 1992, you are  living in a Europe that is not the way you wanted it. Is your  struggle for a different Europe continuing?    [Seguin] I lost in the referendum, but I ask myself whether  this defeat was not a victory in many respects. I basically feel  that one could have concluded the Maastricht Treaty in its  present form even in the days before Leonid Brezhnev....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...and Erich Honecker?    [Seguin] Yes, and without changing a single line of the  treaty text. If we first limited Europe to six, then nine, then  12 partners, we did so because the Iron Curtain divided the  continent. If Europe's founding fathers--Adenauer, de Gaulle,  Monnet, De Gasperi, and the others--had lived under present-day  conditions, they would not have started out with six, but would  have considered a quite different number.    [DER SPIEGEL] So, the European Union should expand to the  East?    [Seguin] Definitely. I also think that prosperity in the  West  will depend on how much we help the East in its development. I  dream of a kind of West European Marshall Plan for East  Europe....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...for the time being, this will probably  remain just a dream. The European Union would certainly be  taking on too much if it integrated the East European countries  precipitately. The Brussels consensus is: intensify instead of  enlarge.    [Seguin] The one thing is not incompatible with the other.  The European Community originally set itself three goals: First,  to create peace between the arch enemies; second, to contribute  to prosperity; third, to influence the world together. Whoever  wanted to join had to have a democratic government. Thus, there  were only six partners at the outset, because Greece, Spain, and  Portugal were not democracies, and Britain did not want to  subscribe to the common goals. When these countries were later  accepted, economic criteria hardly played a role. Otherwise,  Greece would never have been allowed to join.    [DER SPIEGEL] And Spain and Portugal wouldn't have been  accepted either. Nevertheless, Europe could not now afford  financially to expand to include the Eastern countries. It would  have to forget the desired economic and currency union.    [Seguin] Naturally, we cannot bring everything about  overnight. We would not be doing the Eastern countries any  favors in doing so. First we have to help them to organize  economically, but also guarantee that they will become members  over the long term, even if that takes three or four decades.    [DER SPIEGEL] That sounds different. And what place are you  reserving for Russia in your Europe?    [Seguin] What to do with Russia is a problem as old as  Europe, and it can be summarized in one question: Is Russia  really European? I think that is an open question for the time  being. But in any case we have to help Russia to become a part  of Europe. A phenomenon like Shironovsky was made possible  because Europe does not have a decisive foreign policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] The European Union has to define its position  not only toward Russia but toward America as well. Can the  Atlantic alliance survive in its present form?    [Seguin] I think NATO has outlived its usefulness. America's  disengagement has already begun. The number of U.S. troops  stationed in Europe will be reduced to around 100,000. In the  long run, public opinion in America will demand that these  troops be brought home and that Europe be left to its own  devices. Europe has to become grown up enough to take care of  its own security, in friendship and alliance with the United  States.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would France be prepared to make its nuclear  power--a symbol of its greatness and independence--a part of a  joint European defense policy?    [Seguin] France has to rethink its military policy. But  France's nuclear power must never be jeopardized. Therefore, I  belong to those who call for the resumption of our nuclear  testing.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mitterrand allowed the tests to be suspended  in  April 1992--a bow to the pacifists?    [Seguin] Vicious tongues maintain he ordered that because he  thought he could win the political support of the  environmentalists. Besides, the president apparently believes  our nuclear weapons are technically on a high enough  level--which many experts challenge.    [DER SPIEGEL] But this nuclear power is to remain  exclusively  under national command?    [Seguin] We should discuss with our European partners which  forms of consultation and cooperation can be used in the event  of operational engagement, and how the force de frappe can be  reconciled with a common foreign and security policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] Like other European countries, France is  experiencing a crisis of direction--anxiety over unemployment,  waves of immigration and a rising crime rate, and disaffection  from politics. Does the Socialist Mitterrand have to first step  down--his term in office ends in 1995--before the right wing  governing together with him can introduce a real change?    [Seguin] Yes. That is not possible before he does so. Our  political system functions in such a way that only presidential  elections can decide the really big questions of the nation.  They decide policy for the next seven years--for the duration of  the presidential mandate. We are thus still living within the  framework set by the election of Mitterrand in 1988. Despite the  victory of the right wing in the parliamentary elections last  March, the Balladur government is only a transitional  government....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...that therefore cannot deal with the crisis?    [Seguin] We are experiencing a moral crisis, a cultural  crisis, an identity crisis. We are seeking our role, our future,  France's road. We can only hope that the 1995 presidential  elections will provide the impetus to find answers, to set a new  course.    [DER SPIEGEL] First-time voters, who are 18 or 20 years old,  cannot remember any president other than Mitterrand. Doesn't a  seven-year mandate, which can also be renewed, have to lead to  political paralysis?    [Seguin] If we shorten the seven-year period, we necessarily  end up with a regular presidential system of the American kind,  with the simultaneous election of the president and the  parliament. But our constitution was designed along  parliamentary, not presidential lines. I don't believe that  shortening the term in office to four or five years would  produce any advantages.    [DER SPIEGEL] The president is the supreme commander. He can  remove the prime minister, dissolve parliament, influence  day-to-day policy of the government. Isn't that too much power?    [Seguin] The problem lies less in the institutions of the  Fifth Republic than in its undesirable developments. The  government that had the greatest room for maneuver in France  after the war was paradoxically the first cabinet of Charles de  Gaulle with Michel Debre as prime minister, although the general  was indeed an overpowering personality. But he concerned himself  only with diplomacy and the Army--at the time there was also the  war in Algeria. Everything else, all domestic policy, he left to  the government. He did not get involved in the work of the  government.    [DER SPIEGEL] That means that Mitterrand keeps a tighter  rein  on the country than de Gaulle did in his day?    [Seguin] From de Gaulle to Georges Pompidou and Valery  Giscard d'Estaing to Mitterrand, the presidency has taken on  increasingly monarchic characteristics. It would be desirable if  things returned to their original condition.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is Gaullism a doctrine with which France can  proceed into the 21st century?    [Seguin] When I look at people of my generation who caused  the turmoil of May 1968--Maoists, Socialists, Communists, and  what not--I consider myself very lucky that I followed the ideas  of de Gaulle, that I never fought for ideas. that lay outside  the bounds of reality. The general foresaw what is taking place  in Europe today.    [DER SPIEGEL] De Gaulle gathered left-wing and right-wing  people around him. In the meantime, the conservatives have  grabbed Gaullism for themselves. How do you view the general's  legacy today?    [Seguin] Just as the principles of the constitution have  gradually shifted, Gaullism, too, has shifted to the right. That  is regrettable because it isn't consistent with the essence of  Gaullism. Gaullism stands for a certain commitment to the  nation--not for an egoistic, secluded, anxious, and thus  outwardly aggressive nation, but for a nation as the fundamental  bulwark of democracy and the foundation of a strong feeling of  community. Gaullism is the victory over the conflict between  left and right in the name of national solidarity.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider yourself a pure Gaullist?    [Seguin] I hope I am. In any case, people say I am when they  want to speak ill of me.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Gaullists are again in the majority in the  government, but its base is largely no longer reflected in the  policies of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Why is Balladur  nevertheless so popular?    [Seguin] There is doubtless a contradiction between the  personal popularity of Balladur and the relative unpopularity of  the government's policies. He is the opposite of the Socialists  who ruled before him. He speaks sensibly and makes no empty  promises, and the people's weariness with politics works in his  favor. Balladur embodies values in which the French seek refuge  in their moral crisis.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you know who your candidate will be for the  presidential election in 1995?    [Seguin] My, what an indiscreet question! I will support the  candidate who is most closely associated with my ideas.    [DER SPIEGEL] That would be you....    [Seguin] ...You can insert three dots at this point.    [DER SPIEGEL] If you could draw a picture of the ideal  president for the future France, what would be his most  important characteristics?    [Seguin] Such a picture could resemble someone you think you  recognize. He will surely be a Gaullist.    [DER SPIEGEL] And what do you expect of him?    [Seguin] Even if the expression doesn't seem happily chosen,  owing to the historical example, I hope he introduces a real  cultural revolution in France that will attack a whole series of  problems--from European policy to combating unemployment to  education. We have a lot to do if we are to preserve and develop  our model of civilization.</p>

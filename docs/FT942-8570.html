			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK reply to Sinn Fein welcomed by Dublin The UK government last night called on Irish republican leaders to halt the IRA's 25-year campaign of violence as it published a detailed commentary on questions from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about last December's Downing Street Declaration. London's carefully worded text, which followed detailed consultations between senior ministers including Mr John Major, the prime minister, answered just one of the 20 questions directly, confirming that, if necessary, a referendum would be held to establish the wishes of the Northern Irish people concerning the province's future. It said the rest of Sinn Fein's questions 'range much more widely' than seeking elucidation of the test of the joint UK-Irish declaration. London's response was warmly welcomed as 'comprehensive and positive' by Dublin. Sinn Fein said it would examine the government's comments and reply to them later. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said later that the remaining questions 'to some extent were invitations to negotiate', but London was 'not going to negotiate, that is made very clear'. By answering one of the questions and hence modifying its previous insistence that the declaration did not need clarifying, London appeared to be trying to encourage republican doves, giving them grounds for proclaiming the exercise a success. But ministers will hope to have reassured unionists and Conservative backbenchers with its punctilious refusal to be drawn into negotiations. Earlier this week, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to portray the government's decision to respond at all as a victory, saying it was 'gratifying' that people had now accepted clarification was needed. Asked last night why the government had decided against leaving the questions unanswered, Sir Patrick said he thought people would have been 'rather critical' of such a decision. He added: 'We are facing something of great seriousness.' This was the continuation of political violence when both the British and Irish governments had agreed that the future should be decided by consent. Praising London's response as 'comprehensive and positive', Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said it should 'help to clear the road'. He was supported by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, who said that London had made 'a very serious effort' to meet the concerns of Sinn Fein. 'Sinn Fein should be able to welcome it . . . We feel very strongly that this effort by the British government should end the logjam.' Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, urged the IRA to declare an immediate ceasefire. 'The IRA has seriously misjudged the mood in Britain and the Irish Republic,' he said. 'Their support deserves to dwindle even further if they procrastinate another day.'</p>

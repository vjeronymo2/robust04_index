			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis said  that he was amazed by the fact that training aircraft were  downed and added:    [Begin Arsenis recording] The only thing I can say is that  this confirms once again the correctness of the Greek position  that Greece as well as all the other Balkan countries should not  participate either directly or indirectly in this activity that  sometimes results, as it did today, in an open [words  indistinct] and the downing of aircraft. I am really amazed  because it was a case of shooting aircraft that are by nature  training aircraft. [end recording]    YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] Chief Admiral  Khristos Limberis did not rule out the possibility of a mistake  and stressed that this incident should not be a reason to  suspend peace talks on Bosnia. Our correspondent Stefanos  Kasimatis has the following report.    [Begin Kasimatis recording] The YEETHA operations staff will  be in a state of vigilance and readiness to follow developments  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Admiral Khristos Limberis believes the  incident is not a reason to suspend peace efforts in the region.  However, the chief of YEETHA does not rule out the possibility  of a mistake by the U.S. aircraft since the identity of the  planes shot down remains unclear. At the same time, Admiral  Limberis noted that there are Galeb planes in Serbia's arsenal  since they are built in that country and also noted that,  according to his information, the Serbs in Bosnia have a small  number of these aircraft.    Belgian Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General [name  indistinct], who is on an official visit to Greece, also made a  statement on the incident. Despite the difference in emphasis,  the positions of the Greek and Belgian general staffs coincide  on the need for a political solution to the Bosnian issue. The  Belgian lieutenant general said that military action can be used  only to the extent that it pushes the belligerent sides to  negotiate. [end recording]</p>

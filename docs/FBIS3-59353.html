			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Binyan (0491 6333 7159): "Mao Zedong in Our </F> Hearts"--First paragraph is editor's note]    [Text] In this article, renowned writer Liu Binyan  probes specifically how Mao Zedong carried out mental  enslavement of the Chinese people and trampled human instinct  and personal dignity, resulting in the rampancy of evil and  corrupt activity around the country today. The article is a  rare, valuable work.    It is said that the corpse in the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall  has begun to rot. Which one is it, the real or the fake? In  those days, an exact dummy of the corpse was made to meet the  needs of "war preparation." The corpse on display may be the  dummy. As artificial materials may be confused with a real human  corpse, it is hard to tell which Mao Zedong it is. This is  somewhat ironic because throughout his lifetime Mao Zedong was  at home in playing tricks of real and fake. His tricks were so  clever that every Chinese was infatuated. At that time, despite  their suffering from starvation and the withering of their will  under mental oppression, the people around the country believed  that they were creating a new beautiful world!    Some 20 years ago, those who ate human flesh in Guangxi must  have had the belief that what they were doing was a  revolutionary act. Apart from the utilitarian reason that eating  human livers gives one a healthy liver and eating human hearts  makes one intelligent, the valiant and proud "sentiments and  aspirations" generated from the above belief must have played a  role when they were trying to overcome the psychological  obstacle that human nature posed against their cannibalist act.    Among Mao Zedong's many "magnificent contributions and great  deeds," a significant one was that he succeeded in  mentally enslaving the Chinese people and pushing them a big  step ahead toward the goal of eliminating human nature..    I once used three words in describing the acts of the  Chinese Communist Party (here I mean the entity of that party  rather than the overwhelming majority of its members) or, more  precisely, the characteristics of its behavior in terms of  morality: cruel, hypocritical, and despicable. These  characteristics were also possessed by Mao Zedong. He  successfully transformed the Chinese Communist Party "according  to his own image" and remolded the Chinese people's souls after  the party's model. All this was done in the guise of morality.    Why were the Chinese people so obedient to Mao Zedong that  no  rebellion occurred even when the unprecedented famine he created  had taken away the lives of more than 40 million people? It  would be oversimplified if we use "violence" and "deception" to  explain this. When the People's Liberation Army [PLA] marched  into Beijing, the first thing it did was to close all brothels.  This move alone conquered the people's minds from the standpoint  of morality. There were many other reasons: The strict  discipline of the army, the plain lifestyle of cadres who worked  even without salary, and the measures taken to stabilize  commodity prices, eliminate robbers and bandits, crack down on  local tyrants, and enable everyone to earn a living. All these  satisfied the Chinese people's moral requirement for "equality."  All these were not only "correct," but were "great." Mao  Zedong's "morality incarnate" image established by himself in  the early 1950's lasted until the early 1970's, when Lin Biao's  coup failed (and when many of the party's scandals were exposed  through the Cultural Revolution and through the events fomented  in the early stage of the Cultural Revolution). But his status  as a symbol of morality has not completely faded out even today.    During the period 1958-62, the destructive "Great Leap  Forward" and the "People's Communes" movements brought about a  catastrophic famine. Mao Zedong once again took advantage of the  Chinese people's moral sense. This way he not only reestablished  his prestige, but made hundreds of millions of people climax  their blind faith in him. The publicity given to Lei  Feng and many other PLA heroes, the accompanying nationwide  emulation campaigns, and the propaganda on cadre Jiao  Yulu all successfully drew the people's attention to the  need for self-purification. They no longer bothered to observe  and think what was going on in China's society and what faults  Mao Zedong had committed.    The main theme of the report on Jiao Yulu was quite clear:  Two factors accounted for Lankao County's dire poverty --  inclement natural conditions and lack of hard-struggling spirit  on the part of cadres and masses. It was impossible that Jiao  Yulu did not think over the numerous mistakes committed by Mao  Zedong after the Agrarian Reform and the grave consequences of  those mistakes. But the report -- which was not so moving --  said nothing about this at all. As a matter of fact, after  comparing himself or herself with Lei Feng, everyone felt  morally guilty and deemed it imperative to devote  hard efforts to self-cultivation and self-improvement. Now, with  Jiao Yulu as a mirror, they were all the more imbued with a  sense of inferiority, feeling that they must be remolded. Both  "models" told them that they must follow Mao Zedong closely  without the slightest vacillation.  <H3>  Successfully Made Hundreds of Millions of People Abandon  Their Own "Selves" </H3>   Neither the Soviet Union nor any East European country could  match China in holding frequent political campaigns. In China,  every year saw some political campaigns. On some occasions,  several campaigns were held at the same time.    Let us say that China's political campaigns began with the  Agrarian Reform. Mao Zedong was opposed to a "Peaceful Agrarian  Reform" and the "idea of bestowing land as a favor." He insisted  that the peasants should do this with political consciousness  and on their own initiative. This required a lot of efforts.  Work teams must "visit the poor and inquire about their  sufferings." They must "take root in the countryside, keep in  contact with the peasants" and "mobilize" every household and  individual. Where there was no suffering, the work team must dig  out something as "suffering." Where there was no "hatred," the  work team had to do something to foster it. The widespread  campaign of physical torment imposed on landlords and rich  peasants, the drive to sweep them out of the doors, and even the  destruction of their lives were mostly the results of the  stratagems applied by the work teams.    Mao Zedong was a successful psychologist without learning.  Suppose, on a certain occasion, you mounted the stage to accuse  a landlord of oppressing you and beat him up. Once you had such  a "practice," even though you had done this not of your own  accord or only half-heartedly or pretentiously, and even though  you had not experienced the retaliation by the "home-going"  legion, you would naturally stand on Mao Zedong's side. In a  campaign, suppose you were egged on or forced to do something by  the "party leadership." After you had done it over and over  again, you would unwittingly become the protagonist. So it would  appear as if the campaign had been really initiated by the  masses themselves.    In urban areas, there was even better soil for sham things  to grow into real ones. After underground party organizations  and the army entered cities, they absorbed many young  intellectuals, most with sincerity to devote themselves to the  revolution. Newly liberated areas needed large numbers of cadres  to replace the Kuomintang government functionaries, giving young  intellectuals many opportunities both to "devote themselves to  the revolution" and to "become officials and overlords." Whether  their goal was to grasp the opportunity to better serve the  people or to obtain official positions, they had to perform  well--they must obey the party's instructions and actively  plunge into various campaigns so as to become party members as  early as possible. If they discovered that they were unwilling  to do something--even if their unwillingness was a slight  hesitation--honest and thoughtful people would blame themselves  for entertaining an "individualist idea." They would quickly  examine themselves so as to avoid being criticized.    Mao Zedong never advocated that a man should reflect on  his mistakes in private. Ideological remolding was always a  process by which the majority forced the minority to give  in. Though this process, which transformed others as well  as oneself, was "entirely arranged by the party," it made people  feel that "I am doing this conscientiously and willingly" and,  therefore, think that they were the initiators of the process.  In each campaign, they had to unjustly attack a number of  people, do something against their will, and say something  against their conscience. Sometimes, they could not avoid acting  immorally or unlawfully, such as conducting secret  investigations, informing against someone, and making false  testimonies. All these, they thought, were "demanded by the  party" and "needed by the revolution," or the "common things"  they had to do in order to protect themselves. With this  thinking and seeing that everyone was doing the same, they could  be relieved of guilty conscience.    In each campaign, the victims were invariably the "small  handful." More than 1 million people were accused as rightists,  but compared with the nation's total population or the total  number of personnel of a work unit, those accused were still a  "small handful." This made people feel relieved--even though the  accused were wronged, there was no need to rehabilitate them. In  fact, the "small handful" could serve a big purpose. Mao Zedong  was more clever than Stalin. Why was it necessary to kill so  many people? Mao Zedong did not want to frighten people with  slaughter. He wanted people to fear that "they might make  mistakes, and if they did make mistakes, they would not only  ruin themselves but bring a disaster to their families."  Therefore, some of the more than 1 million rightists were not  arrested, and only very few were killed. Most of them were still  alive and were allowed to show up everyday. Seeing them, people  could not help but constantly alert themselves. At the same  time, they felt happy that they themselves had not been accused.  What a clever scheme this was!    One of Mao Zedong's inventions was the "label." Among the  "rightists," "bad elements," and "historical  counterrevolutionaries," who would not like to have their labels  removed as early as possible? The "rightists" were further  divided into six categories. The "ultra-rightists" were deprived  of everything but their lives. Those belonging to the sixth  category were only deprived of political rights--even their  wages were not affected. This saved the party a lot of trouble  because the rightists could check and criticize each other and  vie to show loyalty to the party so as to cast off their labels  at an early date. What was wonderful was that these people did  not even know the deceptive or unjust nature of so-called  self-transformation. More often than not, they conducted  self-transformation out of their faith in the revolution.    There was no distinction between right and wrong,  truth and falsehood. When this situation lasted for several  decades, people's instinct, righteousness, and personal dignity  were practically nonexistent.    Mao Zedong succeeded in making hundreds of millions of  people abandon their own "selves." All personal desires,  benefits, and interest not contradictory but even conducive to  the development of the whole nation were attacked and  suppressed. An individual's concern, thinking, and demand for  participation in social transformation were either manipulated  by the leader or the party or viewed as dangerous and hostile,  and therefore strangled. There was one thing that no ruling  party or political leader in the world dare to do but Mao Zedong  and the Chinese Communist Party did successfully, and that was  to openly ask the people to serve as "tools" of Mao and  society--and the "tools" were "docile tools." Unconditional  negation of individuality became the basic norm for ideology,  systems, and policies and was accepted widely as a general  practice. On the other hand, people had no right to withdraw  from society or become inactive members of society. They must  constantly dedicate themselves to society in line with the  party's will. Only in this way could they be really "docile."  <H5>  Making the People as Poor as Animals Is Kind of Knife </H5>   "Poverty stifles ambition." Desire for survival outweighs  everything else. At that time, people were satisfied as long as  they remained alive. They were in a state of lasting  hopelessness, and no one could change their fate. Diligence and  initiative were of no use at all. When you had to beg the party  branch secretary every year for "relief grain" or "resold  grain," or when you had to present your wife or daughter to him  in exchange for his favor, could you still have personal  dignity? At that time, of course, the people would most easily  accept the despotic rule. In 1956, Mao Zedong hastily put into  force the agricultural collectivization policy. The reason was  no other than that he feared that once the peasants became  well-to-do, they would not obey his instructions.    The long period of poverty in China since the late 1950's  was  a result of cruel oppression and enslavement of the Chinese  people by Mao Zedong's personal ambition and his anti-humanist  ideology. Poverty, political deprivation, and mental  enslavement were three leading reasons for the unprecedented  destruction of the Chinese humanist spirit and morality.    Mao Zedong praised "poverty and blankness" because only on a  blank China could he "draw the most beautiful picture" according  to his own will. He held that poverty could make people's hearts  purer. In fact, it made the people more like animals, and it  forced them to suffer much more than real animals.    Despite their year-round toiling, the people could hardly  eke out a living and even had to incur heavy debts. Through  years, such a life benumbed the people's normal feeling and even  caused them to give themselves up as hopeless. After all,  however, human beings were human beings. In society, poverty  always existed along with unfairness, oppression, and bullying.  The Chinese people had neither property nor power, and were  unable to change their predicament. They felt hopeless about  their future and were ignorant of the world (and even of China's  real situation over the past four decades). Because of these  problems, in 1976 when Mao Zedong died, the Chinese people's  minds were by no means a blank. Still less were they in a state  of lovely purity.    By that time, the peasants' go-slow movement which began in  1958 nationwide had lasted for nearly 20 years. Theft of public  property by the masses, which started at the same time, was a  form of the peasants' retaliation against exploitation and  oppression. Slow work and privately seizing public property were  quite common in state-owned enterprises. When these activities  appeared over and over again, the people's hatred for the ruling  political power became increasingly intensive, and their hearts  drifted farther and farther from society. In the early 1970's,  peasants along railways and highways began to seize state  materials being transported. Shortly afterward, an appalling  incident occurred in Shanghai where several hooligans took turn  to rape a young woman in a downtown area. There were lots and  lots of onlookers, but no one bothered to stop the scene.    In 1971, the Lin Biao incident broke out. The second  economic  crisis and the nationwide political persecution caused by the  Cultural Revolution finally collapsed Mao Zedong's authority and  his ideological system. China was in a state of great  disillusionment. The clock began to run back and the ideological  pendulum in China's society began to swing toward the side  opposite to the one advocated by Mao Zedong and hotly pursued by  the Chinese people in previous years.  <H3>  Though the Clock Has Run Back, the People Are Still Going  Toward Inhumanity </H3>   It was a quiet collapse triggered by a soundless explosion.  On their own initiative and without mutual consultation, people  quietly discarded their blind faith in Mao Zedong and moved to  the opposite. What Mao Zedong described as correct now became  erroneous. And what was bad according to his teaching was now  considered to be good.    In a certain sense, there was no doubt an ideological  emancipation movement. People began to be freed from the cage  built by themselves and the shackles they forged for their own  bondage. Nonetheless, the emancipation was tragic in nature and  destructive in terms of its ethical consequence. There was an  instance which might be exceptional but was indeed  representative. Some educated youths who had plunged into the  Great Cultural Revolution and later gone to work in the  countryside and mountain areas in response to the great leader's  call suddenly felt hopeless and dispirited after a long period  of ascetic life where the revolution outweighed everything. In  some villages, young men and women cohabitated as a way of  pleasure-seeking.    When Mao Zedong was building the revolutionary edifice and  using his illusive goal and humanism to unify the people, he  broke down individual entities, eliminated freedom, and  exercised physical and mental enslavement, pushing the Chinese  people toward inhumanity. Now, the collapse of Mao Zedong's  edifice is just a reversed process: Awakened individuals  have divorced themselves from the whole. In doing so, they have  discarded the sham part of Maoism (revolution and morality)  while still holding on to its true essence (cruelty, hypocrisy,  and despicableness). This process, too, is leading to  inhumanity.    This was not a sudden explosion. The dark side of the party  and related historical facts were first exposed during the  Cultural Revolution to meet the needs of struggle. Then, Mao  Zedong put at the highest place the fallacies he had designed  since the 1950's and dealt blows at hundreds of millions of  people. All these have gradually awakened the people. Finally,  the self-awareness of the Chinese people has been aroused to an  extent unprecedented in the past several thousand years. With  such awakening and emancipation, they have naturally taken the  renouncement of Maoism as their glorious goal. On the other  hand, those who can speak the people's sufferings, as a matter  of course, have come up to fill the void in the people's hearts.    Now, the people have begun to regain their own "selves." But  you will find one thing: After trampling human nature underfoot  for decades, what a fertile field Mao Zedong has prepared for  the growth of the vicious part of human nature.  <H5>  The Legacy of Spiritual Ruin Is Evil Running Wild </H5>   Out of revenge for nearly three decades' exploitation and  oppression, everyone now feels that he or she has a right to ask  anything from society. All of a sudden, the self, which has long  been belittled, can go its own way as magnificently and freely  as a heavenly steed soaring across the skies. Unfortunately,  however, the freedom obtained in the Deng Xiaoping era is  neither used for creation and discovery nor for participation in  social transformation (in 1978-80 even an ordinary worker in  China longed for an opportunity to do so). That road is  overgrown with brambles and full of potential dangers. In  contrast, the road to satisfying selfish desire is unimpeded.    Mao Zedong used "socialism" to do away with China's  traditional society and put the party and the political power in  a position to face every Chinese directly. The party's feeler  went deep into every aspect of the people's life. Everyone's  subsistence, honor and disgrace, and ups and downs were dictated  by the will of the party (from the great leader to the village  party branch secretary), and every good deed appearing on the  9.6 million square kilometer land was credited to the party's  leadership. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is:  The Chinese can be irresponsible for their nation, society, and  even themselves. If all achievements are creditable to the  party, then any malpractice should be attributed to the party as  well. So, in the course of time, a peculiar consciousness  or subconsciousness has come into being: Damn! This country  belongs to the Communist Party. It has nothing to do with  me.    The old moral code is practically nonexistent, while new  morality is ridiculed. Education is renounced by society. Law  has little or no binding effect. Religion is considered unlawful  or only semi-lawful unless it voluntarily serves as a tool of  the party. Thus, there is virtually no force that can restrain  people from within and without. This has been the case since the  "virtue" concept was eliminated by man-made class struggle, and  evil activities "for the sake of revolution" were held in  esteem. Now, Deng Xiaoping's time has begun, and a new problem  has arisen: The party's corruption is spurring the decay of the  entire society.    The spiritual ruin created by Mao Zedong has become an ideal  venue for evils to run amok.    This article is not intended to make a comprehensive  evaluation and analysis of the reality in present-day China. The  economic boom resulting from the people's might unleashed by the  economic reform and the greater freedom enjoyed by the Chinese  today are undeniable facts. But didn't we pay too high a price  for these? It is not necessary to turn the obedient people into  an "unbridled people" or "violent people." China need not  repeat the course of Europe in the initial period of capitalism  when darkness and crimes prevailed. And the creative force of  the revived people should not necessarily be translated into a  destructive force. The only question is whether the Deng  Xiaoping clique is willing to carry China's de-Maoization drive  through to the end.    Recently, when the news came that China failed in its bid  for  hosting the 2000 Olympic Games, a female Chinese reporter said  indignantly before the public: "If this had been known  earlier, Wei Jingshen would not have had to be freed from  jail!" Was this a comeback of the departed spirit of Mao  Zedong?    On the day when I learned that Wei Jingshen was released  from jail, I thought of a question: In the face of Wei Jingshen,  has any Chinese intellectual asked his or her own conscience:  During Wei Jingshen's 14 hard years behind bars, what was I  doing for the Chinese people?    I believe there are such people, but perhaps they are not  many. Everyone can find some reason to have a clear conscience.  Mao Zedong has taught many people how to ease their conscience.  No doubt, this will be conducive to their longevity.</p>

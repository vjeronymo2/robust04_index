It means to build five optical fiber cable lines, four  micro-wave lines, 300,000-channel program-controlled telephone  network, two postal projects and ten ground telecommunication  satellite stations.    Last year, the total capacity of the province's telephone  exchanges was doubled, and 96 percent of its villages had  telephone communications. Rural telecommunications in Yunnan  rank now fourth in the country, after Beijing, Tianjin and  Shanghai.    In the past, the backward telecommunications system had  affected economic development of Yunnan, which has many  mountains and changeable weather. In some mountainous areas,  telecommunications would be cut for over a month during the  rainy season.    Last year, the province invested 530 million yuan to build a  micro-wave line, and three optical fiber lines between Dali and  Ruili, Kunming and Yuxi, and Panzhihua, as well as a number of  telecommunications satellite ground stations.    Two of the stations -- in Kunming, capital of the province,  and Nujiang Prefecture -- have been completed and will go into  operation soon.    In 1993, the province increased telephone exchange lines by  140,000.    Eighty-six of the province's 127 counties have joined the  national long-distance automatic telephone network, and 48  cities have installed the IDD [international direct dialing]  system.    Telephone lines were installed in 1993 in an additional 854  townships and villages.</p>

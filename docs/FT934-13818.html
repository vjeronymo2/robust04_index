			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Hearing on US warehouse opens THREE leading supermarket chains launched a High Court action yesterday to block planning permission given for an American 'warehouse club' to trade in Thurrock, Essex. The case is being watched closely by sectors of the retail trade concerned about the impact the arrival of warehouse clubs could have on traditional UK shopping outlets. Thurrock Borough Council has given planning permission for the US company Costco to build a 12,880 sq m warehouse at the Lakeside trading estate. The warehouse will sell a range of products in bulk and at a heavy discount to members of the club - usually businesses - and to the public. J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco have objected to the proposed development, claiming the council acted unlawfully by treating it as a wholesaler rather than a retailer, and so did not use planning criteria applied to proposed supermarket developments. Planning criteria on Thurrock's land use, which place a higher priority on commercial and industrial projects than retail operations, were not considered, they say. Mr David Pannick QC, for the supermarkets, challenged Thurrock's decision to treat Costco as a wholesaler rather than a retailer. Evidence from Costco's US operations showed that 35 per cent of sales were made to the public and the planning application made no mention of the conditions for club membership. Mr Richard Humphreys, for Thurrock Borough Council, said planning permission had been granted on condition that the proportion of sales to the public would not rise above 35 per cent and so not damage other local traders. Costco also marketed a far more limited range of products than supermarkets. Items would be sold in bulk, appealing more to business buyers than the public. The hearing is expected to end today.</p>

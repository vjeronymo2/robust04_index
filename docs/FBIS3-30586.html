			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] After a meeting with ministers from the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], the Sejm speaker, Jozef Oleksy,  declared that he did not exclude a breakup of the coalition.    Monika Olejnik has just returned from the Sejm:    [Olejnik] Certain ministers who took part in this discussion  are also of the opinion that a breakup of the coalition is  possible. The majority of them say that Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak will accept Marek Borowski's resignation. Some say that,  despite everything, the coalition will survive. Aleksander  Kwasniewski told journalists that there was already a new name,  but he said this half in jest, half seriously. However, quite  seriously, Marek Borowski said:    [Begin recording] [Borowski] I will certainly not gather up  my belongings and will not go home because there are tasks to be  fulfilled.    [Olejnik] Does the Parliamentary Floor Group bear you a  grudge for resigning, or does it accept your arguments?    [Borowski] I think it accepts them. The group that debated  [the situation] agreed that these were conditions that could be  accepted.    [Olejnik] Mr. [Deputy] Prime Minister, do you not think it  egoistic? You are resigning; this is a threat to the SLD  coalition with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Do you not  exclude the possibility that this could be a threat?    [Borowski] If certain trends are developing the wrong way,  there remains only the question of when one should do it [as  heard]--whether to wait until it becomes difficult to patch up  anything or whether to do it earlier. I came to the conclusion  that earlier is better. There may have been those who thought  it would have been better to wait. [end recording]    [Olejnik] Marek Borowski told journalists that the  conditions  set by the SLD were the conditions of all of the ministers who  belong to the SLD. The SLD was waiting all the time for a  telephone call from Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. It is not  known whether this will happen tomorrow, the day after, or the  day after that.</p>

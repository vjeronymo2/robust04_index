Graduated in 1968 from the Riga Command Engineer School.    He served in the Strategic Missile Troops for more than 13  years. He worked his way up from gun crew member to missile  regiment commander. He graduated from the F.E. Dzerzhinskiy  Military Academy Command Faculty. In 1984, after completing  postgraduate studies by correspondence he submitted his  dissertation for the degree of Candidate of Military Sciences.    From 1985 he worked in the Armed Forces General Staff Center  of Operational-Strategic Research.    After graduating in 1990 from the General Staff Military  Academy he became Senior Tutor at the Department of Strategy and  a Senior Lecturer.    Since June 1992 he has been Chief of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense Directorate for Military Organizational  Development and Reforms. He holds the rank of  Lieutenant-General.    [Falichev] Gennadiy Dmitriyevich, the Directorate of  Military Organizational Development and Reforms which you head  was one of the first directorates set up in the Russia Ministry  of Defense, and it was there at the very beginning of the  elaboration of the Concept of the Russian Armed Forces'  Organizational Development. Evidently this is why interest in  the directorate, and in you personally, is so great.    [Ivanov] Yes, the Directorate's main task is to develop and  validate conceptual theses in various spheres of military  organizational development. The adoption of decisions on the  practical implementation of these theses is the prerogative of  the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Defense Collegium, and  sometimes the supreme organs of state power also.    Public interest in us is indeed high. Only I would say that  the interest is not in the Directorate but in the Armed Forces,  in the processes taking place in the Army, in army reform. Our  positions have frequently been explained to journalists. There  are articles in the newspapers and magazines which have covered  the progress of the Russian Armed Forces' organizational  development, the creation of its legislative fundamentals, and  the results of military cooperation in the framework of the CIS  -- in other words, the questions which come under our  directorate's jurisdiction.    [Falichev] The Russian Armed Forces will very soon be two  years old, and evidently it is possible to do some summing up.    [Ivanov] The main result of Defense Ministry activity in  this period is the fact that the Russian Federation right now  has its own Armed Forces, which are disciplined and capable of  performing the tasks assigned to them.    Now let us recall where it all actually began.    Despite the fact that, in line with the President's 1992  decree, a significant proportion of the troop groupings of the  former USSR became part of the Russian Armed Forces, they did  not constitute an integrated military organism. The existing  troop command and control and material/technical supply systems  were disrupted; there was virtually no military infrastructure  on Russia's European territory....    These were the conditions in which our Armed Forces were set  up and in which the foundations for maintaining Russia's  military security were laid.    The importance and complexity of this problem is shown by,  for example, the fact that even in the first three months of the  Russian Armed Forces' existence the concept of their  organizational development was examined at two sessions of the  Security Council.    The changes in the military-political situation and Russia's  geostrategic position and the reduction in the size of the Armed  Forces necessitated the elaboration of new approaches to the  organization of troops. Today it is no longer expedient to have  troops all along the border, as was the case before. The  principle of mobile defense is the cornerstone of the reform of  force groupings. This principle posits the existence of small  but sufficiently strong forces that are ready for effective use  wherever a real threat to Russian security arises.    The Ministry of Defense's proposals for the combat strength,  structure, and size of the Armed Forces and its approaches to  the location of force groupings were approved by the president  and formally expressed as the Concept for the Organizational  Development of the Armed Forces and the corresponding plans and  programs which are currently being implemented.    New force groupings are being set up and the previously  existing ones strengthened; this applies first and foremost to  the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts. The number of  fully staffed, combat-effective combined formations and units  has been increased through a drastic reduction of the number of  under-strength combined formations and units. The creation of  Mobile Forces has begun. The transition to a mixed system of  recruitment is being implemented. The system of military  education has been restored, and reform in this sphere has begun.    At the same time the Armed Forces are performing a number of  other tasks.    One of the most important is the phased withdrawal of  Russian  troops from the territory of other states. In 1993 alone more  than 100,000 servicemen, more than 5,000 units of armored  equipment and artillery systems, and around 700 airplanes and  helicopters were withdrawn. This year the withdrawal of troops  will be largely completed. Everyone knows that our troops are  performing peacekeeping functions in accordance with Russia's  international commitments. The social problems of servicemen  and their families are being resolved.    All this is the result of the very considerable efforts of  the whole Army. What was formerly elaborated and implemented  over many years has taken the newly formed Russian Armed Forces  not quite two full years.    [Falichev] Do you think that the charges made by certain  newspapers that the doctrine appeared too late are just?    [Ivanov] Elaboration of the doctrine began from the moment  the decision to form the Russian Armed Forces was made, that is  to say from May 1992. An interdepartmental commission was  formed under the Security Council to create this doctrine, and  we took the most active part in its work, in conjunction with  other General Staff and Ministry of Defense structures. All our  plans were presented to the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of  Defense Collegium, and the chief of the General Staff, all of  whom made several amendments and criticisms. I should remark  that representatives of many state structures, including the  military, worked on the doctrine. The document that was adopted  is the fruit of collective efforts.    Was the doctrine too long emerging? I wish to explain that  several of its provisions were reflected in the very first  presidential edicts on the formation of the Russian Army.  Subsequently, military questions were frequently examined at  sessions of the Security Council and the government and in  organs of the representative power.    The main provisions of the Russian Federation's military  doctrine, adopted in November 1993, above all constitute a  composite document incorporating military-political, strictly  military, and military-technical aspects of ensuring the state's  defense capability.    [Falichev] The doctrine treats the possibility of employing  the Armed Forces within Russian Federation territory to suppress  armed conflicts. In some sections of the mass media the Armed  Forces are described as policing forces, no less. Could you  clarify this?    [Ivanov] Yes, the Army, as an attribute of the state, is  designed above all to defend it from external aggression. But  in certain circumstances danger to state institutions can come  from within. Why then should the Army remain on the sidelines  in such a situation?    In developed democratic countries, for example in the United  States, Germany, Britain, and France, the possibility and  necessity of employing Armed Forces to safeguard internal  security are legislatively enshrined. The difference is only in  the formulas, which take account of the specific features of  those states.    I should stress that, first, the Russian Army is allocated  only an auxiliary role in the performance of internal functions,  since the accent in suppressing conflict is mainly on the  Russian Federation's internal troops and security forces.  Second, the Army is mainly intended to localize the area of  conflict. Thus the use of the Armed Forces to safeguard  internal state security is strictly limited. The question of  the Army's direct participation in a conflict can only arise in  the event that the internal troops and security forces in the  crisis zone are insufficient to defend the interests of the  state, Russian citizens, and society in that region.    [Falichev] Today the process of creating a military doctrine  is behind us. The main avenues of the organizational  development of the Armed Forces in the long term have also been  defined. Does this mean that your directorate will be left with  no work to do?    [Ivanov] I will reveal to you the directorate's "secret"  work plan for 1994. It envisages:    the elaboration of conceptual proposals for bringing  previously adopted laws into line with the Constitution and the  fundamental provisions of the Russian Federation's military  doctrine;    the preparation of drafts of essential new laws in the  sphere  of defense and of draft normative-legal acts providing for their  realization;    the development of a Concept of Armed Forces Military Law  Reform;    the elaboration of approaches to ensure the realization of  the Treaty on the Collective Security of CIS Member Countries.    Much needs to be done in the organizational development of  the Armed Forces also.    We are taking part in the elaboration of options for the  structure of the Armed Forces in the period after 1995. I  stress, options, so that they can be submitted for discussion.  A whole range of scientific research work is being carried out  to validate the prospects for the organizational development of  the Armed Forces.    But there is a subtle point here. Each branch of the Armed  Forces will probably envisage the existence of its structures in  their former capacity and in the long term. But a narrow  departmental approach must be avoided. And this is not easily  done.    As for the lack of competence of which we are accused, let  me  show you by way of example a selection of the directorate's  cadres.    Of the 45 staff members three are doctors of sciences, 14  are  candidates, and 10 have academic titles. People serving in the  directorate mostly possess a wide experience of working in the  troops, the General Staff, and the staffs of branches of the  Armed Forces. I assign to the directorate's "gold fund" the  consultants and specialists among the civilian personnel and  people who have served in the forces for more than 30-35 years  in leading positions of the Ministry of Defense structures.    Judge for yourself whether we have knowledge, experience,  and  professionalism.    [Falichev] Don't you have too many tasks and commitments,  Gennadiy Dmitriyevich? This way you could become a ministry  within a ministry, subsuming other structures...    [Ivanov] I think that that is an "outsider's" point of view.  We have already read comments to that effect.... I believe that  our directorate is only a part of a complex machine whose name  is the Ministry of Defense. Everything that is created here is  a common product, and that is all.    [Falichev] Gennadiy Dmitriyevich, I cannot help asking you  about articles which have appeared in recent times. They  concern the defense minister's inner circle. What do you feel  about them?    [Ivanov] I believe that such publications pursue only one  goal -- to compromise the country's military policy, the Army,  and the Defense Ministry leadership. If you analyze the  articles on this topic, you will easily be convinced that they  bear a self-serving character and appear at times when important  events are taking place in the country and in society: the  referendum, the elections.... Typically the authors of these  articles always refer to various mythical sources of  information, trying to hide their own uninformed opinions and  elementary ignorance in military questions. Let us leave these  articles to the consciences of the authors, who either do not  understand or, on the contrary, understand only too well that  the Army is one of the few state institutions which, in this  highly difficult period, are guarantors of stability.    As for the defense minister's inner circle, you will agree  with the following: Any leader comes with his own team, relying  above all on those people he knows well. This is a worldwide  standard, a generally accepted practice, and there is nothing  surprising in the fact that there are such people in the  minister's entourage.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Y. Tsakiris] </F>   [Text] Look East, North, and West. A new Greece is waiting  for us and we should defend it. This is the philosophy of the  new defense doctrine that aims to retain the only opportunity  given to our country to play a decisive role in the Balkans and  reinforce its position in Europe.    For the first time, the National Defense Ministry appears to  be getting out of the narrow framework and entering the foreign  policy and military diplomacy fields. The right of the  powerful, a policy Turkey follows, is the ministry's new goal.  The first and necessary move on the international chessboard is  the change in our country's defense doctrine and the unified  defense space with Cyprus.    It is the second time in our country's recent history that  there has been a change in the defense doctrine. The first  change was imposed by the developments of 1974. Earlier,  Greece's threat came from the North and was not so much due to a  real threat as designed to serve NATO's needs. But the events  of 1974 forced the government to withdraw from NATO's military  branch (to which it later returned) to change the defense  doctrine and clearly state the danger from the East.    The second change in the defense doctrine is formulated now  by the National Defense Ministry. Compared with the first  change, the substantial difference is that this change is not a  result of military action. It constitutes a change in handling  international political and military developments. The goal now  is to strengthen Greece internationally and the first move is  the unified defense space with Cyprus. In practice, this means  that the two countries coordinate their defense needs and moves  and their defense purchases and exercises. And the "casus  belli" will be valid for both sides.    The second factor leading our country to change its defense  doctrine is the agreement by all governments that "they wrongly  placed their hopes for a Cyprus solution on an ineffective and  bureaucratic machine like the United Nations. Not only has it  failed to help substantially, but it has reduced hopes of a  solution to the minimum."    The success of the new defense doctrine is based on unified  Hellenism, which means--and this is clear in the Defense  Ministry's documents--that an offensive move by the Turks in  Cyprus "provides the legal basis for our country to attack  Turkey from any point, not only from the front that Turkey  opened."    In this way, we will increase the fronts the Turkish Army  must face and decrease the possibilities of a Turkish attack,  while pressing Turkey to amend its intransigence over the Aegean  and Cyprus. The goal is to upgrade Hellenism as a force in the  Balkans and increase Greece and Cyprus' negotiating capabilities.</p>

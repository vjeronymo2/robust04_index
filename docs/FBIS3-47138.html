			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Human Rights Infringer's </F> Ballad on the Respect of Human Life"]    [Text] The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called  report meeting on life reforms on 7 January. Talking about life  reforms, he raved that the spirit of respecting human life  should be put into practice and that many people must not be  made lawbreakers because of unrealistic legal systems. The  rascal raved that the people should actually feel the success of  life reforms within a year at the most. This is another  brazen-faced mockery of the people, which can be raved by  traitor Kim Yong-sam, that is, the political impostor well  versed in fraud, trickery, cheating, and machination.    To renovate the spirit of respect for human life in South  Korea, the colonial fascist rule should, above all, be put to an  end. Fascist vicious laws, including the National Security Law,  which systematically infringes upon the people's freedom and  rights; and suppressive organizations, such as the police,  prosecution, and the Agency for National Security Planning  [NSP], and the Defense Security Command should be abrogated and  dissolved. Then new laws and organizations centered on the  people should come into being. Otherwise, the spirit of  respecting human life cannot be displayed.    In fact, even today, that is, the era of respecting human  life, human dignity, and freedom have been fully trampled  underfoot in South Korea. It is in South Korea where youths,  students, and patriotic figures who struggled for independence,  democracy, and reunification, have been secretly assassinated  and dumped into rivers and seas. It is also in the rotten South  Korea where husbands kill wives and vice versa, sons and  daughters kill parents and secretly bury them, and traffickers  in human flesh for a little money prevail. The worst human  right infringement activity has been committed by the Kim  Yong-sam ring babbling about respecting human rights.    Under the pretext of a civilian regime, the Kim Yong-sam  puppet ring is suppressing the people more mercilessly than at  the time of the military dictatorial regimes. By mobilizing the  police, the puppet ring trampled underfoot the workers who  staged sit-ins calling for the right for subsistence last year.  It mercilessly suppressed youths, students, and citizens  calling for revealing the truth behind the Kwangju incident and  punishing those responsible for the Kwangju incident, by  mobilizing approximately 100,000 policemen. The number of  people who were injured by the police is more than three times  those injured at the time of the Sixth Republic. This shows  that the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring is mercilessly suppressing the  people.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved that many fellow countrymen must  not be made lawbreakers because of an unrealistic legal system.  This is also a brazen-faced maneuver. Many kinds of vicious  laws, which can be applicable under any circumstances, exist in  South Korea. The National Security Law is the most vicious law  of all laws.    It goes without saying that the National Security Law is an  unrealistic one in view of the background of the enacted law and  its reactionary characteristics. For this reason, the South  Korean people have strongly demanded that the National Security  Law--the vicious fascist law against democracy and  reunification--be rescinded.    However, the Kim Yong-sam ring has aggravated North-South  relations and arrested and persecuted many people by brandishing  this law. This nonetheless, he had the face of raving that many  fellow countrymen must not be made lawbreakers because of an  unrealistic legal system. How brazen-faced the rascal is!    Traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled about the spirit of respecting  human life from the beginning of the new year. The reason he  spat out such words is clear. As everyone knows, since traitor  Kim Yong-sam seized power under the pretext of a civilian-regime  president, he has babbled about the improvement of human rights  and the development of democracy. Even though one year has  passed since he seized power, nothing has changed in South  Korea. Vicious fascist laws, including the National Security  Law, which is a legal and systematic device for infringing upon  human rights, have existed as they are or have been turned for  the worse. The NSP, the hotbed of human right infringement, has  remained intact.    In addition, the rulers' infringements of human rights are  more prevalent than those of the time of the Fifth and Sixth  Republics. Thus, people cannot breathe to their heart's content.    The so-called civilian regime's color was clearly brought to  light. The people, who have been deceived by the rascals'  ballad of reform, are trying to rise up to struggle against the  rulers. Taken by surprise, traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying once  again to deceive the people and maintain power by means of the  ballad on human rights. It is unreasonable to babble about the  respect of human life in South Korea--a land barren of democracy  and a living hell-- where human rights have been fully trampled  underfoot.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should abrogate and dissolve  the  vicious fascist laws, including the National Security Law, and  the other suppression organizations, including the NSP; should  stop suppressing the people; and should immediately release all  patriotic figures who have been illegally arrested.</p>

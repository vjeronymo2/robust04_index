			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CURFEWS SPAWN BLOODY CLASHES IN BANGLADESH  </P> <P> Gunfire crackled through Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, today as police battled  protesters demanding the ouster of President Hussain Mohammed Ershad and an end  to a state of emergency, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders said 50 people were killed and more than 1,000 others  wounded Wednesday when demonstrators swarmed into the streets in defiance of  curfews in Dhaka and four other cities.  </P> <P> The casualties were reported in written statements circulated in Dhaka that  reached India through unofficial channels. Some previous opposition claims have  been exaggerated, and the latest figures could not be verified.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources in New Delhi said they had reports of four dead and 15  wounded in the Bangladesh capital during clashes with paramilitary forces  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The curfews were imposed Tuesday night as part of a state of emergency Ershad  declared to try to quash the growing movement against him. The decree also  suspended civil rights and imposed press censorship after six weeks of  often-violent protests.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the demonstrations continued today, but they had no word of  casualties.  </P> <P> Kurt Hensena, a businessman based in Hong Kong, said he heard gunfire when he  left his Dhaka hotel for the airport today.  </P> <P> "It was 'bam-bam-bam-bam!' and then it was quiet again. It was shotgun, rifle  fire. I heard a lot of people shouting," Hensena said as he arrived in Bangkok,  Thailand. He did not give his nationality.  </P></p>

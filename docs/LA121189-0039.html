			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLE OVER DEVELOPING WETLANDS IS NEARING END;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: A DEVELOPER WHO SHARES APPRECIATION FOR ECOLOGY OFFERS A SOLUTION  TO PROTRACTED STRUGGLE.  </P> <P> As winter approaches, the great blue herons and snowy egrets return to the  Ballona Wetlands, a quiet refuge for wildlife surrounded by some of the most  intensely developed and valuable real estate in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This tranquil open space between the Westchester Bluffs and Marina del Rey  offers migratory birds a safe harbor from the frenetic urban landscape next  door.  </P> <P> For years, the peacefulness has belied a pitched behind-the-scenes battle  between environmentalists determined to save one of the last remaining wetlands  in Los Angeles County and developers intent on building a massive multi-use  complex known as Playa Vista.  </P> <P> But now, with a new developer, who apparently shares an appreciation for the  environmental significance of the land, an end to the protracted battle over  Ballona Wetlands appears to be at hand.  </P> <P> Although the environmentalists of Friends of Ballona Wetlands and the new  developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, have yet to sign a formal settlement ending  a 5-year-old lawsuit, both sides express confidence that a final agreement will  be reached soon.  </P> <P> "We're getting very close," said Carlyle Hall, attorney for the Friends. "We've  made very substantial progress on most major issues."  </P> <P> Nelson C. Rising, head of the development team for Maguire Thomas, agreed:  "Things are moving along very nicely. It does take time. But the spirit in  which the negotiations are taking place is a very constructive atmosphere."  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the settlement talks is a commitment by Maguire Thomas to  save 270 acres of wetlands for the herons, the egrets, and nearly 200 other  species of birds that call Ballona home at some point each year.  </P> <P> The plans for the wetlands include such public facilities as an $8-million  nature center with trails and exhibits that would be run by the National  Audubon Society.  </P> <P> Until this year, the vast property west of the San Diego Freeway and south of  Marina del Rey had been the province of the Summa Corp., founded by the late  industrialist Howard Hughes.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas purchased the 887-acre site from Summa Corp. in February and  immediately began trying to clear the way for the development of the remaining  600-plus acres of Playa Vista.  </P> <P> The lawsuit by the Friends of Ballona Wetlands has been one of the biggest  impediments to development of Playa Vista. The Los Angeles Superior Court suit  challenged governmental approvals for the Summa project. Uncertainty created by  the suit stopped Summa from moving forward with plans to erect a small city of  high-rise office buildings, as well as commercial and residential structures.  </P> <P> Attorneys and officials of the Friends describe a night-and-day difference in  attitude between Summa and Maguire Thomas.  </P> <P> "They have a very different feel and sensitivity to the environment, the  wetlands and the overall neighborhood," Hall said.  </P> <P> Almost immediately after Maguire Thomas entered the picture, a new team of  planners began work on a revised plan that would eliminate the soaring office  towers, scale back office space to 5 million square feet, reduce the commercial  space and increase the number of residential units to 11,750.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas also began talks with the Friends aimed at settling the wetlands  controversy that had stymied Summa.  </P> <P> After months of negotiations, attorneys told a Superior Court judge last  Tuesday that they are moving toward an agreement. A referee is expected to be  named to mediate the remaining issues.  </P> <P> "The settlement we are talking about is an excellent one in which everyone will  benefit," Hall said. "Everybody is moving in the same direction. It is just a  matter of resolving various points."  </P> <P> Both sides say Maguire Thomas has agreed to save all of the wetland area west  of Lincoln Boulevard from the base of the Westchester Bluffs north to Ballona  Creek. The only exception is a swath of land of about 50 acres west of Lincoln  that lies between Culver and Jefferson boulevards, which will be developed.  </P> <P> The developer will commit $10 million to wetlands restoration.  </P> <P> The National Audubon Society is expected to provide $8 million for the  interpretive center it plans.  </P> <P> "We've been wanting to restore this wetland for a long time," said Glenn Olson,  vice president of the National Audubon Society.  </P> <P> The nature center's exhibits, Olson said, will explain why wetlands "aren't  just mosquito breeding grounds or places for shopping carts to rust."  </P> <P> But before the lawsuit can be settled, Maguire Thomas wants certain assurances,  including a commitment by the 1,500-member Friends organization to support a  consensus plan for development. Rising stressed that "the lawsuit can't be  settled" until all parties agree, and that includes the city and county of Los  Angeles and the California Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas wants the city, county and commission to agree to process and  review all plans, environmental documents and requests for zoning approval as  expeditiously as possible.  </P> <P> The developer also wants to abandon Summa's plans to build an extension of  Falmouth Avenue through the wetlands. Maguire Thomas' desire not to build the  roadway has drawn kudos from the Friends but is the subject of negotiations  with the city and county.  </P> <P> As lawyers and planners debate the future of the wetlands, environmentalists  continue to educate the public about their importance.  </P> <P> On a recent Sunday, Ed Tarvyd, professor of marine biology at Santa Monica  College, told small groups of bird watchers and interested observers that the  Ballona Wetlands are "very, very important to wildlife."  </P> <P> Birds migrating from Alaska to South America along the Pacific Flyway use the  wetlands as a place to stop and feed before moving on. Halibut and northern  anchovy use the side channels of Ballona Creek for breeding -- "a nursery for  offshore fishing," he said.  </P> <P> More than 40% of the wild bird species found in California have been seen at  Ballona, the last remaining saltwater wetland between Malibu and Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Farther down the Ballona Creek levee, Loyola Marymount University biology  instructor Howard Towner had telescopes trained on the egrets and herons.  </P> <P> Towner said the wetlands are home to at least two endangered species of birds  -- the California least tern and Belding's savannah sparrow. Other endangered  species such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons have been seen in the area.  </P> <P> PROTECTED WETLANDS  </P> <P> Alongside the proposed Playa Vista housing, office and commercial development  -- the white area pictured above -- will be about 270 acres of the Ballona  Wetlands for the nearly 200 bird species that live there. The proposed wildlife  area is marked by cross-hatch.  </P></p>

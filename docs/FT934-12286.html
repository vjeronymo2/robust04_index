			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: P&amp;G posts earnings of Dollars 670m PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in first-quarter net earnings, with volume growth and cost cutting outweighing lower prices and unfavourable exchange rate movements. The group reported net earnings of Dollars 670m, or 95 cents a share, on net sales of Dollars 7.56bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 610m, or 86 cents, on sales of Dollars 7.88bn in the same period of last year, excluding special 1992 items. The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street expectations. Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said that 'despite challenging market conditions in many parts of the world, the quarter produced broadly-based volume growth by sector and geography, with good balance between established and new brands. 'Efforts to improve value for consumers are receiving good response, and several new brand initiatives have been productive.' The company said important factors contributing to the rise in earnings were strong unit volume growth in the US and international markets, lower costs that more than offset the impact of lower pricing, and lower interest costs. Unit volume was up 6 per cent, excluding the company's discontinued juice and pulp operations. On a constant exchange rate basis, net earnings would have been up 17 per cent on a year ago. Excluding exchange rate changes and divestitures, sales revenues would have been up 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Leading a German crusade on strategic alliances: The Cartel Office president has jolted the establishment with his attack on Allianz-Dresdner links MR Wolfgang Kartte, the outgoing president of the German Cartel Office, is deeply suspicious of the growing trend towards strategic alliances among international companies. 'Competition is restricted when there is no access for third parties,' he says. Mr Kartte, who is due to retire next June, has a strong personality and has made his mark in the Cartel Office. He recently jolted the German insurance and banking establishments by taking on one of the most powerful financial alliances in Germany. The Cartel Office decided earlier this month that Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, will have to reduce its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank. He says the decision to take on the Allianz-Dresdner links was 'well received' in the insurance world, to which an aide adds that Dresdner Bank was also pleased. If so, Mr Wolfgang Roller, Dresdner's chief executive, is not showing it. It was Mr Roller who agreed with Allianz that the two would not poach on each other's territory, a cosy arrangement the Cartel Office now seeks to undo. If Allianz does not voluntarily drop its direct stake in Dresdner Bank from 22.3 per cent to the 19.1 per cent it held before June of last year - and it is most unlikely to comply - the case will go to court, where it could take more than five years to be decided. Mr Kartte stresses that, although Allianz's additional 3.2 per cent share in Dresdner appears negligible, it is enough to 'effectively control' the bank with the help of an intricate web of crossholdings. But it is Allianz's ability to prevent Dresdner from entering the insurance business which lay at the heart of the Cartel Office's case, he argues, since the result is economically undesirable restricted competition. 'In a strategic alliance one or both of the partners want to assure that the other cannot have an affair with a stranger. But we cartel officials are more for free love,' he quips. The probe into the Allianz stake in Dresdner was made possible because of an amendment to federal cartel law two years ago, which allowed the Cartel Office to launch an investigation even when a company holds less than 25 per cent in another one - provided, however, that it results in 'substantially' reduced competition. By far the most important decision in Mr Kartte's 16-year presidency - prior to the move against Allianz - was the Cartel Office order in 1989 prohibiting Daimler-Benz from taking a majority stake in the MBB aerospace and defence company. The Cartel Office argued that the merger would lead to a market-dominating position for Daimler-Benz and MBB in German defence production. However, the ruling was overturned by Mr Helmut Haussmann, then economics minister, whose decision was final. Mr Kartte says that it was a 'political decision' which he accepted, warning that with it Bonn assumed a 'moral responsibility' for the merger. The active Mr Kartte keeps a watchful eye on 'interrelationships' within the world's leading car manufacturers. No investigation of carmakers is planned for the foreseeable future, Mr Kartte admits, but the Cartel Office has to be 'prepared' if the opportunity arises. The preparations will, no doubt, take into account the lessons learnt by the office during its price collusion case against the international oil companies in the 1970s, which collapsed because most of the evidence was beyond the reach of the Berlin cartel busters. Only last year he was rebuffed by the European Commission for trying to prevent Volkswagen from joining Ford in a 'strategic alliance' to produce vehicles in Portugal. The EC's approach to large mergers and alliances has made his job even more difficult than when he took office in 1976. Undeterred, however, Mr Kartte has proclaimed 'strategic alliances as a challenge to cartel law' as the theme of the international conference on cartels, which he will host next month in Berlin. Although a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party, the outspoken Mr Kartte makes no bones about his misgivings about Bonn's economic policy towards depressed east Germany. He is particularly concerned that the DM180bn (Dollars 109.7bn) in transfers to the east this year will go mainly into consumption, although he pointedly adds that 'politically' it was the only thing that could be done. Similarly, he agrees that while the rescue of east Germany's shipbuilding and chemicals industries made no sense in purely economic terms, 'you cannot give them up without losing the next election'. Mr Kartte's successor, to be named by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, is expected to be Ms Karin Pieper, the low-profile head of the legal department of WDR, West German TV &amp; Radio in Cologne. Meanwhile, the restless cartel chief is utilising his remaining months in office to act as a part-time adviser to the Russian parliament. Commuting to Moscow every few weeks, he is helping the Russians draw up company law while acting as a self-styled 'catalyst' between the Russians and his wide contacts in German industry.</p>

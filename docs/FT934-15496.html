			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Egypt leads call for OAU Somali summit THE United Nations and Egypt, which holds the chair of the Organisation of African Unity, have called for a summit meeting of African leaders next week in an attempt to set in train an 'African solution' for Somalia. Arab diplomats in Cairo said President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, would chair the meeting in Addis Ababa on October 20, which would be attended by Mr Meles Zenawi and Mr Isayas Afewerki, the presidents of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the Egyptian-born UN secretary general who arrives in Cairo this week, is also likely to attend the talks. The Addis summit and a flurry of other Somali-related diplomatic moves in Cairo this week followed US promptings for Egypt, one of its firmest allies in the region, to lead the regional response to the country's plight. Both President Bill Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, have directly appealed in the past few days for an 'African solution' to Somalia. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has been anxious for some time to demonstrate to the US that it can play a regional role far beyond being a privileged interlocutor in the Arab-Israeli peace process. It was unclear yesterday whether invitations to the Addis Ababa talks would also be extended to the various Somali factions. Arab diplomats said, however, that the meeting would aim to determine the structure and composition of a further series of national reconciliation negotiations, likely to be held in Ethiopia by mid-November. Mr Boutros Ghali is set to arrive in Cairo on Thursday to meet Mr Mubarak and discuss the proposed negotiations. He will also meet senior representatives of the OAU, the Arab League and the Islamic Conference Organisation. Mr James Jonah, the UN special envoy, last night met last night Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, in preparation for Thursday's meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Ajanovski: "What Is Athens Afraid of?"] </F>   [Text] The situation in Macedonian-Greek relations has been  at a stand-still for some time now, and both sides are going on  with their mutual accusations about unpreparedness to solve the  disputed questions. In the light of the great importance that  these relations have for the wider stability in the region, the  West is continually insisting on a speedier solution of the  disputes and on normal cooperation. In doing that, one must bear  in mind that Greece, as the farthest part of the European Union,  has a special role in this region in assisting and facilitating  the Macedonian options for approaching Europe. Without the  establishment of more stable communications between the two  states, it is impossible to make any attempts at a further  process of Balkan consolidation.    Totally aware of the importance of such a cooperation,  Macedonia never misses the opportunity of expressing its  readiness for a mutual dialogue with Athens. It believes there  are no problems that cannot be solved if there is good will, and  that the best and most efficient way, tested and affirmed in  international practice, is to sit at a negotiating table and  review all the disputable questions between the two states,  without any prejudices.    The greater number of the hitherto Macedonian initiatives  have, unfortunately, remained without an answer from Athens. The  Greek side, hesitating and laden with various nationalist  prejudices, is simply exhausted when looking for excuses; thus,  it is conditioning the dialogue with unilateral requests that,  from the aspect of international relations, are totally  groundless and unjustified, and their treatment depends on the  will and readiness of both sides. Those requests are imposed by  the internal political and propaganda needs of Greece for which  the Papandreu government tried to urge European support, but in  their essence they can only be solved with the agreement of the  two states.    The Athens government is not ready to face that fact,  although it has become perfectly clear that it does not have any  other choice. At this moment, the most bitter problem of the  ruling Greek group is making that known to its own people.    The requests made hitherto by Greece also prove it to be  true. Once it requested the rejection of the name Macedonia,  then it suggested prefixes to that name (the Greek propaganda  itself has prepared a whole list of proposals: Vardar, North,  Central-Balkan, Slav, New Macedonia and so on), now it mentions  the state symbols, the borders, the Macedonian Constitution. All  this discrepancy and uncertainty in the Greek policy has a  common characteristic: fear or shame to admit an unavoidable  fact! To admit something it has ignored for decades, something  it presented as a nonexistent and manufactured question, as an  artificial state, a manufactured state, a manufactured language,  a fabricated history and culture. However, it is aware that  admitting these facts will mean uncovering other questions that  it has been hiding.    The method of unilateral conditions and dictates, as a bad  excuse for postponing dialogue and for blaming the "unyielding  Skopje" and the "stubborn Gligorov," has evidently become stale  and counterproductive. There are few in the world who can  believe in such cheap tricks. The reputation of Greek policy has  been devaluated to such an extent that even its closest allies  are worried and placed in an awkward position. Their efforts to  place Athenian foreign policy on normal European tracks are not  hidden. It did not pass the first test in the dispute with  Macedonia: the test of democracy!    The Macedonian policy, nevertheless, believes in a positive  outcome. It firmly believes that Athens will become more  realistic and gather enough strength to overcome the passions.  However, one must not forget that the Macedonian leadership has  also not been spared from various internal pressures and  resistances. The strength of a policy is assessed by the  realization of great goals, by the main and the real interests  of the people. No one can ask anybody to be nationally  humiliated and betrayed, and nobody has the right to keep  nations in conflict and without mutual respect and  understanding. The hitherto policy of the two states, aside from  spreading mutual mistrust and hostility, has not produced  anything good for either state. Sincere and overall cooperation  between them will, in any case, be of greater value not only for  the two states, but it will also demonstrate that the Balkans  are fed up with divisions.    In order to achieve all this, discussions are necessary.  Without mutual disdain, without conditions from a position of  power. History does not recall any dispute solved without mutual  compromises. The other alternative is violence: The stronger  wins the dispute. However, that is the philosophy of war.  Macedonia has had too many experiences with such justice  throughout its history. For the first time now, as a member of  the United Nations, it is in a position to conduct equal  negotiations and decide on its own destiny. This is the only  status it can have in the dispute with Greece.    The moment that they sit at a negotiating table will reveal  who is more ready for negotiations, for a successful solution of  the disputes, for the possibilities of mutual compromise and  concessions. In a direct dialogue, it will not be enough only to  deliver personal requests, but discussion of the requests and  remarks of the other side will also be needed. The terminology  of the United Nations and International Law states: dialogue  between equal partners.    Certainly, the problems that have piled up over decades will  not be solved overnight. Nevertheless, the basic thing is that  both sides start negotiations with the wish for success, in  order to realize principles of mutual confidence that will  establish a climate conducive to results.    Then the problems regarding the symbols, the flag, the  borders, and the Constitution will be treated adequately, as  will, for instance, the question about various discriminatory  laws toward Macedonia and the Macedonians that are still valid  with our southern neighbor, and that represent an anachronism in  modern international law, such as the problems of human rights  and liberties in which lie the framework are minority rights,  the property rights of its one- time citizens of Macedonian  origin, the bans they are exposecd to when they try to visit  their birthplaces, the destruction of historical and cultural  monuments of non-Hellenistic character, whose protection and  maintainance have been proclaimed in UN acts.    These are, briefly, only some of the disputed questions  between the two states that require solutions, and today or  tomorrow, the governments of Macedonia and Greece will have to  sit down and agree if they wish to establish modern, civilized,  democratic solutions to their mutual relations, or, to be more  precise: if they want to enter modern-day Europe.    Macedonia has chosen that road and it believes it is the  right one. It expects support from Greece and wants to have  friendly relations with it. It is ready for a dialogue on an  equal footing. Perhaps athens will reply tomorrow. Let us hope  it will be a positive reply.</p>

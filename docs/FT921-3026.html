			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Technology: Game of cards - Link keeps IT close to its chest A team of tired volunteers with plastic cards in their hands ventured out into UK high streets in the small hours of a winter's morning in 1987. At 5am they took up their positions at cashpoint machines throughout the country and prepared to take out cash. At the headquarters of Link, the cashpoint company that unites 34 banks and building societies, operators watched their screens for the first test transactions, which would signal the addition of Co-operative Bank to the network. But things did not go according to plan. Seconds before the first transaction was due, an early-rising member of the public, keen to try out his new card, beat the official swipers to the draw. 'We were surprised and pleased,' says Trevor Jenkins, general manager of technology at Link Interchange Network. 'It's good to be that much in demand.' Since the Link network started in 1986 with four main members and 14 smaller ones, it has grown rapidly. A stream of banks and building societies joining the network has taken the total of automated teller machines (ATMs) to more than 5,500, boosted in 1989 by a merger with Matrix, a rival UK network. Last year, despite the recession, Link handled about 45 per cent more transactions than in 1990. Such rapid growth has forced Link to reconsider the computer and telecommunications technology that underpins its business. When the network started, Link brought in British Telecommunications to run the technical side. 'At the time it was the right choice to help us set up the network,' says Jenkins. But five years later, Link came of age. Last summer, in a move that bucked the trend for companies to contract out their computing to facilities management (FM) suppliers, Link brought the whole operation in-house at a cost of Pounds 7.5m. It moved its headquarters and the hub of the network away from BT in London to a new centre in Harrogate, West Yorkshire and installed the lastest computer hardware from Tandem, the US supplier of fault-tolerant computers. At the same time it set up a duplicate site in Leeds for disaster recovery and established a new telecommunications infrastructure between Link and its members, many of whom are also in Yorkshire. It recruited 20 staff to run the system. First among its reasons was the fundamental role of technology in Link's business. Being non-profit making, Link has no ATMs of its own. But it connects those of its members through a central electronic switch. This allows Abbey National card holders, for example, to withdraw cash from a Nationwide ATM, or a Girobank account holder to get a bank balance from a Leeds Permanent machine. Up to 40 transactions a second cross between the institutions through Link's central computer running a software package called Connex from Deluxe Data Systems of the US. 'This switch is our core business,' says Jenkins. 'We only have this one application. Our whole reason for being here is to do ATM switching.' Bringing control in house has simplified matters and shortened the chains of command. Link computer operators now talk directly to their counterparts at all the Link institutions. They also deal directly with the hardware and software suppliers which used to be subcontractors to BT. 'We had a very close relationship with BT in the early days,' says Jenkins. 'Then the relationship became more formal and we were finding ourselves more remote from what was happening. As you go on, contracts tend to become more formalised, less flexible and it's more difficult to introduce changes.' Link calculates that it is running the switch more cheaply than BT did. The move in house was conceived as a five-year project and Link expects it will have more than recouped its investment at the end of that time. Later this year it plans to cut by one or two pence the fee that its members pay each time a transaction goes through the switch. Link board, comprising 23 representatives from the member institutions, voted to bring the computing in house. But before this Link was already considering setting up a second switch to use in the event of a disaster at the first. 'Our service has become critical to the institutions and we were under more and more pressure to provide disaster recovery,' says Jenkins. Disaster recovery is an expensive form of insurance which involves duplicating the entire network - all the hardware, software and telecommunications links. One way of lessening the cost is to share disaster recovery with other companies on the basis that only one company is likely to have a disaster at a time. Link considered sharing disaster recovery with other BT clients. 'It turned out that BT couldn't offer that,' recalls Jenkins. 'They didn't have anything to share, so they were looking at setting up a second site for us. But we realised the costs were going to be much the same whether we did it or BT did it. And then our thinking moved on - if we were going to set up a disaster site, then perhaps we could run the primary system ourselves as well.' Now with two sites of its own, and one of them used only for testing and development, Link is itself considering offering a disaster recovery service to other companies. But this is long term. In the meantime it wants to stretch the Harrogate centre to its full potential. The new Tandem Cyclone hardware installed there more than doubles the power previously available. The Cyclone took over the network from BT for two short tests last July. The third test in August was so successful that Link decided not to hand the network back. 'The most dangerous part was actually transferring the system from one site to the other - so, as everything was working well, it made sense to keep the system,' says Jenkins. Link is now looking at connections with European cashpoints. It already has a gateway into Plus System, a big North American network. There is also room left for growth in the UK, says Jenkins. Link wants more people to use their cards in machines that do not belong to their own bank or building society. The range of services could also be enlarged. At present, Link is the only UK operator whose ATMs offer balance inquiries across a network of institutions. Other services such as statement ordering and being able to change a personal identification number are already offered by some individual Link members in their private networks but are not carried across Link's switch. Long-term, the Link network could be used for far more than connecting cashpoints. In theory it could pass any kind of electronic information between Link's member banks. The institutions already use similar electronic networks for direct debiting and clearing cheques, but Link has its eye on other possible applications including the transmission of structured documents from member to member using electronic data interchange. 'There's the potential for us to do that,' says Jenkins. 'But first we have to find some data to exchange.'</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (4): Utopias of yesterday  -The London Ring EVERY year, a class of 13-year-olds is thrown into confusion by the task set by a teacher in a smallish town north of London. 'Find out when and why we were once the centre of world attention,' she says. A few will always scramble through sports encyclopedias. Did the local football team once beat the European champions? Others comb the newspaper libraries to suggest some forgotten accident or royal visit. The shrewd ones ask their parents. Almost 50 years ago Stevenage was designated as Utopia. Enlightened land owners had been creating 'new' towns for centuries. In fact, two garden cities were already established at Welwyn and Letchworth a few miles each side of the site off the the A1 chosen for Stevenage. But this was the first government-inspired bid to create a new way of life. Sam (later Lord) Silkin, the 'father' of post-war town planning, faced a similar audience to that teacher, but raised laughter rather than bemusement when he announced in the Commons: 'Stevenage will in a short time become world famous. People from all over the world will come to see how we are building a new way of life.' But he was right. It dominated attention, if only because of anti-development passions as strong as anything seen today over plans to build on the green belt. Then Crawley, a little Sussex town of 5,000 people, designated next on the list took over the limelight, inspiring one angry protester to insist that 50,000 new people would spoil his enjoyment of sea breezes. The site is 25 miles from the coast. To a 13-year-old there is little 'new' in the ring of towns created in the late-1940s to rehouse bomb-battered and slum-debilitated Londoners. In fact it is only older residents and outsiders who still use the title. Development corporations have disappeared, leaving only the Commission for New Towns (CNT) to sell off remaining assets. District councils have taken over the reins again, and new towns have merged with local economies. But most still perform the same function as when they were born, offering people and businesses an escape from the congested metropolis. Some, such as Bracknell, have attracted companies from even further afield. It is now a fully-fledged international office centre, boasting companies like ICI and BMW. More than 30 acres have just been acquired by 3M for a new headquarters. The very fact that these communities are now merged into their surroundings, however, means that not everything is rosy. Like the rest of the south-east they are weighed down with empty buildings and unemployment. But the burden is generally lighter than many older neighbours'. 'They all have modern infrastructure and good locations, which has attracted offices. But the workforce drawn out of London also drew a lot of industrial businesses,' says Stephen Mallen of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley Research. That has produced not only a wide economic base, but one more resistant to the service-sector recession which has hammered major office centres. Basildon, where the original small town has been quadrupled to more than 100,000, looks to Tilbury Docks and Ford Motors. Northern Telecom had enough confidence to pay CNT almost Pounds 4m for its freehold in the Pipps Hill Industrial Area this year, while Colour Court Properties spent slightly less on the former Carreras Rothman playing fields at Nevendon, and Wilcon Homes laid out more than Pounds 3m for land at Dunton Hills. The commission is down to its last major town centre site, although it has large amounts of land to develop. Crawley grew from bare fields to almost 56,000 people, many of whom draw a living from nearby Gatwick Airport and its massive warehousing developments. A pension fund has recently invested more than Pounds 9m buying half the Martlets shopping centre. Harlow, another greenfield development now boasting a population of more than 72,000, also has an airport, Stansted, on the doorstep. But it has seen a significant office expansion as well by General Portfolio over the last year. 'This is significant because it shows that new towns can hang on to firms which may have been attracted by grants or other incentives,' says Mr Mallen. Hatfield is one of the smaller centres, with only around 25,000 inhabitants. Until last week, its long-standing ties with British Aerospace had provided a solid base. This has now been shattered by BAe's decision to close its plant there with the loss of 2,000 jobs. There are also long faces over the huge Galleria shopping centre, which seems to have failed because it aimed too far up market for the local people. Hemel Hempstead (pop. 77,000) - technically an expanded rather than a new town - and Stevenage (pop 76,000) both have strong industrial bases liberally scattered with electronics and other new technology which have helped ease the pain of recession. Sovereign Land bought shops and flats in central Hemel for Pounds 7m and Burford Group paid CNT more than Pounds 2m. Welwyn (pop 40,000), the last of the London ring, could claim to qualify as the first, as it was a new town long before the others were even thought about. It was set up by the movement's pioneer, Ebenezer Howard, in the 1920s, and therefore has a solid industrial base as well as pleasant surroundings. At the other extreme, almost touching the Midlands, stands Milton Keynes, which came along 20 years after the ring was formed and proved the last UK new town. In fact, it is more a city, with more than 150,000 people. Numbers are still growing, with an influx of more than 2,500 last year drawn by a broad economic base which has helped ease the pain of recession by keeping unemployment almost two points below the national 9.5 per cent. The private sector has taken this giant baby to its heart, investing almost Pounds 365m last year. Of the Pounds 3.2bn spent since this 'third generation' new town was set up in 1967, some Pounds 2.6bn has come from private investors. The aim is to create another 35,000 jobs and raise the population above 200,000. Transfer to the NTC this year (discussed in the Midlands article on the facing page) has also opened a new chapter for the commission, as it works through the final stages of selling off the remaining assets.</p>

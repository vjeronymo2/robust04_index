			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / S African leaders consider new offer on peace process A COMMONWEALTH offer to send a team of experts to help monitor violence and facilitate the peace process is being considered by South Africa's political leaders. The initiative comes amid growing tension over the weekend as Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, again angrily rejected President FW de Klerk's offer of a meeting. Further details also emerged of ANC plans for 'mass action' designed to make the government capitulate to demands for majority rule. The Commonwealth initiative was set in train during the visit to South Africa last week by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general, in the course of talks with Mr de Klerk, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, and Mr Mandela. It envisages a group of eminent Commonwealth figures, backed by a small number of senior military and police advisers, helping to reinforce the country's existing National Peace Accord, assist in any new measures designed to curb violence, while also having a potential role as intermediaries. The NPA, signed last September by 29 organisations including the government, ANC and Inkatha, already offers a framework for the resolution of political violence - provided it is backed by the political will, hitherto lacking. Among other measures, it provides for a network of regional and local 'dispute resolution committees' with which a Commonwealth team could liaise. Chief Anyaoku has been in contact with the NPA secretary, Mr John Hall. The initiative also seizes on an apparent opening contained in Mr de Klerk's memorandum to Mr Mandela last Thursday, a reponse to the ANC leader's own document explaining why constitutional talks had been suspended. Mr de Klerk suggested a meeting at which the agenda would include 'the advisability of a joint monitoring body through which the three parties could act to defuse and solve problems that could give rise to violence'. In what is seen by western diplomats as a key sentence, the memorandum went on: 'The role of the international community in an observer capacity could be considered, especially in relation to this item.' South Africa's leaders are now studying a document outlining the Commonwealth proposal, which Chief Anyaoku discussed with Commonwealth ambassadors on Friday. Diplomats who attended the briefing confirmed that a Commonwealth effort to break South Africa's political deadlock was under way, but were cautious about prospects for success. Chief Anyaoku said on his departure for Nairobi from Johannesburg yesterday that 'stalled negotiations need to be reactivated in an appropriate way and the stumbling blocks addressed quickly by all concerned', but did not elaborate.</p>

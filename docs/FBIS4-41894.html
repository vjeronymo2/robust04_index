			<p>BFN     [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the  Federation Council, said at a news conference today that none of  the 37 points of the government plan to eliminate the  consequences of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict have been  implemented. He noted that the necessary financial assistance  for Ingushetia and North Ossetia have not yet been received by  the warring parties. Not a single refugee has been able to  return back home. At the same time, Abdulatipov said that  according to the results of criminal investigations, up to 1,000  criminal cases have been lodged in the conflict zone. He  believes that Russia's uncertain policy toward Chechnya, as well  as the absence of any coherent concept with regard to the north  Caucasian region, plays a destabilizing role in the north  Caucasus. The deputy chairman of the Federation Council intends  to appeal to Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of government, to  accelerate the settlement of the problems stemming from the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict.</p>

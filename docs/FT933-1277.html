			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg to dispose of Munksjo stake TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday said it intended to sell a 70 to 75 per cent stake in its Munksjo paper and packaging unit via a stock market listing. The disposal is in line with the group's strategy to cut its debts by SKr3bn (Dollars 369m) over 12 months and to focus activities on its mining, metals and rubber operations. Analysts have valued Munksjo, which has annual sales of SKr3bn and is profitable, at between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn. The sale is part of a broader drive to strengthen the group's financial position, which has been squeezed by falling metals prices. It has announced a SKr1.1bn rights issue and plans to sell its remaining shares in Svedela, the mineral processing and transport unit. In the first half the group incurred a SKr796m loss after financial items. Munksjo has six main divisions, comprising hygiene products, packaging, speciality papers, envelopes, valves, and pulp. Trelleborg has effectively been seeking a buyer for the unit since the end of 1991, when it was first consolidated into the company's accounts, but the slump in the worldwide pulp and paper market has made it a difficult task. Trelleborg has net debts of about SKr10bn and has already sold assets worth SKr1.4bn this year. Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday agreed to buy a group of companies within the Teli industrial unit of Telia, the Swedish state-owned telecommunications operator. Ericsson will supply an AXE switching system worth more than SKr1bn to Telia as part of the accord. Ericsson said the acquisition would give it additional technical expertise, new products, increased volumes and a greater production capacity in Sweden.</p>

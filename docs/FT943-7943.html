			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie retreats after piercing the 3,200 mark - Market report The FT-SE 100 Index successfully launched its expected attack on the 3,200 level, but it was hard won and quickly lost as the UK equity market succumbed to repeated bouts of selling pressure in international bond markets after disappointing economic news from the US. The US news - in the form of a higher than forecast US international trade deficit and worrying news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, which published its August inflation index - caused a sharp downturn on Wall Street shortly after the US market had opened. The American data came hard on the heels of news that the Bundesbank council had signalled no change in German interest rates. At the close the FT-SE 100 was 7.7 down at 3,182.6, around two points off the day's low. The FT-SE Mid 250, however, gave a more resolute performance, closing only 1.3 easier at 3,740.4, thanks to some sustained institutional support for the second-line stocks, which tended to get left behind the leaders' upsurge on Wednesday. Earlier, the equity market had shrugged off a poor start and pierced the 3,200 mark on the Footsie following yet more encouraging pointers on the domestic economy. This included a lower than expected rise in the broad money supply - up 4.8 per cent year-on-year against most forecasts of around 5.5 per cent - and a marginally higher than forecast increase in retail sales in July. A 0.4 per cent rise in sales came against market expectations of around 0.3 per cent. Dealers said the latest data put the seal on a week of all-round excellent news on the domestic economy and had headed off any lingering fears of an early rise in UK interest rates. On Wednesday the market raced ahead in the wake of a much better than expected decline in the July inflation rate. The market opened modestly easier, with most instititutions holding off ahead of the Bundesbank meeting. The FT-SE 100 was some three points adrift of its overnight level, but was never under real selling pressure and was back in positive territory within an hour of the opening. Early pressure was exerted by a big seller of the Footsie future, but a measure of the market's resilience was that a brief decline to around the 3,189 level on the future triggered a powerful burst of support which kept the contract above the so-called resistance level of 3,194 for the rest of the session. At its best, shortly after midday, the Footsie was up more than 11 points and seemingly set fair, with market optimists still hopeful of a cut in German interest rates. These hopes were fuelled throughout the morning by news that German money supply in July had risen by 9.9 per cent fromn the previous year, well down from the 11.4 per cent figure for June. The absence of a German rate cut was the signal for a sharp decline in bonds across the world, with UK gilts, around  1/4 higher shortly after the opening, subsequently retreating to close with losses of around 3/4 at the long end. Equities moved down along with gilts, with the weak opening on Wall Street producing more downside pressure on the market. Marketmakers were by no means disheartened by the London market's performance. 'We still feel okay, but all eyes are still firmly fixed on bonds,' said one senior trader. He emphasised that most marketmakers were trying to avoid taking big book positions in such volatile markets. 'You only have to look at the big movers to see where the marketmakers have been caught out.' Turnover of 674m shares was regarded as slightly disappointing and well down from Wednesday's 771.9m, which represented customer business worth Pounds 1.63bn.</p>

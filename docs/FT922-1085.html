			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Clouds over open skies: Air transport liberalisation in Europe Hopes were high yesterday that the European Community's agreement on 'open skies' would lead to a sharp reduction in the cost of European air travel. But such expectations are likely to remain grounded for some time to come. 'I'm not pretending everything will be fine from January 1993,' Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, said yesterday, mindful of the euphoria which greeted two previous airline deregulation packages, in 1987 and 1990. Both failed to drive down fares more than marginally. And even though the latest package will introduce greater competition and create some new opportunities to increase consumer choice and services, the financial problems of airlines combined with the high cost of operating air services in Europe are expected to keep the pressure on fares. In theory, at least, European airlines will be free to set their own fares from the beginning of next year. They will also be free to fly between any EC country. They will operate under a single EC air licence and from April 1997 they will be free to run domestic services in other member state. The package - the most far-reaching in the EC's gradual process of air liberalisation - is designed to encourage greater competition and bring down European air fares. On average, these are still at least a third higher than in the US. In practice, the notion that deregulation will send fares crashing in Europe could not be more misleading. European airlines are operating under the most difficult financial conditions since the second world war. 'You only have to look at the financial results of airlines to see they cannot afford to cut fares,' commented Mr John Parr, director-general of the Air Transport Users Committee, the UK consumer pressure group. The combined losses of European airlines last year of Dollars 1.3bn were greater than their combined profits over the past 10 years. Airline traffic has yet to show a sustained recovery following the slump caused by the Gulf crisis and the recession. Established carriers and potential entrants alike are unlikely to rush to open new routes in a European market burdened by increasingly heavy navigational and airport take-off and landing charges. European airlines estimate the start-up costs of a new route in Europe at between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m. While trying to generate more competition with its latest package, the Commission risks putting further pressure on European air fares by its separate proposal to introduce value-added tax on European airline tickets. The European airline industry claims that the proposed 9 per cent VAT on tickets would add about Dollars 1bn on airline costs alone. The eventual abolition of intra-European duty-free sales and the proposed introduction of a 3 per cent carbon tax will all eventually add expenses, thus reducing the possibility of large fare reductions. A bigger and more immediate problem is Europe's inadequate airport and air traffic control infrastructure. Although European countries are finally attempting to harmonise and co-ordinate the modernisation of their different air traffic control systems, this is likely to take several years, with the risk of increasing congestion in the air preventing airlines from exercising their new freedoms. Despite last year's air travel slump, delays to European airline services because of infrastructure problems increased by 13 per cent, according to the Association of European Airlines. Congestion at such busy airports as Heathrow or Frankfurt could also squeeze out new entrants because of the lack of available take-off and landing slots. At the same time, airlines with a dominant position will have an important competitive advantage. The EC has so far left out of its liberalisation package new regulations to allocate slots at congested airports to ensure fair competition and access to all airlines. The Commission had wanted to pool underused or vacant landing and take-off slots at main airports so that at least they would be redistributed to entrants. This provoked fierce opposition from established airlines. But Mr Van Miert said he was encouraged by UK assurances that it would address this issue as a priority during its presidency of the EC. Apart from these structural problems, the success of liberalisation and its eventual impact on air fares will ultimately rest on the goodwill of EC member states. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, the UK carrier, warned yesterday that in the next few weeks, 'we are likely to see further attempts by some countries to slow down the liberalisation process'. Sir Michael said the experience of US deregulation suggested that competition came from the ability of new airlines to secure access to routes and airport facilities, and not simply by the removal of existing restrictions. He argued that many routes in Europe continued to be dominated by state-owned airlines with little incentive to compete. He also claimed that the only routes in Europe which had so far benefited from liberalisation were those such as Heathrow to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, where a third carrier has been able to compete against the respective national carriers. 'On routes where there is now only limited, or 'organised', competition - like Brussels to Rome - there can now be greater competition,' Mr Van Miert said, adding that carriers such as British Midland now 'have real additional opportunities to expand their business in Europe'. Sir Michael has claimed that business travellers pay up to 25 per cent too much for their air fares on many European routes because of insufficient choice. The EC package itself was the result of a compromise between ardent supporters of liberalisation such as the UK and the Netherlands and other less enthusiastic countries like France, Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain. While removing price controls and creating opportunities to fly in other member countries, the package also contains what the EC describes as 'safeguards' which could ultimately undermine liberalisation. These apply both to air fares and to European domestic air services. Although, under the package, airlines will be able to set fares on intra-EC flights, governments will still be able to intervene if they consider fares either unreasonably high or low. It will then be up to the other government to appeal to the Commission to overrule the decision. In some respects, the system could turn out to be more restrictive than the current 'double disapproval system', whereby an air fare can only be refused if both countries at either end of a route object to it. Under the new scheme, much will depend on the speed of the EC arbitration process in the event of one country deciding to veto a fare. 'At least under the 'double disapproval' system a member state was not able to disapprove a fare unilaterally as will now be the case,' a UK airline executive remarked. The package has also introduced certain so-called safeguards on the issue of open market access. Individual governments will continue to control aviation within their own territories and much will thus depend on their attitude to entrants in their markets. Some countries are clearly expected to adopt a more restrictive attitude to competition in their domestic market than others. As Lord King, British Airways chairman, said with heavy irony yesterday: 'I think the other European airlines will seek to protect their own patch. I think Great Britain, oddly enough, will probably try to play by the rules, and I admire the way the French play by theirs.' EC transport ministers also agreed on a transition period of four years and three months before allowing airlines to operate domestic services in another member state. Although airlines will be able next year to fly to a second destination in another country (a British carrier could fly from London to Paris and then on to Nice), they will only be allowed to fill a maximum of half their seats in a foreign stopover until 1997. This is expected to make it more costly for airlines to open such stopover routes especially since most travellers prefer direct flights. However, as of next year airlines will be able to fly between two other countries without starting or ending in their home state. The transition period is also expected to give national carriers more time to consolidate their own domestic and international market position before full liberalisation. All the big airlines have been scrambling to forge partnerships and have sought equity investments in other carriers to strengthen their base before deregulation. Air France has acquired a stake in Sabena of Belgium as well as absorbing the French carriers Air Inter and UTA: Lufthansa is looking at investing in smaller European carriers like, among others, Lauda Air of Austria. BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines are expected to resume merger negotiations later this year. The big carriers have argued that consolidation of the airline industry was necessary if Europe was to compete against large US and Far Eastern carriers in an increasingly global airline market. But this trend could also undermine competition in a liberalised European market by squeezing out entrants or forcing them to ally themselves with one or other of the large airline groups. The fact that most large European carriers are state-owned is expected to complicate further the liberalisation process. Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) said yesterday it hoped clear rules would be established on the permitted extent of state support for EC airlines to prevent them from cutting fares artificially to drive out competitors and subsequently raising them. But the package has at least provided the legislative framework to encourage the development of a multi-airline industry in Europe with greater competition and eventually lower fares. However, as Sir Michael Bishop warned: 'There is still a long way to go before European consumers can enjoy the practical benefits of highly competitive, low cost air travel, and we should not underestimate the difficulties of implementing the package.'</p>

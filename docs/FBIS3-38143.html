Yesterday the police had to discontinue the search  for the wreck of a crashed Cessna aircraft because of a storm.    Josef R. (54) and Klaus E. (54), nuclear dealers from  Berlin,  were on board the aircraft. In October they bought 70 kg of  cesium from the Russian mafia in Riga. They agreed on a price  of 2 million German marks.    Since they did not pay, the mafia took Josef R. hostage. The  German Embassy in Moscow asked the Russian police for help.  After 26 days, Josef R. was freed from prison.    Shortly afterward, the nuclear smugglers took the cesium to  Prague. According to police investigations, Klaus Peter N. (48)  from Berlin, former lieutenant colonel of the GDR criminal  investigation department and Mielke's confidant, organized the  deal. Since Monday night he has been detained and he is being  interrogated.    On Monday, Pilot Rudolf W. (44) from Cologne flew from  Hannover to Prague. There the two nuclear smugglers from Berlin  went on board with two young Czech women. They headed for the  West. According to the tower of Friedrichshafen Airport, the  radio contact broke off at 1912. A little later, the Cessna  presumably crashed into Lake Constance. Marlis R. (39), the  pilot's companion in life, said: "The flight was first bound for  Switzerland and then for Paris. The two businessmen had a date  there -- in a laboratory, as my boy-friend said."    Question: Did the smugglers want to have the cesium examined  there by an expert? Were the customers waiting there?    The causes of the crash are still unclear. However, the  police think that an act of revenge by the Russian mafia is  possible. It had threatened the Berliners: "You will not live  long."    The search for the wreck with the radioactive cargo will be  continued today.</p>

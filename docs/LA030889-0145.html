			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REPORT CITES ILLS AT REST HOMES  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office told Congress, in a report released today, that  states have found problems ranging from physical and sexual abuse to improperly  stored food and trash at rest homes and similar residential facilities for the  elderly and mentally ill.  </P> <P> It reported on the board-and-care homes, which are residences of last resort  for many aged and mentally ill people. "It is frightening how little we know  about board-and-care homes," said Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), ranking Republican  on the Senate Special Committee on Aging. "This is an industry out of sight and  out of control."  </P></p>

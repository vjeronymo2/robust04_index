			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Turkey's Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin  has called upon Germany to issue a "clear and unconditional no  to terrorism." Cetin told DPA in Ankara on Friday [8 April]  that he has no doubt that accusations saying that German arms  are used in internal conflicts against Kurdish extremists,  against the rules of bilateral and NATO agreements, will prove  false.    Turkey is facing "separatist terrorism by the Workers Party  of Kurdistan [PKK]." Turkey must, therefore, be allowed "to  defend itself with the means of a democratic constitutional  state." PKK terrorism must not be regarded as a fight for  freedom by the Kurds, the Social Democratic foreign minister of  Kurdish descent said.    According to the semi-official news agency ANADOLU, the  parliamentary state secretary in the Federal Interior Ministry,  Eduard Lintner, said at a German-Turkish symposium in Istanbul  on Friday that the suspension of German arms supplies is mainly  due to "aggressive television programs" directed against Turkey.    According to Anadolu, Lintner said: "Some leftist groups are  out of work now that South Africa is no longer a topic, and now  they are concentrating on Turkey." According to the ANADOLU  report, Lintner went on to say that Germany is the country where  the PKK is most active outside Turkey. This has created the  impression that the Kurds are those that are "oppressed" and the  Turks are the "oppressors." It is, therefore, necessary to tell  the German public the truth, Lintner said, according to ANADOLU.</p>

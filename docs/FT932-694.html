			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Club Med slips to FFr2m after six months CLUB Mediterranee, the French holiday group, suffered a sharp decline in attributable net profits, to FFr2m (Dollars 350,000) in the six months to April, from FFr20m a year ago, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The group, which blamed its poor performance on the 'bad economic environment', would have suffered an even steeper setback but for an accounting change which raised net profits before minorities by FFr46m. The US business improved in the first half of this year, but the group was hit by difficulties in Egypt and Senegal.</p>

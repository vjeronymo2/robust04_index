			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Israel to seek EC law on Arab boycott of companies ISRAEL is expected today to ask Brussels to extend the anti-Arab-boycott legislation that already exists in two EC states to Community level. The expected request by Mr David Levy, the Israeli foreign minister, to a formal EC-Israel meeting here coincides with growing interest in the Community, as well as the US, in at least an easing of the Arab boycott of companies trading with Israel as a confidence-building measure to boost Middle East peace efforts. On Saturday, several EC foreign ministers urged the six Gulf Co-operation Council members to use their influence within the Arab League for an easing of the boycott. The latter said this was only conceivable in the context of an Arab-Israeli peace deal. France and the Netherlands have national laws forbidding their companies to give the Arab Boycott Office formal undertakings they will not trade with Israel. The Israeli government wants such legislation adopted by the EC as a whole, arguing, among other points, that general Arab incitement creates commercial distortion. Germany and Denmark now sympathise with the Israeli view, but most other EC states want to wait and see how Israel responds to peace overtures and prefer to exert quiet political pressure on the Arabs.</p>

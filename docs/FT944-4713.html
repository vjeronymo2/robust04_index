			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Working in Europe It is regrettable that the UK employment minister, Mr Michael Portillo, opted for a display of anti-Brussels theatrics at yesterday's meeting of European Union social affairs ministers in Brussels. The UK government's suspicion of the old-style EU social agenda was usually justifiable. But much of the debate in Europe has now moved on. Mr Portillo would make a more valuable contribution to EU employment policy if he moved with it. Britain had been widely expected to block the two directives debated yesterday, one enforcing equal rights for part-time workers, the other proposing equal treatment of workers posted to other countries. In the event, Mr Portillo only needed to veto the first, since the other requires redrafting, but this is unlikely to change the UK's position. Both directives represent the last gasps of the aggressive social action programme drawn up five years ago by the then European commissioner for social affairs, Ms Vasso Papandreou. It was that long list of measures that led the UK to argue for the right to 'opt out' of the social chapter of the 1991 Maastricht treaty, and Mr Portillo could justifiably use many of the UK's traditional arguments for exercising a veto. Mr Portillo viewed the other talking point of the meeting, a further set of German-sponsored proposals, as a sign of more to come. But these are the fruit of a visibly softened attitude to employment legislation in Brussels. Mr Portillo ought to question whether the UK's past objections still have the same force. Subsidiarity Traditionally, the UK's opposition rested on three planks. The first was a principled objection, on grounds of subsidiarity, to European legislation which went beyond the broadly uncontroversial desire to secure a basic framework of rights for all EU workers, and enhance labour mobility within the single market. A second, and in many cases, underlying objection was more substantive: the Continental quasi-corporatist model of employment policy implicit in several directives was at odds with the deregulatory emphasis of Conservative policy in this area. Finally, and with some justification, British ministers would accuse fellow European ministers of using EU social policy proposals to pursue essentially domestic political ends. Politicking There was certainly a fair amount of domestic politicking behind yesterday's discussions. German part-time workers already enjoy most of the rights included in the directive. The German government's enthusiasm yesterday for pressing ahead with the legislation owes much to a desire to trumpet the virtues of part-time work at home. Similarly, France was backing the posted-workers directive strongly, since it has just passed similar legislation at home, and wishes to avoid a legal proceeding against it on competition grounds. Mr Portillo was not averse yesterday to winning some domestic political points of his own by opposing Germany's further policy suggestions. In truth, however, the longstanding German wish-list - for EU-wide worker protection against unfair dismissal, for example - is tame by comparison with the early Delors agenda. Both the principle and the substance of the European Commission's thinking on social policy has changed substantially over the past two years. The UK ought to work to influence the new model of employment policy that is currently being forged, helping to tilt it further towards job creation and towards allowing scope for different countries to experiment with different regulatory and other safeguards. Many on the Continent are already moving in this direction. Mr Portillo could push them further by cultivating a less bombastic, case by case, approach to the debate.</p>

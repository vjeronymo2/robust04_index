			<p>Show      of Solidarity Follows Speech Cautioning Hardliners                           SUMMARY      The declaration by Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia (FRY), that Belgrade would not continue to pay the  heavy price for the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs to maintain an  uncompromising position toward a peace settlenient does not appear  to have affected their negotiating stances.  Despite Lilic's  cautionary statements,  Bosnian and Krajina Serb leaders have  continued to take tough stands on the crises in their regions  without any hint of censure from Belgrade.                           END SUMMARY      While suggesting criticism of Serbs who oppose peace talks,  Lilic's statements in a June speech in Novi Sad were most likely  intended more to reiterate Belgrade's position that it supports a  peaceful resolution of the Balkan conflict.  Insisting that the  FRY (Serbia and Montenegro) needs peace so that the UN will lift  the economic sanctions imposed on the country, Lilic warned that  "nobody has the right" to drag Serbia and the FRY into the war  and "exhaust their own country."  He emphasized that the  population of the FRY "cannot be the hostages of a single leader"  whether he is "from the FRY, the Republic of Srpska" in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, "or the Republic of Serbian Krajina" in Croatia.  He  declared that the people of the FRY have a "justified"  expectation of a "successful outcome to the peace talks" and  "cannot agree to the option of their endless foot-dragging,  sabotage, and blackmailing" (Belgrade TV, 7 June).  Most likely  trying to avoid open conflict in Serb ranks, Lilic did not  specify who was responsible for the footdragging and sabotage of  peace negotiations.      Lilic's remarks echoed those of Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic on other occasions when the Serbian president has  called--albeit with mixed success--upon the Bosnian or Krajina  Serbs to compromise for the greater good of Serbia, the FRY, and  all Serbdom.  During the negotiations in January 1993 that  eventually led to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia-  Herzegovina, Milosevic reportedly warned Karadzic that he "could  not hold all of Yugoslavia as his hostage" by refusing to  compromise (Vreme, 13 June).  Ultimately, Karadzic and the  Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan in May 1993 in  defiance of Milosevic's wishes.  At the same time, the Belgrade  media used the episode to argue that the UN sanctions against the  FRY were unjust because, as the Yugoslav leadership had claimed  all along, Belgrade's influence over the Bosnian Serbs was  limited.  When Milosevic sought to persuade then-President of the  RSK Milan Babic to accept the Vance peace plan for Croatia, the  Serbian president similarly warned the RSK leader that he would  not be allowed to hold the Serbs of Yugoslavia as "hostages" to  Babic's personal ambitions (Tanjug, 11 January 1992).  In that  instance, Milosevic proved successful:  The Krajina Serbs  accepted the Vance plan and removed Babic from office in February  1992.      Lilic's remarks apparently had unintended consequences that the  Serbian leadership and the Milosevic-controlled media have tried  to counter.  The FRY President's statements set off a round of  speculation in the independent Belgrade media, particularly in  the daily Borba, that the speech was symptomatic of a growing  rift between Milosevic and Karadzic (Borba, 9 and 11-12 June;  Vreme, 13 June).  Radovan Karadzic, president of the "Republic of  Srpska" (RS) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Milan Martic, president of  "Republic of Serbian Krajina" in Croatia, and other leaders  dismissed the matter by asserting that the speech did not refer  to them (Vreme, 13 June).  In an interview in a Belgrade daily,  Karadzic declared that if Serbia is "provoked and dragged into  the war" it would be neither because of the Bosnian Serbs  intentions nor as a result of their actions.  Moreover, he  deflected the thrust of Lilic's warning by claiming that the  United States is "working to get Serbia and the FRY involved in  the war" (Vecernje Novosti, 17 June).  On the other hand, Biljana  Plavsic, "vice president" of the RS, responded bitterly to  Lilic's remarks.  She likened him to Serbian opposition party  leader Vuk Draskovic, whom she accused of advocating surrender to  the "blackmail" offered the Serbs in the peace talks (Borba, 9  June).      Several subsequent statements denied the existence of any rift  between Belgrade and its allies across the Drina and, at the same  time, appeared to be an attempt to tone down--if not deny--the  message sent by Lilic's speech.  Not long after the controversy  over the speech erupted in the media, the Belgrade television  news program Dnevnik carried a statement from a local leader of  the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia reemphasizing the Serbian  position that the Serbs had been victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and that peace would only come with the international community's  and other warring sides' "acknowledgment of the interests of the  Serbian people."  Zeljko Simic, deputy premier of the FRY,  blandly claimed that Lilic's remarks were only intended as a  general warning against possible "willful actions of any  politician" and that Lilic had not even excluded himself from  those who needed to be cautioned.  He insisted that Lilic's  speech had been delivered "with the aim of sobering both the  public and certain significant political individuals" and  "warning" them not to put their "personal interests, or even  their will," above the national interests of the FRY (Belgrade  radio, 13 July).   Unyielding Stance      The Milosevic regime's response to Bosnian and Krajina Serb  behavior since the controversy over Lilic's speech suggests that  Belgrade has made no effort to persuade its allies to compromise  and, if anything, may have encouraged a renewed effort to stand  firm:      Quality for Quantity.  Neither the Belgrade leadership nor  Milosevic-controlled media have been observed to criticize  Karadzic despite his recent escalation of Bosnian Serb  territorial demands that could dampen hopes for a peace  settlement in the near future.   Although Karadzic, during his  13-15 June visit to Moscow, suggested that the Bosnian Serbs  could agree to the 51-49 percent split of Bosnian territory  between the Bosnian government and the Serbs, he insisted that  that could happen only if the boundaries of the proposed  territorial division were significantly renegotiated (Moscow TV,  14 June).  The Serbs, he said, demanded an exchange of territory  based on the principle of "quantity for quality" to create  "compact territory" (Tanjug, 14 June).  Then, in his 17 June  interview with Vecernje Novosti, Karadzic backtracked from his  Moscow statements, saying that the Serbs could not accept a 49-  percent share of Bosnian territory as a "final solution."  He  also reiterated previous demands that the Serbs be granted  control of parts of Sarajevo, suggested that he might also seek  control of Tuzla, and discussed the Serbs' proposal for an  exchange of territory with Croatia to gain access to the Adriatic  south of Dubrovnik (Tanjug, 17 June).      Karadzic's uncompromising demands were not reported by the  Belgrade media until after he consulted with Milosevic on 16  June, suggesting that the Bosnian Serb leader felt the need to  get Milosevic's  approval before announcing  his latest  negotiating position.  In an apparent attempt to dispel the  rumors of a rift between the two leaders, Karadzic and a smiling  Milosevic were shown on Belgrade television conferring amiably on  Karadzic's return from a  14-15 [?]June visit to Moscow.  Although the report did not broadcast the two leaders' comments  to each other, a Tanjug statement read by the television news  announcer gave no indication of any deviations from previous  statements professing the Serbs' desire for peace and their  demand for "equal treatment" by the international community  (Belgrade TV, 16 June).      No Compromises from Knin.  Suggesting that Lilic's 7 June speech  also did not signal a softening of Belgrade's support for the  Krajina Serbs' demands or negotiating tactics, negotiations  between Zagreb and Knin scheduled for 16 June foundered when the  Serbs refused to accept the presence of more than two Croatian  journalists at the talks.  The Belgrade media gave no indication  that the Milosevic regime objected to the scuttling of the talks  over what appeared to be a minor protocol point.  Moreover,  suggesting bleak prospects for future talks, Martic has demanded  from the Croatian Government "compensation to hard currency  account holders" and to the "57,000 pensioners" living in the  RSK, warning that such compensation is a precondition for the  reopening of the Adriatic oil pipeline shut down by the Serbs  since the early days of the 1991 war in Croatia.  He also has  declared that the pipeline can be reopened only if it were  allowed to deliver "Krajina crude oil" to the Pancevo refinery in  the FRY (Tanjug in Serbo-Croatian, 14 June).  Not only does  Zagreb deny the Krajina Serbs' right to pump the oil from oil  fields owned by Croatian companies, but it--and the international  community--would adamantly oppose such a violation of the UN  sanctions against the FRY.   Prospects      While Lilic's speech served as a reminder that the Milosevic  regime intends to retain control of the Serbian nationalist  movement in former Yugoslavia, it did not signal a retreat from  Milosevic's goal of eventually uniting all Serbs in one state.  Although Milosevic is willing to let the FRY make significant  sacrifices to obtain that goal, Lilic's speech implies that  Belgrade has set limits on the demands that the Serbs should make  and the tactics they should use to achieve them.  Those limits,  however, are apparently intended to rein in only the most extreme  demands by Bosnian and Krajina Serb leaders.  Belgrade's apparent  endorsement of Martic's and Karadzic's toughened negotiating  strategies suggests that they have stayed within the limits.  At  the same time, it helps Belgrade's efforts to win the lifting of  UN sanctions to claim that the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs act  independently and that Belgrade disapproves of the Bosnian war.

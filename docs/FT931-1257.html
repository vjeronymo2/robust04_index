			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Portugal offers aid to exporters PORTUGAL yesterday announced an Es300bn (Dollars 2bn) package designed to support exports and help industry through the international recession, Peter Wise reports from Lisbon. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, said the aim was to help exporters penetrate non-traditional markets, to promote Portuguese products in specific markets and to support companies hit by exchange-rate instability and the crisis in the former Soviet Union. Credit lines worth Esc270bn will be opened at Portuguese banks during the next six months to support exports to 13 non-traditional markets including Israel, South Africa, China, Iran and some Latin American and East European countries.</p>

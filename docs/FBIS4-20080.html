			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roula Kambouriani from New York--live] </F>   [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, good evening from New York,  where these days there is very intense diplomatic activity in an  attempt to lift the impasse in the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou could possibly meet with UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday [27 April]. On that same day, Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias will have a meeting with  Butrus-Ghali. Today, Foreign Minister Papoulias met with Cyrus  Vance, UN special mediator on the Skopje issue. In the previous  few days, Vance had meetings with Matthew Nimetz, U.S. envoy on  the Skopje issue, and Skopean Foreign Minister Stevo  Crvenkovski. Vance will again meet the Skopjean foreign  minister in the coming days. Furthermore, Vance will meet  Papoulias again before Thursday.    I expect goodwill moves from both sides, Vance said during  his arrival for the meeting with Papoulias. Following are the  remarks of the two men after their meeting, which lasted for one  hour.    [Begin recording] [Kambouriani] Both Vance and Papoulias  said that the effort will continue and that they are in  continuous contact. When Vance was asked whether there will be  an end to the impasse before the end of the week, he said: I do  not want to guess when that will take place. Asked whether a  new formula for a solution of the Skopje issue is being  examined, Foreign Minister Papoulias said:    [Papoulias] Various proposals are under examination, but in  general the effort centers on overcoming the impasse.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Vance earlier talked about  goodwill moves by both sides. What is your comment?    [Papoulias] Look, the position of the Greek Government is  known and I think that Vance's goodwill services continue and  this is the positive at this time.    [Kambouriani] Vance said that there are no plans for a  meeting with Prime Minister Papandreou, and Papoulias ruled out  a meeting, at this stage, with Skopjean counterpart Crvenkovski.

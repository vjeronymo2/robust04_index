			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Chernova and Aleksandr Maksyuk: ``In </F> Volgograd Death Hasn't Grown Out of Knee-Pants Yet, While in  Donetsk it is Roaming Unidentified'']    [Text] When the last youngster infected in Volgograd Oblast  dies from AIDS--a sudden and incomprehensible outbreak of  disease in Southern Russia--all but the unfortunate parents will  probably forget about this.    It has already been half a year since the 3-year statute of  limitations on the criminal AIDS case. The former director of  the city health department advanced in his career as far as  deputy head of the oblast administration, and even mothers, left  alone with their grief, no longer haunt the thresholds of the  Volgograd mayor's office and city health department asking for  help for their children in food, money and medicine, so as to  make it until the world invents a medicine against the  frightening ailment. Some of them write letters and describe  their misfortune only to a certain woman who is not invested  with power and who lives in Tyumen-- Tatyana Khrustik. In her  own life she experienced what it means to live and know that  your child may die at any minute.    Now Tatyana Petrovna, who doesn't trust the local  authorities  and the oblast health department, goes from one commercial firm  to another in her search for assistance. Strange as it may seem,  sponsors are still to be found. The Tyumen Avantash Bank, the  Trigon firm, an airline company, the Volgograd Transportation  Administration, and Norwegian trade unions. The director of  Moscow's Astra Company, Mikhail Semenovich Tsivin, explained his  assistance--paying for medicine for AIDS patients--with just a  single phrase: I am a human being, and I want children to live.    But in the last half year four youngsters died in  Volgograd--all boys. And other boys who are older and quite  healthy are beating on the windows of the AIDS center.    Of 42 infected children, 34 remain among the living. And  this  is just in Volgograd Oblast. They are hidden from everyone.  Trying to remain incognito, the parents sometime even refuse  benefits to which they are entitled.    A 5-year-old girl almost succumbed to AIDS while mother  frantically raced through the rayon in search of a telephone to  call an ambulance. You couldn't go to your neighbors, after all,  and you're not going to utter the diagnosis aloud. But many  families with sick children still don't have telephones.  Volgograd authorities promised to help, but they haven't  supported their decision with money.    Today most mothers who as a rule have two dependent  children,  one sick with AIDS, are living on a disability pension and  assistance.    The only place in Donetsk where there are no lines is the  anonymous AIDS testing office. And for no good reason, believes  N. P. Grazhdanov, director of the oblast center fighting the  frightening disease. From the moment when it became clear that  immunodeficiency virus knows no boundaries, 36 infected persons  were revealed in Donetsk Oblast, three of whom have already  died. Twenty-five out of these 36 turned out to be foreigners,  and were deported. However, there are no grounds for  reassurance. In N. P. Grazhdanov's opinion there are around 150  AIDS virus carriers in Donetsk Oblast, of whom both the  authorities and doctors are unaware. People at the bottom of the  ladder are a special headache to medical workers. It doesn't  appear that they enter into any kind of relations with  foreigners, they prefer drinking perfume to taking drugs, but  they still manage to catch the fatal disease somehow.    The example offered by the most recently revealed virus  carriers is traditionally instructive in this aspect: A fitter  working for a certain enterprise in Makeyevka lived in a  dormitory and was not distinguished by an especially sober view  on life; a young lady who had a dozen sex partners was able to  communicate only their first names, and nothing more.</p>

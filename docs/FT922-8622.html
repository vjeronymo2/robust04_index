			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Residents take over their pub A PUBLIC house in an inner-city area targeted in an economic and social regeneration initiative has been taken over by local residents. The Rock, closed earlier this year, lies in Cruddas Park in Newcastle upon Tyne, an area of high unemployment selected as a regeneration testbed three years ago by the Newcastle Initiative, a leadership team of Business in the Community, the voluntary organisation for business initiatives. It has been the focus of intensive efforts by the private sector, local and central government and residents. Newcastle Breweries has waived the first quarter's rent to help the community-led Cruddas Park Community Trust, chaired by Mr John Ward, Barclays Bank regional director, to re-establish the business. Since the trust reopened the pub's bar three weeks ago, customers have returned. The lounge, previously used for drug dealing, is still closed. Business in the Community survey, Page 31</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Adverts on jockeys' silks get go-ahead The British Horse Racing Board yesterday altered its rules to let racehorse owners sell advertising space on the sleeves and collars of jockeys' silks. The board, the governing body for horse racing in England, Wales and Scotland, will also allow advertising on paddock blankets and the backs of stable lads' jackets. Up to 10,000 horse owners will be able to take advantage of the scheme, which has been cleared with broadcasters and the Independent Television Commission. The board says the 'multi-million pound' revenue will go to owners. Under a separate scheme race courses will be able to sell space on horse number cloths. The proceeds will go to owners, jockeys, trainers and stable lads. The number cloth scheme is expected to begin tomorrow at Wolverhampton. The scheme for owners should start next month. Miss Lucy Weaver, the board's marketing assistant, said: 'It will be up to owners to decide what sponsorship is worth.' The announcement follows talks last year between the thoroughbred industry and Customs &amp; Excise. Both sides were anxious to allow registered owners to develop their businesses and to claim back value added tax. The Market Racing Agency, an independent consultancy, said it was already in talks with potential sponsors.</p>

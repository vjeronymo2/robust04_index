			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: Help in kind reaps reward - Sponsorship When the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts hands out its annual awards on November 21 to companies that have supported the arts beyond the call of duty during 1994 there will be one new prize category - 'sponsorship in kind'. And about time too, you may think. This activity is growing in importance, building on a long history of business giving its expertise and products to the arts. It goes back to the days when regional Rep props were manned with products from local manufacturers and retailers. It can be a modest expense for a company compared with handing over cash and also there is an obvious promotional advantage. ABSA in Scotland has already added this category to its annual awards list, and these days it is a naive arts organisation which does not look to companies for aid in kind. The most obvious examples are in transportation. American Airlines made possible the American Festival in London last year by providing tickets for the artists, and United Airlines is currently supporting the ENO. At ground level BMW loaned cars to the recent Aldeburgh Festival and Hertz will service Edinburgh this month. Behind the scenes, Digital has taken its obsession with the arts as far as giving computerised box office systems to the National Theatre, ENO, and Sadler's Wells; while IBM provided the computer graphics for the Leonardo exhibition at the Hayward on the South Bank. Perhaps the most useful form of aid in kind is brain power. Business In The Arts was set up to lend managers; WH Smith, Marks &amp; Spencer and Arthur Anderson are among the most enthusiastic companies to give staff time off to take their accounting, marketing, or computer skills to the aid of idealistic, if less business like, arts companies. There is tremendous scope for imaginative relationships: in Northern Ireland, Duds and Suds, a launderette, offered to wash the costumes of the cast of the Arts Theatre in Belfast when it was performing The Steamie, while in Scotland Millhouse Design provided the posters, programme, merchandise and signing for the Edinburgh International Children's Festival while training its new personnel through work on the project. Currently at the Serpentine Gallery in London, Helen Chadwick's controversial show Effluvia is enhanced by the fact that Trafford Carpets has provided the artificial green grass to show off her 'Piss Sculptures', while the Royal Exchange in Manchester was provided with a new corporate bar by Charles Heidseick, the champagne house. Arts organisations in the north of England have been helped by BT laying on free phones and faxes and ABSA itself benefits from free office accommodation in Manchester provided by P&amp;O Properties. The National Freight Corporation has given the touring troupe Energy Exit Arts a van to transport its props while Scottish Ballet's tour of Russia was made much easier by Safeway providing the pantechnicons which carried its gear. And so it goes on - Ibstock Building Projects supplied the clay, and then fired the thousands of small figurines which made up sculptor Antony Gormley's work 'Field'; Kingfisher, the retail group, has suggested that its B&amp;Q and Comet subsidiaries bolstered the Hay-on-Wye Festival by laying on floor and pathways, plus an audio system; while Becks Bier, the Scottish and Newcastle subsidiary, regularly provides free drinks at the launch parties of contemporary artists. At least some of these companies can expect to be short-listed when ABSA prepares for its prize giving. All good sponsorships come to an end and what better way to part friends than by holding a celebratory gala? That is what BT is doing for The Stables at Milton Keynes, the country home of John Dankworth and Cleo Laine and the venue for music festivals, courses, and jazz workshops. BT has put up Pounds 30,000 over the past three years, mainly to fund musical education, and on September 10 at London's Festival Hall it is backing an all star concert to mark the end of the deal. BT has also just said goodbye to its New Contemporaries visual art sponsorship, but has taken on board BT National Connections, a youth theatre scheme which culminates with performances at the Royal National Theatre. Both show the main characteristics of a BT sponsorship - they cover the country; they are youth-orientated; and they encourage participation in the arts by non-professionals. Rodger Broad, who controls an annual arts sponsorship budget of around Pounds 1.8m, the largest in the UK, has set aside around Pounds 250,000 for a new, yet to be determined, project to be running by next year. He is currently examining the dance field, but no decisions have been made. BT already sponsors Northern Ballet Theatre with Pounds 500,000 over three years. Next month professional drama returns to Huddersfield after a gap of 40 years with the opening of the Lawrence Batley Theatre. Batley, now in his 80s, is credited with bringing cash and carry wholesaling to the UK, and his contribution of around Pounds 300,000 to the project, almost matching local authority grants, has immortalised his name. There are two auditoria, a 447 seat theatre and a 150 seat studio, in the complex. With lottery funding for new arts buildings dependent on matching contribution from arts organisations it is likely that more generous citizens will be commemorated in this way over the next few years.</p>

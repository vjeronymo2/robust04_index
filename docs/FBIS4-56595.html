			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN National Directorate member Victor </F> Tirado Lopez by Noel Irias; place and date not given; first five  paragraphs are BARRICADA introduction]    [Text] Victor Tirado Lopez, member of the National  Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN),  believes that economic issues are fundamental for the electoral  future of his party.    He appealed for the formulation of economic proposals that  go  beyond momentary problems and set a course along which the  Sandinists can take the country.    Regarding the internal situation of his party, Tirado stated  that "the factions represent a more comprehensive  democratization in the FSLN."    "No member of the National Directorate will remain aloof  from  these factions. Otherwise, we will be alone, isolated," he  declared.    The Sandinist leader said that his participation in one of  the factions of the FSLN will depend on how they deal with  economic issues.    [Irias] Will the FSLN return to power?    [Tirado] Like all parties, we always aspire to take office,  and to political power in general. The FSLN has great potential  for running the Government of Nicaragua.    We need to meet a few requirements. To act as a  revolutionary  party that has committed itself to the defense of the workers'  interests.    The current conditions are not the same as they were in  1979;  now there is a much wider array of parties in the opposition,  contending with the FSLN to become the ruling party.    The FSLN will have to define three important strategic  aspects of the current situation: the democratization of the  country, the economic crisis, and the electoral processes.    Just as we accepted our electoral defeat and turned over the  reins of government to the victorious political forces of the  National Opposition Union (UNO), the FSLN must do its part and  contribute to the democratization of the country and its  institutions.    Above all, it must discuss and debate the great issues that  we face today. The most important one is the country's economic  plight. This issue is being discussed with a lot of limitations,  without giving it the priority it deserves.    Elections are now replacing the armed struggle of the past.    Many countries all over the world are attributing to the  electoral struggle the importance it deserves in the effort to  continue changes that could not be brought about through armed  struggle.    In Nicaragua, we must look at the electoral process in a  revolutionary way; if we disdain it as an ideologized measure or  procedure, we will not make any changes.    We must create a democracy in the country, expand it,  participate in elections, make the institutions of government  and civil society work.    Nicaragua is not an island; external influence plays an  important role politically, economically, and socially. What is  the worldwide trend that is taking place?    We have to look at it this way so that we can resolve the  problems that have arisen, so that we can take office in the  future and govern by national consensus.    No doubt about it, the market and competitiveness are the  watchwords of the day. We must depart from that point to  participate as a nation in this worldwide trend and improve the  populace's socioeconomic conditions.    [Irias] What are the obstacles to the FSLN's assuming office  again?    [Tirado] We face one obstacle: the economic crisis. You are  not going to defend the workers' interests with alms. I think  that defending the workers means creating jobs, training them,  and giving them access to the resources generated by the  production system.    If you want to govern, you have to solve that problem, not  with populist measures, but with jobs, investment.    [Irias] What can the FSLN do right now to begin solving this  problem?    [Tirado] We must begin by revising the government's  macroeconomic policies; that is the responsibility of all  political forces and economic sectors in the country.    We must seek a consensus to free up the economic mechanisms  and revitalize production.    I think that it is in the legal, civic opposition that we  have gained the least experience. It has not been a constructive  opposition, which we said we would build when we lost the  elections.    The FSLN's job is not to help solve short-term problems of  poverty, but to contribute to a genuine change in the course of  economic policy to open up new sources of employment.    The FSLN must take a serious approach to economic issues to  set the country's economic course.    If the FSLN undertakes this task seriously, in the next  elections we may not win in a landslide, but we will increase  our percentage of the vote.    [Irias] What internal effort is necessary in the FSLN to  regain its leadership?    [Tirado] We must establish leadership in the economic  sphere.  No leadership is capable of implementing all the economic  measures that the trade associations are demanding of the  government.    Next week the trade associations--coffee growers,  stockmen--plan to stage a demonstration, calling for the  discussion of macroeconomic policies. That is an effort at  establishing leadership. No political party has taken the lead  in this discussion.    No economic leadership--which is also political  leadership--has emerged from within the FSLN. It is not a matter  of wresting the leadership from the trade associations; it is a  matter of using the legal and institutional means at the FSLN's  disposal and sitting down to discuss the economic policies that  are being called into question.    The Sandinist Front should provide an alternative for all of  these demands. That is the kind of economic leadership that I  think is most important.    [Irias] Do you agree with the existence of factions in the  FSLN?    [Tirado] There has been a lot of talk here about the  democratization of the FSLN. It is not just a matter of holding  a congress to reelect our officials.    The factions represent a more comprehensive democratization  in the FSLN. Some people get upset because these factions could  lead to divisiveness. That is true, but the divisiveness is  there whether or not there are factions.    Those who are in charge of these currents of opinion should  bear in mind that political discussion should serve to  strengthen rather than to widen distances.    Some people have legitimate aspirations, but that should not  cause them to split away from Sandinism, because that would be  counterproductive.    The factions will play an important role in the  democratization of the FSLN, independently of the congress or of  any other activity that might make the FSLN more credible and  help it win the people's trust.    [Irias] It is said that the National Directorate agreed that  its members would not be involved in any factions. Is that  correct information?    [Tirado] There was no decision; it was left up to each  individual. Each one was to gauge the consequences and decide  for himself. I do not recall any clear-cut decision being made.  The matter was discussed in a very limited fashion.    If this whole process is part of democracy, no member of the  National Directorate will remain aloof from these factions.  Otherwise, we will isolate ourselves. If this is aimed at  democratizing the FSLN, what will Victor Tirado or Bayardo Arce  do? Remain on the sidelines watching the action?    What will we do? I suppose we will take sides with one  faction or another. Actually, right now individuals already  participate as groups, classes, or social sectors.    The members of the National Directorate will have to decide  to go with one of the two camps; otherwise, some will be left  out.    [Irias] There has been speculation that you would sign one  of  the documents made public by the factions. Will you sign at some  point?    [Tirado] My participation in particular--in a faction--will  depend on whether they take up and discuss these economic issues  and institutions. We must know where we want to take our country.    The issue that interests me is economics. I am not satisfied  with political matters. This country's backwardness is an  economic problem.    I think that the factions should discuss economic matters,  add economic issues to their agenda. They should also add the  issue of the Army.    [Irias] Will the FSLN regain its peasant face?    [Tirado] It lost the support of the peasantry over the  economic issue. They turned their backs on us because of the  price controls, expropriations, and distribution mechanisms. We  did not use the market to help peasants develop. These measures  caused the peasants to distance themselves from the FSLN.    The FSLN should participate in the responses to economic  problems and attract undecided voters. The Sandinist Front must  present an alternative beyond what is being discussed now.    In the discussion of the economic policies that are being  applied, we can win back the peasant face of the FSLN. It is  already happening.    [Irias] What are your personal aspirations?    [Tirado] I was thinking of beginning to write my  autobiography while at the same time staying with the Sandinist  Front. Thirty years in the FSLN, that has been my life.    I have to find a way of surviving, of earning a living. You  always have to participate in political and social activities,  in revolutionary activities. It is impossible to live in  isolation.    I think that sometimes we Sandinists of this generation, who  fought against Somoza and spent 10 years fighting against the  United States, have turned positive things into obstacles to the  organization and to society. We must make way for others, young  people, the new generation that lived on the threshold of war  and peace.    One generation has to replace the other so that we can  resolve our conflict. I am in favor of having new young people  with a different mentality come in. We cannot remain wedded to  what we did in the past.    There is always a new alternative that we as a generation  have not managed to reinvent.    [Irias] Do you think the current situation in the FSLN is  being influenced by the differences between Daniel Ortega and  Sergio Ramirez?    [Tirado] I do not think so. I think the media are largely to  blame. When they personalize our leaders, the media take sides.  They should be more objective.    I do not think it is a personal problem. I think everyone  wants reform in the FSLN.    Individuals can also have aspirations; individual initiative  is not a crime. I believe that these ideas should be channeled  through the established mechanisms, that the bylaws should be  allowed to function.    If the current mechanisms are not working, new mechanisms  should be developed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that allowing floor traders to provide customers with quote sizes greater than the minimum ``ten-up'' guarantee, while not being obligated with respect to broker-dealer orders, is consistent with the Act in that it will facilitate customer orders. The Commission also believes the rule change will encourage market participants to make larger markets, resulting in tighter spreads, which, in turn, should contribute to more liquid options markets. Furthermore, allowing floor traders to increase the quote sizes available to customer orders furthers the underlying purposes of the ``ten-up'' rule. The proposal also requires that order sizes be maintained equally for all orders of the same account type, as defined by OFPA B&hyph;6. Accordingly, if a specialist elects to give a size of twenty-up to one broker-dealer, he must honor the size of twenty-up for all broker-dealer orders. In the absence of a stated size to any bid or offer, the size shall be deemed to be for one contract only, subject to the minimum volume guarantees for public customers orders, as established in Rule 1033(a). The Commission believes this requirement will help to ensure the integrity and fairness of the Phlx's markets in that it will help prevent order discrimination within account types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposal prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Amendment No. 1 eliminates the term ``public customers'' from OFPA B&hyph;7, which was proposed in the original filing. Because existing Phlx OFPA B&hyph;6 already distinguishes between account types, of which ``public customers'' is one type, the Commission does not believe the proposal's elimination of the term raises any new or substantive issues. Moreover, the minimum volume guarantees afforded by Rule 1033(a) are only available to public customer orders and the elimination of the term from OFPA B&hyph;7 does not affect the ten-up guarantee. Amendment No. 1 also replaces a reference to the Phlx ``ten-up'' rule with a citation to OFPA A&hyph;11, which is the floor advice currently governing minimum volume guarantees. The Commission believes this change is non-substantive and does not affect the operation or implementation of either Rule 1033(a), OFPA A&hyph;11, or the filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Staff at Yarrow to return to work WHITE-COLLAR workers on strike at the Yarrow warship yard on the Clyde voted yesterday to return to work, having successfully fought off an attempt to introduce performance-related pay for 500 draughtsmen and supervisory staff. The staff walked out two weeks ago in protest at a pay offer of 1.8 per cent plus a performance-linked rise of up to 2.6 per cent. Yesterday's deal gives all white-collar staff a general increase of 2.5 per cent. Officials of the MSF technical union said performance-related pay would never work in the shipbuilding industry. Yarrow, part of the GEC group, has orders for three warships for the Royal Navy and for two more for the Malaysian navy.</p>

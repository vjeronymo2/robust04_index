			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Australia ponders jobs guarantee An Australian government advisory group has proposed job guarantees of six to nine months for those who have been unemployed for more than 18 months. writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne. The programme would cost up to ADollars 1.4bn (Pounds 628m) a year and recommends a 'jobs levy', a short-term tax on employed Australians to fund job-creating projects. Anticipating wide opposition to the levy, the task force said the alternatives would be to expand the budget deficit (expected to reach ADollars 18bn this year), or further to cut public spending.</p>

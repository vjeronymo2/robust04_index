			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Wiesenthal in West Berlin Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal paid tribute Saturday to  the actor who played him in a television film of his life story -- British  actor Ben Kingsley. Wiesenthal, who was in West Berlin, also praised the  American television production, entitled "The Murderers Among Us -- The Simon  Wiesenthal Story," which starred Kingsley and won the Golden Camera award, one  of West Germany's highest television honors.  </P> <P> Wiesenthal appeared to be moved as Kingsley said that the real prize was for  Wiesenthal and his work. Wiesenthal, now 81, was confined in 12 concentration  camps and lost nearly all his relatives to the Holocaust. He was liberated by  U.S. troops from the concentration camp Mauthausen in 1945, and has brought  about 1,200 Nazi criminals to justice. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

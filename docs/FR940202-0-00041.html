			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1275&hyph;3&blank;OID Information Reporting Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legending requirements in the final regulations for debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments with OID are generally the same as the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1275&hyph;5&blank;Variable Rate Debt Instruments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to comments that the definition of a variable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate debt instrument contained in the proposed regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overly restrictive, the final regulations liberalize the rules in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several respects. First, the regulations allow the issue price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a variable rate debt instrument to exceed the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncontingent principal payments on the instrument, provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the excess is not greater than a specified amount. Second, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations allow a variable rate debt instrument to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated interest at more than two qualified floating rates, at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a single fixed rate and an objective rate that is a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inverse floating rate. Third, the regulations provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest that is stated at an initial fixed rate for a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not more than one year, followed by a qualified floating rate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an objective rate, is treated as stated at a single qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating rate or an objective rate in certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule applies, for example, if interest for the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrual period is set a short time prior to the issue date at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed rate chosen to approximate the expected value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified floating rate or objective rate on the issue date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the regulations allow certain multiples of a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating rate to be treated as qualified floating rates. Fifth,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations expand the definition of an objective rate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a rate based on the yield of actively traded property, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate that would be a qualified floating rate if the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument were denominated in a foreign currency, and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of objective rates. In addition, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provide that other rates may be treated as objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates if designated by revenue ruling or revenue procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a comment, the definition of an objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate has been narrowed in two respects. While the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations permit a rate based on the price of actively traded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal property, the final regulations permit only a rate based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the change in the price of actively traded personal property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be an objective rate. In addition, the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a more general rule relating to the frontloading or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backloading of interest such that a variable rate is not an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective rate if it results in significant frontloading or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backloading of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rules in the proposed regulations relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible objective rates on tax-exempt debt instruments have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been changed in the final regulations. Under the revised rules,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a variable rate on a tax-exempt debt instrument is an objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate only if it is a qualified inverse floating rate. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, an objective rate is a qualified inverse floating rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and the rate varies in a manner that inversely reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rules in the proposed regulations for determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrual of OID and the amount of qualified stated interest on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable rate debt instrument have been revised and simplified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final regulations. Under the revised rules, a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument providing for qualified floating rates is converted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument by assuming that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified floating rate will remain at its value as of the issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date. A debt instrument providing for an objective rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted to an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument by assuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the objective rate will equal a fixed rate that reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield that is reasonably expected for the instrument. The rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to fixed rate debt instruments are then applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the OID accruals and the qualified stated interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appropriate adjustments to these amounts are made in each accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period if the interest actually accrued or paid during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrual period is greater than or less than the interest assumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be accrued or paid under the equivalent fixed rate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

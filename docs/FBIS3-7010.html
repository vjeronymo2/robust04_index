			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Panel discussion by Shunji Yanai, director general of the </F> Ministry of Foreign Affairs Foreign Policy Bureau; Maki Okada,  chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs European and Oceanic  Affairs Bureau, East Europe Division; and Teruaki Nagasaki,  chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs International  Cooperation Department, Refugees Assistance Office, on 20  January; place not given: "What Can Japan Do for the Former  Yugoslavia?"]    [Text] Details of the Survey on Yugoslavia, and the  Actual Situation in Respective Areas    [GAIKO FORUM] A "survey team on the former Yugoslavia"  consisting mainly of Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] staff  members was sent to the area in January this year. Today, I  want to ask you about the situation there and the purpose of  sending the survey team.    [Yanai] Although Japan used to have relations with the  former Yugoslavia, frankly, unlike the European countries, we  were not necessarily familiar with the detailed situation in  that country. Therefore, to study what policies we should set  up and what contributions we should make in dealing with the  problems of peace and humanity existing in the former Yugoslavia  that are creating world-wide concern, it was decided the MOFA as  a body would make an on-the-spot study -- without confining its  activities to collecting data through embassies in foreign  countries -- to grasp the actual situation.    [GAIKO FORUM] When peace was being sought in Cambodia,  opposition and doubts about participation were raised among the  Japanese people. Fortunately, however, peace has been restored.  Notwithstanding, we notice opinions in the newspapers about the  situation in Yugoslavia being very complicated. Under such  circumstances, you have dared to start a study on Yugoslavia.  What kind of survey did you carry out?    [Yanai] First, let me introduce the outline. It is true  there is the opinion that, while it is understandable for Japan  to be involved in Cambodia which is located in Asia, why should  it go as far as Europe? However, the significance of the  problem of peace and humanity should not be determined by the  distance. Since such a serious problem is going to have global  influence, our country should not remain indifferent on the  grounds it is a problem in Europe.    In the case of Cambodia, Japan was also seriously concerned  about the situation. International cooperation, with the  European countries, and Central and South American countries  rushing to the spot, was realized in the process of restoring  peace in Cambodia, in the peacekeeping operations [PKO], and in  carrying out humanistic assistance activities, thus making it  possible to attain the objectives. We have learned from this  how important it is for the world to concentrate its strength to  solve such a serious problem.    The first step of our survey was to grasp the Yugoslav  situation. We visited all the countries which constitute the  former Yugoslavia except Montenegro -- Croatia, Slovenia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Serbia. Some of the  countries have attained independence and been recognized by our  country, and some of them are not yet independent. We met with  key figures of the respective countries, and studied their  actual situations.    In addition, UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force], the  UNHCR [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees], and  other international organs are located within the area, and we  talked with people associated with the various organizations. We  had an opportunity to observe the situation of the respective  countries and international activities taking place there.    Even today, when we hear the name Yugoslavia, we tend to  imagine a united area. However, the various areas of Yugoslavia  are quite different. I do not think it correct to try to  understand the respective areas indiscriminately.    Let me briefly describe the situation of each area. Slovenia  has become completely independent, and presently there is no  military dispute at all.    In Croatia, there are two big problems. One is its relations  with the Serbian people living in Croatia. This is a very  serious confrontation which developed into a clash of military  powers. Another problem is the conflict between the Croatian  people and other races living in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is a confrontation  among three groups--the Croatian, Serbian, and Islamic people  (hereinafter referred to as Muslims). Unfortunately, the  confrontation among these three groups has now developed into a  military conflict.    Macedonia has attained independence peacefully, and there  has  been no military conflict at all. The country remains quiet.  Potentially, however, there is the problem of the minority race  of Albanian people in Macedonia. Also, there is the danger that  the problem involving Albanians living in the autonomous state  of Kosovo, Serbia, north of Macedonia, might involve the country.    As for Serbia -- with Montenegro we call it "the Union of  New Yugoslavia" -- affected by the war, the country is broken  economically and is also subject to economic sanctions. Its  currency system has totally collapsed, and it is suffering an  inflation rate of astronomical figures. However, there is no  military conflict within Serbia. Besides, the Serbian people  are united very firmly under the leadership of President  Milosevic.    As we have seen, a considerable difference exists between  each area and, accordingly, the United Nations is carrying out  different PKO in respective areas. In Croatia, the UN  Peacekeeping Forces are stationed in the Serbian residential  areas to control the reoccurrence of conflict. In  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the PKO's [peacekeeping operations] main  task is to secure the safety of personnel engaged in  humanitarian aid. Developing preventive activities is the PKO's  task in Macedonia. Moreover, UNHCR-sponsored humanitarian  activities are being developed in various districts of the  former Yugoslavia.  <H5>  The Muslims Have No Intention of Seeking Peace </H5>   [Okada] Let me explain how we were dealing with the Yugoslav  situation prior to our recent survey. Besides grasping the  situation as a whole, we participated in discussions at various  international levels; in particular, we participated in those  sponsored by the United Nations and, further, offered  humanitarian aid mainly through the UNHCR.    In the process of our participating in such international  activities, there is one thing I noticed: The Yugoslav problem  is viewed as serious in the United States and Russia, as well as  Europe. On the other hand, though there are fragmentary reports  in newspapers, Yugoslavia is very remote from Japan in terms of  geography and culture, and many Japanese people, including those  who are in comparatively responsible positions, tend to respond:  "Yugoslavia? -- That problem is too difficult for me to  understand."    It may be true that, seen from a comparatively narrow  viewpoint based on our historical, social, and economic  relations with the country, Yugoslavia's problems are not likely  to deeply affect our national interests. However, Japan  declares itself to be a country that shares global values with  other democratic countries. If, for instance, the Japanese  people really believe in the significance of democracy, human  rights, and humanism, they may as well express their opinions  based on their beliefs -- even though the problem may be  complicated in nature and difficult to understand, as is the  case of Yugoslavia.    When visiting the area, I was particularly impressed to  discover two new facts: First, I found out that, at present,  the Muslim side is not willing to obtain peace. I had to renew  my recognition of this. The Serbian side, having already  obtained what it wanted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and being accused  internationally, is willing to make an appropriate compromise to  achieve peace. Croatia, presently being attacked by the Muslims,  wants to achieve a cease-fire one way or another; and, to attain  this purpose, seems to be making various concessions concerning  conditions for peace. I realized that only fragmentary reports  about these situations were available to the outside world.    Then, talking with European and U.S. diplomats and other  officials in the area, I was strongly convinced that they have a  serious aversion to Milosevic as a symbol of great Serbianism,  and as a Stalinist. In short, everything is being dealt with in  the recognition that Serbia is to blame and that, compared to  Serbia, the other countries are acceptable. They intend to  achieve peace by suppressing Serbia. However, since Serbia has  strength, it must be controlled by military force. But, the  European countries and the United States seem to be somewhat  hesitant about taking such action as it is likely to result in a  serious sacrifice for them. Seemingly, they are distressed with  this dilemma as what they believe in is not supported by their  ability to realize it. However, even concerning recognition of  the facts on which their belief is based, I question whether it  is really justifiable for them to one-sidedly make a judgment to  that extent.    [GAIKO FORUM] If the Muslims do not want peace, what do  they intend to do?    [Okada] The Muslim experienced a very serious defeat in the  initial stage of the conflict. Most of the weapons of the  former Yugoslav allied forces were transferred to Serbia, which  was the main part of the allied forces. As a result, Serbia,  although its strength was inferior in terms of the number of  soldiers, was able to win victories one after another in its  military actions.    Then, the Muslim group, which had been in a continuously  inferior position throughout the period, changed to the  offensive around the autumn of last year. Though the Muslim  group does not seem to have greatly expanded its territories  through military actions against Serbia, the group had won  victories one after another in its territorial competition  against Croatia, thus placing several cities under its control.  Therefore, the group may be feeling confident that, if they try  harder in the future, they might be able to recover what they  lost during the military conflicts. That is why they do not want  to compromise for peace.    Also, we can point out the fact that the opinion of the  international community is on the side of the Muslims. For  example, while it is the actual situation in Sarajevo that the  attacks are mostly made by the Muslim side and no attack is  being made by Serbia, it has been reported in most cases that  Serbia is making the attacks, thus bringing about casualties.  We may say that the newspapers or the mass media are being  skillfully controlled from behind the scenes.  <H5>  A Unique Case of Assisting Refugees </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] Mr. Nagasaki, what is your opinion as one in  charge of assisting the refugees?    [Nagasaki] It is our duty to assist refugees not only in  Yugoslavia, but throughout the world. Basically, there are  various organizations such as the UNHCR, WFP [World Food  Program], the International Migration Organization, and the  International Red Cross Council. According to the "White Paper  on Refugees" the UNHCR issued last year, the number of refugees  throughout the world was reported to be approximately 19  million. The number of refugees from Yugoslavia -- in the case  of Yugoslavia, in addition to the "refugees," there are  so-called "domestic refugees" who are taking refuge within the  country -- shows a very large figure of 4.25 million. In the  past, the problem of refugees used to be understood as a problem  which tends to take place in developing countries. The problem  of refugees of Yugoslavia can be considered a unique refugee  problem taking place in an advanced area.    Besides, though we talk about the former Yugoslavia, it  consists of totally different areas. In particular,  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a troubled area where the battle fronts  are being built up with all the military forces jumbled  together. In a normal situation, a battle takes place first,  and then an international organ helps the refugees who have  escaped from the front lines. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, however,  the international organ goes to the spot where a conflict is  taking place and develops its action to offer humanitarian aid.  Moreover, in the recent conflict, particularly in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the three groups were, after all, competing  with each other to secure their positions. In such a situation,  though each group is supposed to welcome humanitarian aid under  a normal situation, we had to face various political  disturbances. I realized that the case of Yugoslavia is a very  unique one in which the humanitarian aid is being offered under  a very difficult situation where the conflicts and the problem  of refugees are taking place concurrently.    In Yugoslavia, we had the opportunity of listening to the  opinions of personnel who are offering humanitarian aid under  the UNHCR and the WFP; in Croatia, we visited the refugee camps  operated by the Red Cross of Denmark; and in Serbia, we visited  the refugee camps operated by the Serbian Government authorities  in the locality. We realized that every facility is in a  serious condition.    One thing I want to say is that the form, or should I say  the  difficulty, of humanitarian aid differs depending on the place.  Typically different is the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina where it  is difficult to secure access even if we want to transport goods  for humanitarian aid. In the case of Serbia and new Yugoslavia,  the refugees and the weak are presently in a very tough  situation because of the economic sanctions in addition to the  chronically aggravated economic conditions.  <H3>  What Are the Opinions of Other Countries About Japan's  Concern? </H3>   [GAIKO FORUM] The actual situation seems quite different  from  Japanese press reports.    Nevertheless, while speculations by neighboring countries,  and speculations by Italy, the United States, and all the other  European countries are being entangled with one another in  addition to the UN activities, the activity of the Japanese  people, such as Yasushi Akashi and Sadako Ogata and others, is  being highlighted, though it may be accidental. It is likely  that they might feel anxious about Japan's being concerned with  the problems of former Yugoslavia. What is the reaction of the  neighboring countries?    [Yanai] As you mentioned, since days gone by, countries such  as Austria, Turkey, Italy, France, Germany, and also Russia and  other countries were very much concerned about the former  Yugoslavia, or about the Balkan Peninsula if we take a broader  area. In the past, there was a struggle among the great powers  to expand their sphere of influence over the area. All the  countries located on the Balkan Peninsula, including the former  Yugoslavia, also once competed with one another for hegemony in  their respective areas. However, the situation has changed today  and, within the framework of the United Nations, all the  countries are cooperating with each other to restore peace and  to offer humanitarian aid. Although their interests are not  completely identical as each country has its own national  interests, at present there is fortunately no struggle among the  great powers as was seen in the past.    Japanese people have appeared on the stage under such  circumstances. I think Japanese people are rather welcome to  the arena, and there will be no negative feeling toward Japan as  long as Japan also lends its hand to restore peace and to offer  humanitarian aid.    Additionally, regardless of districts, the people of the  former Yugoslavia are very friendly to Japan. One reason may be  that, historically, our country has never interfered in the area  with any ambitions. Also, their feeling toward Japan is very  friendly because there was a very favorable relationship between  the two countries when Yugoslavia was the Socialist Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. In view of such relations, it is  considered very natural for us to help the area one way or  another.    Also, by chance, Japanese citizens were appointed heads of  the UN organizations having ties with the area. Ogata is the  high commissioner for refugees, and Akashi is special envoy of  the secretary general of the United Nations in charge of  Yugoslav problems. Also, there is another Japanese, Secretary  General Hiroshi Nakajima of WHO. As WHO is also offering  humanitarian aid with medical supplies and more, it turns out  that the three organizations are coincidentally headed by  Japanese. Although not because of this fact, we tend to feel  like cooperating with these leaders.  <H5>  Yugoslavia in East Europe </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] By the way, in a sense the Cold War seems to  have functioned as a kind of stabilizing factor for the Balkan  situation, including the former Yugoslavia. However, it seems  that this time the ethnic problem has erupted now that the  stabilizing factor has been totally removed. How should we  understand the future Yugoslav situation within the total  framework of East Europe?    [Okada] In East Europe, there is no other place where the  ethnic problem is as complicated as in Yugoslavia. However,  besides Yugoslavia, there are certain countries which are more  or less involved in racial problems. As you know, as of 1  January 1993 Czechoslovakia was divided peacefully into the  Czech Republic and Slovakia. Also, there may have been other  places where national consciousness was once sharply exalted  when the stabilizing factor in the form of the Cold War was  removed. However, they may have become rather prudent in their  own way because of the miserable situation taking place in  Yugoslavia.    A potentially most serious problem besides that of  Yugoslavia  is that of the Hungarian people who are in foreign countries. In  particular, about 600,000 Hungarians are included in the 5.3  million population of the new Slovakia, and nearly 2 million  Hungarians are living in Romania's Transylvania. In addition,  Hungarians are also living in the autonomous state of Vojvodina  (in Serbia), north of Yugoslavia. Therefore, some people fear  that, if the various problems taking place in Serbia lead to  oppression of the minority race of Hungarians living in  Yugoslavia, the oppression might stimulate the national  consciousness of people of Hungarian descent, which might come  to involve other areas.    Another problem, which is considered a little more  realistic threat, is the problem of the people of Albanian  descent. About 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, Serbia,  is Albanian, and, in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM], south of Serbia, about 20 percent of its population is  Albanian according to official statistics -- although Albanians  claim the ratio should be over 40 percent.    When we talk about FYROM, it should be understood that the  Macedonian nation was first recognized by the late President  Tito. Bulgarian people still think they are West Bulgarians, and  the nationalistic Serbian people call them South Serbians.  Greece also thinks FYROM was originally part of Greece. Such  being the situation, there were two Balkan wars involving the  area prior to World War I. In that sense, though the conflict  is presently taking the form of a civil war within the former  Yugoslavia, should relations between the Albanians and the  Macedonians worsen, creating a conflict around the area, it is  feared that an international conflict might take place involving  Bulgaria and Greece in addition to Serbia and Albania.  <H5>  Comparison of the Situation With the Cambodian Peace </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] In the case of the Cambodian peace, we noticed  the interesting phenomenon that all the people were somehow  united under a symbolic person called Prince Sihanouk (the  present king). In Yugoslavia, is there any person who can be a  key person to bring about a peaceful solution of the conflicts?    [Yanai] It is a very interesting idea to compare the  Yugoslav situation with that of Cambodia. Certainly, in the  case of Cambodia there is a charismatic figure called Sihanouk  whom even the Pol Pot faction respects, thus making it possible  to set up a framework for peace under him. To our regret, there  is no such person in Yugoslavia. Though, in the past, there  used to be a person called Tito, there is presently no one to  replace him.    Another difference is that, in the case of Cambodia, the  Paris Peace Conference was held, and a very comprehensive  agreement called the Paris peace accord was signed. The accord  was not merely an agreement for a cease-fire, but it provided  for the peace process as a whole. There is a framework formed  by the countries concerned, including our country, to support  this agreement, and PKO was carried out based on this framework.  In the case of Yugoslavia, however, there is no such total  framework for peace, thus creating a very difficult situation  with peace talks being held on one hand, and the PKO and  humanitarian activities being carried out on the other.    [Yanai] Then, do you mean that the way for peace has not yet  been paved [in former Yugoslavia] as in the case of Cambodia?    [Yanai] I am afraid I should admit that.  <H5>  What Can Japan Do? -- The Form of Cooperation and Assistance </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] By the way, I want to ask what Japan can  really do. What form of cooperation and assistance can Japan  offer? Public opinion in Japan has also changed since the  Cambodian peace was achieved. The opinions in the past  supporting the one-nation pacifism have disappeared, and now the  Japanese people think Japan should not offer economic assistance  alone, but should make international contributions. However,  there seems to be anxiety about the possibility of Japan's  making an over-commitment as a political superpower. Taking  such public opinion into consideration, what kind of  contributions do you think possible for Japan?    [Yanai] In the first place, various requests were presented  by the local side during the process of our survey. Those  requests may be roughly divided into three categories - requests  by the countries constituting the former Yugoslavia, requests by  the UNPROFOR headed by Akashi, and requests from the standpoint  of offering humanitarian aid.    First, of the countries which constituted former Yugoslavia,  Croatia, Slovenia, and FYROM, which have been recognized by our  country, expressed both the government's and the private  sectors' earnest desire to deepen their relationship [with  Japan]. As a necessary step, they wanted to have Japanese  embassies established in their countries.    Particularly in the case of FYROM, because its economy is  the  most inferior of the former Yugoslav countries and, moreover,  because the country has been separated due to the economic  sanctions from Serbia and other countries which used to be  traditional markets for FYROM, the country earnestly wants Japan  to offer its economic cooperation, and to introduce Japanese  private enterprises to the country. Also, for the time being,  they earnestly want Japan to help them in dealing with the  accumulated debts and more.    Second, concerning the UNPROFOR headed by Akashi, it was  earnestly requested that Japan send an administrative official  to assist Akashi, and to meet the request it has been decided  that Assistant Division Chief Tomiko Ichikawa of the UN  Administrative Division, International Cooperation Department,  Foreign Policy Bureau, is to be sent to the area as an  administrative official.    Also, in view of the successful experience in Cambodia, they  requested that a venue for a conference with major countries be  set up. The purpose of setting up the conference is that they  want to perform their peace-seeking duties in Zagreb, capital of  Croatia, where the UNPROFOR is headquartered, so they can hold  discussions on various problems with ambassadors and other  officials from the respective major countries and, therefore,  they want Japan to be prepared to join the conference at the  earliest stage possible.    Also, as a general idea, we talked about the possibility of  Japan sending staff members to the UNPROFOR or other unit of the  PKO. Though it was not an official request by the United  Nations, a PKO commanding officer in FYROM said in general terms  that the PKO, which was developing the security operations, was  in need of military monitors -- they are unarmed monitors --  and, therefore, it would be welcome if Japan could send such  staff members. Also, it was reported that transportation and  other equipment were in short supply.    Third, three requests were presented with respect to the  humanitarian aid. It was reported that, although refugees were  being taken care of at present either by the refugee camps or by  general households, there were in any case not enough facilities  to receive all the refugees. And Japan was asked for aid in  this respect. In the case of the former Yugoslavia -- different  from Cambodia -- solidly built houses are necessary as the  refugees are in cold areas.    Second, with regard to humanitarian aid which is being  offered by international organizations other than the UNHCR,  such as WHO, UNICEF, and the International Red Cross, it was  expressed in a general form that, while Japan had already been  largely cooperating with these organizations, they expect Japan  to continue its aid in the future.    The third point was with regard to medical problems. They  said that, in the former Yugoslavia, they have doctors, nurses,  and hospital buildings. However, there is a serious shortage of  medical equipment and medicines.    [Okada] Different from the case of Cambodia, I do not think  Japan is going to be deeply involved in the problem of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. So far, the EC has been taking  the initiative [in dealing with the problem of peace in  Yugoslavia], with the United Nations helping the EC in matters  which it cannot deal with. The peace talks in Yugoslavia have  been chaired jointly, literally, by Owen, representing the EC  (EU), and Stoltenberg, representing the United Nations. Behind  the peace talks are NATO and the military power of the United  States trying to find a way toward peace. I do not think there  is any chance for us to enter the scene and to play an actual  role in forming a framework for peace.    What Mr. Akashi actually does will not be to take part in  the  peace-seeking process. Anyway, we are going to continuously  observe the situation with interest, and we may be asked to play  a role within our capacity. What we have been doing is to  participate in sanctions, to put political pressure on the  parties concerned, and to participate in talks. I do not think  there is any role different in quality from these to be played  by us in the future.    There are also other fields Japan should do something about.  For instance, it seems important to build up relations with  those countries which have attained independence. In the case  of FYROM, for example, new conflicts might take place should the  living conditions of the people be aggravated. To prevent such  a situation from taking place, Japan is expected to cooperate in  elevating the economic level of the society. I think that, from  now on Japan should offer its help in these fields to the extent  possible.    The national administrative structure of Japan is very  rigid, and it is not possible to promptly set up an embassy even  if a new nation is formed. Only two or three embassies have  recently been established even in the former USSR. Therefore,  it is important to deal with the situation, making the most of  the already existing systems. The problem is, for instance, how  to deal with a country like FYROM. No ambassador has been  assigned to our embassy in Belgrade as the situation does not  allow us to do so, and it is also not possible to take a plane  from the area because it has been subjected to sanctions. We  must drive for hours to get there. Telephone connections are  also terrible. We should first take such local conditions into  account when we try to do something in the area.    Another problem is how to maintain Japan's presence in these  areas. For instance, I was very impressed to see a bonkei [a  tray landscape] at a hotel where we stayed in FYROM. It was  gorgeous. While there are only a few Japanese married to local  citizens, there is an association called the Macedonia  [FYROM]-Japan Association with one thousand and several hundred  members, and everyone is studying about Japan very hard. From a  broader point of view, we want to study in what area and in what  form we can offer our assistance to such areas.    [Nagasaki] Though it is not well known, Japan has offered  aid to the former Yugoslavia through international organizations  in the considerably large amount of $82 million. As far as the  former Yugoslavia is concerned, the total sum of our aid as of  the end of November 1993 ranked the third in the world, next to  EC and the United States. We intend to exert ourselves to  effectively meet the needs of the locality, and to offer aid in  such a form that Japan's cooperation is really appreciated by  the beneficiaries.    [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.</p>

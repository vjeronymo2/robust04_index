			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FDA DECISION COULD BE BOON FOR TRIMEDYNE  </P> <P> Trimedyne Inc. is hoping to revive its flagging laser sales after receiving  federal government approval to market a laser product for use in a new surgical  procedure for removing gallbladders.  </P> <P> "The reality is this breathes new life into laser sales for us," said Pete  Escallier, Trimedyne's marketing director, about the Food and Drug  Administration's approval last Friday of the company's laser procedure.  </P> <P> Trimedyne originally developed its so-called "hot-tip" laser for opening  clogged arteries in the leg and heart. In 1987, the Trimedyne laser was the  first laser of any kind to win FDA approval for use in leg surgery, spurring  brisk sales for the Tustin biomedical firm.  </P> <P> But sales skidded almost to a halt after Trimedyne experienced delays in  obtaining FDA approval for using the hot-tip laser for heart surgery.  </P> <P> Trimedyne's hot-tip laser -- also known as the Neodymium Yag laser -- has also  encountered emerging competition from an alternative, so-called "cold laser"  technology.  </P> <P> While the hot-tip laser uses heat to evaporate fatty deposits in blood vessels,  an alternative cold laser cuts through the plaque with short bursts of  ultraviolet light and eliminates the heat that may damage an artery. The FDA  has not yet approved cold lasers for opening clogged arteries.  </P> <P> Blaming marketplace "confusion" over the effectiveness of its hot laser,  Trimedyne lost $1.9 million in the quarter ended March 31 as sales plunged 70%.  For the first six months of fiscal 1990, the company lost $2.45 million,  contrasted with earnings of $1.5 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Escallier said physicians are showing increased interest in a new type of  gallbladder surgery called laparoscopic cholecystectomy and that interest "is  what is driving a lot of laser sales now."  </P> <P> In this new procedure, he said, the gallbladder is severed by the laser, which  cauterizes as it cuts, and is removed through a 1-inch incision in the abdomen  rather than the 6- to 8-inch incision required with traditional gallbladder  surgery.  </P> <P> He said the new technique typically allows patients to leave the hospital in  one day and return to work in a week. That compares to five to seven days of  hospitalization and three to five weeks of recuperation at home with the  traditional procedure.  </P> <P> While the new gallbladder surgery can be done with alternative implements,  Escallier said that some physicians prefer lasers because of their precision  and ability to stop bleeding with heat.  </P> <P> Escallier said some hospitals already had been placing orders for Trimedyne's  hot-tip laser in anticipation of last week's FDA approval.  </P> <P> He said lasers supplied by other manufacturers have also received FDA approval  for use in gallbladder surgery, but that Trimedyne's is the only one also  approved for leg surgery. FDA officials were unavailable Thursday to confirm  Trimedyne's claim.  </P> <P> Escallier said Trimedyne has also obtained FDA approval to use its hot laser  for about a dozen other non-vascular surgical procedures, including general  surgery, gynecology and urology.  </P> <P> He said the new uses for the Trimedyne laser will give greater leverage to  surgeons trying to persuade hospital administrators to purchase the $100,000  piece of equipment.  </P> <P> Trimedyne expects within 45 days to receive similar approval from the FDA to  market a newer-model laser for gallbladder surgery, Escallier said. He said 150  of those models have been sold by Trimedyne.  </P></p>

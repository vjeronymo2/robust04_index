			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin hopes  that on June 22 the State Duma will endorse the final draft of  the Federal budget for 1994.    Talking to newsmen at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport before  boarding a flight for Milan, Chernomyrdin said the Federation  Council, too, would be able to see what was what in the economy  and would endorse the budget.    According to Chernomyrdin, the Duma committees had done a  great job. After the draft budget was presented to the Duma on  May 11, he said, they came out with more than 300 amendments to  that document. Doing it all over again would make no sense,  Chernomyrdin said. His impression was, some individuals were  simply afraid to have nothing to do.    In Chernomyrdin's view, it was about time for the government  to work on a draft budget for 1995, instead of going back to  what it had already done.    Chernomyrdin said the government had pledged to come out  with  a draft budget for 1995 in September.</p>

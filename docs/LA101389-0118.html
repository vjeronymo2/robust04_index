			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHWEST ORDERS, OPTIONS JETLINERS WORTH $5.2 BILLION  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines said Thursday that it placed orders and options for 90  jetliners worth $5.2 billion from Boeing Co.  </P> <P> The St. Paul-based carrier said the largest aircraft order in its history  consists of firm orders for six Boeing 747-400 long-range aircraft and 40  Boeing 757-200 jetliners. The order also includes options for four more 747s  and another 40 of the medium-range 757s.  </P> <P> Northwest, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, said the firm orders are worth  about $2.7 billion and the options $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> But the airline, target of a $3.65-billion leveraged buyout led by investor  Alfred A. Checchi, said it has not yet decided how to pay for the planes, which  may be purchased or leased.  </P> <P> In an LBO, investors borrow heavily to buy a company and use cash from its  operations, and often asset sales, to pay off the debt.  </P> <P> Airlines typically place small deposits with the manufacturer when making large  aircraft orders to reserve "delivery positions" on crowded assembly lines.  </P> <P> U.S. airlines have been ordering planes at a record clip for the past few years  to replace older jetliners and accommodate growing passenger traffic,  particularly on overseas routes.  </P> <P> The Northwest order is a blow to Europe's Airbus Industrie, which had  previously won large orders from Northwest.  </P> <P> The first delivery of the new planes is scheduled for the second half of 1993,  with all aircraft arriving by 1998, Northwest said.  </P> <P> A Boeing official said it was too early to tell whether a 9-day-old strike by  union machinists would affect delivery of the planes.  </P></p>

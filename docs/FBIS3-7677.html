The presidential party will land  at Tan Son Nhat International Airport at 1815. He will be met  at the a?rport by Phan Chanh Truk, people's committee vice  chairman, and Vu Hac Bong, foreign affairs director. A dinner  honoring the president will be hosted by Truong Tan Sang,  chairman of Ho Chi Minh's People's Committee.    During the president's first night in Vietnam, he was a  guest  at a dinner hosted by Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh. It was  on this occasion that he proposed the demilitarization of the  Spratly Islands. The president said that the tension in the  Spratly Islands will be eliminated if the six countries claiming  the islands agree to pull out their respective forces there.    [Begin Ramos recording in English] I therefore propose that  all the claimant states and other Southeast Asian nations  jointly study matters related to the possible demilitarization  of the area; a freeze on all destabilizing activities; marine  research and environmental protection; joint development  ventures; confidence-building measures among the elements in the  area; and, similar cooperative undertakings for the benefit of  all. [end recording]    In a news conference at Hanoi, the president emphasized the  importance of his visit to Vietnam.    [Begin Ramos recording in progress, in English]...with the  vigorous economies of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the  Socialist Republic of Vietnam as one of the most significant I  have made. With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states,  the Philippines has a shared destiny. There is no alternative  to peace and economic cooperation among us in this region that  we all inhabit. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the president had the chance to visit the  Mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revolutionary leader. The  president also visited the assembly plant of Vietnam Motors  Corporation [VMC]. Here is a report from David Jude Sta. Ana:    [Begin recording in English] [Sta. Ana] President Ramos  paid tribute to Vietnam's past -- offering a wreath at the  mausoleum of the late Ho Chi Minh -- considered as the founding  father of the unified Vietnam. He is fondly remembered as Uncle  Ho. Ho Chi Minh led the struggle for liberation from France and  the United States. Ironically, however, Ho Chi Minh died before  his dream of a unified Vietnam was realized in 1975.    Today, also, the president paid tribute to the future  economic cooperation between Manila and Hanoi. In his visit to  the Vietnam Motors Corporation assembly plant, Mr. Ramos urged  Filipino businessmen to forge more joint venture deals with the  Vietnamese and other Asian industries. Formed in 1992, the VMC  is a partnership between Filipinos and Vietnamese with the help  of Japanese and Korean car manufacturers. Manila-based  Columbian Motors Corporation owns 70 percent of the firm, while  Vietnam's Transportation Ministry owns the rest.    [Ramos] There are some among our countrymen who think, and I  say, they think very wrongly, that when Filipino financiers,  managers, and experts export their services and their technical  expertise abroad that the Philippines loses. That is not  correct. Jobs are also being created for our countrymen because  they must run the shops, they must operate the factories that  produce spare parts, components, and set assemblies for this  factory in Vietnam.    [Sta. Ana] Last year alone, $7 million worth of  Philippine-made components were used by the VMC. The plant is  run by 11 Filipino supervisors, and VMC General Manager Butch  Roa said they plan to enter into more joint venture deals with  other car firms, and business has been good.    [Roa] Government is very...the government is very pragmatic.  If they have a decision which is not suitable to your  requirements and you appeal to them, they listen. They listen  and they adopt.    [Sta. Ana] This plant which currently employs 300 will  expand operations later this year, assembling the BMW 5 series  which will be sold to foreign nationals here in Vietnam, which  is a growing market.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Zhurun and Ni Siyi] </F>   [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese press  will eventually be guided by law and self-discipline, leaving  the government to plan and supervise in accordance with the law.    According to Liang Heng, deputy director of the State Press  and Publication Administration (SPPA), a draft of China's first  publication law will be submitted to the Legislative Affairs  Commission of the National People's Congress for deliberation  this year.    The draft, prepared by the administration, has been  "repeatedly revised and is now ready for legislative  procedures." As regards the country's first press law,  "legislative procedures are to be completed within two or three  years."    Government decrees have, until now, been the guidance for  China's press work. "Work will be intensified to ensure that  law and self- discipline do the job," said Liang, who is in  charge of the press work.    As the government body in charge of the press and publishing  industries, Liang specified, the SPPA will, in addition to  planning and supervision, be responsible for drafting laws and  decrees and selecting and awarding government prizes.    "Self-discipline" means "instituting ethical standards or  rules of conduct for journalists and writers in fulfilling their  social responsibilities," Liang said.    The official cited the All-China Journalists Association,  which has issued a norm of professional ethics for journalists  throughout the country.    Local journalists' associations are busy preparing norms  that  suit local conditions, he added.    In implementing laws and decrees, Liang said, the SPPA will  continue to ban illegal publications, including those of "an  excessively low taste or pornographic."    But that does not amount to censorship. "Newspaper and  magazine editors independently decide what to publish in  accordance with state laws, government policies and their own  editorial policies," he said.    SPPA officials do read and check up some publications after  they come off the press. But they insisted that this was to  ensure a "healthy development of China's press and publishing  industries for the good of the entire people."    One was Zhang Bohai, a former editor of the People's  Literature Publishing House and now an SPPA "examiner." "For me  and my colleagues, the most gratifying thing is to conclude,  after reading, that the publications are of high quality and  taste," he said.    "Unless the problems in a certain publication are  exceptionally serious, we will not take administrative measures  against it," he added.    In most cases, the problems are referred to the editor with  advice on improvement.    By the end of 1993, he added, 2,039 newspapers and about  8,000 other periodicals had registered with SPPA. Among them,  Zhang said, "only four or five were ordered to close down for  grave problems."    China's press and publications industry had a boom in 1993,  the number of newspapers registering a 13.9 growth. This year,  SPPA officials said, the growth in the number of newspapers will  be "controlled somewhat" for better quality.    The policy is one of aiding those "of high quality and  popular" in their development and helping those of inferior  quality to improve.    Meanwhile, new publications badly needed in China's economic  construction will have priority to get registered, and this  policy also applies to publications of science and technology or  in languages of China's ethnic minority nationalities.</p>

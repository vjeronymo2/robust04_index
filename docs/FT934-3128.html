			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / CBI fears effects of sick-pay move The Confederation of British Industry fears that the government's move to make large employers responsible for all statutory sick pay heralds a wider shift towards loading social responsibilities on to companies. Although companies overall will save Pounds 160m more in reductions in National Insurance than they will pay out in statutory sick pay when new legislation is introduced in April, the CBI is still concerned. Mr Steve Palmer, CBI deputy director of employment affairs, said yesterday: 'We are not at all happy about the way that this reimbursement has been removed even though it will not involve any extra cost for most companies. We believe it's the thin end of the wedge. 'We are already moving in the same direction on maternity pay.' The CBI fears that the government may in future try to burden employers with other benefit areas, such as those for industrial injuries and family credit. It points out that historically employers only took on payment of statutory sick pay to ease the government's administrative load. It also believes that by accepting the duty to pay a statutory benefit it will do nothing to reduce vulnerability to future National Insurance increases. Mr Palmer said: 'Statutory sick pay will have gone but there is nothing to stop the government increasing the rate of National Insurance in the future.' At present larger companies can claim reimbursement of 80 per cent of the costs of statutory sick pay but this is being abolished in April.</p>

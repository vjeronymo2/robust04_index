			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT SPOILED BID TO SOLVE BISHOP'S MURDER, SALVADORANS SAY  </P> <P> Officials in the Salvadoran government say that the 1980 assassination of  Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, which helped spark the nation's civil war and  caused worldwide outrage, will remain unresolved because of a Supreme Court  ruling that the testimony of a key witness is not valid.  </P> <P> The ruling, handed down Dec. 21, has caused an uproar in El Salvador,  escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the  Christian Democrats of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the rightist  Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), the main opposition party.  </P> <P> "In fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked," said Roberto  Giron Flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was  fired Dec. 23 by the Arena-controlled National Assembly.  </P> <P> U.S. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by  the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political  sources say the Americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the  case.  </P> <P> Romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military  repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on March 24, 1980,  while saying Mass. It was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out  by the death squads, and Duarte had vowed to punish those responsible.  </P> <P> Former U.S. Ambassador Robert E. White asserted that the killing was ordered by  Roberto d'Aubuisson, a founder of Arena and currently a legislator in the  National Assembly. D'Aubuisson has denied the allegation.  </P> <P> In November, 1987, Duarte made public testimony given to investigators by Amado  Garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. Garay said  that he worked for Alvaro Saravia, a cashiered Salvadoran air force captain and  protege of D'Aubuisson. Garay said that after the killing, Saravia reported on  the success of the operation to D'Aubuisson.  </P> <P> D'Aubuisson declared at the time that Garay was lying and rejected the  allegations.  </P> <P> Based on Garay's testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and  other elements of his testimony were investigated, the Salvadoran government,  with U.S. help, asked for Saravia's extradition from Miami, where he was living  illegally.  </P> <P> Saravia was arrested in Miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been  held since, as the extradition request proceeded. He was to have been  extradited in early January, according to legal sources.  </P> <P> But the Salvadoran Supreme Court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and  Christian Democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled Dec. 21 that there  were no grounds for arresting Saravia if he returned to El Salvador and that  the extradition request itself was illegal.  </P> <P> The court ruled that delay in presentation of Garay's evidence, after "seven  years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his  testimony" and resulted in no evidence linking Saravia to the killing.  </P> <P> "The problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been  totally dominated by Arena, which blocks the investigation and application of  justice," said Antonio Morales Erlich, secretary general of the Christian  Democrats. "I want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented  in the Romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order."  </P> <P> On Dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the  Arena deputies supporting the move, fired Giron Flores as attorney general,  alleging "incompetence and immorality," and named Arena sympathizer Roberto  Garcia Alvarado to replace him.  </P> <P> "The truth is that I was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because  the Romero case was about to be resolved," Giron Flores said. "Saravia was  about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . The  Romero case is now closed, and I was fired so the case could be closed."  </P> <P> Knowledgeable observers say that Giron Flores is correct, because, by ruling  that the testimony was too old -- although no Salvadoran law places time limits  on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown  out on the same grounds.  </P> <P> "On legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead," said one person familiar  with the case.  </P> <P> Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, after a Mass on  Christmas Day, said, "In the church, we think (Saravia) has valuable  information on this act which convulsed the country."  </P> <P> Arena's presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, said that Giron Flores was  fired for "demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office,"  and Cristiani accused the Christian Democrats of throwing up a "smoke screen"  and "politicizing" the matter by trying to link the firing to the Romero case.  </P> <P> The investigation into Romero's killing was being handled by a special  investigative unit that had received U.S. training. According to two people  involved in the investigation, Saravia was also to be charged upon his return  here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of Carlos Guerra Campos, a wealthy  coffee grower. Investigators said that they planned to use the Guerra Campos  case to force Saravia to give evidence in the Romero case.  </P> <P> "It was to be our checkmate move," one investigator said.  </P> <P> Investigators also said that Garay had identified Dr. Hector Antonio Regalado,  a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was  no hard evidence other than Garay's statement linking him to the shooting.  </P> <P> Regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the Constituent Assembly  when D'Aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that  Regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.  </P></p>

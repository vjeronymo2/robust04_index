			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cuts reflect poor returns FURTHER cuts in with-profits life policy bonuses were announced this week, in the wake of the trend-setting 9 per cent reductions announced by Norwich Union in December. The bonus cuts reflect the poor investment returns achieved by life insurance companies in the late 1980s. The more buoyant stock market conditions of the early 1980s, and competitive pressures in the life industry, had previously pushed up bonus rates. But as Chris Dell, assistant general manager (life) of Clerical Medical said, 'since 1987 stock markets have been relatively flat and looking ahead, I have no expectation that, in the short term, it will be possible to match the investment returns of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The consequence is a reduction in maturity values for most policies, particularly for shorter terms.' Although the traditional structure of annual (reversionary) and maturity (terminal) bonuses might already seem complicated enough, Clerical Medical has followed Norwich Union in switching to two kinds of reversionary bonus. Previously, bonuses were paid as a percentage of the sum assured plus any attaching bonuses that had already been declared. Now, those elements have been separated, with the bonus on the sum assured being cut from 5.1 per cent to 4 per cent, and that on the previous bonuses being increased to 7 per cent. The effect will be to push the growth in value of the policy towards the later years. The maturity value of longer term policies also benefits from the stronger share prices of the late 1970s and early 1980s. So at Clerical Medical, a male (30 years old at outset) paying premiums of Pounds 30 a month, will see a January 1992 maturity value on a 10 year policy of Pounds 7,576, a 5.7 per cent fall from last year. On a 25 year policy, the drop is just 0.9 per cent (to Pounds 61,283 from Pounds 61,789). At General Accident, the returns on 20 and 25 year policies are actually being increased, although cuts are being made on 10 and 15 year policies. A male, 29 at outset, who paid Pounds 30 a month, will see a maturity value of Pounds 65,255 on a 25 year policy, up 3.4 per cent on 1991. But the same man with a 15 year policy will receive just Pounds 17,141, down 2.7 per cent on last year. Standing against the trend is Sun Alliance, which is maintaining its bonus rates this year after making small cuts in both 1988 and 1990.</p>

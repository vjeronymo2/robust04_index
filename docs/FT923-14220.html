			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / State of defence vehicles attacked THE Ministry of Defence should consider contract hiring or leasing of new vehicles because the old ones cost too much to repair, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said yesterday, Daniel Green writes. The MoD was 'running over-age vehicles and incurring costs on uneconomic repairs' because it lacked the cash for purchases of replacements, the committee said. The Treasury and the MoD should consider alternatives to purchase. The MoD was also criticised for poor management information on the state of its fleet of support vehicles. The committee called for 'a careful independent review' of the vehicle needs of the services. The recommendation comes as defence budgets are under scrutiny from the Treasury. This week's white paper forecast a fall in real defence spending over the next three years.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Management: Running the show - Puma's new boss is blending US and German styles / Euromanagers to watch AT 30 years of age, Jochen Zeitz, the new head of Puma, is so young he even has a few years' advantage over some of the top athletes sponsored by the sports shoe and clothing company. By the standards of German business, where top executives in their 40s are a rarity, he is just out of kindergarten. Linford Christie, the British sprinter who sped to victory in the men's 100m at last week's world athletics championships in Stuttgart, is his senior. So is Merlene Ottey, the Jamaican who won the women's 200m. Both are 33. Christie paraded his Puma allegiance when warming up for the 100m relay, in which Britain was beaten by the US team. 'Biggest, baddest, best' was emblazoned on his T-shirt, which carried his individual sprint time of 9.87 seconds and the Puma logo. Stuttgart was good news for Puma, which needs all the promotional help it can get. Now owned by Aritmos, the Swedish sports and leisure group, it has had a rough ride since its non-voting shares were floated on the German stock market in 1986. In common with Adidas, its larger rival - both are based in the north Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach and were founded by members of the Dassler family - it has suffered from the market onslaught of aggressive US competitors such as Nike and Reebok. The German companies were slow to react to changing tastes. Today, Puma is only a bit player in the US market, though it is rebuilding its position, and is under pressure from its Swedish owner to put on a stronger financial performance. Zeitz is the man chosen by Aritmos to do this. He is Puma's fourth chief executive in two years. A former Colgate-Palmolive marketing employee with experience in the US and Germany, he was at Puma for four years before his promotion to the top job. His ascendancy reflects a more aggressive approach at Aritmos - which yesterday announced a first-half loss of SKr116m (Pounds 9.7m) - under the influence of its new 44 per cent shareholder, the Proventus investment group with the hands-on management style. Zeitz admits he was somewhat surprised to be given the job - not so much because of his age, but because his three predecessors had all come from outside the company. As marketing director, however, Zeitz made his mark by shaking up the division and injected US-style methods he had learnt at Colgate. 'The key points they (Aritmos) were looking for were - experience in the sports goods sector and international thinking, but also knowledge of German specifics, which a German understands better than a foreigner. That's why they decided on me.' Today, he reckons German companies are not just seeking an international education, but also experience abroad. 'You have to be able to react flexibly to different situations. You need wide horizons and you have to understand different opinions, views and cultures. You can't do this with a purely German mentality.' Zeitz, a doctor's son whose business education began at the European Business School near Wiesbaden, appears every inch the young, clean-cut German manager. He believes in fast decision-making, minimal hierarchies, and total communication with fellow managers. In the past, he says, 'decisions were handed out by the board whose members kept things very much to themselves.' Much has changed since the company was run by the Dasslers, and Zeitz is not the first boss with international experience. After Puma started struggling in 1986, the family brought in Hans Woitschatzke as chief executive. Formerly in the pharmaceutical, printing and ski industries, Woitschatzke had worked in Canada, Venezuela and the US, as well as Germany. He left Puma in 1991, having returned it to a small profit which then evaporated in 1992. With much of the world now in recession, including Germany, which accounts for more than half the company's turnover, Zeitz has had to implement a rapid restructuring programme. This has involved closure of the shoe plant in Germany - most supplies already came from the far east - extensive job cuts, and the creation of profit centres for the international (licensing and distribution), German, foreign subsidiaries (including other European markets, Australia and Asia), and Hong Kong-based purchasing activities. He has cut down on company cars and said all travel should be economy class. 'My aim is to make changes as quickly as possible, so this comprehensive restructuring was done in two months. The need is not to do things step-by-step, but deal with problems at once.' Since Puma is by no means a corporate giant, with turnover of DM513m (Pounds 202m) in 1992, an 11 per cent drop on 1991 - licence business lifted this to DM1.2bn - such sweeping changes can be introduced more readily than at a larger group such as Volkswagen. With Aritmos, driven by the performance-oriented Proventus, looking over Zeitz's shoulder, the pressure to perform is even greater. Because of the restructuring costs, Puma will make an increased loss this year, a return to profit being the goal for 1995. Rapid decisions are essential, Zeitz believes. 'Sometimes, it's better to make an early decision that's not 100 per cent right than none at all,' he says in a most un-German comment. He draws two important lessons from his experience of running a German company with a Swedish shareholder. Firstly, the German consensus-minded way of doing things, however laudable its long-term strategic aims, is often too inflexible and laden with compromise in these days of fast-moving markets, consumer preferences and product innovation. Secondly, he believes other countries can learn much from Swedish management. 'There are good things in the German and US management styles, but the Swedish approach is a good combination. On the one hand, there is the long-term vision and the sense of continuity, as in Germany. But there is also the fast pragmatic decision-making which is the positive side of the US practice.' For Zeitz this means Puma has to do more than just sell shoes to make money. It has to put across a convincing image. At Stuttgart, the triumphs of Christie, Ottey, and Colin Jackson, the world record 110m hurdle champion, - a mere lad at 26 - helped publicise the Puma name. 'We want people with charisma, not just those who are number one,' Zeitz stresses. 'The consumer identifies with the image of a brand not just the product. We've got to communicate what the product stands for.'</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fulcrum Inv Trust Net asset value per capital share of Fulcrum Investment Trust stood at 63.12p at the half year ended October 31, against 48.11p six months earlier and 34.04p for the comparable period. However, because of a refinancing which was completed at the end of June last year, and two new loan facilities in sterling and dollars which were agreed before the period end, last year's figures were not comparable. Net revenue amounted to Pounds 497,467 for earnings per income share of 4.43p. A second interim dividend of 1.4p makes a total for the year to date of 2.8p.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> PLANNERS SUGGEST ALLOWING RV SALES  </P> <P> The Camarillo Planning Commission on Tuesday recommended that the City Council  amend the municipal code to allow the sales of recreational vehicles, equipment  and services in areas zoned for limited manufacturing.  </P> <P> Planning Director Matthew A. Boden said the change was proposed to satisfy a  party interested in establishing an RV sales facility in the city.  </P> <P> The amendment would require a minimum parcel of 15 acres for such uses.  </P> <P> In another change to city ordinances, the commission recommended that the  council allow certified farmers markets within the city limits. If the council  approves the amendment, farmers markets, which are banned in the city, would be  established.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission also recommended changes to the city's General Plan  relating to the use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials. If the  council approves the changes, the Planning Department would have greater  control over the location, storage and use of chemicals that are deemed by the  state to be hazardous.  </P> <P> The council is expected to address these issues at its Aug. 8 meeting.  </P> <P> A previously scheduled public hearing relating to a proposed ordinance  regulating amateur radio antennas was postponed by the commission until Sept.  4.

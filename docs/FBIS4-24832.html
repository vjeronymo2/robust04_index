			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 2 (CNA) -- Fu Chun-fan, new president  of China Airlines (CAL), said Thursday [2 Jun] that CAL will  stress air safety following the CAL plane crash in Japan in  April.    Fu made the remarks when he took over the CAL presidency  from  Yuan Hsing-yuan, who resigned earlier to take responsibility for  the tragic disaster in Nagoya, Japan in which 264 of the 271  aboard were killed.    Fu, 52, said air safety will be CAL's top priority and CAL  will also work to provide the best service to passengers. He  stressed that stringent safety standards requirements will help  ensure air safety.    Fu, who first served as a CAL counter clerk in 1966, becomes  the first civilian to take the CAL's helm.    Fu also took the opportunity to refute reports in the United  States media that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  will suspend CAL flights to the United States because of the  Nagoya crash.    Fu said that Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator,  was misquoted in THE WASHINGTON POST, which reported on the FAA  decision.    Fu also voiced his discontent over Japanese media reports  that have not been confirmed by a Japanese task force  investigating the cause of the air crash.    Fu said Japanese reports that traces of alcohol had been  found in the blood of the pilot and co-pilot of the ill-fated  plane were not only unfair to CAL but also a serious violation  of international practice.    Fu said that he has conveyed his discontent to the special  task force in Japan. This is the first time a high-ranking CAL  official has openly voiced discontent about Japanese media  reports on the disaster.    During the change over ceremony Wednesday, Chiang Hung-yi  took over the post of CAL chairman from Liu The-min.    Chiang, 68, said that his top priority will be to deal with  the aftermath of the Nagoya plane crash and to step up air  safety.</p>

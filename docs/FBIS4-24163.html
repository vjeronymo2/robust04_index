			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The interim president of Burundi, Mr. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya, today held a press conference at the Novotel  Hotel for local and foreign reporters. He talked about the  institution of the president, the pirate radio which can  currently be heard on the national territory, security, the  economy, etc. I suggest you listen to the statement he issued  before allowing journalists to ask their questions. Before  issuing his statement, the interim head of state said the deputy  speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. Christian Sendegeya, had  tendered his resignation to him. Here is President  Ntibantunganya.    [Begin Ntibantunganya recording] [Words indistinct] April  1994, Burundi is once again at a political impasse without a  head of state with all the powers invested in him by the  Constitution. This followed the untimely death of President  Ntaryamira. Since 12 April, there has been an interim  presidency which ends on 12 July.    Many of you are asking yourselves several questions related  to the future of this beautiful country which everyone  cherishes, but which causes concern. One question lingers on  the lips of everyone: When will we have a head of state with all  the powers endowed to him by the Constitution. This question is  even more pressing when one sees what is happening around us,  first in our country, and then in the neighboring country of  Rwanda. In the light of this, people are very worried. [passage  omitted]    Besides the serious, shameful and reprehensible interethnic  massacres, political score-settling, and all sorts of crimes  which have been committed, the country today is on the verge of  an abyss. Distrust among citizens, notably with reference to  their political and ethnic affiliations, has reached its climax.  [passage omitted]    For the last few days, pirate radio broadcasts have been  heard in some parts of the country. It broadcasts messages  which are contrary to peaceful co-existence between the various  groups in the country, notably ethnic and professional groups.  The government would like the population to note that the radio  is functioning in violation of the country's laws. The  government is determined to do everything to cripple it.  [passage omitted]    Peace must be everyone's priority. That is why the  government has been working hard all week to accelerate and  finalize, through consultations between the various political  and social partners, the process of establishing the institution  of the president of the Republic with all the powers invested in  him by the Constitution. This is an extremely strategic  objective for peace and security in the country. That is why  all the national political partners must combine efforts, show  proof of good will, and be sensitive to the call issued to them  by the Burundi people who are concerned about what they consider  to be stagnation of this process.

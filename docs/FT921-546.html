			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): M &amp; G offer closes The offer for the M &amp; G Recovery Investment Trust has now closed, with widespread expectations that it will not have raised as much as the Pounds 246m the group raised for its Income Trust last year. The share price of that trust, which was largely bought by investors for its high yield, has drifted down to around 92p since issue from the 100p offer price. Both issues have split capital structures.</p>

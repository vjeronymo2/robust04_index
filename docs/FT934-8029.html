			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen expands operations in China VOLKSWAGEN, the German carmaker, is expanding its operations in China with the development of its joint venture with First Automobile Works, the state-owned vehicle maker, in Changchun in north-east China. VW signed a letter of intent in Beijing yesterday under which it is planned that FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, the joint venture company in which it holds 40 per cent, will take over the assembly of the Audi 100 in China. This car has been assembled under licence since 1988 by FAW, which is chiefly a producer of light commercial vehicles and also produces the Chinese state limousine, the 'Red Flag'. The Volkswagen group is already the leading carmaker in China, one of the world's fastest growing car markets, with two joint ventures in Changchun and Shanghai. It is developing capacity to produce more than 330,000 cars a year in China by 1996, by which time the country is likely to be its third most important market worldwide. VW said yesterday that FAW had assembled more than 45,000 Audi 100s since the start of assembly under licence. Capacity is being raised in order to produce 30,000 Audi cars a year by 1995. The Audi 100 is the only car selected by the Chinese authorities for use by senior state officials. FAW-Volkswagen Automotive, which is to take over control of the Audi 100 assembly, is already developing a plant in Changchun to produce 150,000 cars a year by 1996 in a DM1.5bn project including engine and gearbox manufacturing as well as car assembly. The joint venture will assemble VW Golf/Jetta-sized cars both for the domestic Chinese market and for export to other markets in south-east Asia. Small-scale production has already started on the basis of assembling CKD kits (completely knocked-down) supplied from Germany and South Africa, with 8,050 VW Jettas produced in China last year. Volkswagen formed its first joint venture in China in 1985 when it took a 50 per cent stake in the Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Company for the local production of the VW Santana.</p>

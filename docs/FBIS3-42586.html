			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Nikolayev under the rubric "Fighters": </F> "Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia Fights Against  U.S. Influence--and Defines Social Utility of a Individual"]    [Text] The central coordinating council of the Federation  of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR] adopted a decision  "to boycott the Association of Independent Trade Unions of  Russia and its foreign `coaches' represented by American AFL-CIO  trade unions." The reason, as the FITUR statement said, is that  "lately the American AFL-CIO representation in Russia has been  increasingly intensifying its fight against the independent  trade unions of Russia with the purpose of destroying those  trade unions that take a position of independence and defend  both the interests of the workers and the national interests of  the country." In the process, in the opinion of federation  members, the American trade unions' representation is  "searching" for those among the Russian trade union leaders who  "can be bought for dollars," artificially creating "shell" trade  union organizations that could feed on the difficulties of the  stage of formation of the independent trade union movement. In  the opinion of the statement's authors, "the role of the  so-called Association of Independent Trade Unions of  Russia"--recently created within the framework of the  Russian-American Foundation for Trade Union Research and  Education and financed by the U.S. Congress--"is precisely  this--to imitate such `trade union' activities whereby the  workers, instead of fighting for their rights, would blindly  follow the American policy course in our country."    In this connection the leadership of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia asserted that the actions of  the American AFL-CIO representation in Moscow "are aimed at  undermining the national interests of Russia."    As Aleksandr Alekseyev, FITUR chairman, told the SEGODNYA  correspondent, the central coordinating council of his  federation currently has information regarding "several Russian  trade union leaders already having been bought by Americans."  This, in turn, in Aleksandr Alekseyev's opinion, will lead in  the near future to a situation whereby the activities of a  number of Russian trade union organizations may end up "under  U.S. control."    In this situation, FITUR--one of the major trade union  associations which includes representatives of metallurgical,  oil, and machine-building industries, pilots and military  servicemen, among others--intends to take response measures.  Among them is creating on the basis of their trade unions the  National Labor Party, which was registered several days ago with  the Ministry of Justice. "We have one goal--to strive for the  maximum participation of workers in the political life of the  country for the purpose of building a `socially-oriented  state,'" said Mr. Alekseyev. According to him, members of the  party will act on the assumption that the basis of any state is  labor; labor is the primary source of human rights and defines  an individual's social freedom. Thus, in Mr. Alekseyev's  opinion, labor for the good of the nation should become a social  obligation of any citizen and the only criterion for determining  social utility both of an individual and of various social  groups.</p>

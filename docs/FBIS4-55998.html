			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 25 (ATA) -- The spokesman of the Foreign  Ministry reports that the recent clamour raised by the Greek  Government regarding the announcement of the Tirana Attorney's  Office about the reasons of the arrest of six Albanian citizens  of Greek origin, as well as the statement of the spokesman of  the Greek Government about this question are unjustifiable and  do not serve the normalization of relations between the two  countries and doubts their tones have a direct impact of  electoral passions.    According to its statements, the Greek Government has  undertaken and may undertake further steps towards international  forums such as the [UN] Security Council, European Union, CSCE  and other forums, interpreting this legal action of Albania as a  violation of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania.    The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of  Albania declares that the Albanian Government is ready to  welcome the sending of commissions from the Security Council,  CSCE, European Union and other institutions for a direct  observation of the reality having in their disposal the complete  file of the Albanian Attorney's Office as well as other  documents which prove both the keeping of arms by these persons  without permission and their relations with the Greek secret  service as well as other unconstitutional and secessionist  activities. However, this will not be in the interest of Greece  and of the joint efforts the two countries are making to  overcome the existing contradictions and problems.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Rover workers get 10% pay rise over two years The Rover Group has signalled an upward turn in British pay deals with a two-year award of about 10 per cent for most of its 33,000 employees. Average settlements in the engineering industry are still running at about the rate of inflation, currently 2.4 per cent. But the Rover deal could exacerbate pay pressures as inflation is expected to increase gently over the coming year and unemployment continues to fall. Mr Alistair Hatchett, of the independent pay analyst Incomes Data Services, said: 'This could be a weather-vane settlement for the private sector and will be taken as a benchmark in the West Midlands.' The pay agreement - the first since the company was taken over by the German car group BMW earlier this year - is a reflection of Rover's recent success and follows a pay freeze in the first six months of 1993. But the deal will not make it popular with other car companies, such as Jaguar, which begin negotiations this weekend. The exact size of the rise is disputed. The company says that everyone will receive a 3.7 per cent rise from next month and a further 4 per cent, or the rate of inflation if it is higher, from November 1995. It also says that some workers will get extra payments for accepting a grading change. Following Rover's 'new deal' agreed with the unions in 1992, the company has been phasing out demarcation lines and distinctions between blue and white-collar workers. The latest move involves merging five manual grades and six staff grades into three joint grades. The unions say that most employees will get an extra payment of about Pounds 5 a week in the first year and another Pounds 1.86 a week in the second for accepting the change. Mr Tony Woodley, the national motor industry secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'That means that almost all workers will be getting between 9.2 and 11.1 per cent over the two years, with most getting 10.7 per cent.' Mr Woodley said he would recommend the deal for acceptance in a ballot of union members. He also said that he would be informing his German union colleagues. I G Metall, the motor industry union, puts in its claim for this year's engineering industry pay round next week. But I G Metall in Frankfurt said last night: 'Rover may now be a German company but circumstances are still very different in the two countries.' Rover counts the benefits, Page 6</p>

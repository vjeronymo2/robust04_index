			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Wolfgang Holzmair - Recital For a couple of years Wolfgang Holzmair's Lieder singing seemed to be the best-kept secret of Wigmore Hall audiences. On one occasion I recall the young Austrian baritone looking genuinely surprised at his reception. No more; these days he is to be found in recital across several continents and plentiful recordings are promised. He has taken strides forward since his London debut four years ago. Tuesday's programme at the Wigmore Hall was all Schubert, taking Schwanengesang as its backbone, but adding extra songs with words by Seidl and Rellstab to give it body. Brigitte Fassbaender and Peter Schreier have offered the same basic idea before, but they did not start with the last song, 'Die Taubenpost', and then sing it again for an encore, as Holzmair did - a strange idea, but not unpleasing. His accompanist on this occasion was a noted Schubert pianist in her own right, Imogen Cooper. Unlike Andra's Schiff, who was in the audience, she did not accompany with a soloist's flair. The Bosendorfer's lid was firmly down; the sound was unvaryingly soft and demure, leaving Holzmair's baritone to take the limelight for itself. It was difficult to call this a partnership in any meaningful sense. Beautifully moulded though her playing was, Cooper did not really dramatise the songs at all. By the time she had reached a contrasting mood, Holzmair was up and away, several new ideas further on. He has always been a restless singer, apt to veer from one dynamic extreme to the other in quick succession, but a far greater degree of discipline is now in evidence. At his best - a seductive 'Liebesbotschaft', a powerful 'Der Doppelganger' - it is difficult to think of another young recitalist to match him. Holzmair has a lot to say about the music he sings and the technique (except in those awkward octave rises of 'Kriegers Ahnung') to put it across. His baritone sounds as though it was born with its wide range of expression. Meltingly romantic tone colours and bitter, dark anger come to it with equal ease. The conclusion must be that Holzmair is well on target to fulfil his early promise. Incidentally, the second time that he sang 'Die Taubenpost' was even better than the first - a knowing and affectionate smile in the voice that worked as well for this song as any performance I can remember.</p>

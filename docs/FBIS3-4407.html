Present at the reception were provincial leaders Gu  Jinchi, Yue Qifeng, Zhang Guoguang, Wen Shizhen, Zhang Rongmao,  and Guo Tingbiao; and leaders and reporters of XINHUA news  agency, RENMIN RIBAO, the Central People's Broadcasting Station,  and the Central Television Station. The reception was chaired  by Wen Shizhen, executive vice governor of the provincial  government. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party  committee, made a speech ahead of others at the reception.    He said: Liaoning's development cannot be divorced from the  support of press units. On behalf of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, I express thanks to you.    Gu Jinchi said: Liaoning's development targets have been  defined. After the convocation of the second session of the  eighth National People's Congress, we will work out new  development targets according to the guidelines of this session.  Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and with  the support of press units, we should continue to develop  Liaoning and [words indistinct]. I hope that the comrades of  the press units will develop more opinions and share suggestions  on Liaoning's development.    At the reception, Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech in  regard  to the 1993 ideas for readjusting the economic structure and  doing the second pioneering work as well as the new changes in  Liaoning's economic pattern.    He said: First, the backward agricultural and rural economic  situation was changed. Last year, the grain output reached  16,960,000 tonnes. The province not only became self-sufficient  in grain and major nonstaple foods but also started to export  some farm and sideline products. Second, the situation where  local industries developed slowly was changed. The provincial  party committee and the provincial government clearly set forth  the ideology of having large industries to guide the development  of small ones and [words indistinct]. At the time of enlivening  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, we have  concentrated great efforts to develop local minor industries.  The output value realized by the local minor industries in 1993  reached 111.23 billion yuan, an increase of 68.4 percent over  the previous year. Third, the unitary ownership structure was  changed. Non-state economy, as a new economic growing point in  Liaoning's second pioneering work, develops at a fast speed.  Fourth, the unitary form of revenues was changed. Due to the  step-by-step formation of new financial resources, such as town  and township enterprises, district and neighborhood economy,  tertiary industry, individual and private economy, and three  kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, the revenues increased each  passing year.    Yue Qifeng said: With these new changes, Liaoning's economic  structure is more suitable to the needs of the market economic  development and more conducive to bringing into play various  advantages and [words indistinct]. All this has brought  prospects for rejuvenating Liaoning's economy.</p>

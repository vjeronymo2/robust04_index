			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods and the rudder travel limiter fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes. (This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted as a part of a sampling program carried out by the manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by water accumulating in the lower part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rods and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards), which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1033, dated February 23, 1994, describes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for inspecting the elevator trim, rudder trim, and rudder travel limitation rods to determine the orientation of the open rod end. It also describes procedures for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation of water between the internal and external tubes of the rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;001&hyph;018(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1012, Revision 3, dated October 7, 1991, describes procedures for replacing the currently installed fail-safe control rods with rods that have been modified by the addition of a drain hole in the non-open end of the rod and the application of a protective treatment. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1010, Revision 4, dated February 23, 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes procedures for reversing the installation of the ends of the elevator tab rod and rudder tab rod so that the open end of the rods is oriented downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1027, dated July 28, 1993, describes procedures for determining the installation direction of the fail-safe rod of the rudder travel limitation unit (TLU), and replacing the rod if it is installed with its open end oriented upwards. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the orientation of the end of the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods and the rudder travel limiter fail-safe rods, and replacement of those rods having downwards-oriented ends. The actions would be required to be accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airplanes on which Aerospatiale Modification 02723 and Modification 03110 have been installed are not affected by the requirements of this proposed AD. The subject flight control rods on those airplanes have been modified prior to airplane delivery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 28 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,240, or $330 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should replacement of any of the flight control rods be necessary, the number of work hours and the cost of required parts would vary according to the type of replacement accomplished. In a ``worst case scenario'' (all subject rods needing replacement), the cost of parts would be approximately $8,200 per airplane. Labor necessary to accomplish replacement of a rod(s) would vary from 2 work hours to 10 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.

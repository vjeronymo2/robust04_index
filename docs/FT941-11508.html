			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Brussels retreat on works councils The European Commission is watering down its proposal for mandatory elected works councils in pan-European companies, in an effort to garner business support. Instead of a uniform structure for compulsory consultation with workers' representatives, the new draft directive seeks to induce voluntary agreements at company level, with unions and employers deciding their own modus operandi. 'We have gone for the middle course . . . in order to make the proposal more palatable to the employers' side,' said a senior official close to Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner. But if employers and unions fail to agree, then a reduced set of minimum requirements for consultation will be imposed if workers demand them. 'We hope the mere threat of imposed conditions induces agreement,' the official said. The Commission's original proposal has been blocked for more than three years by the UK. But Britain's 11 partners decided to press on with the directive, without the UK, after the Maastricht treaty came into force in November. But British trans-European companies will still be among those most affected. Mr Flynn said: 'The aim of any legislation should be to bring them to the negotiating table and let them agree whatever they think is best.' He added that 'the paradox of this directive is that it will succeed best if it is never applied but that if it did not exist, nothing would happen.' The senior Commission official said that 'the calculation we've made is that this is still a text with something in it for everyone'. But Mr Emilio Gabaglio, general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), described the new plan yesterday as 'a complete U-turn by the Commission' and 'totally unacceptable'. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the Euro-employers lobby, also dismissed the plan as 'unacceptable' in a letter to Commission President Jacques Delors. 'The adoption of such a directive . . . will discourage investment and damage employment prospects,' he said. Brussels is set to approve the plan next Tuesday, from when Unice and ETUC will have six weeks to decide whether they can reach an agreement which obviates the need for the directive. On recent form they are unlikely to do so, and the Commission expects to get the measure into EU law by the end of this year. It will still apply to companies with at least 1,000 employees, and more than a hundred in at least two member states.</p>

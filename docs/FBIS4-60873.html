			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Georgia"]    [Text] On 28 April, the KOMUNISTI newspaper published an  appeal by the Georgian Communist Workers Party [GCWP] Central  Committee to the republic's citizens. The document points out  that the desire of Georgian peoples to get rid of everything  that is negative and "alien to a socialist way of life" has not  been fulfilled. In the opinion of the document's authors, "by  the ambitions of Georgia's national-liberation movement and with  an active support from former communists, the country has been  thrown back to feudalist fragmentation." Georgia, the document  says, has become a beggar on an international scale, and its  people, proud and happy in the not so distant past, are  currently suffering from hunger and poverty.    The GCWP Central Committee thinks that the policy of denying  any protection and depriving the population of the right to  exist amounts to a downright genocide and extermination of one's  own people. All this is the reason for an unrestrained outflow  of the population, including Georgians, from the country.  Georgia's true communists, the document says, do have a plan for  overcoming the crisis.    "We are ready to assume responsibility for the fate of the  country, but for this to be done we must become a party that has  parliamentary seats" -- is how the party's immediate prospects  are described. "By joint efforts, in an open dialogue let us  expose the doings and true political faces of demagogues, idle  talkers, and turncoats both within the parliament walls and  outside them."    The GCWP Central Committee urged people to elect its  representatives to official posts. So far it is hard to say  what influence the GCWP may have on various sectors of the  population, but the documents it has been issuing come to the  attention of many people. In a number of Georgian regions  former party activists are trying to resuscitate district and  city organizations of the Georgian Communist Party.</p>

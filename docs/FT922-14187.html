			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: Lloyd's as tax hedge Sir, To a member of Lloyd's who has suffered crippling losses, the advent of a Labour government would indeed be a double whammy ('Labour: who wins and who loses?', April 5), but other Names able to trade through the present difficulties will almost certainly find their membership proving to be a useful hedge against Labour's tax plans. Historically, membership of Lloyd's has always been of particular benefit in eras of high taxation, so should the worst happen on Thursday, those with the necessary means would be well advised to consider whether membership was appropriate to their circumstances. G N M Mellersh, 47 Quarrendon Street, London SW6 3ST</p>

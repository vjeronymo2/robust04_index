			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / BT plans to reward its smooth operators BT STAFF who whistle while they work could find themselves the proud recipients of a Pierre Cardin simulated pearl necklace or a Sony Walkman, under a management scheme to lift the workforce's low spirits. The scheme is being introduced as BT cuts 24,000 jobs. Managers who feel a particular employee is 'living BT's values' will be able to nominate the individual for a gift to be chosen from a catalogue of 50 items. The Union of Communication Workers, which represents BT telephone operators, reacted angrily. 'This is yet another cynical attempt to manipulate the workforce,' said Ms Janice Stone, a UCW national official. Operators have been particularly badly hit by the job cuts. A recent internal survey found that 44 per cent of the 216,000-strong workforce were afraid of losing their jobs. Only a third of those who took part in the survey were proud of the company. BT, which says it expects to award thousands of the gifts, claims the scheme is a first as it is not an incentive scheme but a reward to staff who implement company values. As an illustration, BT says an installation engineer who alerted a customer to a 'hitherto undiscovered problem with their telephone' and whistled while he fixed it might be eligible for an award if a customer wrote in to say what a 'marvellous advertisement' he was for BT. The UCW is sceptical about how motivated staff will be by the gifts: 'It may be a forlorn hope for BT that giving away trinkets can turn this appalling loss of morale around. Pictures in the brochures of smiling workers applauding a colleague being thanked by a manager are hardly likely to ring many bells with UCW members at BT.' National Grid plan, Page 3</p>

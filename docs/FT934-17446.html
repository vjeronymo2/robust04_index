			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Australia to face budget 'showdown' AUSTRALIA'S opposition coalition yesterday gave notice that it intends to declare a debating 'showdown' over the government's proposed budget bills next Tuesday, when the Senate resumes. The proposed finance package - now split into eight separate bills - has been stalled for six weeks, because the government has been unable to secure necessary support from two minority parties - the Green party and the Democrats - which hold the balance of power in the Senate. In a further effort to secure the budget's passage, Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, has offered to phase in an increased sales tax on wine over a five-year period, and to provide cash grants, marketing funds and some other concessions to wine makers. The tax, as it stands, has been condemned by the wine industry, and has been universally rejected by the opposition and the two minority parties. The response from the wine industry is proving mixed. Small wine makers yesterday expressed some interest in the Dawkins compromise, while the Winemakers Federation of Australia has rejected the deal. Mr John Hewson, opposition leader, said the coalition would continue to hold the line on the wine tax rise. The government has meanwhile insisted it will delay any implementation of the personal tax cuts contained in the budget unless the Senate passes the proposed indirect tax increases by October 21.</p>

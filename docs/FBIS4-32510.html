			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite all peace efforts and realistic views that  the continuation of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is more  senseless than ever before, bloody fighting--mainly between the  Muslim and Serb army and the inter-Muslim conflict in western  Bosnia--continues.    A statement by General Rasim Delic, head of the Muslim army,  calling on his soldiers to leave trenches and launch an  offensive to liberate the country was like adding fuel to the  fire. Here is a commentary by our journalist Ivica Tomic:    The Bosnia-Herzegovina army has in these 10 or 15 days of  truce made large steps in liberating the Vlasic plateau, Gen.  Delic, the chief of the general staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  army, has told VECERNJI LIST. This statement by Delic and some  other of his statements make it clear that an all-out war is  being prepared and that signatures on truce agreements do not  have any meaning any more, since the general openly admits that  his army has made biggest advances during the truce period. The  justification for this lies, of course, in Serb attacks in some  other areas.    While not disputing the right of the Muslims to regain with  weapons what the Serbs had taken from them in the same way we  still cannot be indifferent to the escalation of the war, since  we are all living in the same state and the war cannot leave us  unaffected.    The Croats of Herceg-Bosna were the first to take up arms  and  show everyone that they were ready to defend their own  territory, but never in this war have they launched conquest  operations. It is clear now more than ever before that opting to  defend was the correct decision. We can see now that it was much  easier to defend one's home than have to fight to regain  territory given up without fighting.    The chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna  at its latest session called on the belligerent parties in  western Bosnia to sit at the negotiating table and put an end to  senseless killing. Croats of Herceg-Bosna are for a just peace  with the aggressor's, Serb side. The Serbs must--if not in any  other way then under pressure from the great powers--accept the  peace solution under which they keep as much as 49 percent of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory--more than belongs to them. The  Muslims must also relax their position and give something for  peace. It is obvious that the great powers do not accept the  lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina,  therefore they do not want the war to continue. It is indeed  absurd to wage the war without the blessing of Clinton and the  allies, except--of course--in obvious self-defense.    We have never been closer to peace, but also to an all-out  war. Croats are for peace. Let us hope that Muslim and Serb  politicians are also for peace, and generals should in any case  not be in charge of politics. Generals [words indistinct]. This  is why Delic and Mladic should before the show-down ask their  soldiers whether they are still prepared to get killed.</p>

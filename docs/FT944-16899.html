			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais chases bad loans Credit Lyonnais hopes by the end of next year to recover some FFr12bn (Dollars 2.27bn) of its total FFr70bn worth of doubtful loans for which provisions have been made, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, said yesterday. In an interview with Agence France Presse, he signalled a tougher line in pursuing creditors and for the first time quantified the impact the bank hoped this policy will have on its balance sheet. The bank is involved in legal action to recover its loans to Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman-politician, and has started criminal proceedings against former staff of its International Bankers subsidiary. Credit Lyonnais had often been lax in trying to recover loans once provision for possible non-repayment had been made, a spokesman said yesterday. But it now has FFr70bn in provisioned loans on its books - excluding FFr40bn doubtful real estate loans transferred to a state-guaranteed company earlier this year. Mr Peyrelevade 'firmly hoped' the group's current banking business should show a profit next year. In the first half of this year, pre-tax 'current' operations produced a FFr1.57bn profit.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Prescription for a financial ailment: Market-based capital requirements Imagine gears clashing, the engine sputtering and the car stalling. That is the picture some observers paint of the credit crunch and its impact on the US economy. 'Get credit flowing again,' would seem the remedy. If bank capital requirements stand in the way, reduce them, so that banks can lend again. Such a prescription makes no sense. It is the wrong response to the wrong issue. Less capital is not better. Nor is more capital. What is needed is a franchise that will improve banks' ability to attract capital and capital requirements that are market-based. The so-called credit crunch is no reason to reduce bank capital requirements. Borrowers with the same prospective cash flows and financial ratios as a year ago are getting credit, either from banks or in the capital markets. For them there is no credit crunch. The problem is that borrowers by and large do not have the same financial ratios as they did a year ago. The recession has reduced their cash flows. Consequently, the risk of lending has increased. Companies rated A a year ago and B today are finding it difficult to obtain the same amount of credit at the same rate as they did a year ago. This may be a 'credit crunch', but, if so, it is more a symptom than a cause of the recession. To imply that banks should be supplying credit to such borrowers as if nothing had changed is in effect a recommendation that banks should be less prudent. That is unlikely to do either the economy or the banking system any good. The remedy for recession lies elsewhere. Political uncertainty contributed to the downturn; its removal via the swift victory in the Gulf will contribute to the upturn. Further stimulus has come through monetary and fiscal policy. Most forecasters now expect the recession to end sometime this year. This should spell the end of the credit crunch. To perform their function as financial intermediaries banks need a franchise that will attract capital. Such a franchise would allow banks to branch freely and to offer customers a full range of financial services, including securities and insurance as well as deposit-taking and lending. This allows banks to diversify their sources of income, to make more efficient use of their distribution systems and to realise economies of scale. The EC has given its banks such a franchise through the Second Banking Directive. The US and Japan are lagging behind, although adoption of the recent US Treasury proposal would help close that gap. The purpose of bank capital requirements is to limit the risk that a bank will fail. To do so efficiently such requirements should be market-based. This means putting investors in debt of banks (and of companies, such as Citicorp, that own banks) at risk so that they will exercise market discipline over the bank, and it means relating required capital ratios to the market risks a bank assumes. If investors in a company's debt believe that they are at risk when the organisation becomes illiquid or insolvent, they will effectively control the level of capital that the organisation must maintain. As the perceived level of risk increases, such investors generally (and quickly) reduce the amount of funds that they are willing to provide and/or demand an increase in the rate of return. To counteract this the company must take steps to improve its equity ratios. Citicorp's own experience is a case in point. During the past year investors and rating agencies perceived that the risk of Citicorp paper had increased. As a result, Citicorp had to pay higher rates for certain types of funding and it encountered some difficulty in placing as much paper as it would have liked. We responded by initiating a programme to increase our total capital by Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn over the next three years. The first tranche of the capital increase has come through the issuance of Dollars 1.25bn in convertible preferred stock. A second tranche will come through the sale of non-strategic businesses. The rest should come through retained earnings; to this end we aim to pare costs by Dollars 1.5bn a year while retaining our revenue momentum. With tight control over asset growth, this capital-building programme will improve Citicorp's capital ratios. In designing capital regulation, policymakers should preserve such market discipline. This entails limiting the guarantees that the government provides to depositors or creditors of banks and companies that own banks. Fortunately, both the US and the EC seem ready to do so. The US is discussing ways to limit insurance of bank deposits, and the EC seems determined to keep coverage low. However, limiting guarantees is only the first step. Capital requirements should be imposed on the bank (but not on companies that own banks) and these requirements should be related to the bank's exposure to market risks, such as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and credit risk. The bank's exposure to each risk is its net position (after due allowance for netting, hedging and diversification) times the likely movement in the risk factor, such as the level of interest rates. The bank's overall capital requirement would be the sum of the requirements for each risk, minus an allowance for the fact that some risks (such as interest and exchange rate risk) may themselves be negatively correlated. Elements of this market-based approach are present in the EC's proposed Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD). This directive would apply to non-bank investment firms and to the trading book of banks. For the bank's trading book, the CAD would replace the 8 per cent Basle ratio with separate requirements for credit risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. The CAD holds the promise of establishing a capital regime that will protect both bank and non-bank investment firms while creating a level playing field on which the two would compete. In sum, the credit crunch will pass. Bank regulators need not act. But they must act to give banks a franchise that will attract capital. And they must act to make capital requirements market-based.

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVENTURE TRAVEL: MT. BACHELOR RUNS ARE AMONG BEST IN THE WEST  </P> <P> From the alpine slopes near the top of Mt. Bachelor, descending waves of snow  tumble west toward the main range of the Cascades and south toward the  silhouettes of the California peaks around Mt. Shasta.  </P> <P> Mt. Bachelor is laced with 54 ski runs, including one descent off a nearly  vertical cornice that puts the ski expert into the air for up to a 10-foot  drop.  </P> <P> There are adventures for skiers of every ability on these slopes, where U.S.  ski teams and Olympic contenders have trained for two decades.  </P> <P> Cross-country ski trails rated among the best in the country reach into the 1.6  million acres of central Oregon's Deschutes National Forest, an area larger  than the state of Delaware, and climb up to glaciers rising more than 3,000  feet.  </P> <P> The summit of Mt. Bachelor soars to 9,065 feet. The Mt. Bachelor Ski and Summer  Resort recently was rated by Snow Country magazine as best in the Pacific  Northwest and third-best nationally, behind Vail, Colo., and Squaw Valley,  Calif.  </P> <P> The skiing lasts into the summer months. The area also features white-water  rafting on the Deschutes River, and, rising above nearby Crooked River, the  soaring cliffs and spires of Smith Rock are becoming an increasingly popular  challenge for rock climbers.  </P> <P> Downhill and cross-country skiing can be tailored to your own abilities. The  slopes have a vertical drop of 3,100 feet. About 25% of the runs are  challenging enough to be rated for expert skiers; 35% are for advanced  intermediates, and 15% for beginners.  </P> <P> Despite uncertain snow conditions throughout the West, Mt. Bachelor was able to  open for skiing the day after Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> Although there are no overnight lodgings, Mt. Bachelor often draws about 12,000  day-skiers on weekends. Lift lines are held to a minimum by 11 lifts that  include three detachable quad chairlifts and five triples.  </P> <P> The banks of the upper Deschutes River are less than 25 minutes from Mt.  Bachelor. In late spring and early summer, one can spend the morning on snow  skis and the afternoon bouncing over white water on a raft, canoe or kayak.  </P> <P> Smith Rock, meanwhile, is now drawing climbers from as far away as Europe to  test their skills on its awesome crags and spires. At least a score of such  experts are among the 200 or so Smith Rock climbers on a busy weekend.  </P> <P> Another challenge is to spend a summer's day biking the 22 miles from Bend  through Sunriver and up the steep grade to Mt. Bachelor, then zigzag down  trails back to Bend. Cycling the Crooked River with the spectacular vistas of  Smith Rock can be another day of trekking on two wheels. Rental tandems as well  as mountain bikes are available at local bicycle shops.  </P> <P> Lift tickets this winter are $26 for adults, $14 for juniors ages 7 to 12 and  $13 for seniors, but all can be part of special skiing and lodging packages.  </P> <P> The Inn of the Seventh Mountain is the closest lodging to Mt. Bachelor; it's  about 14 miles from the ski lifts. Double accommodations start at $149 per  person for three nights' lodging, three days' skiing and the shuttle to and  from the slopes. A studio with kitchen and fireplace is $194 per person. Call  toll-free (800) 452-6810.  </P> <P> Some 2,000 accommodations at varying rates are available around Bend, Redmond,  Sunriver and nearby communities. The Sunriver Lodge has indoor and outdoor  racquet sports, hot tubs, saunas, 28 tennis courts and two golf courses, with  many package rates available. Call (800) 547-3922.  </P> <P> Bend, with its parks and downtown streets along the Deschutes River, has a full  calendar of special events to flavor the many adventures of central Oregon,  including the Pole, Pedal &amp; Paddle skiing, biking and canoeing competition  in May and the Cascade Festival of Music in June. Museums, galleries, theater  and concerts provide cultural attractions throughout the year. Among notable  restaurants Cyrano's, Le Bistro and Mexicali Rose.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Bend, contact the Bend Chamber of Commerce,  63085 N. Highway 97, Bend, Ore. 9770l, (503) 382-3221.  </P> <P> For an inaugural 100 days through March 31, Alaska Airlines is providing daily  service from Los Angeles to the Redmond/Bend Airport, with complete packages  beginning at $299. The price includes air fare, three days' lodging and two  days of skiing.  </P> <P> A copy of the "Central Oregon" year-round guide to this area is available from  the Central Oregon Recreation Assn., P.O.

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Placer unit to develop Osborne deposit Placer Pacific, the Australian group which is controlled by Canada's Placer Dome, is to go ahead with a ADollars 155m (USDollars 113m) development of the Osborne copper/gold deposit in north-west Queensland. The deposit, which lies about 195km south-east of Mount Isa, will be mined at first by open-pit methods. However, during this initial eight-month period, Placer plans to develop an underground operation, which it says should have a 10-year life. The mine is due to come into operation in July 1995. Over the total mining period, therefore, average annual production is estimated to be 29,000 tonnes of copper and 37,000 oz of gold. Total production over the mine's life would be around 324,000 tonnes of copper and 416,000 oz of gold, with a gross metal value of ADollars 1.2bn. Life-of-mine cash costs are projected to be 63 US cents per pound of copper, including gold credits, Placer said. Shares in Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's largest mining companies, gained 3 cents to ADollars 8.44 yesterday, after the group confirmed that early-stage exploration work on the Philippines-controlled island of Mindanao, has found copper/gold mineralisation. The company said the mineralisation had been intersected in two areas, and that further work was required to determine its significance.</p>

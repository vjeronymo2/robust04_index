			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEBER STATE STUMBLES PAST NORTHRIDGE  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge finally met its match on the road, but the Matadors played  so poorly they couldn't take advantage of an equally inept Weber State team.  </P> <P> The Wildcats (3-6) shot 39.6%, committed 17 turnovers and didn't score for four  minutes of the second half, but were able to beat Northridge, 69-61, before  2,358 at Dee Events Center Saturday night.  </P> <P> Northridge (2-8) committed the same number of turnovers, all but four of which  were unforced, in its worst scoring effort of the season.  </P> <P> Still, the Matadors had a chance to win when Keith Gibbs' three-point basket  with 43 seconds to play cut the Weber State lead to 64-61.  </P> <P> However, Weber State's Jason Joe, formerly of Santa Monica High, countered with  two free throws and Gibbs missed a six-footer.  </P> <P> Andre Chevalier and Todd Bowser led Northridge with 13 points each, Bowser  getting his 900th point.  </P> <P> "I couldn't do it last (Friday) night because I missed everything," he said of  his one-for-eight shooting in a loss to Idaho State. "But I'd rather play like  last night and win than lose and get the 900th point. It's hard to take. We're  dying for a road win."  </P></p>

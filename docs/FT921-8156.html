			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GPG takes 16% stake in Australian Consolidated GPG, the London-based investment company managed by Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday said it had acquired just over 16 per cent of the shares of Australian Consolidated Investments. The announcement fuelled speculation that GPG would bid for ACI, which owns 50 per cent of National Brewing Holdings, formerly the brewing arm of Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings. ACI also owns 96 per cent of Weeks Petroleum, an Australian oil company which has royalty rights over oil produced by Broken Hill Proprietary from the Bass Strait, off Australia's south coast. However, ACI is in the process of selling its share in National Brewing to Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer which owns the remaining 50 per cent. Weeks has also announced plans to float its Bass Strait royalty rights to raise ADollars 220m (Pounds 94.2m). Analysts said GPG might seek to prevent ACI disposing of its two principal assets by bidding for the group, which is capitalised at about ADollars 130m. ACI has also attracted interest from Nycal, a US oil company which has said it expects to make an announcement shortly. Gulf Resources and Chemical Corporation, a Nycal subsidiary, said recently that it had tried to acquire an interest in Weeks' Bass Strait royalties. ACI, formerly Bell Resources, was once a listed vehicle for Mr Robert Holmes a Court, the entrepreneur who died in 1990.</p>

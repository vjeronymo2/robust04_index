			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Zedillo plans boost to pace of reform Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the victorious candidate in Mexico's presidential election, has outlined plans to intensify political reform, saying he aims to change the ruling party and make the country's election machinery completely independent of the government. Mr Zedillo said in an interview he intended to pursue dialogue with other parties in an attempt to create a common political platform to advance reform. 'I would like to see in the first place a direct dialogue with all the parties and if possible, the candidates.' The election proposals of the three main parties coincided in important areas, he added. This should allow a common platform to be advanced in areas such as the economy, social policies, judicial reform and democracy. The opposition parties have yet to respond to Mr Zedillo's call. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist opposition insists the election was fraudulent, and observers dismiss the possibility of any common platform. Mr Zedillo was 'in total agreement' with proposals to make the Federal Electoral Institute, the Interior Ministry arm which runs Mexico's elections, fully independent of the government. After an election campaign in which the ruling party outspent its rivals and received more TV coverage, Mr Zedillo said he was willing to discuss making election campaign conditions more equitable. Asked if he would include members of the opposition in his cabinet, he said the Mexican constitution did not allow for coalition governments. But 'I would not discount including independents or people belonging to other political parties that could be of enormous utility or service in the next cabinet.' Sunday's voting had also given him a mandate to reform the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and give it more internal democracy. 'I don't think it's an insoluble problem. In the next few months, we are going to be working at this. 'What I want before assuming the presidency is to leave some ideas for the reform of the party, some terms of reference over the direction of this reform.' Part of this might eventually involve the PRI chairman being chosen by a collective decision of the party, rather than by the president as at present. Mr Zedillo said the margin of his victory (the final figures suggest he was 23 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival) would not deflect him from pursuing the reform. He attributed his victory to three factors: the strength of the party, the favourable evaluation of President Salinas's government, and the ruling party's positive and intense campaign.</p>

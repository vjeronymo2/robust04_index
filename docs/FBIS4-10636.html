			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Clock Does Not Work"] </F>   [Text] According to the law and the almanac, it is simply  impossible to carry out the next electoral process within the  time period planned by the government party. Some people have  made erroneous calculations based on the closing date for the  registration of candidates, which falls on 10 October 1994. They  seem to be forgetting, however, that the elections must be  convoked by 15 August at the latest. To make this possible, all  of the electoral bodies for which the current Constitution  provides would have to be installed. This cannot be achieved,  even with the aid of Macuito.    A detailed analysis of the steps that must be taken in order  for the elections to be held in April of 1995 reveals that 281  court days, that is to say 13 months, are needed for the  implementation of all of the electoral mechanisms required by  the Constitution. Even if work is done at a forced-march pace,  full steam ahead, and allowing no respite, 157 court days--that  is to say seven and a half months--would be needed.    In the first case, assuming a normal rhythm, the electoral  requirements would be met by about April 1995. This is why the  general elections, according to the electoral law in effect--Law  23903, Article 2--are to be held "on the second Sunday in the  month of April in the year prescribed for the renewal of the  executive and legislative branches."    In the second case, the electoral apparatus would be  complete  by October. As we have noted, this presumes accelerated work,  which might possibly complicate the situation. In any case, the  parties and fronts would have only six months in which to wage  their electoral campaigns.    Now then, according to Article 1 of Law 23903, "The  president  of the Republic will convoke general elections at least eight  months prior to the date on which they are to be held." This  means that the convocation must be issued by 15 August, at the  latest.    Can this be done when the electoral bodies prescribed by the  Constitution have not yet been established? Can the candidates  for the presidency of the Republic or for the parliament accept  the convocation under these conditions, when, for example, it is  not known how the process of appointing the National Judgeship  Council of the Magistracy was handled? (It will be remembered  that in accordance with Article 182 of the new constitution,  "The head of the National Electoral Procedures Office is  appointed by the National Judgeship Council for a renewable  period of four years." It is the duty of that official, this  same constitutional article says, "to organize all of the  electoral and referendum procedures and those of any other type  of popular consultation, including their budgets, as well as to  design and draft the ballot forms. He is also responsible for  providing the documents and other materials required for the  voting process and for publicizing its results."    To obtain a more accurate idea of how troublesome and slow  the mechanisms conceived by the constituents of the New Majority  and Cambio 90 (Change 90) are, it suffices to note the  prescribed procedure for the appointment of the National  Judgeship Council.    The Council has seven members, whose election is more  complicated than the designation of the mandarins in Imperial  China. One member is elected by the Supreme Court; another by  the Higher Prosecutors' Council; another by the members of the  national colleges of attorneys, by secret ballot; and two by the  members of the other professional colleges, by secret ballot.  One member is elected by the rectors of the state universities,  and another by those of the private universities.    It should be added that some colleges have their own  specific  procedures for the election of delegates. The bylaws of the  College of Engineers, for example, provide for a period of 90  days.    The steps involved in the election process in the colleges  of  professionals are oppressively slow. The normal period would be  one day for the approval of the internal electoral calendar, 10  days for the publication and dispatch of the electoral calendar  to the Departmental Electoral Commissions, 30 days for the  checking of the census registers; eight days for coordination  with the departmental electoral commissions on the design and  color of the ballot forms, one day for the registration of  candidates, two days for the publication of the names of the  candidates, two days for the disqualification of candidates, two  days for the decisions on disqualifications, two days for  appeals against the decisions, one day for the final decision on  disqualifications, another day for the drawing to allocate  numbers to the candidates, another day for the publication of  the announcement of the qualified candidates, 15 days for the  dispatch of ballots to the departments, one day for the election  process, 10 days for the receipt of the departmental balloting  reports, 10 days for the national tallying process, and one day  for the installation of the National Judgeship Council. In  all--heavens above!--89 days. Three months.    In the event of a forced march, the process might be  compressed into 57 days. But that is all. One is tempted to say,  in the words of the refrain, "Clock, you don't keep time."  <H5>  Impossible Either Way </H5>   Stage I involves the drafting of the organic laws, and the  procedures required are discussion and approval of the draft and  laws pertaining to the electoral system and the National  Judgeship Council and their promulgation and publication, as  well as the electoral committees of the colleges of attorneys  and other professionals. The normal procedure would take 91  days, or if the steps were accelerated, 48 days.    Stage II involves the election of the members of the  National  Judgeship Council, and the procedures required include drafting  the electoral calendar, polling the colleges, registration of  the candidates, disqualification, etc., and installation of the  Council. The normal procedure would take 99 days, or if the  steps were accelerated, 57 days.    Stage III involves the appointment of the heads of the ONPE  and the RENIEC, and the procedures required include selection  and evaluation of the candidates and appointments. The normal  procedure would take 31 days, or if the steps were accelerated,  15 days.    Stage IV involves the organization of the ONPE and RENIEC,  and the procedures required include establishment of the  internal regulations, the requesting of materials and personnel,  the transfer of resources and equipment, and the reassignment of  JNE [National Election Board] personnel. The normal procedure  would require 60 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 37 days.    Thus all four stages together would require 281 court days  normally, or with acceleration, 157 court days, representing 13  months and seven and a half months, respectively.    The five preceding paragraphs describe the various steps in  the entire process, and the result is equally discouraging.  Except for those who think that all the preparations have  already been made, and that on the basis of the political  situation, it is impossible for Fujimori and his military  entourage to abandon government power in an ineffably exquisite  democratic fashion. In the opinion of these skeptics, the  government party does not care one whit that the opposition  candidates would not have time enough to wage a real electoral  campaign.  <H5>  What Should Be Done? </H5>   An unrelenting analysis of the time periods required shows  that the country will be faced with a dilemma. Either the  elections will have to be postponed, or a formula for compromise  making it possible to hold elections in accordance with the law  and the Constitution must be found. In this connection, a  proposal put forth by Roger Caceres, a congressman, appears to  provide a means of salvation.    The proposal made by Caceres, which has been given support  by  Enrique Chirinos Soto and has received the provisional approval  of the government party majority in the Constitutional  Commission of the CCD, would put the electoral process in the  hands of the National Election Board, for this one time. The  Board would take over the functions of the National Electoral  Procedures Office and the Civil Identification Registry.    Even Gilberto Siura voted for the proposal in the  Constitutional Commission, although he explained that he only  did so to speed up the process of getting the text referred to a  plenary session of the CCD. On the other hand, it is reported  that Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, the president of the  Commission, exclaimed recently: "I believe that we have s...d  this up!" At least he recognizes the fact.</p>

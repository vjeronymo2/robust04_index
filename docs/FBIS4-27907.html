			<p>CSO     [Text] Omron announced on 30 May that it has established a  fully financed local corporation, "Omron (China) Ltd."  (abbreviation OCE) in Beijing, China. The new company will be  the regional headquarters that will control the other local  corporations that Omron has established in China, make the  optimum allocation of personnel and capital among the local  corporations, and centrally manage sales promotion and technical  service in China. The aim is to make local decisionmaking swift  and expand the China business.    Itohchu has already established a similar controlling  company  in China, but this will be the first case for a major  manufacturer.    The capital for OCE is $10.7 million, Omron senior director  Hideki Masuda will be the part-time supervisor (chairman), and  for the time being there will be 30 employees, which will  increase to 60 in three years.    OCE is a company which generally is called "an umbrella  corporation" in China, and it will supervise the four production  companies for control equipment, etc., that Omron previously  established in China. Besides management of earnings,  cultivation of personnel, and taking charge of legal and  financial advice for the various subsidiary companies, it will  receive business commissions from the various subsidiary  companies and handle customer service activities such as sales  promotion.    It will also have a production control function to adjust  the  operations of the various subsidiary companies to conform to  local market trends.    If Omron should establish a joint-venture company in China  in  the future, the policy would be to have it funded by OCE. When  the OCE funding ratio tops 25 percent, that joint-venture  company will be able to obtain preferential measures in the tax  system as a foreign-invested firm.</p>

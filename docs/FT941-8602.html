			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Germany halts plans to upgrade bourse technology Ambitious plans to upgrade share dealing technology on the German stock exchanges have been put on ice, the chief executive of the Deutsche Borse said yesterday. Mr Werner Seifert, giving his first press briefing since he took over last summer as chief executive of the the German stock-exchange, said the priority for the current year would be to improve the exchange's operating efficiency. A decision on whether to replace open outcry stock markets with full-scale electronic trading systems - as recommended by a consultants' report which has been under consideration for at least 18 months - would not be taken before the beginning of 1995 at the earliest, he said. 'We asked ourselves whether we should bet everything on the electronic trading card, as London bet everything on Taurus (the failed electronic settlement system),' Mr Seifert explained, 'and came to the conclusion that we could have landed flat on our face.' His remarks indicate a pause in the scale of investment in technology in the German securities markets. In the past three years, investment in equity dealing and settlement technology has totalled DM100m (Dollars 59m) while a further DM150m has been spent on the development of the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the screen-based futures and options exchange which came into existence four years ago. In a candid comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the stock markets of London and Germany, he said that the German markets suffered because turnover was split between eight different exchanges. However, the perceived regulatory deficiencies in the German market would be tackled by the introduction of the second Finanzmarktforderungs-gesetz - the second financial markets promotion act - which is due to be enacted this year. This will make insider dealing a criminal offence and introduce a regulatory body for the German securities markets. He said the exchange's main priority must be to ensure that dealing in D-Mark related products must be conducted in Germany rather in London. At present, Germany conducted 90 per cent of turnover in German equities, he added, better than for some other continental European countries where London's share was higher. A full-scale strategy for the future of the Deutsche Borse would be developed this year. At present, Mr Seifert explained, the priority was an internal 'fitness cure' for the Deutsche Borse which was likely to mean redundancies for some of the 1,200 staff. The Deutsche Borse came into being at the beginning of last year. It is the holding company for the Frankfurt stock exchange, which accounts for the overwhelming bulk of German share trading, and the DTB as well as the Kassen-verein settlement agency. The other seven regional stock exchanges own a stake in the Deutsche Borse but retain their status as independent organisations.</p>

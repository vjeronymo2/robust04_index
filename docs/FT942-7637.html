			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Bossi among 32 top namessent for trial A Milan judge yesterday ordered leading members of Italy's old political and business regime and one prominent representative of the new ruling class - Mr Umberto Bossi of the Northern League - to stand trial, charged with breaking the law on the financing of political parties. The accused are alleged to have been involved in the 'mother of all bribes', the L150bn (Pounds 62.7m) paid out to permit the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group to withdraw from Enimont, its ill-fated joint venture with Eni, the state-owned chemicals and energy group, in 1990. The trial will begin on July 5. Mr Bossi, whose Northern League is one of three main parties in the new Italian government, will stand trial because his party is alleged to have received payments from Ferruzzi. Apart from him and one regional League organiser, the other 30 names on the list of people sent for trial are drawn from the upper echelons of the discredited old regime. Among them are former party secretaries of the pentapartito, the five political parties which shared power in Italy from the end of the second world war until the corruption scandal began to break two years ago. They include two ex-prime ministers, Mr Bettino Craxi of the Socialist party, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, of the Christian Democrats. Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the Milan prosecutor who is Italy's best-known magistrate and one of the most popular figures in the country, formally requested the trial of 37 people at the end of last month. Yesterday's decision by Judge Italo Ghitti to agree 32 of those requests should provide Italians with the next instalment in the judicial soap opera which began last year with the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant to Ferruzzi-Montedison. After a grandstanding performance by Mr Di Pietro as prosecutor, much of it televised, Mr Cusani was sentenced to eight years in jail last month for corruption and falsifying accounts. Magistrates deliberately pressed for Mr Cusani to be tried first, because they believed his trial would bring to light allegations against more senior political and business figures. Mr Craxi, probably the most prominent of those accused, again failed to hand in his passport to magistrates yesterday, in spite of increasing pressure to do so. He is thought to be in Tunisia. Judge Ghitti yesterday refused to accept the pleas of his lawyer that the former prime minister was too ill to travel. Also sent for trial were Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a former budget minister, and Mr Gianni De Michelis, former foreign minister. Mr Giuseppe Garofano, former chairman of Montedison, and Mr Carlo Sama, former managing director of Montedison, will also be tried for falsifying accounts.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Food: Christmas with Uncle Sam - A look at some US food favourites obtainable by mail order BRITONS in search of American foods for the holidays, to give as gifts or serve on their own tables, are in luck this year. Technology is making it easier and faster to mail-order food from the US, and there is a widening variety of mail-order companies from which to choose. But Britons' best and easiest source for American foods this holiday season is Harrods, which has chosen 'Christmas in New England' as the theme of its annual holiday promotion. Housewares, furniture, clothing, accessories, toys, as well as food products from the New England states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire are featured. Harrods has constructed a 5,000 sq ft New England-style village and a miniature version of Boston's historic freedom trail, for children in its Knightsbridge store. Harrods worked with the Massachusetts Port Authority to locate not only well-known companies such as Ocean Spray cranberry products, Cross Pens and Dexter shoes, but US cottage industries. (There really is a Dave, for example, behind 'Uncle Dave's Vermont-Made' sauces and cocktail mixes.) All the food products usually associated with New England are available at Harrods including tinned Boston baked beans and Vermont maple, blueberry, raspberry, and boysenberry syrups. New England's famous seafood is represented by Olde Cape Cod's tinned soups, chowders and bisques, as well as fresh clam chowder made from Boston-based Legal Seafood Restaurant's recipe. New England's reputation as a source for homemade sauces and spreadable products is growing in the US. Among those available at Harrods are Underwood barbecue sauces, Atwood and Cooke's honey-cinnamon, chocolate-raspberry, and banana flavoured peanut butters, and Gourmet Products' corn relish and honey mustard sauces. Specialty sweets on offer include Lake Champlain Chocolates from Vermont, Renee's Vermont Buttercrunch candies (toffee centres dipped in chocolate and rolled in nuts), and lobster-shaped chocolate lollies from Massachusetts' VIP Sweets. Harrods Food Hall has long been a mecca for homesick Americans in search of familiar food products, and many essential components to American holiday dinners can be found there: fresh cranberries for cranberry sauce, pink and yellow fleshed sweet potatoes, and home baking ingredients including tinned pumpkin (a 16 oz tin is Pounds 1.60), Karo brand corn syrup (16 oz jar, Pounds 3.05), and whole pecans for pecan pie. For those who prefer their baking done for them, Harrods' patisserie has fresh-baked pecan pies (Pounds 6.50 for a six-portion pie). Selfridge's Food Hall, Fortnum and Mason, Partridge's in Sloane Street, Hampstead Food Halls and Cullen's food stores throughout London are also well-stocked with American food products. Many American food companies will ship their products. Credit cards, fax machines and express mail services expedite mail orders, but it is important to order as soon as possible given the holiday rush. Overseas shipping charges are heavy, sometimes doubling the purchase price, and make sure to inquire about duty and taxes before placing your order, as they do add additional costs. Pepperidge Farm makes some of America's most popular cookies and crackers; Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers are the quintessential American snack food, served at superior cocktail parties and collegiate beer bashes alike. Some Pepperidge Farm products are available at Harrods. A selection of cookies, nuts, chocolates, snack mixes and crackers, many in decorated tins and gift boxes, can be mailed to Britain from Pepperidge Farms' Connecticut HQ. Fruit cake is an American holiday standby - the ultimate 'you either love it or hate it' food. Quips about there only being 10 fruit cakes in America, constantly handed on every holiday season but never eaten, are as common as mother-in-law jokes, but there are as many people who find the chewy nut-and-preserved-fruit concoctions (denser, less boozy versions of Christmas pudding) delicious. Fruit cakes, although not particularly easy to transport, do have good keeping qualities. A good source is the Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas, which has specialised in mail-order pecan fruit cake for 96 years. Also familiar to Americans are Oregon-based Harry and David's gift baskets of fresh and dried fruit, cheeses, sausage, and sweets. Many of Harry and David's products can be shipped to Britain - cakes, candies, preserves, and even a vacuum-packed north-west smoked salmon (Pounds 26 for a 1lb 4oz portion, plus 30 per cent shipping charge). Freeport, Maine's LL Bean, which has raised catalogue sales to a high art, ships New England-style foods including muffins, pancakes, bread mixes, syrups and honey products. Using Federal Express, LL Bean can rush orders to Britain in two weeks - regular air mail takes a month. Addresses: Pepperidge Farm: Gift box prices range from Pounds 10-Pounds 15. Pepperidge Farm's deadline for shipments to Britain is December 4; for shipments within America, December 11. Tel: (203)-669-4000, ask for mail order department (800)-243-9314.

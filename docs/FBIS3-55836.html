			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Many people were alarmed by yesterday's report from  Latvia about provocative actions by the local authorities  against two Russian generals. In this connection, various  points of view have appeared. Incidentally, Latvian Foreign  Minister Georgs Andrejevs stated that an armed conflict was a  possibility. How is this assessed by the Russian Defense  Ministry? We have contacted Yelena Agapova, the press secretary  of the head of the Russian military department, over the phone.    [Begin Agapova recording] First of all, I would like to  recall how these unprecedented events developed. In the morning  on 10 January in a suburb of Riga, armed groups of the Latvian  home guard seized the House of Officers, the billeting and  operating unit, a hotel, and a number of other installations  that belong to the Northwestern Group of Forces. Major General  Nikolay Taylakov, the deputy commander of the Northwestern Group  of Forces, and Major General Aleksandr Vodopyanov, the  commander's aide for work with personnel, immediately arrived at  the scene of the incident. When they demanded that the  facilities seized be surrended, the chairman of the Vidzeme  district commanded that the generals should be arrested. Highly  unprecedented and most unceremonious actions were used against  them. I would call them humiliating actions. They were  handcuffed and put in a car, which was driven toward the Russian  border.    Naturally, Colonel General Mayorov, the commander of the  Northwestern Group of Forces, informed Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev. The minister ordered that all  Russian troops stationed in Latvia should be put on a state of  operational readiness and that the protection of installations  and buildings belonging to the Northwestern Group of Forces  should be stepped up. The forces and equipment of the airborne  troops were also put on combat readiness. These include the  famous Pskov division and also units of the military transport  aviation.    The commander of the Northwesten Group of Forces also  informed Latvian President Ulmanis about what had happened.  During a meeting with the commander, Ulmanis expressed  bewilderment as to what had happened, gave instructions that  those arrested should be released, and conveyed his apologies.  Yesterday by 1700 hours the Russian generals and all the  occupied facilities had been surrended.    In connection with this, the Russian Defense Ministry is  demanding that an immediate investigation should be carried out  and those responsible for what happened punished. The Russian  Defense Ministry believes any violent and illegal acts, like  those we are now speaking about, against Russian servicemen,  military units, or installations of Russian troops will be  halted in a most decisive manner. [end recording]    We also asked Yelena Agapova how the Defense Ministry sees  the reasons for this most blatant provocation against Russian  servicemen. As far as we remember, things like this have  happened more than once.    [Begin Agapova recording] To our great misfortune, this is  not the first instance. On 27 November the Latvian home guard  stopped an UAZ vehicle. Threatening with weapons, they brought  the vehicle and a driver to the headquarters of the Latvian home  guard battalion, where a radio station from the vehicle was  dismantled.    On 14 December in the region of Plavinas, unknown persons in  a car fired from small-caliber weapons on a courier and postal  communications vehicle. The latter was carrying correspondence  from Riga.    All this simply indicates that certain political forces are  constantly trying to create a tense and nervous atmosphere  around Russian troops and thus, have an effect on both the  deadlines for the withdrawal and on the progress of the talks,  and, in so doing, to acquire certain political capital.  Unfortunately, all such attempts cast a cloud over the  relations between the two states and do not help the  establishing of good-neighborly relations. [end recording]    It is understandable that the Defense Ministry is  attentively  observing the state of troops stationed in the Baltics. What is  the morale of these troops like? What are they ready for?    [Begin Agapova recording] The Russian troops stationed on  the territory of Latvia maintain calmness and restraint and, in  the event of a situation like this recurring, they are ready to  take adequate measures.

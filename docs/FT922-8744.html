			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Back to basics on Tecs Will Britain's Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) succeed in injecting enterprise into local economies and boosting training by businesses? Not unless a range of problems which have emerged in their first two years are addressed, a study* by Warwick Business School suggests. 'Tecs have been given a job to reverse a century of training neglect in this country but have been left on their own with limited, contractually-tied resources to accomplish this task. This is a recipe for early loss of credibility and disillusionment,' it concludes. A survey of 18 of the first Tecs to be established revealed that they had made a serious study of their local labour markets to see what help was needed. But their proposals for action displayed a lack of proper analysis and a reliance on existing government schemes which they had been delegated to manage. The study also queried whether the Tecs would be able to stick to their long-term plans in the light of this lack of analysis, the impact of the economic cycle and short-term government policy changes. There was little evidence of how the Tecs would involve other local organisations in their plans to achieve a truly comprehensive approach. Few of their strategic plans distinguished between services the Tecs themselves would provide and those which they would merely co-ordinate. The study also queried whether the Tecs would be able to persuade companies to spend their own money on training. Ninety per cent of Tec funding relates to existing government training programmes. There is a danger that the strategic planning objectives of the Tecs will be overshadowed with a preoccupation with the delivery of existing government programmes. *Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: S Africans win ECGD backing THE UK Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has announced it is supporting a Dollars 225m line of credit to three South African companies to finance expansion of a stainless steel plant in eastern Transvaal, Reuter reports. It is the largest line of credit the ECGD has supported to South Africa and will help buy capital plant and equipment for Columbus Joint Venture's Middelburg site. Columbus Joint Venture is a partnership between Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp, Samancor and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa. Davy International will design, install and commission hot and cold rolling mills to expand production to 500,000 tonnes of steel by 1995, the department said. Davy's British sub-contractors will also benefit from the financial package, said the ECGD. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, has co-ordinated the non-South African element of the financing. A project line of credit is a loan from a bank in Britain to finance purchases by a single overseas buyer from British exporters. Up to 85 per cent of the value of the purchases may be financed in this way. ECGD guarantees the lending bank full repayment of the loan and a reasonable return.</p>

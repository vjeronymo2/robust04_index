			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / MoD bill for women's dismissals could soar to Pounds 100m The Ministry of Defence faces a possible compensation bill of more than Pounds 100m after a Glasgow court yesterday made a record award of nearly Pounds 300,000 to a woman army officer who was forced to quit because she was pregnant. About 1,800 other complaints are still outstanding from former servicewomen who were dismissed for the same reason, including one single claim for Pounds 549,000. Three other awards of more than Pounds 100,000 each have already been made. Even if the average in future claims is half that amount and no fresh claims are lodged, the total bill will be 10 times the Pounds 9m paid out so far. Yesterday's judgment found that Mrs Helen Homewood, 44, was entitled to recompense for the ending of what promised to be an outstanding career. She held the rank of major when she left the army in 1982. Mrs Homewood, who now has two children aged 11 and nine, rose to the rank of colonel in the part-time Territorial Army, which she joined in 1986. The court found that this was evidence of her 'drive, ambition, and love of the forces'. She was awarded Pounds 299,851 as the price of her lost career and told she may receive more once tax and pension rights are taken into account. The defence ministry said it was considering whether to appeal against the award. Spending by the armed forces is already under strong political pressure, and intensive preparation is going on at the ministry for a white paper which will lay out fresh ideas on paring expenditure. Among the areas of possible cuts are the medical services of the army, which employ a high proportion of women. The ministry exposed itself to a torrent of litigation after acknowledging in 1990 that pregnant women, who had been discharged over the previous 12 years, were entitled to compensation. It estimates that about 5,500 women fall into this category, and it has already settled about 1,900 claims for a total of Pounds 9m. The average value of awards has soared since last summer when the European Court of Justice removed an Pounds 11,000 limit on compensation for sex discrimination at work. The ministry's best hope is that the courts will take a different view of the remaining claims, most of which refer to servicewomen with little prospect of reaching high rank. While acknowledging that its practices are unacceptable under European law, the ministry has contested claims by the litigants that their dismissal came as a surprise. It maintains that all women entering the services were required to sign a document accepting that pregnancy would lead to dismissal. The ministry's concerns go beyond the cases outstanding. The value of awards may tempt into court as many as 2,000 servicewomen, who are entitled to claim, but have not yet done so.</p>

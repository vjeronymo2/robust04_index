			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] La Paz, 5 Apr (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, who was  the private secretary of former President Jaime Paz Zamora,  today said she was a "victim of the good faith errors" by the  former president. Seleme said this while being questioned by a  congressional commission investigating the former government's  alleged links with drug trafficking. [passage omitted]    Seleme is among the group of militants of Paz Zamora's  party,  the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), charged with being  involved with traffickers following a police investigation  prompted by statements by trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka Meco.    The Bolivian Police investigation is centered on Paz  Zamora's  friendship with alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso.    Seleme is charged with having protected alleged trafficker  Edgar Fernandez Lezcano -- who regarded as Chavarrias' aide --  and of having accepted money from Chavarrias to finance the MIR.    Paz Zamora's former secretary today denied having had a  personal relationship with any of these individuals.    She admitted, however, having spoken over the phone to Meco  Dominguez once and with Chavarrias on several occasions when  they unsuccessfully tried to contact, through her, Paz Zamora  when he was president.    Seleme admitted that Paz Zamora and his family had a  long-standing friendship with Chavarrias. She added that she  thought Paz Zamora believed that the person who is now regarded  as a trafficker was involved in strictly legal deals.    Seleme took advantage of the occasion to say that she  believes the struggle against trafficking in Bolivia is a  violation of human rights.    She recalled an attempt to abduct her a few weeks ago,  apparently by police who mistakenly abducted her niece whom they  interrogated for several hours.    She spoke of the charges, also being investigated by  Congress, by several inmates charged with trafficking who said  they had been brutally tortured in "clandestine strongholds" by  alleged Bolivian and foreign police agents.    Seleme said the charges linking the MIR with trafficking are  part of a "sinister plan" organized by "the first world power  and its representation in Bolivia," referring to the United  States and its embassy in La Paz.    "I deeply admire Bill Clinton (U.S. President) and (his  wife)  Hilary Clinton, but I do not think human rights should be  violated to fight trafficking," said Seleme.    She added: "I am not a delinquent. I am willing to shoot  myself to prove I am innocent." She also voiced her conviction  that her party colleagues are also innocent.</p>

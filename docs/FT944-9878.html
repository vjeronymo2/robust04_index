			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Float of grid may bring rebates Domestic electricity consumers could receive rebates of about Pounds 10 each from the planned flotation of the National Grid next year. Regional electricity companies, which own the grid, are moving towards giving the rebates under pressure from ministers anxious not to impose a windfall tax on the grid's rise in value. The rebates would cost Pounds 250m and the companies also expect to inject of about Pounds 750m of debt into the grid. This would help offset the cost of the rebate and the tax bill which will result from the grid flotation. Most regional electricity companies have accepted that a capital gains tax bill of about Pounds 1bn is inevitable. Representatives of the companies will put their proposals to government officials in the next two weeks. The precise levels of rebates and debt injections will depend on the progress of the talks. The talks come amid growing criticism of electricity privatisation. The Labour party last week called for a windfall tax on the regional companies because of the grid flotation. The grid was given to the companies when they were privatised four years ago. It was then valued at Pounds 1.2bn but is now estimated by analysts to be worth more than Pounds 4bn. Capital gains tax is likely to be levied on the difference but Labour believes this is not enough. The government is unlikely to impose a windfall tax because of its free-market principles. Ministers are understood to be pushing for a rebate, which is likely to be paid to all customers in the 'franchise' market who have no choice about who they buy their electricity from. The most likely method of flotation is a share split by which shareholders in the companies would be given free shares in the grid.</p>

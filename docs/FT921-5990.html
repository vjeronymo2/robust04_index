			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Travel: Strange beauty of a stark land - The fragile, cruel desert of the Skeleton Coast PARTS of Namibia's Skeleton Coast are so ecologically fragile that Land Rover tracks take hundreds of years to heal. In the desert heat a discarded banana peel does not rot, but shrivels and ossifies. If man's presence threatens to scar the region, the Skeleton Coast pays back in kind. The area owes its name to the innumerable shipwrecked sailors who lost their way in milky Atlantic fogs and found themselves abandoned to the grit of the great Namib desert. Bleached bones and hulks of galleons bear witness to their fate. These days the area is a national park, a sliver of coastline stretching hundreds of miles from Cape Cross to the Angolan border. The northern section has been declared a wilderness area; not a road, not a house, not a car nor a train disturbs its bleak silence. On my visit I flew with Louw Schoeman, the region's sole concessionaire and self-appointed environmental guardian. To do so is to join a privileged set comprising only a few hundred people a year. Our group of eight left Windhoek's Eros airport in two light aircraft early one April morning. The first aircraft was piloted by Schoeman himself, a weatherbeaten Afrikaner with a mellifluous voice, silvery hair and a grey moustache. The second was flown by his son, Bertus, a shy geologist. The flight to the desert base camp took three hours - ample time to contemplate the vastness of this arid country, four times the size of Britain but home to only 1.4m people. It is so large that an airport built in 1966 outside Windhoek has been lost. When a local gliding club asked for permission to land there, the authorities denied its existence. Bertus rarely flew higher than a few hundred feet and often considerably lower. When he spied the strange Welwitschia mirabilis, he banked the aircraft sharply and swooped so low I thought I saw insects crawling over the plant's leathery leaves. This living fossil grows only two huge leaves in a life that spans hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. It crawls from the baked earth like some surreal spider and sustains itself, like so many plants on the Skeleton Coast, from the moisture borne by the daily fogs. We refuelled at the resort of Swakopmund before following the coast north. As our aircraft buzzed along, Bertus casually served up a series of stunning sights. There were lurid purple and pink salt pans; thousands of flamingos which scattered in a tumult of wings, beaks and legs; a colony of 120,000 seals lined up along the shore at Cape Cross. We landed at Sarusas camp, some 20km inland, on a strip so rough it was almost indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain. Sarusas is the oldest of Louw's four camps. It comprises a handful of deluxe tents, a solar-heated shower unit and a wooden trestle table set beneath one of the region's rare trees. The aim is to keep the camp as unobtrusive as possible, Louw's philosophy being, as he solemnly puts it, 'to bring nothing to the desert and to take nothing away.' The old Afrikaner has an infectious enthusiasm for the desert. Several times we found him lying on his stomach peering at the sand through a magnifying glass. This rather undignified exercise revealed, quite miraculously, grains of blue, green, red, white, black and yellow sand like a collection of costume jewellery. On other occasions, Louw would thrust his wooden walking stick at points of interest. In this way he indicated the sandy covering to the trap-door spider's lair, the dust-dry lichens that bloomed into flower on contact with water, the tracks of the brown-backed hyena and the stone circles that may long ago have been bushmen's huts. We made trips by Land Rover, across the desert's pancake-flat plains or over its stark lava rocks. It was on one such occasion that we came upon the 'roaring dunes.' The Namib is scattered with all types of dunes. Some of them march (up to 15 metres a year), some are streaked blood-red with garnet, some are mountainous. Only the roaring dunes roar. At first, the sight of Louw sliding down the near-sheer surface of the sandy crest caused me some bewilderment. But, as he disappeared far below, the ground started to buzz, hum and finally to thunder. It was like the roar of B-52 bombers rumbling overhead. The friction between the bone-dry grains of sand was being amplified in the sickle-shaped dune as though the rim of a giant wine glass was being rubbed by an unseen hand. The roaring dunes were not the only wonder of the world's oldest desert. There were also the 'waterfalls' of pure sand, the desert zebra which somehow eked out an existence and the yellowish clay 'temples' of the Hoarusib canyon. The latter, formed perhaps 30,000 years ago from the silt deposits of a long-dried-up river, had an extraordinary man-made quality. Many were symmetrical pharaonic-type structures; others took on the shapes of huge stone heads, fortresses with yawning doors and windows, or columned palaces with gargoyles leering over balustrades of clay. It gave the eerie impression that this was some long-abandoned city or that hidden inhabitants were peering at us from the cavernous interiors of its gargantuan structures. Louw maintained this level of spectacle on each of our five days in the desert. We flew to two further camps, one on the ghostly coast at Cape Frio, the second perched above the black Kunene river which glimmered like sheet metal as the sun set over the Angolan border. Once Louw flew us to meet some of the Himba cattle herders involved in his conservation efforts. The region used to be home to many desert elephant and rhino but most were butchered during Namibia's civil war. Now numbers are slowly beginning to recover. The Himba, whom Louw pays to elect game wardens, have lived an isolated nomadic existence for centuries. When they came into contact with whites last century, some adopted Victorian dress which they have worn ever since. Others did not change their customs, but continued to coat their naked bodies in a beautifying and protective red dye. We were introduced to two Himba women in Purros village. One wore a frilly Victorian dress with layers of petticoats covering her ankles. She showed not the slightest embarrassment as her naked friend smeared her own breasts with a reddish paste of goat fat in front of eight leering foreigners. As we pulled into the air for our return journey to Windhoek, the immensity of the desert, inconceivable from the ground, again became apparent. The bulging lava flows, endless plains of black sand and interlayered rock bore out the bushmen's description of 'the land God made in anger.' Anger must have been one of God's most spectacular and creative moods. David Pilling travelled c/o Art of Travel (071-738-2038) in conjunction with Windhoek-based Skeleton Coast Fly-in Safaris. Art of Travel organises tailor-made holidays to Africa. The eight-day trip, including scheduled flights on BA/Namib Air and two nights' accommodation in Windhoek, cost Pounds 1,770. The company is also organising two group holidays to the Skeleton Coast, scheduled to depart October 1992 and April 1993 incorporating Etosha national park and Sossusvlei dunes.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: CME seat changes hands for a record Dollars 925,000 A membership of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's International Monetary Market has traded for a record Dollars 925,000, a near-50 per cent increase since the start of the year. The transaction puts seat values at the CME above those at the New York Stock Exchange, and demonstrates rising global interest in financial derivatives markets. Seat prices at the futures exchange have climbed steadily this year, largely because world interest rate volatility has more than doubled turnover in the CME's Eurodollar futures and options pits. As the exchange's importance as a hedging centre for interest rate risks rises, international banks which were slow in obtaining memberships are now competing for seats. Lloyds Bank, Deutsche Bank, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have all bought CME seats recently. Exchange rules require a bank to own six memberships before it can 'clear' or process trades for itself or its customers. Rising seat prices are also the result of an internal push to redistribute ownership at the exchange. The highly controversial plan would consolidate the exchange's two largest divisions and shift governing power from a traditional base of agricultural futures traders to the banks and financial institutions that now generate most of the CME's business.</p>

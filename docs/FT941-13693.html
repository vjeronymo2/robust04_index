			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Major braced for attacks on state pay freeze The government was bracing itself last night for a fresh challenge to its planned freeze on the public-sector pay bill as Labour's success in forcing it on to the defensive over taxation provoked alarm among Conservative MPs. Downing Street has confirmed that Mr John Major, the prime minister, has received the first of the reports of the independent pay review bodies whose recommendations cover about 1.5m public sector workers. The first reports cover doctors, dentists and nurses and will be followed in the next few weeks by several others, covering such groups as teachers and the army. The conclusions remain confidential but the speculation at Westminster last night was that the review bodies would defy the Treasury's call for any pay increases to be financed entirely from higher productivity. Instead, the bodies may seek increases close to the 2.7 per cent that MPs have voted for themselves. The case for such increases will be strengthened by the government's admission at the weekend that the tax bill of the average family will rise by Pounds 12.50 a week from April. Mr Kenneth Clarke defended the need for tax rises again yesterday in the face of a sustained attack from the opposition after the Treasury's admission that the overall tax burden would soon be higher than at any point under the last Labour government. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, produced another sheaf of official figures to reinforce the opposition claim that the admission had destroyed the Conservatives' claim to be the party of low taxation. On the eve of today's House of Commons debate on the finance bill, Mr Clarke said action to reduce public borrowing was essential to sustain the recovery. Few, if any, Tory MPs are likely to back a Labour move during today's debate to force the government to drop the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. But the strength of Labour's attack on the government's tax record was reflected in a series of public demands from Tory backbench MPs for the tax increases to be reversed before the general election due by 1997. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, echoed the mood among his colleagues when he warned that the government would pay a heavy penalty unless taxes were cut before the election. Labour produced figures compiled by the Commons library showing that the average family with a mortgage would see 10.7 per cent of their income taken in income tax in the financial year beginning in April. This compares to 9.6 per cent during 1978-79, the final year of the last Labour government. When national insurance was included, the proportion handed over to the Treasury had risen from 16.1 per cent to 19.5 per cent. Mr Brown accused the government of setting in place a 'five-year plan' of tax increases, with the burden of taxation projected to rise to 38.5 per cent by 1998-99. That compared with the high-point of 36.75 per cent during the last Labour government. Joe Rogaly, Page 20 Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

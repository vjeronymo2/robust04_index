			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Ford launches Pounds 200m R&amp;D expansion FORD of Europe is launching a five-year programme to expand its research and development centre at Dunton, Essex, at a cost of Pounds 200m. The programme, disclosed by Mr John Oldfield, Ford of Europe's vice-president for product programmes, vehicle engineering and design, is expected to create up to 500 more jobs at Dunton, which is the largest motor industry centre for R&amp;D in the UK. But the jobs are expected to be filled by existing Ford employees moving from nearby satellite research operations at Aveley, Basildon and Dagenham. Last year Ford announced its intention to restructure all its European R&amp;D operations, consolidating them at Dunton and at a similarly sized operation at Merkenich, near Cologne in Germany. Under this consolidation it was intended that a total of 1,200 engineering staff would eventually move to Dunton from the three satellite plants. The influx would lift Dunton's total establishment to 4,000, from the current 3,000. Although not formally confirmed by Ford management last night, it is this process that appears to be getting under way . In spite of no new jobs being created, the Dunton expansion should finally set to rest fears which began circulating early last year that Ford might be considering closing Dunton and moving all its research and development activities to Germany. At that time Ford said it was transferring about 20 to 30 jobs from Germany to the UK. In Germany, about 1,300 staff were relocated to Merkenich from other sites in Cologne. Mr Oldfield said at the time that Ford was seeking to bring together design and production engineers at one site so that 'we can achieve better communication and teamwork and thereby generate significant quality and efficiency gains'.</p>

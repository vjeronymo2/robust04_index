			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: BETWEEN LIFE AND LIFE-SUPPORT;  </P> <P> IMAGINE A WOMAN;  </P> <P> AND OTHER TALES BY RICHARD SELZER (RANDOM HOUSE: $18.95; 226 PP.)  </P> <P> The honorable pursuit of professions has been one foundation of our  civilization over the centuries. But beyond that solid virtue, a cleansing  grace attaches to those who, from within each profession, ask questions about  it.  </P> <P> There is the professional soldier who knows how much defeat lies in victory.  The lawyer who knows how much injustice lies in the legal pursuit of justice.  The journalist who knows how partial a truth is uncovered by his methods. The  doctor who knows how life can be marred and insulted by the medical  requirements for preserving it.  </P> <P> Such supra-professional questioning may not often raise the practice of the  profession but -- like the saints who haven't yet managed to drastically  elevate the quality of bishops -- it encourages the rest of us. And it has  produced some wonderfully good writing.  </P> <P> In medicine, for instance, there are the examples of Oliver Sacks and,  particularly, of Lewis Thomas. They use the essay form for their stretching and  questioning. So, in the past, has Richard Selzer, a retired surgeon and  professor at the Yale School of Medicine. Now Selzer has taken another step in  the humane expansion of his original discipline by writing a collection of  brief fictions.  </P> <P> There is a writer in the doctor; we knew that. More interesting, there is a  doctor in the writer. That may seem a truism; what else would you expect when a  doctor writes? In fact, it is two stages beyond.  </P> <P> In the best of these tales, Selzer has transformed himself entirely, if not  quite untraceably, into the fiction writer. And back from this graceful fiction  blows a breath of healing. Imagine a doctor whose medicines have improved the  patient's body without quite bringing him to health, playing the cello to  perform the final cure of re-attachment to life.  </P> <P> The image is a little excessive. So is some of Selzer's writing, and in the  same way. It over-makes its point; it over-arranges. As if intoxicated with the  writer's power to make things as beautiful as he can, the author sometimes  makes them too beautiful.  </P> <P> He does so, I think, in "Luis," a soft tale of a slum child in Brazil who finds  a "star" in a garbage dump, and who dies from the radiation given off by what,  in fact, is a carelessly discarded hospital isotope. Another story, "Poe's  Lighthouse," is a narrative by a madman who discovers an unspeakable evil in  the base of a lighthouse. It announces horror without drawing us into it, as  Poe could do.  </P> <P> Radiation sickness, madness; the other tales each use a different medical  phenomenon as a point of departure. They are not about the illness or the  procedure; they are about an aspect of the human spirit suggested or affected  by them.  </P> <P> "Whither Thou Goest" is, ostensibly, about organ transplants. In fact -- its  crooked comedy bestrides its haunting message like a circus clown shambling up  onto a horse and giving a bravura ride -- it is about the mined frontier  between human life and the practices of medicine.  </P> <P> Hannah's husband is shot by a vagrant while helping an old woman change a flat  tire. The doctors persuade her to discontinue his futile life-support system,  and let them harvest his vital parts. "Harvest?" she asks. "Like the gathering  in of wheat?" Thinking it over, she looks down at the chief doctor's feet. "He  was wearing oxblood wing-tip shoes of a large size. They were the shoes of  power."  </P> <P> She gets a letter thanking her. Sam's liver is working nicely in Abilene, the  kidneys in Dallas and Galveston, the lungs in Fort Worth, the corneas in  Houston, the heart near the Arkansas border. "She already knew what had become  of the rest of Sam. She had buried it in the family plot of the Evangelical  Baptist Church cemetery."  </P> <P> But she is bewildered and unhappy. Is she really a widow when so much of Sam is  alive? Widowhood would be better than "the not-here, not-there conditions into  which she had been brought by the miracle of modern science."  </P> <P> She needs to do something. She decides to visit, and writes to the farmer who  has Sam's heart. Angry letters come back from the wife, but one day when the  wife is away, the farmer asks her to come. Feeling like a bride-to-be, she  goes, and for an hour, listens to her husband's heart in the farmer's chest. At  the end he asks timidly if she'll be back. "No need," she says. The dignity of  life's end had been abused; somehow, Hannah's quest restores it.  </P> <P> Does medicine, seeking to prevent or postpone death, belittle life by denying  death's place in it? The question is posed with extraordinary beauty in the  title story. No medicine will help the narrator; she has contracted AIDS from a  bisexual lover. She goes to stay at a pension in a French village near Annecy,  on the lake.  </P> <P> There she writes a letter in the form of a journal. It recounts the daily  graces of a civilization which, at its best, knows more about the small details  that nourish life than any other.  </P> <P> Dying, she is an honored guest of Mme. Durand, who runs the pension; of the  servants and waitresses, of the gardener, and of the neighbors who come in the  late afternoons to have an aperitif on the terrace. For every symptom, there is  not a medicine but a garland.  </P> <P> Her legs begin to fail, and the gardener fashions a walking stick out of a  grapevine. She develops shingles; Mme. brings her a loose Arab robe for  comfort. A neighbor drinks a glass of the local wine with her; another drives  her down to the lake to sit in a cherry orchard. She is carried out to lie in  the sun on a stone wall looking over the water. Crusty bread and a fresh  speckled egg -- all she can eat -- are served her. When her hands swell up, she  is driven to a bee farm. After two bee-stings the swelling subsides. It is the  "bees' milk," she is told.  </P> <P> "Nicole and Mme. together disinterred me from the bed and brought me forth for  an airing," she writes one day. "Where did they learn this profound courtesy  for the flesh?"  </P> <P> It is an extraordinary phrase. The courtesy for the flesh is the most ancient  of healings, and it works when medicines fail -- not to prevent death but to  make dying a worthy part of life.  </P> <P> Selzer has delivered a message that could easily fall into sentimentality, with  an astonishing, exhilarating precision. It was an artist's decision to set the  story where he does. His villagers represent at its most ideal the French way  of treating life; but it is an authentic representation.  </P> <P> And when death comes, it is a small, unforced step. One day in the autumn,  Nicole no longer brings up breakfast. She no longer sets out the daily fresh  napkin in the narrator's place at table. The narrator is able to record this  too; even though -- as we realize -- it means she has died. Death and life go  hand in hand.  </P></p>

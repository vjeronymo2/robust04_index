			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Cash curbs on housing attacked: Use of derivatives recommended Housing associations could soon be allowed to use financial derivatives such as futures and swaps to reduce interest rate risks in borrowing to build low-cost homes for rent or sale. The Housing Corporation, the quango that regulates registered housing associations, is to consult housing associations and interested bodies over proposals to lift restrictions on using derivatives which are recommended in a report on improving associations' treasury management. The report, drawn up by the management consultancy arm of Touche Ross, the accountants, says that derivatives could help associations to manage the treasury risks, including their exposure to movements in interest rates. Housing Associations are raising an increasing proportion of the cost of building new homes on the capital markets, much of it at floating rates. Where funding is at fixed rates it is often through loans that will have to be refinanced in the future. The report says that using derivatives could help associations to improve the interest rate maturity profile of their borrowing portfolio. Housing Corporation rules for registered housing associations restrict the use of derivatives to the point when loans are taken out and for changing an existing derivative. Most associations have not changed their rules to take advantage ofthese restricted applications. The report warns that many finance managers in associations have only limited experience of interest rate management products. Financial institutions are wary of dealing in derivatives with associations after a legal ruling that the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, an active sterling interest rate swaps trader, did not have the power to enter into derivative con-tracts. Touche Ross recommends that the restrictions be lifted for associations that have the expertise, structure and processes to use them safely. But it says that they should not be allowed to write options except to close out an existing option position. The report also proposes a prohibition on speculation. The Housing Corporation said yesterday that it would want the treasury function to be seen as a cost centre in associations, not a profit centre.</p>

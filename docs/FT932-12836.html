			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Danes open output-for-export plant in Russia DANISH investment company 2M Invest has opened a company for manufacturing machinery components in St Petersburg. The company, ZMI, is rare among western investments in Russia in that it is based exclusively on production for export to the west. Mr Michael Mathiesen, main shareholder of 2M Invest, made his name and fortune as founder of Dataco, a Danish company making networking equipment for computer systems. Dataco was sold at to the UK's Dowty Group in 1990. He decided, after looking at the potential for investment in St Petersburg, that an ordinary joint venture or participation in a privatisation project would not be satisfactory. The factory is on premises rented from a state-owned company in the defence industry. ZMI is not a normal company, as it is a production unit only. All selling is done from a sister company, EBI Suppliers, in Copenhagen, which also uses the facilities of the Copenhagen Free Port to hold buffer stocks. Another of Mr Mathiesen's principles was to start small. The total investment is DKr13.5m (Dollars 2.2m), of which 56 per cent was subscribed by 2M Invest and 25 per cent by the Danish government's Investment Fund for Central and Eastern Europe. Russian shareholders have about 1 per cent of the stock and two ZMI executives have options which can be converted to shares within two years. The plant has a total staff of 19 and four Russian machine tools, equipped with western cutting tools and measuring instruments. ZMI's staff is Russian, but the management has received training in Copenhagen in how a western company functions. Mr Mathiesen expects to see a fairly rapid expansion of ZMI over the next year or so, taking employment to about 100, and he expects that the investment will be profitable. The first orders have already been received, after test orders had showed product quality up to the standards required by customers in Denmark and Germany. ZMI expects to receive the coveted International Standards Organisation ISO 9002 quality control certificate this year, probably a first for a Russian manufacturing company. Workers at ZMI are paid the rouble equivalent of about Dollars 150 a month. The Russian machine tools cost a fifth of the western tools, with which they have proved to be competitive.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Betacom back in the black with Pounds 350,000 BETACOM, the telecommunications equipment supplier which is 71.3 per cent owned by Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad, returned to the black in the half-year to December 31 1992. On turnover from continuing operations ahead to Pounds 6.67m (Pounds 5.11m)  -reflecting an expanded product range, particularly in telephone answering machines - pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 350,000 against losses of Pounds 644,000 in the corresponding six months. The figures were compiled under FRS 3 accounting principles. Costs of restructuring and rationalising the range amounted to Pounds 73,000. The result was helped by an interest turnround to Pounds 145,000 receivable (Pounds 218,000 payable), and included an operating profit of Pounds 213,000 (Pounds 324,000) from discontinued businesses. The disposal of the Loewe Betacom joint venture was completed in September. Operating profits from continuing operations totalled Pounds 65,000, against a deficit of Pounds 196,000. Mr Ken Ashcroft, chairman and former corporate finance director at Amstrad, said the group 'was now recovering its market share in the UK after an extremely difficult period'. Net assets at the period end amounted to Pounds 10.4m, including cash of Pounds 3.4m. Earnings per share emerged at 0.46p, against losses of 3.86p.</p>

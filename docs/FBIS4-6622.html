			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Friday [22 April] he did not personally have a  hand in a failure to report some 29 million yen of his personal  income to tax authorities. "It is common for legislators to  have their offices handle accounting and raising of funds,  including their personal funds," Hosokawa said.    Hosokawa's chief political secretary, Namio Yatsuka, told a  news conference earlier in the day that the prime minister did  not disclose the 29 million yen income from stock and bond  investment during a 10-year period from 1981.

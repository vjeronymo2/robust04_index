			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eiichi Takahashi] </F>   [Text] Deregulation without substance will not stand up.  Regardless of the changes in the text, that alone does not  represent a change. The bureaucrats are good at that. This is  what Chairman Masao Ogura of the Yamato Transport Co. points  out. It is apropos.    With the enactment of the aforementioned two laws on goods  distribution, the transport charges in the land transportation  industry were "deregulated" from the permit system to the  notification system, but the substance has not changed at all.  In the general language sense, it is normally considered that a  report is complete if a cost account statement is attached and  the intended date of implementation is indicated, based on the  rules of the government agency. However, the language sense of  the bureaucrat is different. Simply stated, the dealer submits  the documents, the official checks them and, if everything seems  to be in order, he stamps them as accepted. The notification is  completed only if the stamp of acceptance is applied. This  appears to be the language sense of the bureaucrat. In that  sense, there is substantially no difference whether a permit  becomes a license, or a license becomes a notification.  <H5>  Hidden Essence of Regulations </H5>   Moreover, the problem was that the standard for the  official's judgment of approval was not clear. As is well known,  costs differ widely, depending on the business category, scale  and management efforts of the respective enterprises. Regardless  of how capable the Japanese bureaucrat, it is almost impossible  for him to accurately grasp the cost structure of an individual  company based on a sheet of document. Nonetheless, he concludes  that it is either okay or not okay. From the standpoint of the  individual company, it is natural to be dissatisfied, and it  feels an urgent need to "become better acquainted" with the  bureaucrat. It also results in further distrust of government  agencies.    What is worse is that, despite submitting documents, it does  not know when it will receive a reply. When the Yamato Transport  Co. acquired two route permits, the Transportation Ministry  reviewed the request documents only after it became the object  of administrative litigation. Also, the most insidious is the  so-called administrative guidance. There is no legal basis for  administrative guidance, and guidance is often offered verbally.  The issuance of documents is skirted to avoid leaving evidence.  During the oil black market cartel incident, and also during the  recent securities scandal, the government gave its implicit  approval and guidance, but when the incidents were exposed, it  persisted in professing its "innocence."    Also, among the established dealers were seen moves as an  industry group to deter new entries, approach the agencies to  protect their vested interests, and to rely on administrative  guidance. An aspect of connivance between the bureaucracy and  the industry from the standpoint of the "established order"  cannot be denied.  <H5>  Transparency of Administration Is Urgently Needed </H5>   Among the advanced nations of the West, most have  established  administrative procedural laws and freedom of information laws  to prevent such evil practices. In Japan also, there is a rising  demand in recent years to enact a similar administrative  procedures law. In 1979, the "council on preventive measures  concerning suspected aircraft scandals," which was created in  reaction to the Lockheed incident, proposed strengthening the  General Administrative Procedures Law. The crime by a prime  minister resulted in self-reflection on unclear administration  as the breeding ground for a cozy alliance between the  government, bureaucracy, and industrial circles.    The movement toward legislation picked up momentum after the  Second Administrative Reform Council's proposal in 1983 on "the  establishment of an ad hoc specialized investigation and  deliberation organization" for the enactment of an  administrative procedures act, and after the followup Third  Administraive Reform Council submitted to the prime minister in  December 1991 "a report on the drafting of a fair and clear  administrative procedures law."    In May 1993, the Miyazawa cabinet made a decision on  submission of an administrative procedures act to the Diet. On 4  June, the gist was explained at the lower house plenary session.  However, as is well known, it met a doomed fate amid the passage  of a no-confidence vote in the cabinet and a tendency toward  dissolution of the lower house. The administrative procedures  law bill to be submitted to the Diet consists of the same  content, in principle, as the previous proposal.    Its characteristics are generally as follows. First, the  purpose of the law is to ensure fairness in administrative  actions and to improve clarity. Simply stated, the purpose is to  form clear rules regarding regulations and administrative  guidance, which had been left chiefly up to the convenient  interpretation of the government agencies.    Specifically, they consist of three pillars. First, to  ensure  swift and clear processing. Toward that end, 1) to publicly  announce concrete judgments concerning permits and licenses; 2)  to decide and publicly announce standard inspection periods from  petition to disposition; 3) to begin inspections without delay  on reception of petitions, and to avoid neglect of petitioned  proposals and delays in processing; 4) when rejecting a  petition, to indicate the reasons by letter.    The second pillar involves procedures on so-called nonprofit  disposition, including cancellation of permits and business  suspensions. In principle, 1) the reasons for disposition are to  be indicated with documentation; 2) perusal of proof materials  used as the basis are to be permitted; and 3) opportunities for  pleas are to guaranteed. These are all matters of course  regarding disposition, but the fact that they failed to be  implemented is characteristic of Japan's administration.    The third pillar concerns administrative guidance. It has  been decided that: 1) The jurisdictional scope will not be  exceeded. 2) Administrative guidance is an action premised on  voluntary cooperation by the petitioner, and unprofitable  treatment based on lack of obedience will be prohibited. 3)  Administrative guidance with permits/licenses as the backdrop  will be banned. 4) In addition to providing documents on  request, the spirit, content, and responsible official will be  clarified.    Because both the ruling and opposition parties have no  reservations as far as the Administrative Procedures Law is  concerned, "the era of `nemawashi' [spadework] has ended"  (Managenent and Coordination Agency). Therefore, although an  indeterminate element concerning the conclusion of the political  reform act bill does exist, the probability of enactment may be  considered to be good.    Of course, as was mentioned before, the behavior of the  government agencies will not necessarily change instantly after  enactment of the bill. There is an aspect of politics and the  industry circles coexisting in cozy comfort amid the permits and  licenses, and a change of the established order is more  difficult than the formulation of resolutions. The principal  corporations licensed by MITI are listed as follows:     -  Japan Federation of Economic Federations [Keidanren]    -  Japan Federation of Employers Associations [Nikkeiren]    -  Japan  Committee for Economic Development    -  Kansai Economic Federation    -  Japan Junior Chamber Inc.    -  Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry    -  Mutual Aid Association    -  Japan Productivity Center  [JPC]    -  Business Research Institute (BRI)    -  Business Productivity  Research Institute (BPF)    -  Japan Overseas Business Association    -  45th Anniversary Commemorative Foundation for Promotion of  Taniguchi Kogyo Company    -  Japan Value Engineering Association    -  Japan ABC Association    -  Association of Management Consultants of  Japan (AMCJ)    -  Japan Volunteer Chains Association    -  Japan Chain  Stores Association    -  Federation of Cooperative Associations    -  Japan Home Sales Association    -  Japan Mail Order Association    -  Japan Federation of Consumer Credit Companies    -  Japan Credit  Industry Association    -  Distribution Problems Research Association    -  Japan Supermarkets Association    -  Sales Promotion Bureau (SPB)    -  Japan Self-Service Association    -  Store Systems Association    -  Japan Shopping Centers Association    -  Advertising Federation of  Japan    -  Japan Advertising Review Organization (JARO)    -  Newspaper  Advertising Review Conference (NARC)    -  Japan Advertising Agencies  Association    -  Japan Magazine Advertising Association    -  Japan  Advertising Association    -  Japan Advertising Council Inc.    -  National Federation of Product and Tourism Promotion  Organizations    -  Japan Fair Trade Council for Tourist Souvenirs    -  Japan Tourist Souvenirs Federation    -  Japan Fitness Industry  Association    -  Japan Resort Clubs Association    -  Japan Preparatory  Schools Association    -  Industrial Health Promotion Association    -  Japan Safety Accessories Association (JSAA)    -  High-Pressure Gas  Safety Association    -  Industrial Gas Detector and Alarm Industry  Association    -  Japan LP Gas Plants Association    -  Japan LP Gas  Federation    -  Mutual Aid Agency of Japan for LP Gas Safety    -  Japan  LP Gas Wholesalers Association    -  Japan LP Gas Instrument  Inspection Association       For example, there are six licensed corporations in the LP  gas-related field alone. Like the oil and black market cartel  problems, if administrative guidance shifts by using the  licensed corporations under the name of the industry's  independent (voluntary) rules, the unclarity will only increase.  Even if it does not, there will be criticism that administrative  guidance, which previously had no legal basis, is given a "legal  basis" within the scope of jurisdictional affairs by this law.    However, despite considering the apprehensions and  criticisms, enactment of the Administrative Procedures Law  represents a major step forward. In effect, it is probably a  question of implementation. The answer is the self-discipline  and awareness of the industrial circles and the individual  citizen.</p>

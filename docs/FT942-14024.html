			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Japanese coalition ends policy dispute Japan's fractious coalition parties last night reached a compromise over a joint policy platform aimed at preventing a break-up of the government and opening the way for them to nominate foreign minister Tsutomu Hata as prime minister. Coalition leaders said Mr Hata would be proposed at a meeting today as their candidate for the premiership being vacated by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Mr Hosokawa announced his resignation two weeks ago over allegations of financial impropriety. A parliamentary vote is now likely next week. The Social Democratic party, the largest member of the ruling coalition, had threatened to leave the government because it could not accept binding commitments to increase consumption tax and to prepare for possible economic sanctions against North Korea. The threat was later withdrawn, A rise in sales tax is seen as essential by the powerful Finance Ministry to compensate for a decline in income tax revenue as the proportion of retired people increases sharply over the next decade. Agreement on this would enable the government to produce a permanent cut in income tax, as sought by the US to increase demand for imports. Coalition partners were also seeking ways to allow Japan to take part in potential United Nations sanctions against North Korea without offending the socialists' literal interpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution. Discussion turned on whether or not Japan should consult China before considering sanctions, as demanded by the socialists in an attempt to head off the risk of Tokyo being drawn into any sanctions demanded by the US outside the aegis of the UN. The state television network NHK reported that the parties agreed that any new tax should 'have the understanding of the people' and, on North Korea, that Japan should consult as needed with other Asian countries. Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party is seeking an accord on basic policies before the new government takes office, an attempt to avoid the chaos of the previous administration. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of the JRP and the government's backroom strategist, has pushed hard for a clear set of common policies, giving the public a rare taste of public debate on national issues. He is also believed to be keen to split the far left away from the SDP and attract more defectors to the coalition from the opposition Liberal Democratic party. Last night Mr Hata compared the drawn-out, closed-door policy dispute to a difficult childbirth. 'Although it's hard labour, the result is worth it,' he was quoted as saying.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Towards a rescue culture - The debate over insolvency law in the UK As Britain emerges from recession, analysis of the insolvency regime introduced by the 1986 Insolvency Act has already begun. Prior to 1986 the UK insolvency regime was not geared to rescuing companies as going concerns. The 1986 act, which came out of recommendations of the Insolvency Law Review Committee chaired by the late Sir Kenneth Cork, was designed to facilitate the rescue of the viable portions of a business and to penalise directors who did not act responsibly. Its main innovation was the introduction of the role of administrator, normally an accountant, appointed by the courts to try to save the business rather than to liquidate it. Through the introduction of the administration order and the company voluntary arrangement, where the directors voluntarily hand the running of the company to an insolvency practitioner, it was hoped a 'rescue culture' similar to that engendered in the US by the 'Chapter 11' procedure could be achieved. Administrations differ from Chapter 11, however, in that the appointment of an administrator frequently results in the displacement of a company's existing management, whereas chapter 11 leaves existing management in place as 'debtor in possession' to run the company under the watchful eyes of the creditors. This difference of approach has prompted much debate. As the UK climbs out of recession, lawyers, accountants and insolvency practitioners have begun to question whether the English administration procedure has achieved its objective or whether the issue should be re-examined with a view to designing a system closer to the American debtor in possession concept. The recession gave the rescue procedures introduced by the 1986 act a baptism of fire. There have been some successes, with businesses emerging from administration as going concerns but, for many lawyers and accountants, the procedures have not been a success. Administration has proved prohibitively expensive for smaller companies largely, it is said, because of the procedure's over-reliance on court involvement. When companies find themselves in financial difficulties, most boards do not embark on the administration procedure early enough for successful rescue, perhaps because the procedure does not leave a large enough role for existing management and directors fear loss of control. The statistics suggest the hoped for 'rescue culture' has failed to materialise: rescue procedures, already in decline, represent less than 1 per cent of company insolvencies. How, if at all, Britain should change the insolvency regime and whether English corporate insolvency should move towards the US system, were debated last weekend at the Bar's annual conference in London. Mr Robert Rosenberg, a partner of US law firm Latham &amp; Watkins, said America had opted for a debtor in possession concept because that was what the marketplace wanted. There was general confidence that the chapter 11 system contained enough checks and balances on directors' conduct, such as creditors' committees, to prevent the debtor in possession running amok. Americans also subscribed to the 'better the devil you know' philosophy, he said. However incompetent the management of a company had been there was no reason to believe new management would be any better. But the debtor in possession concept had its drawbacks, he said. It worked poorly in small cases, where creditors were often reluctant to get involved in the rescue. In the large cases, there had been criticism of the size of lawyers' and accountants' fees. The process was also said to be too lengthy. In reality, however, fees were normally a very small percentage of the assets of the estate, and most chapter 11 cases were successful. In the UK, bankruptcy is still very much a moral issue, according to Mr Michael Crystal QC, a leading commercial silk. The Victorian concept that a director responsible for getting a company into difficulty is not a fit and proper person to continue to manage it is reflected in the 1986 legislation. Administration involves displacement of existing management. Mr Crystal told the conference England needed a system which allowed existing management to have a real role. That would give them an incentive to stay, to go for rescue early and would motivate them to co-operate with an outsider supervising the process. The English regime was also too court driven, he said. 'The High Court is not the appropriate type of court to deal with the vast number of issues which arise in an insolvency. Its training does not give it the necessary expertise. So, to expect it to express business value judgments is unrealistic,' he said. There could be a role for a type of commercial court staffed by people capable of taking commercial decisions, he suggested. Some thought should be given to creating an insolvency tribunal. Mr Crystal said there was also a need for a body like the Financial Law Panel to develop a code on corporate governance issues for directors whose companies are in difficulties. It was not enough to refer them to wrongful trading legislation and leave them to it. Mr Fred Pointon, head of group risk at National Westminster Bank said that, before opting for legislative change, some thought should be given to adapting elements of the London Rules Approach, a set of voluntary principles used by bank creditors, to provide a framework for continued support for troubled companies from banks until agreement can be reached on the way forward. The London Approach involves three stages: a standstill or moratorium on enforcement procedures; an investigation by accountants; and, a refinancing. In the last three years, NatWest had used the London Rules to deal with bank debts of Pounds 19.8bn, and in only 1 of 27 cases had the company gone on to insolvency. 'We believe the procedure has some value in preserving companies rather than pushing them under,' he said. There are those who believe the 1986 act has been a success, however. Mr Justice Millett, a member of the Cork Committee, said there was little basically wrong with the present regime. It had its faults - there was too much displacement of existing management, for example. But the real problem with administration was its high cost. In that respect it was no different from Chapter 11. But there was little to choose between the two systems, he said. Both could and did save large businesses. If success meant the continuation as a going concern of a business, as opposed to the company, the UK's success rate was better than the US's. But if success meant keeping the company going, the English success rate was much worse than the US's. The overriding need was for a cheap form of administration, but there was no reason why this could not be achieved within the existing legislative framework, he said.</p>

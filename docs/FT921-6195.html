			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Tribunal tells port to pay cost of case AN INDUSTRIAL tribunal yesterday took the unusual step of awarding costs against an employer which had lost an unfair dismissal case, Catherine Milton writes. The tribunal ruled in August that the Port of London Authority had unfairly dismissed 19 dockworkers at Tilbury because they were union activists. The case lasted 196 days. Legal experts said that the tribunal must believe the authority had conducted the case unreasonably, and costs were likely to run into six figures when they were assessed. The tribunal is expected to issue reasons today. The authority is appealing against both the unfair dismissal ruling and a tribunal order that 12 of the 19 dockworkers should get their jobs back. The appeal is likely to last another week.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Effjohn sinks to FM261m loss INTENSE competition on its key Baltic sailing routes sent Effjohn, the Helsinki-based shipping group, plunging to a FM261m (Dollars 43.21m) loss after financial items in 1992. The result was also blighted by floating exchange rates, a Finnish travel tax, and heavy interest payments following extensive investments in new tonnage. The group is scrapping its dividend, after paying FM1.20 a share in 1991 when it made FM4m profit after financial items. Turnover rose 10 per cent to FM3.73bn, due to increased passenger traffic. The group's main operation, Silja Line, suffered a loss because of severe competition on its passenger routes between Finland and Sweden.</p>

Story": "Certainly I'm no expert on L.A. I actually grew up  in Orange County (Garden Grove), which I think of as a different animal than  L.A. When I came up to Los Angeles in the late '60s, it was quite a shock. . .  . You know, you'd see some guy riding a bicycle with a pyramid on his head."  Tom Hamilton and Cathy Curtis  </P></p>

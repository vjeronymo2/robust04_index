[passage  omitted]    At the forum, in line with their working, ideological, and  social reality, the 10 outstanding communist party members set  forth their opinions and suggestions on bringing into play the  communist party members' exemplary role in the new situation,  strengthening the party organizational work, improving spiritual  civilization, strengthening the ideological and educational  work, and fostering an accurate world outlook and an accurate  outlook on life.    Chen Xitong conscientiously heard their speeches and noted  down their opinions and suggestions. He said: You are  representatives of Beijing's outstanding communist party  members. The selection of 10 outstanding communist party  members from among one million members is a great matter of  Beijing. By disseminating the excellent deeds of the 10  outstanding party members, we have educated the party members  and promoted party building. So, we should also continue to  disseminate the advanced thinking and deeds of the 10  outstanding party members; the lofty ideals, sentiment, and  morality of communist party members; an accurate world outlook;  and an accurate outlook on life so as to further foster a new  brilliant image for communist party members.    Chen Xitong said: Today, we invite you to this forum to  mainly discuss the great matter of strengthening party building  in the new situation and the great matter of promoting reform  and development. Your opinions are conducive to the work of the  municipal party committee and the improvement and enhancement of  party building. While talking about the building of party  grass-roots branches, some comrades maintained that the party is  likened to a big tree and the grass-roots party organizations  are likened to the root of the tree. So long as the grass-roots  organizations are well built will the party have powerful  vitality and combat effectiveness. This opinion is very good.  We should realistically strengthen the building of grass-roots  party organizations, including those in such new spheres as high  scientific and technological units and three types of  foreign-funded enterprises; and bring into better play the  functions of grass-roots party organizations. After election of  new leading bodies, the districts and counties in the  municipality should strengthen the building of grass-roots party  organizations, particularly backward party branches.    Chen Xitong said: Under the present situation that the  planned economic system is being replaced by the socialist  market economic system, we should continue to persist in the  principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that  both hands are tough," further upgrade our understanding, adopt  effective measures, strengthen the improvement of spiritual  civilization, and strengthen the ideological education. We  should adopt various forms, that the masses are likely to see  and hear, to strengthen the ideological and political work. It  is necessary to disseminate an accurate world outlook and an  accurate outlook on life. We should learn from the 10  outstanding communist party members, foster a great lofty ideal,  give no thoughts to personal gains and losses, persistently  serve the people wholeheartedly, and fight for making the  country strong and building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Chen Xitong urged that in the new year, the 10 outstanding  communist party members should do their jobs well, bring the  communist party members' exemplary role into play, and make new  progress in various spheres.    Chen Guangwen praised that the 10 outstanding communist  party  members are the banners and models of the municipal party member  contingent. He urged that the 10 outstanding communist party  members should cherish their glory, accept trials, set more  strict demands on themselves, bring their exemplary vanguard  role into better play, and make greater contributions to the  setup of the socialist market economic system and the  improvement of the spiritual and material civilizations.</p>

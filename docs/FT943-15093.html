			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Power shifts eastward in Ukraine: Political upheavals in prospect after elections in two CIS states By electing Mr Leonid Kuchma as president in Sunday's ballot, Ukrainians have set off a political earthquake in their seemingly stagnant state. For the first time since the country became independent in 1991, it is Russified, industrialised eastern Ukraine, rather than the intensely nationalist west, which will set the political tone in the nation. Moreover, with the ousting of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the elaborate and powerful patronage networks the president has established in Ukraine over the past three years are set to crumble. A new guard, from the east and from the once elite and now wilting defence sector, is about to take charge of the capital. A balding man with an unpretentious, engaging personal manner, Ukraine's president-elect is an ambivalent figure. The election campaign did more to obscure than to clarify Mr Kuchma's platform, as he sought to simultaneously win the communist vote and woo market reformers, to appeal to the pro-Russian east while reassuring the rest of the nation that he would not be Moscow's pawn. What is clear is that Mr Kuchma, known as the 'chief' when he was prime minister, will bring in a style of government very different from that of Mr Kravchuk, a cunning strategist who has elevated vacillation into a political philosophy. As the erstwhile director of Yuzhmash, the former Soviet Union's largest missile factory, Mr Kuchma is a tough, decisive leader, impatient with politicking and accustomed to instant obedience. Western diplomats predict that Mr Kuchma, whom Mr Kravchuk sought to portray as Moscow's yes-man, will not in fact, inaugurate a radical change in Ukraine's relations with Russia, but will instead bring a more subtle shift in orientation. His aides agree, and say the new Ukraine will be wrought in the image of east rather than west. 'Russian-speaking Ukrainians are absolutely loyal to the Ukrainian state,' Mr Iuri Pestriakov, a Kuchma official said. 'But they were reduced to second-class citizens by Kravchuk.' Before he can set about forging this new, slightly different, Ukraine, Mr Kuchma must first establish himself as the leader of this entire, and disparate nation, and assert his control over the nation's government. Swept into office on a pro-Russian platform, he must prove he can be the leader of all of Ukraine. To do that, he will be compelled to balance on a tightrope pulled taut by nationalist aspirations in the west of the country and pro-Russian inclinations of the eastern Ukrainians who propelled him into office. Satisfying the east should be easier. Indeed, Mr Dmytro Tabachnyk, mastermind of the Kuchma campaign, yesterday declared triumphantly that with Mr Kuchma's victory the question of Crimean separatism had been put to rest 'because the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly for Ukraine's new president'. The second domestic challenge Mr Kuchma faces will be asserting his authority over the state administration which, during the past three years, Mr Kravchuk has carefully stacked with supporters. Another source of acrimony is Mr Kuchma's relentless campaign against corruption. In a nation in which government pay-offs are a way of life, he is privately praised by Ukrainian law-enforcement officials as one of the country's cleanest politicians. As president, Mr Kuchma, whose efforts to dismiss and jail corrupt state officials when he was prime minister were thwarted by the president and parliament, might well make a very public example of some of the more questionable business dealings of the Kravchuk administration and the men behind them. He will also need to develop a modus vivendi with Ukraine's parliament and cabinet of ministers, a task complicated by the still unresolved constitutional debate in the country. Although many communist voters appear to have backed Mr Kuchma, he will inevitably come into conflict with the dominant hardline left-wing faction in parliament if he pursues the market reforms he has promised. Last night Mr Kuchma said he was ready to co-operate with parliament and the recently appointed prime minister, Mr Vitalii Masol. However, the new president's relations with Mr Masol, a long-time Kravchuk ally whom he vowed to sack during the campaign, could be tense. Mr Masol, who gamely says he has a deal to stay on as prime minister, has admitted privately that his personal relationship with the new president is distant. Even as Mr Kuchma sets his own house in order, he cannot afford to neglect the world beyond his nation's borders. From the west, he has the enticing offer of Dollars 4bn of aid if Ukraine begins long-delayed economic reforms. To the east, Mr Kuchma hopes that his warm friendship with Russia's prime minister and his more conciliatory tone will ease strained relations between the two Slav neighbours. But he would do well to realise that neither Moscow nor Washington is likely to favour a faltering Ukraine with economic hand-outs; like his ousted predecessor, voters are likely to judge Mr Kuchma by what he achieves at home.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Northern League Chamber of </F> Deputies floor leader, by "g.p." in Milan; date not given: "`We  Will Never Join Forces With the Fascists' -- Maroni Wants a  Ciampi-Style Government"; first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Milan -- [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi said: "A  Forza Italia-League government with external support from  National Alliance [AN] may be formed." However, relations  between the Bandwagon [League nickname] and Forza Italia have  become somewhat tense by now, so Maroni, replied to the Knight's  [Berlusconi nickname] proposal by suggesting instead "a  government made up by the League, Forza Italia, CCD [Christian  Democratic Center], and UCD [Center Union], and with external  support, not only, however, from AN but from anyone else."    [LA REPUBBLICA] But in this way you are voiding Berlusconi's  proposal.    [Maroni] The important thing is that Berlusconi said that AN  will not form part of the government.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, you do not want [AN leader] Fini.    [Maroni] As [Northern League Secretary] Bossi says, maybe  the  mountains will also move, but, I repeat -- and this is no news  -- there will be no government with the fascists.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi insists on opening a door to  Fini.    [Maroni] We could perhaps make use of those political  personalities who are elected under Forza Italia and AN's common  symbol, but who are nevertheless independent.    [LA REPUBBLICA] They would not be enough to form a  government.    [Maroni] AN has not subscribed to a political agreement or  to  a platform. We, Forza Italia, CCD, UCD, the Radicals, and the  Pact's former supporters, have done so, and this constitutes the  future government's platform. Forza Italia and AN only add up  to votes, as Berlusconi himself says.    [LA REPUBBLICA] To set up that sort of government you would  require an absolute majority without AN.    [Maroni] Why place limits to Providence?    [LA REPUBBLICA] If, as is more probable, you do not obtain  that majority, Fini's votes will be decisive.    [Maroni] We will form a minority government.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What if Berlusconi insists?    [Maroni] How could he govern without the League's votes?  Presumably, with Fini and the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left], given that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian  Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli will not have a seat.    [LA REPUBBLICA] With a minority government...    [Maroni] Yes. Consider the Ciampi government. It did not  have a majority but, in our opinion and in that of many others,  it governed well. Consider the Varese and Monza town councils,  with League mayors but no organized majorities. They are doing  very well. Otherwise, new elections would have to be held all  the time.    [LA REPUBBLICA] No alternatives?    [Maroni] There is also another possible government solution,  which has been proposed to me by a PDS member in the last few  days: that of an institutional government.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Who made this proposal?    [Maroni] I cannot tell you, but it is someone I hold in high  esteem. An institutional government would have to include  everybody, from Communist Renewal to AN, and it would have to be  based on a very precisely defined platform, limited to a few  points only: electoral reform, institutional reform; this would  be followed by elections.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colin Brown and Patricia Wynn Davies: "Tory </F> Attack Over EU Veto Flusters Lib Dem Leaders"]    [Text] The Conservative Party yesterday took the  unprecedented step of picketing the headquarters of the Liberal  Democrats to create further mischief about Britain's "veto" on  decisions in the EU (European Union) Council of Ministers.    A young man from Conservative Central Office stood under a  multi-coloured golfing brolly outside the Cowley Street  headquarters of the Liberal Democrats, handing out leaflets and  asking all visitors: "Have you got copies of Sir Norman Fowler's  letter?"    The letter by the Conservative Party chairman challenged  Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, to admit his party  would do away with the British veto, which the Tories have  placed at the centre of their European election campaign.    "You have never been shy to spell this out in the past and I  am afraid it is too late to change your position now simply  because it is unpopular with the British public," Sir Norman  said.    The tactic of attacking their opponents on the veto has  proved a strong card for the Tories, who have the weakest hand  in the elections. It is unlikely to save the Tories from losses  on 9 June, but it has put the other parties on the defensive.  The Tory attack also has forced Labour and Liberal Democrats to  defend the veto more strongly than they might have wished.    The Conservatives were accused by Labour of spreading a lie  after claiming Labour would abandon the veto on immigration,  allowing more foreigners into Britain.    Mr Ashdown told a campaign meeting in Taunton this week that  the ability of one country to block decisions in Brussels was a  recipe for "European sclerosis." But, under intensive Tory  attack, he yesterday appeared to shift his party's policy by  confirming the Liberal Democrats would retain the veto on  "executive" issues, such as the budget, extending VAT, or the  national rebate.    The Tories pointed out the "executive" veto was not  mentioned  in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, published on Monday [23 May].  That states the use of qualified majority voting in the council  should be extended and the system reformed, perhaps by the use  of a "double majority," for example requiring three-quarters of  the states plus the votes of states representing three-quarters  of the EU's population.    Mr Ashdown's apparent shift on policy was alleged to have  caused tension in the Liberal Democrat camp. Sir David Steel,  the party's foreign affairs spokesman, was sticking to the  agreed party line, that the EU would be "stultified" if it did  not abandon the veto in favour of qualified majority voting.    At a press conference in London, Charles Kennedy, the  Liberal  Democrat president, denied any confusion. He was asked why the  Liberal Democrats had not sought to campaign positively on the  abandonment of the veto?    "We have been positive," he said. "We want more qualified  majority voting. At the end of the day, you will still have an  effective veto, providing you can build a consensus with other  member-states. That is a consistent position."    The Liberal Democrats hit back with a report highlighting  divisions between the Tory party at Westminster and Tory Members  of the European Parliament, who take a more federalist line.</p>

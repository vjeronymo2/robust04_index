This was reported  by Banja Luka radio this evening. Branislav Bozic reports:    [Bozic] Before the Washington agreement is realized in  practice, according to which the Bosnian Croats and the Muslims  would first establish a federation and then form a confederation  with Croatia, it is necessary to replace Alija Izetbegovic.  This condition was set to the U.S. Administration by Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman prior to the signing of the agreement.  This was reported by Banja Luka radio tonight, citing  well-informed Croatian sources. The report further states that  the White House has taken a similar stand for some time. The  additional argument was Franjo Tudjman's explanation that he had  replaced Mate Boban who, according to him, is an extremist among  the Croats.    Not only was Tudjman promised that Alija Izetbegovic would  be  replaced, but, as Banja Luka radio reports, he was also told  that Izetbegovic will be replaced by either Haris Silajdzic or  Muhamed Sacirbey, ambassador of the Muslim government in the  United Nations. All this, as claimed, will happen very quickly.</p>

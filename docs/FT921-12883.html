			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hill &amp; Smith dips 9% HILL &amp; Smith Holdings, the West Midlands-based steel stockholder and fabricator, saw its pre-tax profits fall by some 9 per cent to Pounds 4.64m over the 12 months to end-September. The fall from the previous year's Pounds 5.12m came despite turnover ahead 5 per cent to Pounds 75.8m. Nevertheless, Mr John Silk, chairman, described the outcome as 'good results in the current UK economic climate'. The group's steel stockholding and drop forging activities 'struggled for market share in a climate of falling margins', but other group businesses performed well, he said. Reflecting a property revaluation during the year, shareholders' funds jumped 41 per cent to Pounds 29m. Gearing fell from 32 per cent to 14 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 12.29p (13.06p); a recommended final dividend of 3.9p brings the total for the year to 6p (5.7p).</p>

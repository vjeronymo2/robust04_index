Mr. Abdul Ghafur, parliamentarian  and former cabinet member, is sure that the backwards and the  Muslims are not with the Janata Dal now. He said that the main  reason for this change is the dramatic political style of Lalu  Prasad. He says that if they run for the next election under  Lalu Prasad's leadership, the future will be very dark. Seeing  all this, the Bihar Janata Dal legislators are planning to  establish a new party and Abdul Ghafur is one of them.    Thus, history repeats in full circles! Abdul Ghafur is  leading the revolt against Lalu Prasad. Two decades ago, a  revolt had risen from the opposite direction. Lalu Prasad was  also involved in that. The target was then-Chief Minister Abdul  Ghafur! We have to call it political irony that both of them  belong to the same party. They are both from the same district.  The legislator from Gopalganj is dismissing his chief minister  by calling him theatrical and arrogant.    Is the Janata Dal breaking up? Abdul Ghafur responded that  it  was a historical necessary. Why? This is the only party which  has no national leadership. There is no central leader left. He  explains this in detail. V.P. Singh was elected president by  acclaim and he declared himself a "Gorbachev" later. We know  that Gorbachev dissipated the communist world with his reforms.  V.P. Singh is also looking for a Yeltsin in the Janata Dal. We  join him in his hope. What reaction will be in the Janata Dal  over it? He said bitterly that people will go where they want to  go.    Abdul Ghafur is the most veteran politician in the Janata  Dal. He has been in politics most of the 76 years of life. After  getting his B.A. (Geography) and L.L.B (Law) degrees from  Allahabad University in 1941, he jumped into the political arena  as a follower of Netaji Subhash Chander Bose. He went to jail in  1942. The word, "soldier of the independence war" has heavy  connotations. Abdul Ghafur has played even heavier roles than  that. He has been in the legislature since 1952 and has won all  the elections except for in 1967 and 1989. In 1967, the Congress  Party was almost wiped out in Bihar. He also lost, however, he  was elected to the Vidhan Parishad on the Congress ticket. He  was the chairman of the Vidhan Sabha before being elected the  chief minister. They tried to get him into the Janata Dal in  1989 and he joined it in 1991.    He talked less about his past and spent more time talking  about the present smoke raised by the Janata Dal. He said that  the Janata Dal is finished in Uttar Pradesh and it would be  beneficial to the Janata Dal leaders to join Mulayam Singh's  Samajwadi Party there. If they do not like this, advised Ghafur,  they should do what they think is appropriate. He said that the  situation in Bihar was getting worse. Loknayak Jayaprakash  Narayan had started the movement of "total revolution." The  present chief minister who had joined that movement as a foot  soldier is destroying those values. The devoted Janata Dal  leaders of the "total revolution" are becoming preys to his  anger.    Abdul Ghafur said that what could be worse than the fact  that  Lalu Prasad could not find even one candidate to run for  by-election in Vaishali. He had Kishori Sinha resign from the  Congress Party and made him the Janata Dal candidate. This was  the first time when a chief minister himself went to nominate a  candidate. The Janata Dal has taught him a lesson. The  nomination was delayed for one and half hours because of  protests.    He says with hurt feelings that the backwards are not with  the Janata Dal now. Are 100 percent backwards opposed to the  Janata Dal? He said that 80 percent are definitely unhappy. What  about the Muslims? Abdul Ghafur thought for a few minutes and  said that they are also in the backward category. He repeated  that even Yadavs among the backwards are upset with the Janata  Dal. He said, "The Muslim mentality could be understood from one  example. There is a medical college in Katihar and Maulana Azad  Engineering College in Patna. Mufti Mohammed Sayyed, Yunus  Salim, Shafi Qureshi, and I kept asking Lalu Prasad to accredit  those colleges. He declined it. The case reached the Supreme  Court and the decision was made in our favor. A committee was  formed and it recommended giving accreditation. Recently, the  chief minister tried to stop Governor Kidwai from going there."  Ghafur Said that this was but one example; there were hundreds  of such examples.    He said that only God knew what would happen if elections in  Bihar were held under the present leadership. Did he mean Lalu  Prasad Yadav by "present leadership?" He replied in the  affirmative. What plans are experienced leaders like you making?  He replied that a decision will be made after postmortem  ceremonies of Ramvilas Paswan's father. All this will be done  within a week. Ramvilas Paswan, Chhedi Paswan, Nitish Kumar, and  Harikishore Singh were involved in this effort. There are many  others whose names will appear later.    Abdul Ghafur says that the Janata Dal is at the breaking  point in Bihar. All Janata Dal legislators and more than half  council members will join the new party. He was confident that  Ram Sunder Das will also join his party. Thus, a new political  polarization is taking place. Abdul Ghafur was showing the  "labor pains" of this process. Was the Vaishali by-election a  reason for it? He responded that the "pitcher of Lalu Prasad's  sin is full" and this is the result of it. He said that law and  order, financial catastrophe, looting of government treasury,  and corruption have broken all previous records in Bihar.    He was reminded that during the Jayaprakash movement, he was  recognized as a honest politician and that movement was about  corruption. Then we asked him, "Will you certify Lalu Prasad a  honest politician?" Abdul Ghafur was not comfortable with this  question. He went down the memory lane for a while. His face  showed agitation. He said after calming down a little, "The  truth is that I wanted Lalu Prasad to continue as the chief  minister. However, he will not be saved because of my wishes  alone. The people are against him and the government machinery  is against him. The people are tired of his histrionics. I have  never seen such an arrogant leader." Ghafur does not usually  employ such language. We asked him again if he would give a  certificate of honesty to Lalu Prasad. He gave a clear answer  this time. He said, I wish I could do that. He will wait for  Lalu Prasad's reaction. There are many missiles in Abdul  Ghafur's arsenal to silence Lalu Prasad.</p>

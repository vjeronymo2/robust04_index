			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Le Pen aims to sway moderates Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the National Front. THE defence of national sovereignty against immigrants, Eurocrats and 'federasts' is the stock-in-trade of 64-year-old Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of Europe's largest extreme right-wing party. So far, Mr Le Pen has conducted a surprisingly moderate campaign by his own bombastic standards, perhaps in an attempt to draw support from the large proportion of undecided voters, many of whom are probably moderates. He argues that Maastricht is preparing for a federal Europe 'in a sly and undemocratic manner', an 'absurd' project at a time when other federations across the world are breaking up. He accuses the government of treason in signing the treaty. Traditionally, the National Front appeals to a wide section of the working class, who feel most threatened by immigration. Yet the party also has bourgeois roots: Mr Le Pen started his political career in the 1950s with the Poujadists, the shopkeepers' party. Geographically, however, Mr Le Pen's appeal is far wider. His party won nearly 14 per cent of the vote in last March's regional elections and is the second most powerful in the three largest regional councils.</p>

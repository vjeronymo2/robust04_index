			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Letter: Changes within electricity supply industry, not subsidies to British Coal, would resolve problems faced by coal Sir, Your leading article on the government's ideas for subsidising the coal industry ('Extra Time for British Coal': January 14) was based entirely on the mistaken premise that British Coal cannot be 'saved' without substantial subsidy. This is not the case. It is common knowledge that the price offered by British Coal to the two big generators is Pounds 1.51 a gigajoule for 1993-94, declining to Pounds 1.33 a gigajoule over the five years of the proposed contract. What is not such common knowledge is that British Coal could, next year, supply 60m tonnes to the electricity industry, at the price offered, and still make a modest profit. According to figures I have seen the 1993-94 cash operating cost of production out of the 19 retained pits, plus the 21 pits under DTI review, plus opencast, is expected to be Pounds 1.31 a gigajoule. Even allowing for the costs of any large capital projects (not included in the definition of cash operating costs) the output of at least some of the remaining 10 pits could be added without British Coal falling into loss. The problem for the coal industry is not principally one of costs and prices  -though we still have a little further to go before we match internationally traded coal. The real problem is that there is insufficient room for British Coal to sell 60m tonnes of power-station coal, because of the pre-emption of the generation market by nuclear, the French link and - especially - gas. Nuclear's slice is protected by statute; imported French electricity should be subject to the fossil-fuel levy, but isn't; and the new gas-fired stations sponsored by the regional electricity companies are protected by 15-year take-or-pay contracts for their output. Institutional changes within the electricity supply industry are what is required, not huge subsidy to British Coal. Without institutional changes British Coal would still be faced with an artificial ceiling on the volume of coal it could sell, regardless of cost, price and subsidy levels. The stories which have been circulating recently, in your paper and others, suggesting that the government was considering giving British Coal a Pounds 10 a tonne subsidy, were clearly inspired by the Department of Trade and Industry. They had the twin objectives of frightening people off, and diverting attention from the real problem. Unfortunately, you seem to have fallen for it.

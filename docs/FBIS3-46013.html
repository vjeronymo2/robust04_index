			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 22 (XINHUA) -- The household- and  initiative-based rural responsibility system has pushed up  China's grain production substantially. Last year, China's  grain output topped 456 million tons, according to today's  PEOPLE'S DAILY.    Under a responsibility system which ties farmers' earnings  to  production, the country's grain harvest surpassed the 400  million ton mark in 1984, with per-capita output of grain  approaching 400 kilograms for the first time, the paper said.    "Since 1984 market supply and demand has been in near  balance, without steep ups or downs," the paper said.    Even in 1991, which witnessed severe floodings in eastern  China, grain prices remained stable, it added.    While ensuring grain production, farmers now pay close  attention to the grain quality. As a result, the ratio of  quality rice and wheat to total grain output has risen markedly,  the paper said.    Counties with per-hectare grain production exceeding 15 tons  have appeared not only in South China, but also in Shandong,  Henan and other provinces in North China.    "We still need to redouble our efforts to attain the goal  for  harvesting 500 million tons a year by the end of the century,"  the paper said.    It expressed the belief that correct government policies and  effective measures will enable Chinese farmers to turn out more  grain on limited croplands.</p>

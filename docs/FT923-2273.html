			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Electronic market problems behind setback at Canning PROFITS AT W Canning, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals manufacturer and electronics distributor, declined slightly during the first half of 1992 as it faced continuing problems selling components in continental Europe. The pre-tax line amounted to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 3.05m). Total sales of Pounds 59.1m were down on last time's first half figure of Pounds 61.7m but higher than the Pounds 55.4m recorded in the 1991 second half. The sales pattern reflected the group's changing shape. Its drive into niche chemical markets produced growth while commodity price reductions helped to protect margins. However, sales declined in the electronic component markets of Germany, France, Italy and Spain and provoked a decision to change the focus of the business from generalised to specialised distribution. Chemicals' operating profits were Pounds 3.9m against Pounds 700,000 for electronics. In the 1990 second half the two divisions made a roughly equal contribution to operating profits. Electronic market problems led Canning to close its Semitronic subsidiary in Spain, a withdrawal from the market which takes Pounds 2m off shareholders' funds. This has been partially offset by the sale for Pounds 1.35m of a 90 per cent shareholding in LJ Specialities, a chemical company. Gearing by the year end should be down from 58 per cent to 50 per cent. Although Mr David Probert, chairman, expects continued growth on the chemical side and a return to prosperity in electronics by the end of 1993, he noted that 'there is considerable uncertainty in many of the group's markets with no discernible sign of a general improvement in demand.' This uncertainty has been compounded by the events surrounding the parity of sterling. 'Forecasting is more difficult than I have ever known it,' he said. Nevertheless, the group had enough confidence to maintain the interim dividend at 2.94p, based on earnings per share of 5.9p (6.2p).</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: ABB gas turbines to challenge rivals ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering company, yesterday threw down a challenge to its rivals in the fast-growing Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.9bn) market for combined-cycle power stations by launching a range of advanced gas turbines which it claims are the most efficient yet. The announcement could have a big impact on the sector, where companies such as General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom and Siemens of Germany are ABB's main competitors. All the big players in the power equipment industry have spent heavily on increasing thermal efficiency of gas turbines, which produce 'combined cycle' power when a steam turbine is attached to run from the gas turbine's exhaust gases. ABB is claiming efficiencies of 58-58.5 per cent for its two new turbines; for the 50-cycle (Hz) networks of Europe and most of Asia and for the 60 Hz market in the US and elsewhere. The company says these efficiencies are 2 percentage points higher than values currently being quoted and 3 percentage points higher than others have achieved in combined cycle operations. ABB has received one order for its new turbine - from Jersey Central Power and Light in the US. Mr Fritz Gautschi, senior vice-president and general manager for ABB's gas turbine division, said the increased efficiency could save a utility as much as Dollars 40m in costs over the 15 years of a typical power station's use, depending on the price of fuel. ABB said it hoped to capture a 'sizeable' share of the 13,000MW market for large gas turbines. The company has lacked a truly large gas turbine to compete with machines from GE, considered to have the technological edge. Mr Gautschi said ABB's new 50 Hz machine would pump out 365MW of power with a steam turbine attached, 35-40MW higher than its rivals.</p>

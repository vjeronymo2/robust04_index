			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (6): One step towards a cleaner environment - FGD Technology National Power likens the process to a huge car wash. Instead of cars, the FGD plant is washing the sulphur dioxide out of the gases which are the result of burning coal to fire the generators. The other main difference is that the FGD uses limestone, not soap, in the washing process - and it has a significant byproduct in gypsum, the building materials product. While environmentalists welcome the reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions which results from fitting the FGD plant, they are also concerned about the effects of the plant's consumption of half a million tonnes of limestone each year. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says the FGD construction at National Power's Drax plant is a step in the right direction towards a cleaner environment but says it would have liked a more thorough investigation of FGD alternatives (described elsewhere in this survey) and the effects they would have had on the environment. First, the technology. The limestone-gypsum process at Drax is the most widely used in FGDs throughout the world. Babcock, the contractor, constructed the installation under licence from Hitachi, the Japanese company. Under the process, sulphur dioxide is routed through ducting which is big enough to allow a red double decker London bus to pass through. At peak output, flue gases will flow through the ducting at the rate of 6,000 cu m a second. A simple chemical reaction occurs in large containers called absorbers, which are equivalent in size to 12-storey buildings. Limestone, ground to a fine powder, is mixed with water to form a slurry mixture which is sprayed on to the sulphur-laden gas in the absorber towers. The sulphur dioxide then reacts with the limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce calcium sulphite. Air blown into the absorber oxidises the calcium sulphite, turning it into calcium sulphate. Then, as in the spin cycle in a domestic washing machine, the water is removed leaving the by-product of high grade gypsum. The gypsum is stored at the site, then sold for use in the building trade. Waste water is treated to ensure it returns to the environment to an agreed standard. The environmental lobby's concern is more to do with the sourcing of the limestone and the transport of it on to the site and the gypsum off the site. Ms Fiona Weir, who heads the air pollution team at Friends of the Earth (FoE), says there are worries that the process uses so much limestone compared to other types of FGD. 'We wanted a much more serious consideration of the alternatives and will certainly press for it if any other FGDs are built in the UK,' she says. 'Other options may have been more costly but they may have been less damaging to the environment,' she says. Ms Weir acknowledges that some of FoE's concerns over issues including transport and supplies appear to have been dealt with, at least in part, by National Power. The company has agreed that transport of the limestone will be by rail rather than by road which would cause more disturbance to residents in the areas in between. It contributed Pounds 4m to the building of a dual carriageway ring road built while FGD building was in progress. National Power has also agreed to source all of the limestone from areas which are not in national parks. This goes only some of the way to meeting FoE's concerns because Drax's use of 500,000 tonnes a year may lead to pressure increasing from other limestone consumers for limestone to be taken from areas of natural beauty. In addition, strict planning controls have contributed to National Power covering all of the FGD units with cream-coloured cladding and spending considerable sums on landscaping. Drax, like any other power station, will never be attractive but there are worse industrial eyesores in the UK. In lobbying Her Majesty's Inspectorate for Pollution last year, Friends of the Earth pressed not for rejection of authorisation for the FGDs but for conditions to be attached to the authorisation, including a fuller assessment of alternatives and strict monitoring of sulphur and nitrogen oxides from the plant. Friends of the Earth has long campaigned that the generators should be required to provide more detailed environmental assessments of their power stations. It sees FGDs as only a short-term solution to the environmental problems of Britain and Europe. 'There is a carbon dioxide penalty for FGDs,' says Ms Weir. This is because FGD installations increase the amount of electricity needed to run a power plant and thus increase the amount of carbon dioxide which is being pumped into the air. There are no international limits for carbon dioxide emissions. Friends of the Earth thinks there are preferable long-term solutions to emissions of both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide from power stations. They would like to see national consumption of electricity cut through energy conservation - and increasing use of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar power.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Friday continues to be one of the least tempting nights on television. Early in the evening there is the brass final in the Young Musician Of The Year contest which, given the standard in the semi final, ought to be splendid. My own vote so far would go to trumpeter James Arnold (6.25 BBC2). Later on the same channel the series From A To B: Tales Of Modern Motoring looks into the arcane world of the company car. It seems that rear head restraints and 'badging' play major roles in determining pecking order (9.30). Those aside, you are likely to have more fun listening to the radio. Radio Five Live, which seems to have got away to a remarkably smooth start and to be fulfilling its brief pretty well, begins a regular Friday programme called Parkinson On Sport (7.35). Barnsley's famous son looks forward to the weekend's events and presents an investigative section delving into the dramas and scandals of sport. In A Passion For Bulgaria (8.50 R4) ex-army officer John Robinson talks about his life in the former communist state where he now runs a pub in a small village.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: CONSUMER NEWS  </P> <P> Ford Recalls 110,000 Vehicles: Ford will inspect about 110,000 model E- and  F-Series pickup trucks and, if necessary, replace a snap ring in the  transmission. In some cases where the snap ring has broken, Ford said, it may  not be possible to engage the "park" mechanism even though the transmission  shift control level is in the park position, causing the vehicle to roll when  parked on an incline.  </P></p>

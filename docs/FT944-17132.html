			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Eurovein float to raise Pounds 14m Eurovein, a Sheffield-based specialist engineering concern which has emerged from WA Tyzack, the old quoted company, is to raise Pounds 14m through a share issue designed to pay off debts and enable it to expand. The flotation, announced yesterday , will involve a full Stock Exchange listing for Eurovein, best known in the UK for its Spencer &amp; Halstead shotblasting equipment and Tyzack machine knives. It will mark the return to the stock market of Mr Bill Eastwood, who was responsible for putting together WA Tyzack between 1987 and 1989. Eurovein's managing director, Mr Don Stain, was on WA Tyzack's main board. WA Tyzack went private in 1989 via a heavily-leveraged Pounds 42m management buy-out, in which neither Mr Eastwood or Mr Stain was involved. They formed Eurovein the same year, acquiring most of their old company's components business for Pounds 5m. Only two years later, however, the buy-out vehicle, GSM, collapsed - a victim of the recession and its own financial structure. This gave Eurovein the opportunity to buy GSM's remaining businesses from the receiver for Pounds 21.2m. The re-established Eurovein now has three businesses. The largest, surface treatment, makes shot-blasting equipment, used widely in industry to clean components before painting. It has operations in the UK, Germany and Italy. The other two businesses are filtration, based around the French company Eurofiltec, and components. Mr Eastwood said Eurovein's sales fell sharply in 1991, prompting a search for new markets in eastern Europe, east Asia and the Americas, and a cost-cutting drive. The most important step was the transfer of shotblast equipment manufacture from Germany to the UK. The recent trading record is much improved, with operating profit of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.6m) in the year ended July 31, on sales of Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 29.1m). At the pre-tax level it had a profit of Pounds 635,000 (loss of Pounds 1.2m). Mr Eastwood said the businesses generated enough cash to service the group's debt, but Eurovein's financial structure prevented it from expanding. There were opportunities for organic growth or acquisition in the three divisions, and the acquisition of a fourth leg in specialist engineering was not precluded. The flotation, which is being handled by Albert E Sharp, the brokers, and has yet to be priced, will eliminate Eurovein's Pounds 14m term debt. New shareholders will end up with slightly more than 50 per cent of the company, as none of the current investors, which include Hambro Group Investments and 3i, are selling.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Anglo-German rift sinks pound STERLING dropped nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as foreign exchange markets were thrown into confusion by a new rift between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank, writes James Blitz. Since it was devalued two weeks ago, the pound has hovered weakly above DM2.50 because of the apparent lack of an economic policy in the UK. The emergence of a new fault-line in Anglo-German relations on Wednesday night pushed the pound down to DM2.4770 in Asian trading, with the currency bottoming out at DM2.4680 in Europe yesterday. It later closed at DM2.4750, down 4 1/4 pfennigs on the day. The unhappiness with sterling was well analysed by a currency manager at one of the biggest UK investment funds. He said that sterling was now undervalued against the D-Mark, but that purchasing power parities were no longer influencing the market. 'Instead,' he said, 'our customers are concerned that there is no official target for the sterling exchange rate.' Until Wednesday's row surfaced, he had thought sterling could bottom out at DM2.40. He now believed that it could go to DM2.30, adding that some of his colleagues believed DM2.20 was not far fetched. Two factors will influence the short-term outlook for the currency. The first is whether Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, resigns. Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros in London, said: 'I don't think that Lamont is a plus for sterling. A plus for the pound would be someone with a new mandate.' Another factor is whether the Bundesbank cuts short-term rates today. A generous injection of liquidity into the German money market at 8.9 per cent yesterday, about 20 basis points below call money, raised new hopes of this. The French franc and the peseta closed slightly easier against the D-Mark at FFr3.38 and Pta70.42 respectively. But pressure on the peseta remains strong, and a Bank of Spain official called for a review of EMS mechanisms to counter capital flows. Several analysts ruled out a rate change altogether, while some thought that the differential between US and German rates could widen further if there is a poor US non-farm payroll report today. The dollar rose more than a pfennig yesterday on a mixture of short covering and optimism about the German money market intervention, closing at DM1.4255 in London. But it remains nearly 6 pfennigs down on the week. Even so, there was a feeling that the currency tensions may be over. 'The market has already discounted the idea that the Federal Reserve has decided to ease,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. 'And there is some chance that the weaker ERM currencies will escape devaluation,'</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Germans argue social case The German government submission to the European Commission's review of jobs and competitiveness argues in support of a strong social dimension, welcoming a greater role for the social partners - unions and employers - written into the Maastricht Treaty, writes David Goodhart. In addition to existing directives it suggests seven general rights which workers throughout the EC should enjoy: equal treatment for people in part-time employment; ban on discrimination against workers who exercise their legal rights; the right of the worker to be heard in internal company matters; protection of privacy; entitlement to four weeks leave; adequate protection against dismissal and ban on sex discrimination.</p>

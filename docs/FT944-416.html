			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Hualon chief on share charges Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese tycoon and legislator, was indicted for share price manipulation yesterday after a spate of payment defaults sent the island's stock market tumbling nearly 15 per cent in one week during October. Mr Oung is the effective head of the Hualon group, which includes a textile company earmarked to receive a UK government grant of Pounds 61m for a project in Northern Ireland. The Taipei district court formally charged Mr Oung and 33 others with offences including violation of securities transaction laws, breach of trust and embezzlement. The maximum sentence is seven years in prison. Prosecutors determined there was a case for Mr Oung to answer. He allegedly masterminded price-rigging of shares in Imperial Hotel through Hung Fu Securities, a brokerage indirectly controlled by him. With backing from underground financiers, Mr Oung and his aides were alleged to have lifted the share price from TDollars 30 in January 1993 to a high of TDollars 402 in August 1994. The district prosecutor, Mr Chou Chi-jung, said that even as investigations into alleged share price manipulation proceeded, Mr Oung and his associates endeavoured to push the share price higher to continue borrowing money from financiers. 'Links between financial flows from stock manipulation and his (Oung's) personal bank account and (those of his associates) are very close,' Mr Chou said. The case was the third big stock market controversy in four years linked to Mr Oung, who, with other family members, controls a group of companies believed to be the island's 10th biggest industrial group. The largest of these is Hualon-Teijran Corp, a listed textile concern, which earlier this year said it would build a Pounds 157m textile plant in Ulster with UK government subsidies. Hualon-Teijran was not named in indictment documents released by prosecutors yesterday. Mr Oung is believed to control the company but occupies no formal position. He was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail for his role in a 1990 share scandal which led to the fall of a cabinet minister but following appeals the sentence was reduced to to 26 months. Mr Oung has yet to be imprisoned because he was elected to a parliamentary seat as an independent in December 1992, entitling him to virtual immunity from detention and arrest.</p>

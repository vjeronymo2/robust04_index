			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Tobacco protest in Zimbabwe Hundreds of tobacco farmers are withdrawing their crop from Zimbabwe's auction floors in protest against the low prices on offer, Reuter reports from Harare. At least 30,000 bales of tobacco were pulled out of the market on Thursday and yesterday by angry farmers who said theywould return later in the year if the prices improved. Since the 1993 auctions opened two weeks ago, a kilo of Zimbabwe's flue-cured 'gold leaf' has been fetching an average of Dollars 1.11 - just over half last year's average price.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The high cost of creativity Companies are paying through the nose for the consultancy, creative and production skills involved in UK newspaper and magazine advertisements. That has long been suspected; now there is supporting evidence, according to collaborative research conducted by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, in conjunction with Advertising Research Marketing, a marketing communications company applying fixed-cost methods.* The results make grim reading. Why, for example, should one advertiser have paid production costs of Pounds 4,115 and a different advertiser Pounds 80,000, both for a four-colour double-page spread advertisement? Even allowing for variation in specifications, such as photography, there is no strong reason for the anomaly. The report reveals many instances of agencies seeking to augment profits by loading inadequately invoiced costs on to the production stage of the press advertising process. Such costs are not those incurred in buying media space; they are the simple and easily accountable costs involved in producing the creative concept, the artwork, photography and so forth. A recently privatised national public utility received a bill for Pounds 17,000 for the production work on a newspaper advertisement; another advertisement for the same utility, which reproduced the same images as its earlier ad with slight changes to the copy, was billed at Pounds 41,000. Such findings are bound to generate considerable controversy among advertising agencies, which are continuing to feel the pinch in the current recession. The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising revealed at the end of January that in 1992 another 1,000 jobs had been lost among IPA members based in London. Moreover, a new book to be published in March - Industrial Marketing Communications** - indicates the proportion of industrial and business-to  business advertisers dispensing with the services of an advertising agency has increased from 9 per cent in 1977 to 20 per cent today. Advertising agencies are increasingly losing out to direct mail and public relations activities. The ISBA/ARM research suggests that press advertising in the UK is subject to 'generally poor costing standards' and that there are 'very widespread and fundamental inadequacies in the standard of management controls and procedures throughout the estimating and invoicing path'. John Orsmond, chairman of ARM, says: 'Until agencies abandon variable-cost practices, they will never achieve the transparency and costing stability their clients are now demanding.' One area of complete opacity in the production of press advertising is that of consultancy charges. One advertiser was charged Pounds 52,000 for 'the thinking that lay behind' the pan-European concept of the advertisement in question. When it came to invoicing for the creative aspect of the production process, 91 per cent of those surveyed had no idea how the figure they were charged was arrived at by their agency. In the recession the finance director has regained status viz-a-viz the marketing boss; advertisers are demanding explanations of large bills without clear, item-by-item invoicing. Following the lead set by the ISBA, which published its own guide to best practice in dealing with advertising agencies in 1992, the IPA has just issued its own guidance note on best practice in the selection of an advertising agency. Among the advice aimed at advertisers considering how best to select from the many excellent advertising agencies on the IPA roster, though, there is nothing about how to tell from invoices if the agency work is above or below what might be considered a reasonable market rate. *Available from ARM, 1 McCrone Mews, Hampstead, London NW3 5BG.

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Own-label boost for Invergordon GROWING DEMAND for supermarkets' own-label Scotch whisky helped Invergordon Distillers Group lift interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 14.6m. Volume sales to retailers such as Tesco and Safeway rose 12 per cent as the whisky market polarised between premium brands and value-for-money products. Mid-priced standard brands were squeezed as sales of Scotch through pubs and clubs continued to decline, said Mr Chris Greig, managing director. Operating profit for the six months to June 30 increased from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.1m on turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 40.1m (Pounds 39.6m). Volume sales of whisky rose 9 per cent. In the UK, volumes increased 6 per cent against a similar market decline. Exports rose 14 per cent compared with the industry's overall gain of 6 per cent. Mr Greig dismissed fears of industry over-production. Total output during the first half of the year was some 11 per cent lower than in the corresponding period in 1990, and 7.3 per cent below last year's comparable figure. Output from the grain distillery had been maintained at last year's level but its four malt distilleries were operating at just under 60 per cent of capacity compared with 65 per cent last year. 'This year the industry is producing substantially less than it is selling,' Mr Greig said. 'There is no doubt that any surplus stock will be quickly used.' White spirit products - boosted by the new joint venture distillery at Greenwich - rose 68 per cent. Invergordon, which supplies gin and vodka manufacturers, intends to introduce its own branded gin next year. Earnings per share rose from 6.8p to 7.7p. The interim dividend is lifted to 2.8p (2.5p). Invergordon, which last year fought off a Pounds 350m bid from Whyte &amp; Mackay, refused to comment on the prospect of the bidder, which retains a 41 per cent stake, returning in two months' time. Mr Greig said: 'The best way to see off any predator is to perform.' Apart from its trading results, he pointed out, it had cut net borrowings from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 25.7m and reduced gearing from 85 per cent to 49 per cent in the past 12 months. See Lex</p>

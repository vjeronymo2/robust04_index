			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Vauxhall prices up by average of 2.3% VAUXHALL is increasing car and van prices by an average 2.3 per cent, with immediate effect. It is also increasing its standard delivery charge by Pounds 10 to Pounds 360. The rise follows increases averaging 3.7 per cent announced by market leader Ford last month. Like Ford, Vauxhall attributed the increases to higher costs and specification changes. The industry appears not to have been daunted by the publication of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car pricing, which is expected in the next few weeks. The MMC has been investigating whether cars are overpriced in the UK compared with other European markets and whether the system of exclusively franchised dealers works against consumers' interests. In recent years the vehicle industry has been encountered persistent criticism for increasing prices by more than the rate of inflation. The Vauxhall increases affect most models in the Nova, Astra, Cavalier and Senator car ranges, as well as Nova and Astra vans. They come within a few days of publication of a motoring survey concluding that three out of five new car buyers would rather have a lower, fixed basic price for a car than a higher price from which to negotiate their own discount. Ironically, the 1992 Lex Report on Motoring, based on a Mori survey of 1,300 drivers, appears to support a Vauxhall initiative last autumn, when it lowered dealer margins and list prices of some models to reduce haggling.</p>

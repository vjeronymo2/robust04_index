			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT DELAYS RULING ON FUNDING LIMITS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: JUDGES SAY THEY'LL DECIDE LATER WHETHER TO OVERTURN A RULING BLOCKING  PROPOSITION 73'S CAMPAIGN RESTRICTIONS.  </P> <P> Keeping the door open for statewide candidates to collect huge campaign  donations, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals balked Tuesday at immediately  reinstating Proposition 73's political contribution limits for the Nov. 6  election.  </P> <P> After hearing arguments on the issue for more than two hours, the three-judge  panel said it would take the case under submission and announce later whether  it will block a lower court decision overturning the contribution limits.  </P> <P> So for the moment, candidates for statewide and local elections can continue  raising campaign funds without restriction.  </P> <P> The appellate court was asked by the state Fair Political Practices Commission,  two authors of Proposition 73 and the California Republican Party to stay the  lower court's decision last week that overturned key provisions of the 1988  initiative. Democratic legislative leaders, labor unions and the Democratic  Party, which won the initial ruling, argued against any move to reinstate the  contribution limits.  </P> <P> In a decision that touched off a flurry of fund raising, U.S. District Judge  Lawrence K. Karlton ruled that the contribution limits of Proposition 73 were  unconstitutional because they hampered the ability of challengers to raise  campaign funds. Siding with Democratic legislative leaders and labor unions,  the judge also threw out Proposition 73's ban on transferring money among  candidates.  </P> <P> But a few days later, Karlton reinstated the campaign contribution limits of  Proposition 73 for legislative races. Again agreeing with Democrats, Karlton  concluded that the limits in the proposition would be less onerous than the  restrictions of Proposition 68, a rival measure that would take effect in the  absence of Proposition 73.  </P> <P> While the three appeals court judges did not disclose how they will rule, their  questioning of the attorneys in the case indicated that two of the three have  serious reservations about overruling Karlton in the complex matter.  </P> <P> James R. Parrinello, an attorney for the Republican Party, argued that the  sudden change in the law six weeks before the election posed a hardship to many  candidates who had planned their campaigns months in advance. "The rules were  changed with two minutes left in the fourth quarter," he said.  </P> <P> But Judge William A. Norris shot back, "Have you ever known of a candidate who  wasn't willing to adapt his campaign to take advantage of new money?"  </P> <P> Judge Cecil S. Poole also seemed unwilling to grant a stay, suggesting that the  increase in campaign funds "is not going to subvert the election process."  </P> <P> However, Judge Charles E. Wiggins, a former Republican congressman from  Fullerton, questioned Democratic attorneys closely about whether Proposition 73  was in fact unfair to challengers, as Karlton ruled.  </P> <P> Still, Wiggins took issue with the legal theory that campaign contribution  limits generally are constitutional because they counter corruption or the  appearance of corruption among public officials. "Nobody is accusing anybody of  being corrupt," he said. "It is the ill-conceived perception of corruption  (among public officials) that some people in our society harbor."  </P> <P> Since Karlton's decision, some candidates have taken advantage of the ruling to  raise large donations, including Democratic gubernatorial nominee Dianne  Feinstein, who has raised at least several hundred thousand dollars from labor  unions and other groups.  </P> <P> Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson said that if the court fails to  reinstate Proposition 73's voter-approved restrictions, he would renew his  challenge to Feinstein to abide by the $1,000 limit on individual contributions  established by the measure.  </P> <P> "And if she can't do that, I would invite her to at least abide by some limit,"  Wilson told reporters after he addressed the convention of the California Assn.  of Realtors.  </P> <P> Times political writers Cathleen Decker and Bill Stall contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

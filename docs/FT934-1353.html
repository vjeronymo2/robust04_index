			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Milosevic may have to form coalition The Socialists of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic last night were leading parliamentary elections by a narrow margin as Serbia voted amid economic collapse. But early, unofficial results suggested that the Socialists were unlikely to win a majority of the 250-seat parliament and would be forced to form a coalition government. Full unofficial results are expected today. While Mr Milosevic was not facing re-election, the poll was seen as a crucial test of whether he could keep his hold over Serbia, with inflation running at a monthly rate of 45,000 per cent. A spokesman for the Socialists said Mr Milosevic's party was headed for victory throughout Serbia. By contrast, leaders of DEPOS, the opposition coalition, and the centrist Democratic party, last night claimed a strong showing in Belgrade and in other Serbian towns, winning more than 30 per cent of the votes counted, according to partial results. As he cast his ballot yesterday. Mr Milosevic said: 'I am expecting successful elections and a stable government.' However, if the initial results are borne out, the poll will fail to deliver the Serbian president a compliant government. He called the early elections, Serbia's third in four years, after ultra-nationalist allies threatened to bring down his Socialist government. Officials said more than 50 per cent of Serbia's 7m voters had turned out for the poll.</p>

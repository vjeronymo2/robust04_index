			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Observer: Incestuous Matrix Churchill's plunge into receivership might raise a wry smile among ageing students of Britain's machine tool industry. One of the receivers, Philip Baldwin of Price Waterhouse, was also the man on the spot when Alfred Herbert went down in the last recession, nine years ago. Baldwin ended up selling the Herbert name and product range to TI Matrix, which subsequently became Matrix Churchill and fell under Iraqi ownership in 1987. Four years later it was bought by Keith Bailey's Automation Investments and shares the AI stable with BSA Tools - which, as White BSA, tried to buy the Herbert assets back in 1983. 'It's an incestuous sort of business,' says Bailey who is soldiering on with his BSA Tool business. Who knows, he might even try to salvage some of Matrix's assets from the receiver - although in that case, he'd have to contend with Baldwin who should have a better idea than most of what the assets are worth.</p>

Pursuant to that request, the Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53706). The circumvention inquiry covers the period January 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on a review of Brecoflex's submissions in conjunction with the International Trade Commission's (ITC) analysis of the manufacturing process for production of industrial power belts, the Department determines that Brecoflex does not have standing as a domestic producer of a like product to file the request in the instant inquiry. Therefore, we are terminating the circumvention inquiry. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> May 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0065 forcenewline --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Kimberley Huffman at (202) 482&hyph;0780 or Wendy Frankel at (202) 482&hyph;5253, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On June 14, 1989, the Department published the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan (54 FR 25314). On August 4, 1989, we published an amended order (54 FR 32104). On June 9, 1992, Brecoflex, who identified itself as a producer of a like product in the United States, alleged that the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan was being circumvented and requested that the Department investigate the matter. The Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In several submissions, Mectrol alleged that Brecoflex did not have standing to file a request for a circumvention inquiry. Therefore, on February 1, 1994, and February 28, 1994, the Department issued a standing questionnaire and supplemental standing questionnaire, respectively, to Brecoflex. Brecoflex responded to the standing questionnaires on February 17, 1994, and March 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Standing To File a Request for a Circumvention Inquiry <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 353.29 of the Department's regulations states that ``[a]ny interested party, as defined in &sect;353.2(k), may file'' a request for a circumvention inquiry (19 CFR 353.29). In its June 9, 1993, request for a circumvention inquiry, Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a domestic producer of industrial power belts. The provision in the Department's regulations for standing as a producer is &sect;353.2(k)(3) which includes in the definition of interested party ``[a] producer in the United States of the like product'' (19 CFR 353.2(k)(3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Brecoflex's U.S. Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In its June 9, 1992, request for a circumvention inquiry, Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a producer in the United States of a like product as covered by the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan. Pursuant to questions raised by Mectrol concerning Brecoflex's standing to bring this request for a circumvention inquiry, the Department issued a standing questionnaire to Brecoflex. In its standing questionnaire response, Brecoflex explained its U.S. operations as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brecoflex states that it imports from Germany polyurethane timing belts and performs secondary operations on these belts in its only United States facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. The secondary operations consist of the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> (1) Slitting of roll stock and truly endless belts to narrower belt widths; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Cutting roll stock to specific lengths; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Splicing and welding of open-ended roll stock to finished belts; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Attaching injection molded profiles to belt backs; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Machining of finished belts such as edge grinding, removing sections of teeth, providing holes for joining belts in linear drives, and grinding of belt back. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Brecoflex states that it fabricates, markets and sells three basic types of synchronous polyurethane timing belts that it considers to be subject merchandise. These belts include the Breco M, the Breco V, and the Brecoflex. Brecoflex performs the operations listed above on these three belts. (See the Department's April 15, 1994, Recommendation Memorandum for further detail.) <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

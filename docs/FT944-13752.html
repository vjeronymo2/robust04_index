			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: EBRD in moves to alter bank strategy The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is shifting away from loan finance to a greater use of equity products, wholesale banking and trade finance, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the bank president said yesterday. The restructured bank was becoming more of a wholesale banker by lending and investing large sums of capital in local banks and training staff, he added at a meeting organised by the Royal Institute for International Affairs but hosted by the Bank of England. Since 1991 the bank has approved lending and investments of more than Ecu750m (Dollars 922.5m) to 40 banks in 14 countries and approved an additional Ecu225m of equity to 21 investment funds. These two activities accounted for more than 20 per cent of the bank's committed portfolio of 221 board-approved projects in 21 countries at end-September, Mr de Larosiere added. The EBRD began by taking a 28.5 per cent equity stake in Poland's Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy for Dollars 12.7m in April last year. Its most recent banking foray was last month's Dollars 35m investment for 14 per cent of Russia's Tokobank. Since the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali last year the new president has pushed through cost-cutting and organisational changes which created a banking group organised into specific country teams. Over 40 bankers have been relocated from the London head office to 14 resident offices. The EBRD annual meeting in St Petersburg in April committed it to projects in all 25 of the states emerging from the collapse of the Soviet empire. 'This means smaller loans, more risk and a greater use of credit lines, bank-to-bank loans, equity funds and direct equity investment in financial intermediaries,' Mr de Larosiere said.</p>

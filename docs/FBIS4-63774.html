			<p>BFN     [Text] The press service of Ukraine's president and cabinet  of ministers has issued a statement saying that high-ranking  Russian officials have lately been ever more active in  participating in a rowdy campaign of misinformation and innuendo  being waged by the Russian mass media, aimed against Ukraine in  connection with the situation in Crimea. These officials have  thus imparted an official tone to this campaign.    Indeed, political party leaders making purposeful statements  are one thing and people whose official duty ought to be taking  care of the preservation and development of Russian-Ukrainian  good-neighborliness, which would absolutely exclude any attempts  to interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs, and whose voices are  sounding in the anti-Ukrainian information campaign, are quite  another.    Instead, we witness how these officials are taking on  themselves the part of supreme judges and resorting to the  rhetoric of dubious assertions, full of undisguised sympathy for  the Crimean leadership's separatist aspirations. They are even  resorting almost to overt threats to Ukraine, the leaders of  which are acting fully in accordance with constitutional  provisions and international norms and defending their state's  territorial integrity.    In participating in the anti-Ukrainian information campaign,  senior Moscow bureaucrats are encouraging Crimean separatists to  violate Ukraine's Constitution and the legislation in force. In  (?ostentatiously) expressing their concern in connection with  the exacerbation of the situation surrounding the Crimean  problem, they cannot find a single word of censure with regard  to anticonstitutional actions and decisions by those actually to  blame for the crisis. What is more, some strange logic makes  them put responsibility on Ukrainian politicians who in their  relations with Crimea do not trespass upon the boundary of  constitutionalism.    The inappropriateness and tactlessness of certain Russian  officials' statements are not conducive to friendly,  good-neighborly relations between the two Slav states, which  have common roots and whose problems of today are similar. This  causes surprise and anxiety to the people of Ukraine. Ukraine  has determined the strategy and priority of its policy towards  Russia, which is a policy of friendship and partnership on a  basis of equal rights, and consistently pursues this course and  rejects diktat or condescension.    We express regret that some in Russia cannot understand this  and still look on Ukraine as a dependent state. We call at this  difficult time in the history of our relations for consideration  and foresight. This is said in the statement by the press  service of Ukraine's president and cabinet of ministers.</p>

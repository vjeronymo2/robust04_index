			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PANEL MOVES TOWARD APPROVAL OF SOUTER  </P> <P> The Senate Judiciary Committee appeared ready to approve the nomination of  Judge David H. Souter to the Supreme Court after its two conservative Democrats  announced their support Monday.  </P> <P> Sens. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) and Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) joined five  Republicans on the 14-member panel who have made public their support for  Souter in advance of Thursday's vote.  </P> <P> Three years ago, opposition from Heflin, DeConcini and Sen. Arlen Specter  (R-Pa.), the most liberal Republican on the panel, helped doom the nomination  of controversial Judge Robert H. Bork to the high court. All three support  Souter.  </P> <P> Heflin made clear Monday that he sees Souter, like Bork a conservative, as  temperamentally different from the dogmatic Bork.  </P> <P> "Judge Souter will not bring a scorched-earth philosophy to the court, but he  will bring a sense of historic perspective and a clearheaded approach to the  analysis of legal issues," said Heflin, a chief justice in Alabama before  joining the Senate.  </P> <P> "He has not chosen to turn back the clock on the great constitutional  principles of our day," said DeConcini, recalling the language used against  Bork.  </P> <P> The six other Democrats and one Republican on the panel have not yet stated  their positions, but no one has said he will vote against Souter. In the entire  Senate, only Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) has announced that he opposes Souter.  </P> <P> Cranston based his opposition on Souter's refusal to say how he would vote on  overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized  abortion.  </P> <P> "I cannot support a nominee who refuses to acknowledge that a woman's right to  choose to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental right," Cranston said.  </P> <P> Undecided Senate liberals were coming under some pressure to oppose the  nomination.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an influential  coalition of rights groups, called for the Senate to reject Souter.  </P> <P> "We do not believe that David Souter has demonstrated that he has a commitment  to constitutional guarantees of individual rights and liberties," the group  said. It cited as "astonishing" Souter's statement during the committee's  hearings that his home state of New Hampshire does not have racial problems.  </P></p>

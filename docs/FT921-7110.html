			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Hidden costs in the superstore Will the computing superstore concept catch on in the UK as it has in the US? Many have their doubts but certainly the UK's first superstore, PC World in Croydon, South London, seems set to spawn a host of imitators selling everything from mice to monitors, processors to packaged software. In the US, superstores are already big, if not necessarily profitable, businesses. CompUSA claims to be the leading operator of large computer superstores there. It opened its first superstore in Dallas in 1985 after some years of selling to corporate and retail customers through more conventional methods. Now it operates some 20 superstores across the country. Last year the value of goods sold in its stores ranged from Dollars 22m (Pounds 12.50m) to Dollars 80m. Superstores represent exactly the opposite of everything the computer industry has tried to impress on its customers over the years. Computers are supposed to represent the ultimate in high-technology yet the superstores pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap like refrigerators and washing machines. Service and support is the lifeblood of most computing operations, but at the kind of profit margins superstores are prepared to consider, service has to be, at the most, perfunctory. If you know what you want you will get it; if not, help may be difficult to come by. There is an inescapable logic behind the success of the superstores. The price of personal computers has been tumbling in inverse relation to the amount of innovation in the product. Little differentiates one IBM personal computer from another these days. The microprocessor chip is the same. The operating system is the same. Much of the accessory circuitry is the same. It seems that personal computer manufacturers have become part of the distribution system for Intel microprocessors, Microsoft operating systems and Japanese memories. The superstores are simply the volume end of the distribution process, prepared to survive on minute margins. CompUSA, for example, says it offers more than 5,000 items in its stores at prices up to 80 per cent below manufacturer's retail prices. But its results bear out the delicacy of its balancing act. In 1989 it made Dollars 1.2m pretax profits on sales of Dollars 137m; in 1990, pretax profits were Dollars 1.5m on sales of Dollars 300m. Last year, it lost Dollars 9.7m on sales of Dollars 543m. In its profitable years, its operating income was between 1 and 2 per cent of sales. It is therefore no surprise that its catalogue lists a galaxy of cut-price goodies. An Epson 386SX Plus computer for example for Dollars 1,099 or a Dell System 320SX for Dollars 1,500. But visitors from the UK looking for bargains were struck recently by how little real difference there was in the price of systems in the superstores and in the UK. US superstore prices look cheap, but there are often catches. A computer which looks a good buy comes without a monitor. Adding a monitor not only pushes up the price but raises the risk that the power supply for the screen will be incompatible with voltages in the UK. Issues such as compatibility of power supplies have long been a factor behind the apparent lack of harmony between computer prices in the US and UK. UK prices have often come out twice as high as those in the US. The evidence of the superstores suggests that at the lower end, at least, the gap is narrowing if not already closed. The question remains open whether UK dealers can offer US prices and survive on US profit margins. Customers might be happier paying higher prices for guaranteed service and a financially secure supplier.</p>

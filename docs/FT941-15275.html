			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Look at the meat, not the spice - Perks for company shareholders As variety is to life, shareholder benefits are the spice of an equity investment. They are offered as a reward for loyalty or as a goodwill gesture but should never be a reason for an investor to choose one company over another. Spice cannot replace the meat of a company's investment performance. Kevin Adams, at stockbroker Seymour Pierce Butterfield, which has compiled an annual directory of shareholder perks, for the past 15 years, said: 'An investment should not be selected on the grounds of the concessionary discount. Far more important is to look at the fundamentals of a company and see if its investment strategy is one with which you agree.' Nevertheless, 120,000 investors in P &amp; O, the ferry company, have bought the company's stock because of car-based cross-Channel discounts of up to 50 per cent. The minimum holding is of 600 5.5 per cent redeemable non-cumulative preference shares, worth about Pounds 940. 'People purchase this class of stock for the benefit,' said Michael Owen, assistant company secretary at P &amp; O. 'The majority have had them for very many years and it is a capped market because we cannot issue any more.' Peter Hargreaves, chairman of Hargreaves Lansdown, the asset management group, which also publishes a directory of perks, believes that these benefits can sometimes contribute to a company's performance. 'Over the years many people have purchased P &amp; O concessionary shares, not only to benefit from an attractive income, but also to benefit from the extremely advantageous channel crossing fares. Due to the high number of private shareholders on the P &amp; O share register, the share price has always remained attractive and stable.' P &amp; O's rival, Eurotunnel, which this week announced fares of between Pounds 125 to Pounds 310, will also reward its early shareholders with concessionary travel. Someone who bought 100 shares in the Eurotunnel flotation in 1987 is entitled to one return journey at a cost of Pounds 1 and an annual registration fee of about Pounds 10, if they make the trip within a year of the tunnel opening. Larger shareholders are entitled to more concessionary trips. The number of companies offering perks has been steadily increasing according to Adams. Seymour Pierce Butterfield's directory this year contains 116 entries, up from 111 last year and 99 in 1992. Few companies decide to withdraw them, said Adams, although some disappear when there is corporate activity, such as a company takeover. Benefits are usually in the form of a card or vouchers sent out to shareholders once their name appears on the register, entitling them to discounts. Others give their shareholders complimentary gifts, usually a sample of the company's wares. Discounts often apply to the full retail price and not to special offers. Most companies require a minimum shareholding and other restrictions may also apply. P &amp; O shareholders, for example, must be on the company register by December 31 before the sailing date and must still be on the register at the sailing date to qualify. The value of benefits can vary enormously. Bensons Crisps gives shareholders attending the company's annual general meeting free packets of crisps for tasting and taking home. By contrast, Asprey, the jeweller and silversmith, will give a discount of 15 per cent on cash and cheque purchases. The discount does not apply to repairs or valuations and only investors with at least 5062 ordinary shares are eligible for the Asprey card. This means a holding of just over Pounds 16,000 in Asprey shares at the current share price. Other potentially valuable company perks include those offered by British Airways, Trafalgar House, Airtours, Forte and The Savoy Hotel. BA posts a coupon to those with a minimum of 200 shares giving the shareholder the right to 10 per cent off published air fares, including Apex, and it can be used by those travelling on Concorde. The discount applies only once in a year. If the investor flies between the slack travel months of January 1 and March 31 this year, the reduction doubles to 20 per cent. Other concessions are also available. Airtours will give all shareholders 10 per cent off its holidays while Trafalgar House investors can get a 15 per cent reduction on selected QE2 and other cruises (minimum shareholding: 500 ordinary shares). The Savoy Hotel group offers reductions of 10 per cent off the average room rate at a number of its hotels, including the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught. The price of an average room at the Savoy is Pounds 220 - the discount does not apply to any special promotional offers. Investors only need 10 ordinary shares to qualify. Forte, the largest shareholder in the Savoy group, offers a Forte Gold Card to investors with at least 300 Ordinary shares. The card entitles holders to a 10 per cent discount on accommodation, meals and drinks in the company's hotels worldwide. It can also be used at Lillywhites, the leisurewear and sports shop in London's Piccadilly and on fine wine and hampers bought from the Wine Growers' Association. Most of the companies which offer shareholder benefits are in the consumer and leisure industries but there are some in the financial sector. Bank of Scotland shareholders applying for the bank's Premier visa card pay neither the Pounds 10 joining fee nor the annual Pounds 70 subscription. Additional cards, usually costing Pounds 10, are provided free. Other benefits include a waiver of the 1 per cent commission on sterling and dollar travellers cheques while the annual 1 per cent fee on the bank's self-select personal equity plan is halved. You must hold at least 1,200 shares and have been on the bank's register for one year to qualify. Shareholders with a self-select Pep at the Royal Bank of Scotland (into which RBS shares can be transferred) do not have to pay an initial charge. General Accident gives all its individual shareholders premium discounts of 10 per cent on home, motor and travel insurance policies. The 1994 Perks Book, Seymour Pierce Butterfield, 24 Chiswell Street, London EC1Y 4TY, is published later this month. Free. Attractive Perks for UK Shareholders, Hargreaves Lansdown, is usually Pounds 3 but is available free to FT readers who should write, quoting the offer, to Hargreaves Lansdown Embassy House, Queens Avenue, Clifton, Bristol BS8 1SB.</p>

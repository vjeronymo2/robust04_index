			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Senior Tory MP quits political consultancy Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee and a member of the Commons committee investigating the so-called 'cash-for-questions' affair, is stepping down from the board of one of Britain's leading political consultancies. He is one of four MPs who will cease to be directors of Westminster Communications this month. The other three are Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs and defence spokesman, and Sir Keith Speed, Conservative MP for Ashford. The four will also sever their financial links with the company. It is understood that Mr Campbell has been paid Pounds 5,000 a year for his services. The move is significant because it comes when the outside interests which many MPs use to supplement their salaries are coming under increasing scrutiny amid calls for a fundamental reassessment. Many expect one result of the current probe will be to make it harder for MPs to serve as directors or consultants of professional lobbying companies and public affairs consultancies. The move by the four MPs will reinforce such expectations. If the committee did decide to recommend such a move it could have a serious effect on the overall earnings of some MPs, who continue to act as directors or consultants to PR and lobbying companies. In January, when the latest register of MPs' interests was published, these included Mr Michael Jopling, the former agriculture minister, Sir Peter Fry, the Tory MP for Wellingborough, Dame Angela Rumbold, former Home Office minister, and Mr Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall North. The departure as directors of the four MPs has been necessitated by an application by Westminster Communications to join the Association of Professional Political Consultants. The APPC does not allow members to 'place themselves in a position of potential conflict of interest' by appointing any MP to their board or by paying 'any retainer or commission to an MP'. Mr Andrew Gifford, chairman of the association, said last month he thought it was 'difficult to see how you could very easily have MPs on the board or retained and not have some perceived conflict of interest'. Sir Marcus, who lists seven directorships and three consultancies in the current register, was selected in July by Labour leftwingers as a token target in their failed attempt to ensure that the privileges committee inquiry was conducted solely by MPs with no outside interests. The inquiry was triggered by the action of two Conservative MPs - Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - in agreeing to accept payments of Pounds 1,000 to table parliamentary questions.</p>

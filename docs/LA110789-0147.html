			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TURNOUT HEAVY IN VIRGINIA VOTE  </P> <P> Turnout was heavy today as L. Douglas Wilder's bid to become the nation's first  elected black governor went to the voters after a race in which abortion and  negative campaigning emerged as major issues.  </P> <P> "We're on roller skates," said Alice Lynch, registrar in Richmond, describing  the activity in her office. "I think it's going to be a record in Richmond  anyway."  </P> <P> Wilder, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, and J. Marshall Coleman,  the Republican candidate, flew across the state Monday to warn supporters  against complacency and too much reliance on polls showing Wilder ahead.  </P> <P> "We're absolutely on the eve of a great victory," Coleman told about two dozen  volunteers at Richmond's airport.  </P></p>

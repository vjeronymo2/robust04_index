The effect is calculated  theoretically. Fiber directional couplers with continuously  variable branching ratio (full range from 1/1 to 0/1) have been  fabricated. Fiber core diameter is 75 microns and outer  diameter is 125 microns. Coupler external dimensions are 2 cm x  2 cm x 3 cm, and the coupler has a precision adjuster for  branching ratio.    Figures 1-6, not reproduced, show the following: the  experimental equipment, consisting of a 632.8-nm-wavelength  He-Ne laser, a biconvex lens, the fiber, the coupler, two more  biconvex lenses, and two detectors; the structure and side view  of the coupler; a vertical view of the coupler rotating through  a certain angle; a power density transform diagram; cross  sections of the coupler with fiber translational movement and  fiber angular rotation; and graphs of branching ratio vs  translational movement distance and branching ratio vs rotation  angle, respectively. There are no tables.  <H5>  References: </H5>   1. K. Ogawa, A.R. McCormick, APPL. OPT., 1978, 17(3):2077.    2.

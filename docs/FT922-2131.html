			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Kashmir solution 'must get priority' MR NAWAZ SHARIF, prime minister of Pakistan, last week had a 'heart-to-heart' talk with his Indian counterpart, Mr PV Narasimha Rao. He says he told Mr Rao that by spending large proportions of their budgets on defence, they were depriving their people of basic rights. During a visit to Britain following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro - where he met Mr Rao - Mr Sharif made clear in an interview that solution of the problem of Kashmir, the disputed territory which is the cause of heavy defence spending and two wars with India, carries the highest priority. A cut in arms spending, which takes up nearly a third of Pakistan's budget, would free resources for development and help to support Mr Sharif's radical economic reforms. It would help India, which is attempting similar changes to its economy, in the same way. Mr Sharif has opened up the economy and begun a dialogue with India. But he remains beset by domestic political opposition, and by unrest which has prompted a military crackdown on violent crime in the southern province of Sindh. Pakistan is deprived of US aid because of its nuclear programme and has proposed a five-nation conference - the US, Russia, China, India and Pakistan - to discuss non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. India has refused to participate. Mr Sharif said, however, that 'the nuclear problem will only be solved when Kashmir is solved ..even if we solve the nuclear issue, the tensions will not be resolved.' Though Pakistani officials made clear that there was no attempt to impose conditions by linking the issues, Mr Sharif said the need to have a large defence capability arose precisely because of the Kashmir problem. He said he drew Mr Rao's attention to atrocities being committed by the Indian military in Indian-held Kashmir. 'The worst kind of violation of human rights is being allowed to go on,' Mr Sharif said. This was their fourth meeting, and though it underlined the quiet improvement in their relations, it also followed an escalation of tension this year: Pakistan was forced to halt two attempts by Kashmiris to cross over into Indian-held Kashmir, and last month there was a round of expulsions of diplomats. If progress on Kashmir seems blocked, Mr Sharif's achievements on the economic front are significant. Most exchange controls have gone, the budget deficit has been cut, a liberal foreign investment law has been enacted, some regulations have been removed and subsidies reduced. A total of 54 industrial companies have been privatised as well as a number of banks, and the aim is to privatise airlines, ports, shipping and telecommunications. Mr Sharif says he hopes to make the rupee convertible during his tenure. About Dollars 1bn (Pounds 540m) has flowed into foreign exchange accounts in Pakistan, mostly from Pakistanis living abroad. Mr Sharif will tomorrow address a London conference designed to attract investment to Pakistan. Foreign investors and lenders, however, have been put off by the uncertain political situation and by moves towards an 'Islamised' economy, in which the concept of interest is outlawed. Partly because of international implications, the government has appealed against a Shariat Court ruling that all transactions must be conducted according to Islamic principles by June 30. The appeal will not be heard until later in the year, thereby postponing that deadline. Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, says that 70 per cent of transactions are now carried out on Islamic principles. Some Islamic scholars contend, however, that the new accounts do not satisfy the principles. Mr Sharif, apparently wishing to defuse the issue without losing political support, says: 'All Islamic scholars agree that these are complex issues and will take time. We need time to examine the implications.' Gunmen have killed Mr Nazir Ahmed Siddique, the Kashmir carpet dealer who negotiated the release of several prominent hostages seized by militants fighting the Indian government, Reuter reports from Srinagar. No one immediately admitted responsibility.</p>

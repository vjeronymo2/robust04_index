			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Irish reunification costly Sir, Ian Davidson, in his article 'Ballot box blarney' (August 17), makes, what is to me, one of the classic errors in summarising the current situation regarding Northern Ireland and its constitutional position within the UK. Your writer refers to recent statements by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein; he outlines difficulties for the terrorists on both sides; he restates comments made by the British government; he reflects on the demographic changes taking place between the Catholics and the Protestants in the province; he refers to the Spanish and French governments by way of a comparison to illustrate his opinion of the present position. Not once does he consider the views of the people of Eire. I have family and friends south of the border, and in a very unsophisticated survey I found that the majority of my contacts would prefer there to be no reunification with Ulster. This is not out of any lack of nationalistic pride, but from the practical belief that Eire cannot afford to take on the cost of integrating the North. The feeling is that Eire is not a West Germany or even a South Korea. Their hearts may be for it, but it is an open question as to whether their wallets and purses are as enthusiastic.

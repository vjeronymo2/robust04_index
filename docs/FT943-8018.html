			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade's board survives on technicality Waterglade International's board of directors yesterday overcame attempts to oust them, by cancelling an extraordinary general meeting on a technicality. The EGM had been called by rebel shareholders to bring in a new board, but the existing directors claimed that due notice had not been given for the proposals. The opposing shareholders, led by Mr Winston Ng, claimed to have proxy votes covering more than 41 per cent of Waterglade shares. Donnington, one of Mr Ng's backers, said: 'We have requested assurance from Waterglade's board that, pending the holding of any necessary further EGM, they should maintain the status quo as far as possible.' It has already called for another meeting. The existing management is still negotiating a refinancing package with its bankers, while the new shareholders are proposing an immediate Pounds 6m rights issue.</p>

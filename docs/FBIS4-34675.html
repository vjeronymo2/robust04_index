			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Thousands of  workers, peasants, and teachers marched today through the main  streets of Tegucigalpa to demand that salaries be increased and  that the economic adjustment program in force since 1990 be  suspended.    "The IMF reduces our salaries," "the moral revolution is  killing the people," and "the rooster is screwing us up from  early on," were slogans chanted by demonstrators, who criticized  the administration of Carlos Roberto Reina.    Reina, who took office on 27 January, used "moral  revolution"  as his campaign slogan to stop corruption as well as a "red  rooster" as a symbol to convey his idea of "a new dawn" for the  people with a "new government style."    Reina stated that his government's "hands are tied" by such  problems inherited from the previous administration as the  11.2-percent fiscal deficit, the $3.6-billion foreign debt, and  $450-million annual foreign debt payments.    The demonstrators asked for a 100-percent general wage  increase, inflation control, a decrease in the price of staples  and housing, as well as comprehensive agrarian and forest reform  programs to preserve the environment.    The day before the demonstration the government approved a  30-percent average increase in inter city collective  transportation fees.    Repeated unofficial reports indicate that there will be a  devaluation of the lempira, the national currency, as well as  new hikes in fuel and electricity prices. These rumors have  raised further concern among grass-roots sectors.    Experts said that over 5,000 demonstrators demanded jail  sentences for officials and former officials of the National  Enterprise for Electric Power because they believe these  officials' mistakes have caused electricity rationing of 35  hours per week throughout the country.    The government faces negotiations with teachers who demand a  salary increase. The government must also deal with a conflict  concerning salary payments between the owners of the almost  defunct company Honduran Air Services, Incorporated, and over  400 workers of this company.    The demonstrators asked people to unite and to support their  demands, and they announced new and larger demonstrations in the  coming days.    The government of former President Rafael Leonardo Callejas  began in 1990 a rigorous economic adjustment program with the  support of such financial organizations as the IMF and the World  Bank.    The grass-roots sectors repeatedly rejected that program  and, according to analysts, it caused the electoral defeat of  the conservative National Party of Honduras.</p>

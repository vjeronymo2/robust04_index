			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC expected to lift foot and mouth ban THE EUROPEAN Community is expected today to agree to lift the one-month ban on imports of livestock and dairy products from Central and East Europe imposed after the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in Italy. The move would aim to defuse an embarrassing dispute with 18 central and eastern European countries, some of which denounced the original trade ban as a restoration of the Iron Curtain. At a meeting in Strasbourg today, the European Commission is expected to endorse a recommendation made by veterinary experts yesterday to lift the ban, subject to stringent quality controls on meat and dairy exports to the EC. One option under review is to impose a two-week quarantine on livestock entering the EC from central and eastern Europe. The EC and Austrian ban on meat and dairy products imposed earlier this month provoked a furious protest from central and eastern Europeans who said there was no sign of foot-and-mouth disease in their animals. Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic imposed tit-for-tat bans, while Slovakia barred the transit of EC livestock. The former communist countries suggested the EC ban was an excuse to protect its own agricultural producers and reflected the community's own niggardly offers on market access for eastern European countries. In response to the criticism, Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said the East's bans were politically motivated and unacceptable. The scare began after foot-and-mouth was discovered in Italy and traced to Croatia, a transit point for goods and produce entering the EC.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Gas asks for time on Manila bid British Gas has asked the Philippines government for more time to consider a possible bid for the state-owned Manila Gas Corporation. The company, which was due to be sold last Monday, distributes natural gas to industrial, commercial and residential users in Manila. Reuters yesterday reported that the government had deferred the sale in order for the National Development Company, the state owner of Manila Gas, to evaluate new offers from British Gas and two Japanese companies. But British Gas said it had not yet decided whether to go ahead with a bid. The government wants to sell its 90 per cent holding in Manila Gas. The remainder will be sold to small investors. A government official yesterday said the interest of British Gas and the Japanese companies was 'an improvement over the 20 or so potential buyers who expressed interest only in the real estate assets'. Expansion in south-east Asia is known to be a priority for British Gas.</p>

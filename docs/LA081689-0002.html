			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> R. B. ANDERSON; EISENHOWER'S TREASURY CHIEF  </P> <P> Robert B. Anderson, who was secretary of the Treasury under President Dwight D.  Eisenhower but saw his later career clouded by an income tax conviction, has  died at the age of 79.  </P> <P> Anderson, a native Texan who had lived in Manhattan in recent years, died  Monday at New York Hospital. He had entered the hospital July 25 suffering from  cancer of the esophagus and died of complications after surgery, said his son,  Gerald L. Anderson.  </P> <P> As Treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961, Anderson was known for being  conservative and putting a high priority on preserving the value of the dollar  rather than cutting taxes or paying for additional outlays. It was on his  recommendation that Eisenhower decided that the projected surplus for fiscal  1961 should be used to pay off some of the national debt rather than cutting  taxes.  </P> <P> After leaving government, Anderson was a limited partner in the New York-based  investment banking firm of Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co. from 1961 to 1973.  </P> <P> He held other directorships and posts in business and finance and served as an  economic adviser to the sultan of Oman and as a lobbyist and consultant for the  Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.  </P> <P> Anderson pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to income tax  evasion in 1983 and 1984 and to operating an illegal offshore bank. In 1987, he  was sentenced to a month in prison and five months' house arrest.  </P> <P> He served his prison term in August, 1987, and completed his house arrest in  January, 1988, authorities said.  </P> <P> In January, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court disbarred  Anderson, saying the illegal banking had been unconscionable.  </P> <P> In sending Anderson to prison, Judge Edmund L. Palmieri also sentenced him to  five years' probation and directed him to make restitution to victims of the  bank operation who lost money on his advice. The judge said he was aware that  Anderson had been hospitalized for alcoholism 10 times since 1981 and ordered  him to enter a treatment program.  </P> <P> Originally a Democrat, Anderson switched parties by 1956 and remained a  Republican. As secretary of the Navy in 1953-54, and deputy secretary of  defense in 1954-55, he was known as a quiet and efficient administrator.  </P> <P> Earlier, Anderson had held several posts in Texas government.  </P> <P> In addition to his son Gerald, Anderson is survived by another son, three  grandchildren and two sisters. His wife, the former Ollie Mae Rawlings, died in  1987.  </P></p>

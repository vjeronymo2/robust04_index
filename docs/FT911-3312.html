			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Inter-Continental Hotels takes a long view - Saison Group's plans for the 102-unit chain WHEN Saison Group, the Japanese stores and leisure combine, bought Inter-Continental Hotels in 1988, critics said the Dollars 2.3bn purchase price was too high. On paper, they have a point. Over the past two years, Inter-Continental has failed to cover its financing costs, losing Dollars 60m in 1989 and running some Dollars 7m into the red last year. But the company points out that its projections made at the time of the purchase were overtaken by rising world interest rates and, more recently, by the impact of the Gulf crisis. Mr Yuji Takaoka, chairman of Seiyu, the trading company at the core of the Saison group, insists that Inter-Continental's performance is satisfactory. He draws attention to the hotel chain's operating profits which grew 20 per cent last year to Dollars 87.5m. Mr Takaoka expects the investment to pay off in the long run. 'For the first few years we have not set a prime goal of making profits. Of course, we don't want to see red ink. But rather than just achieve a big profit we want to develop a good network.' Mr Takaoka denies suggestions that the Saison group's finances are being stretched by the acquisition which was funded with bank borrowings totalling more than Dollars 1.2bn. 'Inter-Continental is not a burden,' he says, adding that the hotel chain is expected to cover its interest payments and make a pre-tax profit in 1991. Saison Group, which used to be called Seibu Saison until late last year, is one of the best-known companies in Japan, with a portfolio of high-profile businesses and a colourful corporate history. The group is a network of 130 companies, including seven which are publicly quoted, with interests ranging from Seibu Department Stores, Japan's biggest chain, to helicopters, banking and travel. It is controlled by Mr Seiji Tsutsumi, whose brother Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi has an even larger business empire based on railways. The two men, who inherited their fortunes from their father, are said to be bitter rivals. Mr Takaoka says Saison companies are managed independently but co-operate on large projects such as the purchase of Inter-Continental. The bulk of the finance for the deal was raised by the group's listed companies. Mr Takaoka concedes the increase in interest rates made the Japanese financial markets 'very tight' and so made it more expensive than expected to finance the purchase. Saison group originally intended to replace its bank lending with long-term funds. But the difficulty of using the capital markets obliged the group last year to extend its bank loans. The Japanese media say this arrangement also forced Saison group to revise its plans for Inter-Continental to squeeze more profits out of the operation in the next few years. According to Diamond Weekly, a business magazine, this will include more property sales than originally planned, among them the disposal of the Mayfair, in central London, one of Inter-Continental's top hotels. Mr Takaoka says financial projections have been revised but not by very much. He declines to give figures. Also, far from selling hotels, Saison group has expanded the Inter-Continental chain from 95 in 1988 to 102, plus nine properties under construction. If hotels are sold in future it will be to streamline the chain, not to raise funds. As for the Mayfair, which might be worth Dollars 400m, Mr Takaoka says the group is only considering selling it because a 'very old friend' has offered to buy it. If the Mayfair is sold, it would allow the London Inter-Continental Hotel to be refurbished. Mr Takaoka says that the disposals the group has made also show that critics are wrong in claiming the original purchase price was too high. He says top-class hotel rooms in the US are now trading at Dollars 0.4m-Dollars 0.5m each, compared with an average of Dollars 0.2m paid for Inter-Continental Hotels. The group wants Inter-Continental to be a 'European-style' chain, with a greater emphasis on individuality and personal service than is apparent in large US-owned chains, says Mr Takaoka. The chain will also be developed inside Japan, starting with the opening of an Inter-Continental in Yokohama in July.</p>

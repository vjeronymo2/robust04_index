Assen,  that they talk about the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) for  the economy in New York on 19 March.    Paramaribo accepted the invitation and has approached the  Warwick Research Institute (British university) to act as  adviser. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be there  for the Netherlands.    Pronk's invitation is a reaction to the Surinamese proposal  of 24 February to begin talks as quickly as possible on a  solution to the lingering question of external guidance for the  SAP. In Paramaribo, emotions were running high this week  following the sharp criticism levelled by Pronk at the  Surinamese approach to the economic crisis. However, with the  indignant statement made by Assen on the matter, the question  would appear to be over.    The Netherlands is still demanding that Suriname takes on  the  IMF as an external adviser for the SAP before there can be any  talk of resuming economic aid. However, Paramaribo wants to  throw in its lot with Warwick. Warwick, however, only wants to  give technical assistance and is "not prepared nor in a  position" to coercively enforce the required measures, nor to  advise The Hague on resuming aid.</p>

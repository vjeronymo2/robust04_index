			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Status quo is no way to free Britain from years of decline Sir, The case put forward by Sir Bryan Hopkin and Sir Douglas Wass (Personal View, January 22) for the continued dependence of the Bank of England on the Treasury was erudite, eloquent and exhaustive. It was also, to an industrialist, utterly unhelpful. I read and re-read it for some glimpse of what these index-pensioned knights think that we could do to free ourselves from 40 years of decline in which they, if they have truly earned their spurs, have surely played some part. No such luck. Status quo is the answer. Dismiss what other countries might have done successfully. Wisdom resides uniquely in Whitehall and Westminster. In contrast, we in industry are not measured by eloquence of speech nor erudition in writing but on attainment of quantified and timed objectives. On that basis, they and their contemporaries might not have long survived. Try this for size: 'The nature and degree of the . . . effects (of monetary policy) cannot be free from doubt and argument.' Ergo, do nothing. I am confronted daily by doubt and argument, but finally a decision is taken and its effects are measured. If it proves wrong over time (or is 40 years insufficient?), then it is rejected and replaced. We cannot go on like this in our self-satisfied, ossified mentality. Perhaps the plan by Sir Terry Burns to expose some of his team to the rude realities of trade might be extended to encompass the meeting of German, French, American and Japanese businessmen who buy from us and sell to us. They laugh at our navety - not of those with whom they bargain hard, but of the worldly-ignorant rulers responsible for the economic environment in which we struggle to exist.

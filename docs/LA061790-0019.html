			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STONING CLAY  </P> <P> You want us to believe that he's a sweet, sensitive guy and that the Diceman is  just an act. So I can't help but wonder -- what if the baby he's expecting is  born with physical or mental handicaps? Will the Diceman still think those  jokes are funny? What if that child chooses a homosexual lifestyle or selects a  mate of another race and gives him "urine-colored" grandchildren.  </P> <P> Will the Diceman still be laughing?  </P> <P> As the mother of a handicapped child, I am far too aware of the ignorance and  bigotry that is focused on those who are born into a life of challenge. His act  merely encourages this ignorance to fester and grow to it's enormous, ugly  potential. For every joke he tells, a thousand mothers have cried themselves to  sleep in pain for the way their children are treated. And if handing one  unfortunate individual $1,000 is all it takes to clear his conscience, then he  never really had one.  </P> <P> CATHERINE BACOS CLINCH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / US durable goods orders rise 1.3% New orders for US durable goods increased 1.3 per cent last month and 13.3 in the year to June, indicating that prospects for US manufacturers remain bright, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The figures surprised Wall Street analysts who had projected a less robust monthly increase of about 0.5 per cent. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the gain was 'entirely accounted for by increases in non-defence, non-aviation capital goods, which rose 6.4 per cent to a new all-time high'. The high level of business investment was likely to support 'balanced and sustainable growth', he said. The June figures showed gains in most industrial sectors. Orders for transport equipment, industrial machinery and electronic equipment were up 2.3, 2.2 and 1.1 per cent respectively from May. Orders for primary metals fell 3.1 per cent but this followed a strong gain in May. The figures follow a series of reports - including a deceleration in growth of retail sales and industrial production - that appeared to indicate economic growth was easing somewhat, lessening the immediate pressure on the Federal Reserve to curb the expansion by raising short-term interest rates again. In congressional testimony last week Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said he saw the economy 'settling into more moderate rates of growth over the next six quarters and inflation remaining relatively subdued'. But he said there were conflicting signals and warned that he might need to raise short-term rates further to keep inflation under control. Analysts are now keenly awaiting figures on gross domestic product for the second quarter, due on Friday. The consensus view is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent, roughly in line with growth of 3.4 per cent in the first three months, and sharply lower than the annualised 7 per cent registered in the fourth quarter of last year. But some forecasters are projecting annualised growth of as much as 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (14): Great expectations begin to cool - Alice Rawsthorn takes the temperature and finds that while industry warmed to good economic conditions the financial sector had to operate in a chilly climate / France THIS TIME last year 1992 seemed set to be, at the very least, a prosperous year for France and its largest companies. The French economy had, after all, seen no sign of slipping into recession and was poised for faster growth than most of its European competitors. France's leading industrial and financial groups were in strong shape, with relatively little debt, and were well placed to benefit from the legacy of years of low inflation and win back export markets. A year later, as a glance at the FT500, shows it is clear that 1992 was not quite as good a year for the French as they originally expected. The Paris stock market raced away in the opening months of 1992, but the CAC-40 Index reached its peak of 2,077 in the second week of May, and has since fallen fairly steadily. The CAC-40 ended the year at 1,858, little more than 5 per cent higher than on the last day of 1991. The overall performance of French companies in the FT500 reflects the same pedestrian pattern, but it also illustrates the division between the performance of the industrial and financial sectors. French industry fared fairly well in 1992 with some companies showing significant increases in market capitalisation. Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications and engineering group, improved its ranking as did BSN in food, L'Oreal in cosmetics, L'Air Liquide in gases and Saint-Gobain in glass. The scenario for the financial sector was far less sanguine. Societe Generale, one of the largest private sector banks, made gains, but it was an exception. The competitive state of the French banking and insurance market, combined with the impact of the economic slowdown on investment portfolios, created a chilly climate. Some of France's leading financial institutions - Paribas in banking, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Axa in insurance - slipped down the FT500. The contrast between the two sectors is borne out by the earnings pattern in 1992. James Capel, the Paris stockbroker, estimates that the CAC-40 companies suffered a decline in earnings of just over 12 per cent last year compared with 1991. But finance was hit far harder than industry. If the banks are removed from the Index, James Capel calculates the earnings reduction of the remaining stocks at just 5 per cent. Similarly there are clear lessons to be drawn from the lists of French companies which did particularly well, or badly, in 1992. The winners are all principal players in their particular fields, with a wide spread of international interests and, in general, low levels of debt. Alcatel Alsthom, the biggest French company in the FT500, has devoted most of its energy over the past five years to expanding its international activities. After a stream of acquisitions it has built up a business that now has 70 per cent of its sales outside France, against just 30 per cent five years ago. Where necessary it has formed joint ventures, notably with GEC of the UK to create GEC-Alsthom, to secure the strong positions it needs to survive as a long-term player in highly competitive international markets. BSN has been no less active in establishing itself as a force in the European food industry. It has introduced its indigenous French brands to other markets and bought up businesses in other countries, notably in Italy. BSN has even been willing to join forces with its archenemies to secure the critical mass needed to survive as it demonstrated last spring by backing Nestle of Switzerland, one of its chief competitors, in the bitter battle over Perrier mineral water. L'Oreal has had the advantage of being a long-established international business in its strategy of consolidating its position as the world's largest cosmetics company. This has proved invaluable at a time when its competitors have struggled to adapt to life in an increasingly consolidated and competitive industry. All these companies benefited in 1992 from extensive international interests that enabled them to counter the sluggish state of the French market. The high level of real interest rates, coupled with concern about rising unemployment, has depressed consumer demand in France for the past year or so. The industrial sector has been similarly sluggish, forcing French companies to look for growth in other countries. They have had some success in doing so. French exports enjoyed rapid growth for much of the year and the trading account swung from deficit in 1991 to credit in 1992. The export effort was helped by the legacy of years of low inflation, which gave French companies a considerable cost advantage over many of their competitors. But that advantage disappeared when the September currency crisis left the franc at a high level against other key currencies. This has not only made it more difficult for the French to compete in their export markets, but has also reduced the contribution from their international operations. Even the winners in the 1992 FT500 have felt the effects of the strong franc. For the losers, it has come as a bitter blow after a year spent struggling against sluggish domestic demand and the financial impact of a weak stock market. Paribas, for instance, saw its market capitalisation slide last year when it announced its first-ever loss and was then beset by other problems, culminating in its involvement in the scandal over the off-balance sheet losses of Ciments Francais, the French cement company that it controlled until recently. The big French insurers - UAP, Axa and Assurances Generales de France (AGF)  -all slipped down the FT500 when the competitive state of the French insurance market was aggravated by the writedowns on their industrial investments and property portfolios. A similar pattern seems set to be repeated in 1993. James Capel does expect some improvement in earnings, however. It forecasts that the CAC-40 companies will achieve growth of 15 per cent, this would still leave them 8 per cent below the level reached in 1989. Despite the French government's bullish comments about the strong franc and low inflation, the latest surveys still show low levels of confidence among industrialists and consumers, suggesting that there is unlikely to be an improvement in domestic demand this year.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin halved to Pounds 4.35m MACDONALD MARTIN Distilleries, producer of Glenmorangie and Glen Moray malt whiskies, blamed the recession and extreme competitive pricing, particularly in the blended sector, for a near 50 per cent decline in full year pre-tax profits. The company, which had warned shareholders to expect a sharp decline, said pre-tax profits slumped from Pounds 8.57m to Pounds 4.35m in the 12 months to March 31. Earnings per A share fell from 4.88p to 20.38p. However, as expected, the final dividend is maintained at 6.6p for an unchanged total of 8.8p. Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director, said it had been 'a difficult year for the industry,' with margins suffering as a direct consequence of pricing pressures. Turnover fell by 19.5 per cent to Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 30m) and despite an 8 per cent reduc-tion in costs, operating profits declined by nearly 43 per cent to Pounds 5.66m (Pounds 9.89m). Interest payments were virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.32m) with year-end borrowings increasing slightly to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 12.4m), but gearing remaining steady at 30 per cent. Shipments of single malt whiskies as a whole were down over the previous year, mainly because of lower duty free sales in the UK following the downturn in world travel as a result of the recession, coupled with a change in agency representation. Glenmorangie sales increased in the US and Japan, although performance in Europe was affected by the recession. Bulk blend shipments, mainly to Australia and the US, fell by 33 per cent in volume terms to 137,000 cases and by 48 per cent in terms of value. The average price per litre dropped by 19 per cent as the company was forced to cut its own prices in response to price reductions in the market. After allowing for stocking problems, Mr McKerrow said Glenmorangie's performance in the UK, where sales increased by 9 per cent in value terms despite a 2 per cent downturn in volume, was in line with the market. During the year the company also suffered from the downturn in intra-company trading contracts because of trading conditions in the industry and a number of contracts did not materialise. On the outlook Mr McKerrow said it looked like 'another tough year for the industry and ourselves.' He said production of Glenmorangie was running at a third of capacity and Glen Moray at 60 per cent, compared with an average of about 40 per cent for the industry. He warned that first half results were likely to be below those last year, but that the second half should show an improvement. For the full year he expected improved trading profits, offset by the need to write off excess capacity.</p>

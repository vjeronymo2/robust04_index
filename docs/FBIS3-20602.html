			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial:"Encouraging Signs"] </F>   [Text] It may be too early, but so far the signs are  encouraging. Incredible as it might seem, if the past few days  are any indication, Beijing looks like it has drawn a line under  political reform and decided to allow cooperation to continue in  other areas.    Although the most hardline of mainland officials continue to  utter dire threats that the gazettal of the electoral bill will  harm Sino-British relations on all fronts, this has so far not  proved to be the case. Instead there was the incredible sight  of Chinese negotiators giving ground over the size of their  future naval base on Stonecutters Island, during last week's  defence lands talks, even as Governor Chris Patten was  announcing his decision to go it alone on political reform.  Then there was the heartening declaration from Guangdong Public  Security Bureau Chief Chen Shaoji that cross-border co-operation  would not be affected by the row. Yesterday, Chief Secretary  Anson Chan Fang On-sang even predicted that a date for further  airport talks may be agreed this week.    That will be the acid test of Beijing's intentions. The wind  can change very fast in Zhongnanhai, and Chinese leaders may yet  decide they need to use all the weapons at their disposal to try  and drive down public support for Mr Patten to encourage  legislators to vote down his proposals. But, for the moment at  least, China seems to have recognised the harm that could result  to its and the territory's interests, in following a strategy of  severing co- operation on all fronts. That means there can be  some hope that the years ahead may not be as rough as might  otherwise have been expected.</p>

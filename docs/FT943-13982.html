			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: Why the City is off its food - The Bottom Line Most quoted company chief executives believe their share prices are too low. But when Greg Hutchings bemoans Tomkins' modest rating he has a point. The acquisitive conglomerate's record over the past ten years has been exceptional, outperforming the pack in both good times and bad. Since 1984 Tomkins has produced average annual growth in earnings per share of 36 per cent, compared with the UK average of just 6 per cent. Dividends have grown three times as fast. Yet its share rating is well below the market average. In part Tomkins is a victim of changing investor fashions. In the buccaneering 1980s the dealmakers were king and investors were unconcerned if all the acquisitions resulted in groups with widely disparate interests. But these days investors are keener on companies with a clear business focus and many conglomerates have been slimming to appeal to the new taste. Tomkins is more focused than some of its peers - concentrating largely on low technology manufacturing - and has a better recent record than the likes of Hanson, BTR and Williams. Yet its shares trade at a discount even to them. The problem is simply that the City has gone off its food. Britain's supermarkets are waging a bitter price war and sharing the pain with their suppliers. Food manufacturers have seen their margins squeezed and watched their share prices sag as a result. Tomkins walked straight into the war zone 18 months ago when it paid Pounds 990m for Ranks Hovis McDougall. Suddenly, half Tomkins' sales were in food and it was right in the middle of the bloodiest battlefield of all - bread. The City took fright. RHM, which had been a poor performer for years, was seen as a handful for anyone at the best of times. But for a company with no experience of the food industry in the middle of a price war the deal was regarded as extremely risky. Even more alarming, Tomkins was paying a price that Hanson, Hutchings' former employer, considered over the top. Mr Hutchings argued that Tomkins' expertise was in managing industrial businesses not in making particular products. After all, it had known nothing about handguns when it bought Smith &amp; Wesson or lawnmowers when it acquired Murray Ohio but had made a success of both. But the City was not convinced and since the RHM deal was first announced Tomkins' shares have lagged the market by over a quarter. Yet Tomkins has so far delivered everything it promised. In spite of the bread price war and a disappointing performance from the Mr Kipling and Cadburys cake operation, the RHM businesses contributed profits of Pounds 102.5m in the year to April. Of the healthy 14 per cent increase in group earnings per share more than 4 points were thanks to the RHM acquisition. And with the rationalisation programme only half completed there should be more to come. Tomkins' existing businesses also performed well helped by the buoyant US economy, which provides half group profits, and tentative recovery in the UK, which accounts for most of the rest. With last week's figures Tomkins provided reassurance on another of the City's worries - the impact of the fall in the dollar. The company revealed that it has hedged this year's dollar profits at a rate of Dollars 1.48, almost 7 per cent better than last year. It also displayed a healthy balance sheet with net cash of Pounds 156m and total shareholders' funds of almost Pounds 900m. While its poor share rating precludes further acquisitions financed by share issues that balance sheet could support a large deal funded by debt, though not on the scale of RHM. Meanwhile analysts believe profits could rise from Pounds 257m to Pounds 300m this year putting the shares at 224p on only 12 1/2 times earnings. Tomkins argues that the pricing pressure in food is no worse than it has faced for many years in its other businesses. But it now looks unlikely that the shares will be re-rated in the short-term until conditions start to improve. When that happens the shares will have a lot of ground to make up.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;For emergency renovations (as defined in &sect;61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety or public health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the notification must be postmarked or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, but no later than the following work day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> III. Emission Control Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> A. Requirements to Adequately Wet and Discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No Visible Emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal operations include requirements that the affected material be adequately wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of properly. The requirements for disposal of waste materials are discussed separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section I above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation (&sect;&sect;61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires that RACM be adequately wet (as defined in &sect;61.141) during the operation that damages or disturbs the asbestos material until collected for disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to remove Category I asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements of &sect;61.145(c) apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the ``adequately wet'' and ``discharge no visible emission'' requirements of the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated with the following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface; and (2) a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in operation during the cutting of the roof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may not be required during the cutting of Category I asbestos roofing material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with &sect;61.145(c)(3)(i), that wetting will unavoidably damage the building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, the roof removal operation will be exempted from the requirement to wet during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to base such a decision. Before proceeding with a dry removal, the contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions will be made on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the wetting requirements are not necessary. Where EPA grants an exemption from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage to equipment within the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP specifies alternative control methods (&sect;61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)). Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do not produce visible emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of &sect;61.152, or (c) other methods that have received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has received written approval from EPA and the method is being implemented consistent with the approved procedures (&sect;61.145(c)(3)(ii) or &sect;61.152(b)(3)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is below freezing, as specified in &sect;61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated as the reason for not wetting, records must be kept of the temperature at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not performed and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 years. 42 CFR &sect;61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation that in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the Administrator is needed for using emission control methods listed in &sect;61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that have been previously approved by the Administrator. However, such written application or approval is required for alternative emission control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and debris collected from cutting must still be kept wet and placed in containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste disposal would continue to apply as described elsewhere in this notice and the Asbestos NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> C. Waste Collection and Handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand or abrade Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the NESHAP and can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material (such as A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from the removal is not subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets the NESHAP to be inapplicable to waste resulting from roof removal operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described in section I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal regulations may apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

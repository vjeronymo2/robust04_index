			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major outlines agenda of change to the benefit system, education, housing, transport, crime policy and to the honours system - was set out last night by Mr John Major, combining economic liberalism with a reinforcing of 'the social cement that binds us together'. The prime minister said his beliefs would have been familiar to Burke, Disraeli and Salisbury. He wanted to foster 'a national life in which merit is rewarded, achievement respected, opportunity opened up and the individual given power and choice. That is what I mean by a 'classless society'.' His speech at the Carlton Club, London, stressed the importance of change because, 'if we cling to outdated habits, rules and restrictions, we risk the collapse of our economy and society'. But he also wanted Britain to keep its links with the past: 'Some say that the glories of British history, the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare, the works of Dickens and Trollope - even poor old Winnie the Pooh - are irrelevant to the modern child . . . The destruction they have wrought has been physical as well as emotional.' In an apparent reference to the royal family, he said: 'Recently, the institutions that embodied our nationhood have come under attack: institutions in whose name our countrymen and women have been ready to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. I sense a growing fear that we may lose so much that is precious to this country.' He added later that, as the year 2000 approaches, 'we need more than ever that anchor of past experience and those institutions which give continuity and a framework to our national life - the monarchy, Parliament, our churches and voluntary organisations.' Mr Major welcomed the fact that 'the days when people could be considered somehow superior because of who they were, and not what they were, are finally fading into history.' He wanted to end barriers between blue collar and white collar and to raise the esteem of vocational qualifications. The honours system would be developed, 'to get rid of old, class-based distinctions' and reward volunteers. Conservatives were wary of over-government and unlike socialists did not see the free market as a threat, he said. 'It is not where the free market pervades that ties of community are under threat, but where the state owns and controls to the greatest extent. Look at our suburbs and small towns and villages - where people, by and large, own their own homes. . . The big problem lies elsewhere. It is from the inner cities, where the state is dominant, that businesses have fled.' He said rising crime had to be tackled. Change was needed in the police force: 'The crucial test of our police forces is their ability to deliver what the citizen wants: safety on our streets and security in their homes.' New powers to take persistent young offenders off the streets and into secure accommodation would be announced. On the economy, Mr Major said: 'If we are to sustain sound public finance and make progress towards our goals of lower personal taxation we must keep firm control of inflation and take a rigorous approach to public spending. It is always dangerously easy for the state to settle into habits of spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets.' In housing, good private landlords had to be encouraged: 'But most young people still want to own their own home, and Conservatives believe strongly in helping them fulfil that ambition. I want more of them to have that choice.' The government had already opened the way to privately financed infrastructure projects. He wanted to 'investigate still more radical ways of financing a better road network between our cities.' Mr Major added: 'I increasingly wonder whether paying unemployment benefit, without offering or requiring any activity in return, serves unemployed people or society well. 'Of course, we have to make sure that any conditions imposed improve the job prospects of unemployed people and give good value to the country. But we have already introduced this principle, for example through Restart, in a limited sense for the long-term unemployed. I believe we should explore ways of extending it further.' He did not under-estimate the difficulties of change - 'giving people more freedom means giving people the opportunity to make mistakes,' he said. But it had been 'the genius of our party that we fashion change in the image of our long traditions.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Firms Put More Faith in Arbiters"] </F>   [Text] Officials expect China to remain the world's largest  commercial arbitration centre, indicating that foreign firms  have a growing reliance on Chinese mediators.    More than 250 cases flooded the China International Economic  and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac) by the end of May.  Cietac predicts it will handle nearly 600 cases before the year  is out.    Cietac handled 486 cases last year more than any other  international centre.    "More and more Chinese and foreign companies are willing to  resort to Cietac for settling their business disputes," said Zhu  Jianlin, deputy secretary general of Cietac, at a briefing for  the upcoming International Commercial Arbitration Legislation  Conference.    The conference, to be held in Beijing on June 22 and 23,  should further link China's business arbitration with  international standards.    Decisions made in China are now honoured and enforced in  more  than 90 countries and regions.    In the past, many foreigners fled to other international  arbitrators whenever disputes arose about things like wording in  joint-venture contracts or poor shipments of materials.    Now the world is focusing on particular Chinese mediation  practices because of its increasing importance in international  commercial arbitration.    China has successfully combined arbitration with its  traditional thinking of mediation.    Chinese arbitrators help the disputing parties come to  mutual  agreement and reconciliation, easing tensions rather than  furthering the anger.    But in many nations, arbitrators must decide who wins and  who  loses, no matter how furious a party might be.    The international conference will provide the foreign  experts  with a perfect perch for examining the Chinese experience.    More than 300 Chinese and foreign arbitration and trade  experts will attend the conference, the first of its kind in  China and the entire Asia-Pacific region.    China hopes the event will help its re-entry into the  General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt); other parts of the world  will see at first hand the progress China has made toward  meeting international norms in economic activities.    The conference is being organized by Cietac and the  International Council of Commercial Arbitration.</p>

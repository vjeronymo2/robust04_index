			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NUHOMS&hyph;52B has not been used yet. Pre-operational testing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first cask system put in place under the general license is to be performed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with Certificate of Compliance, Attachment A, ``Conditions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systems Use.'' Monitoring and surveillance of the system will be performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the conditions of the Certificate of Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first use of the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B will not place plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers, the public, or the environment at risk. Conditions of use for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B ensure adequate safety of the workers, the public, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment. The Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B has been designed and will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabricated to well established criteria of the ASME B&amp;PV and ACI codes. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses construction materials that have well known and documented properties to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the necessary structural strength and radiation shielding to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirements. While the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B is not identical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the NUHOMS&hyph;24P, many parallels in design and function can be drawn to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B will perform as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that even though dry cask storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passes all NRC rules and is one of the least expensive methods, it would seem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a different location or more expensive storage method is worth lives,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources, and property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on numerous NRC reviews and growing experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with dry cask storage technologies, the NRC has concluded that spent fuel can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be safely stored in dry casks without significant risk to the public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety. More expensive storage techniques or alternative storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations would not provide any significant additional public protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the storage location is a matter of Congressional policy as reflected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall establish a demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear power reactor sites, with the objective of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section III(a) also finds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generators of the spent fuel have the primary responsibility to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interim storage of the spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The type of spent fuel stored in the dry cask storage systems is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor that allows the cost of the systems to be lower. Because the fuel has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooled a number of years, passive cooling can be used rather than active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling as is required for fuel just removed from the reactor. Passive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling reduces the cost by not having active components such as pumps, heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchanger, water filters, and the maintenance required for these components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter opposed licensing any dry cask storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system other than the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC) because it minimizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling individual fuel assemblies, standardizes compatibility between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage sites and DOE, and reduces cost. Multiple cask designs lead to less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise in production, operation, and accident management. Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations need to be amended to mandate only the use of the MPC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DOE MPC system will not be available for general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use until well after 1997. In the meantime, additional storage capacity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed now at several reactor sites. Once the MPC is available for general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, most utilities might use it. However, given the demonstrated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate need of some reactors for an additional storage capacity, and given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC's responsibility to implement dry cask storage under a general license  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to NWPA of 1982, it would not be prudent for NRC now to require use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of MPC designs that not even DOE has yet approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC does not agree that the number of cask designs has a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on the level of expertise available because standard engineering and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific skills such as mechanical and civil engineers and health safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialists can be hired as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K. Several commenters had concerns about decommissioning issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, citing the draft SER, stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decommissioning and decontamination of reactors and reactor sites remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertain at best. ``At this time, it is not known whether demolition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of the HSM can be performed by conventional methods *&blank;*&blank;*. The reinforced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure of the HSM, for example, will require considerable effort to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demolish.'' The commenter continues by indicating that in its typical fashion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of putting off until tomorrow what it cannot deal with today, the NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers ``ease of decommissioning (a) secondary consideration.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The demolition of the HSM will be more difficult than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical building because of the large amount of reinforced steel it contains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it is technically feasible and represents a likely level of effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to that required to demolish a bank vault. Bank vaults are routinely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demolished without extraordinary effort. The HSM may become slightly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactive from being exposed to a neutron radiation field during the spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel storage period, which would require some containment during demolition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the spread of contamination. Recognizing this, the NRC considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decommissioning a secondary consideration compared to the safety afforded by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage of spent fuel in dry casks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

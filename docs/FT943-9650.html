			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Wilson's nemesis haunts trade gap The increase in the trade deficit in May was largely due to erratic items, the ragbag of goods which the Central Statistical Office separates from the main trade account. It is easy for such items to distort one month's trade figures. Lord Wilson  -then prime minister Mr Harold Wilson - blamed his 1970 general election defeat on bad trade figures, published just before the polls and distorted by the import of two Boeing 747s. There are five categories of trade which come under the heading of erratic items: ships, North Sea installations, aircraft, precious stones and silver. In May, dealings in precious stones were largely responsible for the blip. From a surplus of Pounds 101m in April, trade in precious stones slumped to a Pounds 17m deficit in May. Overall the 'erratic' surplus declined from Pounds 258m in April to Pounds 67m in May. That Pounds 191m swing made up the bulk of the Pounds 262m increase in the overall monthly deficit. Of the five erratic categories, two - precious stones and aircraft - are by far the most important. Last year the UK imported an average of Pounds 212.4m worth of precious stones a month and exported an average of Pounds 231.5m. Mr Roger van Eeghem of CSO Valuations, the leading diamond clearing house, said: 'The main thing to remember is all that is imported is re-exported'. The CSO has 10 'sights' a year at which dealers can bid for stones. That leaves two months a year without a 'sight', a fact which contributes to the erratic nature of the figures. According to Mr van Eeghem, the same two months are not missed out each time, and sometimes the 'sights' straddle the end of one month and the start of another. Diamond rings would not affect the statistics; as finished jewellery, they would be classed as manufactured items. Trade in silver can also be volatile. Mr John Fairlie of Johnson Matthey, the precious-metals group, said: 'Sometimes the flow of silver exports has been very high to the Middle East and Singapore in the form of metal bars. At other times, but not for some years, a great amount of metal comes out of the Middle East and Singapore as imports to be refined.' Silver is counted as an erratic item but not gold, since most trade in gold is a financial transaction and is dealt with under the financial rather than the current account. Commodity trade in gold is in the current account, but trade is not erratics. Aircraft - Lord Wilson's nemesis - are potentially even more erratic items than precious stones. British Airways, for example, bought 12 aircraft in its last financial year. Given that the market rate for a Boeing 747 is Dollars 125m (Pounds 80.6m), a cluster of aeroplane deliveries can make a big difference to monthly trade patterns.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TRADE WITH COUNTRIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EU  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance of payments basis (Poundsm seasonally adjusted)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Exports                         Imports          ----------------------------      ---------------------------                    Countries                        Countries            European  outside    Whole      European   outside    Whole               Union   the EU    world         Union    the EU    world  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992         60,569   46,774  107,343        64,017    56,430  120,447 1993         63,945   57,469  121,414        67,899    66,724  134,623 1993 Q2      15,560   14,128   29,688        16,731    16,306   33,037 Q3           16,129   14,468   30,597        16,883    16,864   33,747 Q4           15,747   15,218   30,965        17,474    16,856   34,330 1994 Q1      16,649   15,386   32,035        17,540    17,426   34,966 Jan           5,606    5,097   10,703         5,785     5,848   11,633 Feb           5,425    5,202   10,627         5,672     5,827   11,499 Mar           5,618    5,087   10,705         6,083     5,751   11,834 Apr           5,760    5,241   11,001         6,064     5,707   11,771 May           5,762    5,125   10,887         6,139     5,780   11,919 Jun             n/a    5,281      n/a           n/a     5,683      n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Visible balance                   ----------------------------                            Countries                    European  outside    Whole   Invisibles    Current                       Union   the EU    world      balance    balance  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992                 -3,448   -9,656 -13,104         2,867    -10,237 1993                 -3,954   -9,255 -13,209         2,799    -10,410 1993 Q2              -1,171   -2,178  -3,349          -126     -3,475 Q3                     -754   -2,396  -3,150         1,191     -1,959 Q4                   -1,727   -1,638  -3,365         1,525     -1,840 1994 Q1                -891   -2,040  -2,931         2,402       -529 Jan                    -179     -751    -930 Feb                    -247     -625    -827 Mar                    -465     -664  -1,129 Apr                    -304     -466    -770 May                    -377     -655  -1,032 Jun                     n/a     -402     n/a  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             Source CSO  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

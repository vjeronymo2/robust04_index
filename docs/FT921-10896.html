			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bond scheme suggested to break CAP reform deadlock THE DEADLOCK over reform of Europe's crippling farm subsidy policies could be broken by offering farmers one-time payments in the form of marketable bonds, one of Europe's leading farm economists argues in a report to be published this week. In a stinging assault on the present common agriculture policy, Mr Stefan Tangermann, at the Institute of Agricultural Economics in Germany's Gottingen university, praises the MacSharry plan for CAP reform, which aims to decouple income support for farmers from price support for farm output. But he complains: 'It is a pity it stops a couple of steps short of reaching its own targets'. Mr Tangermann says the present CAP has failed 'in nearly all respects': in its primary aim of raising farmers' incomes; by plunging governments around the world into a 'nonsensical' spiral of agricultural protectionism; and by aggravating environmental problems by encouraging excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. 'The aim of CAP reform should not so much be to reduce surplus production and public spending in EC agriculture, but to make Europe's farming industry more economically efficient and internationally competitive.' The critical flaw in the MacSharry plan is its proposal for compensation payments, Mr Tangermann argues. By basing compensation on each year's farm output, the plan both locks the EC into constant monitoring of production, and forces farmers to keep output up to qualify for compensation. It is also in direct conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round trade reform plans, in which negotiators insist that such an arrangement would distort trade. Instead, Mr Tangermann argues that compensation should be based on historical rather than current production; a limit should be set on the duration of payments - he suggests 15 years; and the volume of payments should be predetermined over the whole payment period. 'Improvements of this type would eliminate production incentives, allow the avoidance of set-aside, make it possible to turn payments into bonds which can be sold on the capital market, improve chances for structural adjustment in EC agriculture, enhance farmers' confidence in compensation, greatly reduce administrative costs, and make CAP reform more consistent with international efforts to achieve a multilateral liberalisation of agriculture trade,' he says. He is also emphatic that policymakers should be clear that they are compensating farmers rather than farms, and need to resist the politically expedient temptation to use environmental funds as 'sweeteners' to farmers: 'Such payments are likely to miss both their economic and their ecological target,' he says. Reforming the CAP, by Mr Stefan Tangermann, is published on Thursday by the Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London SW1P 3LA.</p>

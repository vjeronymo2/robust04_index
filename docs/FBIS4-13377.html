			<p>BFN     [Text] Developing countries have decided to resist unitedly  against any attempt by some countries to link social issues with  the trade policy. Making a suo moto statement in the Rajya  Sabha today, the commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, said  that some European countries and the United States tried to link  the extraneous issues with the accord. India, along with some  other countries, attached greater importance to the matter, like  restrictive business practices and immigration policies. He  said none of these issues became the subject of a multilateral  decision or declaration. The preparatory committee of the WTO  [World Trade Organization] will discuss whether to include these  issues in the future agenda of the WTO. Mr. Mukherjee asserted  any decision on these issues can only be taken by consensus.</p>

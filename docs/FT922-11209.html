			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Call to keep tax help for home sales: Pressure to extend 'holiday' for stamp duty on housing THE GOVERNMENT is coming under pressure to extend the 'holiday' from stamp duty for most house purchases unless there is a clear and sustained revival in the housing market. Some Tory backbenchers have already said privately that they believe the government would have great difficulty in re-imposing the previous stamp duty arrangements, and there have also been representations from the construction and housing industry. The decision to lift the point at which the 1 per cent levy becomes payable, from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 250,000, was announced in December as part of the government's measures to help home owners. It is due to run out in mid August. Ministers will be determined to reserve their position until it becomes clear whether or not the housing market has recovered on the back of the measures already taken and on the renewed confidence in the wake of the election. The government does not intend to abolish stamp duty on house purchases and puts some faith in the idea that the impact of the change will have most effect only as the August 19 deadline approaches. Ministers will also argue that further cuts in interest rates, when they can prudently be made, will have more impact on the market than the future of stamp duty. The continuing political sensitivity of housing was demonstrated by the fact that representatives of the construction industry have already had an introductory meeting with Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary. Since the election, some estate agents have expressed confidence in a rise in house purchases, but there has been more caution about predicting a sustained recovery. Instead, they have drawn attention to the position last year, when there was an improvement immediately after the Gulf war but sales fell sharply as summer approached.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 19 April commentary: "A Warmonger's Visit </F> for War"]    [Text] It has been reported that U.S. Secretary of Defense  Perry will visit South Korea. A spokesman for the Department of  Defense said that the main purpose of his visit to South Korea  is to hold meetings with military leaders, to receive briefings  from commanders in South Korea on situations, and to take  necessary military steps, while talking about the North's  military moves.    This shows that Perry's visit to South Korea is a dangerous  visit for war [wihomhan chonjaeng haenggak] to further  strengthen military pressure against us, to extremely aggravate  tensions on the Korean peninsula, and to embark upon the road of  war under the pretext of the nuclear issue.    As disclosed recently, last year, the U.S. imperialists  formulated a plan for a war of northward invasion, the so-called  New Operational Plan No. 5027, along with the South Korean  puppets. Based on this, they have concentrated their massive  arms of aggression on the Korean peninsula, as well as the areas  surrounding it.    According to the report issued by the U.S. Department of  Defense in mid-February this year, the U.S. imperialists have  maintained approximately 100,000 aggressive troops in the Far  East in preparation for the emergency situation on the Korean  peninsula. Also they have reinforced the military equipment for  U.S. Forces occupying South Korea, including the deployment of  Patriot missiles to South Korea, and accelerated military  preparedness for the wartime situation [chonsi cheje].    After occupying the post of secretary of defense, Perry has  made many remarks that reek of gunpowder [hwayangnae pungginun],  while taking the lead in talking about the nuclear development  by the North. He has babbled loudly that he will make the North  stop developing nuclear weapons at the price of another war on  the Korean peninsula, and instead of discussing mere plans for  military steps during this visit to South Korea, that he will  concretely discuss how, when, and why military steps should be  taken.    This shows that the U.S. secretary of defense's visit to  South Korea is a visit for his front-line command [ilson  chihwihaenggak] aimed at reorganizing their wartime system in  order to put their already established plan for a Northward  invasion war into practice, as well as a visit to plot their  operation to organize a combined armed forces [yonhap muryok]  against us.    Perry, the boss of a war plot, will visit South Korea at a  time when the U.S. imperialists are concentrating their massive  arms of aggression on South Korea and the areas surrounding it  in order to bring the disaster of nuclear war to our nation.  Therefore, this is not a thing that can be overlooked.    Also, his visit to South Korea is a visit to plunder and  exploit the South Korean people by heightening tensions on the  Korean peninsula, by subjugating South Korea even more  militarily, and by sending stocked military supplies to South  Korea. It is well known that the U.S. leaders [udumoridul] are  aggravating tensions and stirring up disputes in every place to  find an outlet for the munitions industrial complexes which have  faced difficulties finding markets since the Cold War ended. As  a person formerly in charge of military equipment affairs from  the mid-sixties until recently, U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry  has had close relations with large munitions businesses. He was  also in charge of military equipment for coping with South Korea  [taenamjoson kunsa changbi] in the past. It is clear that Perry  will visit South Korea to generate profits for munitions  businesses, to militarize the South Korean economy, and to force  the puppets to increase their proportion in the fund for  maintaining the U.S. Forces in South Korea by deliberately  aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and by turning  South Korea into a U.S. arms exhibition center.    Perry's visit to South Korea will accelerate the driving of  the Korean peninsula's situation to the dangerous brink of war  and will infringe upon the South Korean people's interests. In  view of this grave consequence, his visit to South Korea is  totally regarded as a trip for aggression and war [cholchohi  chimnyakkwa chonjaeng haenggak], and inevitably faces our  people's opposition and rejection [pandae paegyok].    What matters is that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, as a  U.S. war servant [migugui chonjaeng mosumggun], is welcoming the  U.S. military head's visit to South Korea and is running  indiscreetly to set a fire of war against fellow countrymen with  the United States.    After rupturing working-level contacts for the exchange of  top-level special envoys of the North and the South, the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique put the entire puppet Army on alert and  is accelerating preparations for a northward invasion while  talking about strong countermeasures, punishing retaliation, and  the like.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has recently dispatched a  special inspection team to the military and even made a stir of  reconfirming the state of ammunition held in reserve for combat  and of inspecting the management of ammunition in store. It is  needless to say again that this was conducted according to the  U.S. imperialists' adventurous, new war maneuver.    When the U.S. bellicose military head and South Korea's  civilian warmongers sit face to face, they have nothing to do  but scheme up a war, and it leaves no room for doubt that this  will threaten peace and reunification of Korea more gravely.    We will attentively watch the warmonger's ominous  [simsangchi  anun] visit to South Korea. If the aggressors and  nation-sellers set fire first [sonbulchirul handamyon], they  will be made to pay dearly for their behavior.</p>

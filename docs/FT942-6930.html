			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Atkins falls Pounds 252,000 into the red Atkins Group, the Leicestershire-based hosiery manufacturer, swung from profits of Pounds 448,000 to losses of Pounds 252,000 pre-tax for the 12 months to April 2. The directors warned in February that the year-end results would be substantially lower because of a sharp slowdown in trading during the final quarter. They said yesterday that the net costs of terminating the fabric operations, amounting to Pounds 298,000, were an important factor. Turnover improved from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 19.1m, with the final three months generating only 1.5 per cent of growth. Losses per share emerged at 6.6p (earnings 9.81p). However, the final dividend is maintained at 4.25p, making an 8.1p (7.85p) total. Capital expenditure of Pounds 1.16m pushed year-end gearing up from 15 per cent to 38 per cent.</p>

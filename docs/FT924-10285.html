			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Statistics unsettle Wall Street WALL STREET was unsettled yesterday by an unexpected fall in new home sales and a plunge in the Chicago purchasing managers' index of industrial activity for October. New home sales fell 1 per cent in September, to register their first drop in five months despite lower mortgage rates. The Chicago index fell 10 points to 49.7 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.99 at 3,226.28. However, the Chicago purchasing managers' index has been running substantially higher than the national index, to be released on Monday. The new home sales figures were also better than they looked because data for August were revised up sharply. Sales were running at annual rate of 617,000 in September; the new figure for August was 623,000, up 1.6 per cent from July. Previous estimates had shown August sales running at only 570,000, down 6.1 per cent from July.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter: Economic options not so dismal Sir, Your 'Unhappily, all options are dismal' advice to economic policymakers ('A beleaguered government', July 7) itself erred, it seemed to me, on the dismal side. First, rather than 'push for the earliest possible move to (European) economic and monetary union with a (European) central bank that would look at the European economy as a whole, and not just one region of it', the government should immediately institute an independent Bank of England to manage the nation's money in place of, and more prudently than, vote-seeking politicians (ie itself). This is on the principle that sound monetary (and economic) management, like charity, begins at home. And it would pay the government, and the rest of us, hands down. If nothing else, it would bring interest rates down sooner and faster than otherwise. Of course, the government should also drop its Emu opt-out clause, if only to retrieve London's (or other British contenders') otherwise lost chance of landing the valuable (not to say invaluable) price of providing that European central bank's home. In addition, besides continuing to resist any idea of a sterling devaluation, within or outside the EC, with might and main, the government should take advantage of its current EC presidency to press for a general realignment centred, as in present circumstances it clearly must be, on a revaluation of the D-Mark (and so only indirectly constituting a devaluation of other ERM currencies, sterling included). Such a move would not only help Germany's own post-unification struggle against inflation, which is holding the ERM in its thrall, but also relieve some of the pressure on (and allow more room for manoeuvre to) Germany's ERM partners and others. Both options are opportunities too good to be missed at this critical juncture. Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley, London N3 3AN</p>

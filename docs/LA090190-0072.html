			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROGRAM FOLLOWS YOUNG PROSTITUTES TO THE SUBURBS;  </P> <P> VICE: CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT IS MOVING ITS CENTER TO THE VALLEY AS STREETWALKERS  AND RUNAWAYS LEAVE HOLLYWOOD.  </P> <P> Children of the Night, known nationally for helping youthful runaways and  streetwalkers escape Hollywood's seedy boulevards, is closing its Hollywood  office and moving to the suburbs, a move that reflects the district's decline  as a center of prostitution.  </P> <P> The organization's move to Van Nuys in a week follows the migration of  prostitution to the suburbs as well as the institutionalization of Children of  the Night, started by chance in 1979 by Lois Lee. Then a graduate student in  sociology, Lee is now a favorite of talk show hosts plumbing the sensational  stories of teen-age prostitution.  </P> <P> Lee began her effort to help wayward youths in Hollywood by giving brief refuge  in her apartment to some of the teen-age prostitutes she met while conducting  her research. By the start of next year, she will preside over an organization  that will have grown to include a 24-bed shelter in a refurbished Van Nuys post  office, a $1-million annual budget and a full-time staff of 22 devoted to the  shelter, street counseling, administrative duties and a 24-hour telephone hot  line.  </P> <P> Since Lee began documenting prostitution for her dissertation more than a  decade ago, police and community crackdowns have forced many pimps and  prostitutes to move on -- to escort services, massage services and to other  arenas, including suburban communities in Orange County and the San Fernando  Valley.  </P> <P> "I've seen the Sunset Boulevard of 400 to 500 prostitutes (a decade ago)," said  Los Angeles Police Lt. Pete Durham of the Hollywood Division's vice squad. "Now  I'll buy you a steak dinner if I can find 20 prostitutes on the boulevard."  </P> <P> With the opportunity in Van Nuys to set up its first shelter, and fewer youths  in need of counseling services in Hollywood, "it makes so little sense to stay  here," Lee said. "In the last two years we haven't pulled a lot of kids out of  Hollywood."  </P> <P> In 1982, when Children of the Night started leasing space in an office  high-rise at Highland and Franklin avenues, it helped 500 youths. Last year,  143 new youngsters went to the Hollywood center, out of the 801 children the  program dealt with altogether. The rest were either callers to the hot line or  youngsters associated with the program from previous years.  </P> <P> "The pimps are skipping Hollywood altogether," said Lee, a fast-talking,  media-wise 39-year-old whose experiences with Children of the Night were turned  into a TV movie five years ago. "They're going to Orange County, San Diego,  Hawaii, Alaska." And, no, Lee laughs, her staff counselors are not going to  Hawaii, but they do hit streets in Orange and San Diego counties and next year  plan to branch out to the Bay Area and Washington and Oregon.  </P> <P> Children of the Night will also continue to send counselors to Hollywood, which  for all its tawdriness remains something of a magnet for young runaways with  stars in their eyes. This week Lee's staff put a 13-year-old girl on a flight  home to Spokane, Wash., from which she had run away last year with friends,  escaping, she said, a sexually abusive stepfather.  </P> <P> The girl had arrived in Hollywood at the age of 12 "because she wanted to be a  star," as another youngster in Lee's office explained, and wound up living with  a man in exchange for sex. Apparently tired of her, the man called Children of  the Night.  </P> <P> Police statistics trace a dramatic drop in prostitution during the 1980s as  officers, responding to community complaints, stepped up patrols and arrests in  Hollywood. In the first seven months of this year, Los Angeles police say the  Hollywood Division made 1,033 prostitution arrests of both males and females,  compared to slightly more than double that during the same period in 1983.  </P> <P> In the meantime, some of the offenders have turned up in suburban areas where  they had been rarely seen before. "We had a big prostitution problem last  summer for the first time ever in this city," said Sgt. Tom Boylan of the Costa  Mesa Police Department. "One reason is there's a lot of money to be made out  here and police in Hollywood are cracking down, so girls found it easier to  come out here for a while. They move around a lot."  </P> <P> In Orange County, police say prostitutes started showing up in strength on  Harbor Boulevard, a commercial strip that runs from Costa Mesa to La Habra,  after the push to clean up Los Angeles for the 1984 Olympics. A few years  later, the problem had become so pronounced that the FBI was investigating it,  and today police say the stepped-up enforcement has driven streetwalkers from  many Orange County communities.  </P> <P> Also contributing to a suburban migration of prostitution, Lee suggested, is  urban violence. "With the gangs moving into Hollywood, it makes it very  difficult. You don't want to put girls on the street where they're going to be  beaten up and raped and robbed."  </P> <P> Children of the Night's Van Nuys shelter, scheduled to open around Christmas in  a renovated post office purchased for $899,000 in cash, realizes Lee's  long-held dream that the program have a shelter of its own. Finding bed space  is not easy, especially for young hustlers.  </P> <P> Indeed, when Lee called around looking for a place to send the 13-year-old for  the night, she found no takers.  </P> <P> Lee insists the move to Van Nuys is not an abandonment of Hollywood but an  expansion to a building where 11- to 17-year-old boys and girls who are  sexually abused, in prostitution or pornography can return to normal lives in a  quieter, less tempting setting.  </P> <P> Van Nuys, a community with its own prostitution problem, seems to have no  qualms about the arrival of Children of the Night, which is renting a house  there for its operation until the shelter is ready. "People have really  welcomed us in the area. I've been invited to join the Chamber of Commerce,"  Lee said.  </P> <P> In the new facility, the staff will not only house and feed up to 24  youngsters, it will also provide counseling and a classroom, where high school  equivalency instruction will be offered, and the staff will man its 24-hour hot  line and do administrative work.  </P> <P> What's more, the organization in October will operate a new toll-free number in  California and is expanding its emergency transportation program for youngsters  in need of immediate help.  </P> <P> "We were poor for so long," says Lee. She eschews government funding -- "I want  flexibility" -- and instead operates on private donations from sources ranging  from heavy metal groups to the Lawrence Welk Foundation.  </P></p>

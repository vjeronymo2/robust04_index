			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Scores of warplanes of  the U.S. Seventh Airforce and Marines staged a joint air war  exercise against the DPRK in the skies above Taejon, Chonju and  Kunsan, South Korea, on June 22, military sources said.    An overseas-based E-3 was involved in the exercise.    In the June 21-23 period scores of large transport planes  airlifted large quantities of uptodate lethal weapons and  military equipment to U.S. Airforce bases in South Korea from  the U.S. mainland and Pacific bases.    This fully shows that although the U.S. imperialists pay lip  service to peace and detente on the Korean peninsula, they have  not given up the ambition for invading the DPRK.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Halifax's direct hit The cracks in the masonry of the personal insurance market are widening. First came the successful assault by the direct telephone-based insurers on motor business. Now, Halifax building society has launched what looks like a pre-emptive strike to stop the direct insurers from making significant inroads into the lucrative buildings insurance market. The society's 20 per cent across the board cut in premiums in this sector is set to trigger a new price war. The main sufferers of intensified price competition will not be the building societies or others which merely distribute policies but the composite insurers which earn a fat proportion of profits from underwriting personal insurance business. Sun Alliance has the most to lose, as it provides the bulk of Halifax's buildings policies. Its shares fell more sharply than those of other composites yesterday, but all will suffer. Buildings insurance is currently luxuriantly profitable - a 25 per cent pre-tax return on premium income is not unusual. Add in investment income and the return on capital can be more than 50 per cent. The insurance industry's long lead times mean it will take several years for lower premiums to feed through to reduced profits. But the move confirms investors' scepticism about the quality and sustainability of insurers' underwriting profits. The sharp underperformance of insurance shares in the past year is set to continue.</p>

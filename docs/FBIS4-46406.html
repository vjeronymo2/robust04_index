			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, head of the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, said today that he believes  that the basic goals of the PLO and Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] will not change, although they are undergoing a  pragmatic adaptation to the political reality. Our  correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Gen. Sagi made the remarks  at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that he had obtained  information from the defense establishment according to which  the government intends to free 400 Hamas and Islamic Jihad  activists, and inquired as to the impact this move would have on  the security situation. Gen. Sagi said he cannot deny this  information, adding that it is obvious that if those prisoners  are released, some of them will engage in terror activity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The north and northeast are  under the total control of the Rwandan Armed Forces. The  relevant services of Army headquarters say nothing significant  is happening in the Gisenyi operational sector except cases of  interethnic strife which were also reported in the region last  week.    In the Ruhengeri operational sector, the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] tried to cross the neutral zone in the area of the  Kinigi and Vumba communes, but the Rwandan Armed Forces easily  repulsed the attack. The entire zone is now under the control  of the Rwandan Armed Forces.    In the Rulindo operational sector, the Rwandan Armed Forces  are in control of the Tumba and Kabuye Heights near (Gakenke) in  the Ruhengeri Prefecture. Thus, the Kigali-Ruhengeri route is  entirely open and under control.    In Byumba, RPF combatants tried to penetrate through the  (Kisaro) and Rutare communes, but clashed with the Armed Forces  in the process.    The Rwandan Armed Forces are also fighting with RPF forward  units in the Mukarange Commune in Mutara Region.    In Kigali town, as I have said, everything is peaceful at  this moment, but firing has been heard in the Gikondo sector  below (Rebero). Now we can no longer hear anything. Military  officials point out that the RPF is using guerrilla tactics by  which it is sending small groups of armed men into a sector to  divert and dislocate important units of the Rwandan Armed  Forces, but all that is well known to the Rwandan Armed Forces.    The people should not panic, but tell the security forces  where the enemy is hiding. This happened in the Gikondo sector  yesterday when the attention of a patrol of the national  Gendarmerie was drawn to the presence of seven RPF combatants  hiding in a house. [passage omitted]</p>

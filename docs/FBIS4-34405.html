			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast] </F>   [Text] A total of 13,000 Indians, members of the  Evangelical Indian Association of Chimborazo, an affiliate of  the Ecuadoran Federation of Evangelical Indians, Feine,  peacefully occupied the Cajamarca-Guamote Highway to reject the  religious education and agrarian development bills.    Francisco Waspa, president of the Association, said the  action is intended to express the Indians' rejection of the  aforementioned bills. We want to remind the government that a  peaceful people exists and will continue to exist in Ecuador,  but we are entitled to having our fair aspirations considered.    Francisco Waspa said the association comprises 500  communities. He added that in the framework of respect for  authorities and for public and private property, his associate  will ask the government and the National Congress to comply with  the following points:    1. The National Government must comply with the Commitment  Letter [Carta de Compromiso] signed on 11 October 1992, which  contains a list of 23 demands regarding nutrition, health,  education, and strengthening of popular organizations.    2. We reject the mobilization of the public force as a  measure of avoiding possible bloodshed because the Evangelical  Indian peoples condemn violence and vandalism in principle.    3. The National Congress must suspend the religious  education  bill.    The president of the Association of Evangelical Indians of  Chimborazo says his organization is willing to suspend its  action as soon as the government guarantees that its demands  will be met.</p>

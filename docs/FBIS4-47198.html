			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitold Fokin, president of the International </F> Foundation for Humanitarian and Economic Ties with the Russian  Federation, by Georgiy Dolzhenko, RT correspondent: "The Deed  Must Be Done, Gentlemen"; Kiev, date not given]    [Text] Six months have passed since the International  Foundation for Humanitarian and Economic Ties with the Russian  Federation was set up in Ukraine. This step inspired hopes for  re-establishing collapsed ties and improving cooperation between  our countries. Of what was outlined, what have we succeeded in  doing? What is within the power of the Foundation? Vitold Fokin,  president of the Foundation, answers these and other  questions.    [Dolzhenko] Vitold Pavlovich, first, a little history. How  was the Foundation created, and what was the reason for its  appearance?    [Fokin] That is not a simple question, since it touches on  the period of my work as Ukrainian prime minister. I was always  an adherent of a well-considered economic policy, and definite  calculation in interrelations with the union republics. This  pertained particularly to Russia. We should not have severed the  established economic ties in ill-considered fashion, and  abandoned the ruble zone headlong.    In defending this position, I made quite a few enemies at  that time. Let us remember, what happened after the break-up of  the USSR? Fifteen new states appeared on the political map of  the Eurasian continent, having overnight turned from allies into  competitors. Formally independent of each other, they were  objectively tied by a common economic space.    Except that now the system for coordinating and dividing up  work has changed in principle, and the basic power, transport,  raw materials and export-import flows have been destroyed. Price  and financial relations have been deregulated. Customs barriers  have risen in the path of commodity movement. So far, no system  of legislative administration of the markets of the new states  has been created, and indeed, is not being created.    In struggling for formally recognized sovereignty, the  countries will gradually convert the huge space of the former  USSR into a zone of instability and numerous conflicts.    Ukraine is by no means an exception. The disintegration of  production, an unfortunate financial and export-import policy,  and tremendous foreign debt have led to our economy being cut  off from the economy of our neighboring countries.    For a number of objective circumstances, the commanding  state  structures are incapable of putting matters right decisively.  This naturally leads to the appearance of initiative on a  different level. Our Foundation has become the expression of the  will and striving of the leaders of our prestigious enterprises,  scientific and social organizations, creative collectives,  entrepreneurs and businessmen to seek and use non-traditional  forms of cooperation among the CIS countries. The basis of this  cooperation is economic expediency, mutual benefit and mutual  trust and honesty.    [Dolzhenko] Does it not seem to you that Russia has only  gained from the fact that Ukraine decided to go "its own" way.  The Russian economy, as they think, has gone forward, but would  it have succeeded in this in combination with Ukraine? Hopes for  agreement within the framework of the CIS are very slim:  essentially, not one of them will be fulfilled. What do you  think about this?    [Fokin] I assume that 99 out of 100 of those polled would  agree with you, complaining that reforms in Ukraine are "not  moving." Although this is not quite so. They are moving, but  every time in a different direction. It is this lack of  sequence, the absence of continuity and the multitude of  contradictions and mutual exclusions that are holding back  progress. This instability is vicious. It makes increasingly  perceptible the lagging behind Russia, blocking the already  weakened ties between the enterprises of the two countries.    Russia, for example, has long given up the practice of the  state order, although, in my opinion, prematurely. The  enterprises have become the owners of the products. Most of the  production facilities have become joint-stock companies, the  securities market is working actively, and the convertibility of  the ruble is stimulating small- and medium-scale business.    The main thing, though, is that the psychology of the people  has changed. They are already thinking in new categories, and it  will therefore be difficult for our state enterprise director to  come to an agreement with the president of a Russian joint-stock  company. He has completely different powers and interests.    Here, you realize, everything rests on not severing ties or  lack of desire to cooperate for political reasons. The different  level of development of production relations proves to be the  decisive factor. It is extremely necessary to overcome these  differences, and not to let them become disassociated. Both the  Russians and the citizens of Ukraine are interested in this. The  more time that passes since the moment of the break-up of the  Union, the more aware we become of the need for these actions.    [Dolzhenko] The direction of the Foundation, in general, is  clear, but all the same, just what are its specific goals and  tasks?    [Fokin] The goal of the Foundation is all-round furthering  of  Ukrainian economic and cultural progress through direct  cooperation between the enterprises and organizations, and  educational and cultural centers of the CIS, above all Russia,  and promotion of the integration of the Ukrainian economy into  the world system. Our organization is state-social,  non-government, and in no way do we intend to duplicate or  replace the actions of the government administrative structures.  On the contrary, we will take on the functions that are not  characteristic of the state under the new conditions.    L. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine, fully understood and  supported the idea of creating the Foundation. B. Yeltsin also  supported it.    [Dolzhenko] The other day we received information on the  registration of the Russian Foundation for Humanitarian and  Economic Cooperation with Ukraine.    [Fokin] This is pleasing information. It will now be easier  to solve the problems of cooperation. The Foundation was created  through the efforts of well-known Russian state and public  figures -- O. Lobov, Yu. Shafranik, Yu. Dubinin, L. Zapalskiy,  Yu. Astayev, V. Kostyuk and others. The Russian Foundation, like  ours, gained the status of a state-social organization.    [Dolzhenko] What are the basic directions of the activity of  your Foundation? The humanitarian theme is mentioned first in  the title.    [Fokin] We really are devoting a great deal of attention to  humanitarian problems. Public health, ecology and, in  particular, clearing up the consequences of the accident at the  Chernobyl AES occupy a special place.    For example, under the aegis of the Foundation, a project in  the field of cytogenetics is being developed. The unique  conditions for study, and the very rich base of data on a  nuclear accident and its consequences, accumulated at 17  scientific-research institutes and scientific centers, will make  it possible to carry out a set of measures to study the effect  of radiation on man. Here, wide use will be made of the works of  Aleksey Gostev, Russian scientist, a citizen of Ukraine. This  courageous man, together with his wife and son, having been  living in the 30-kilometer zone for 8 years.    The Foundation also intends to gather and disseminate  reliable, objective information, and to cover the subject of the  two peoples in detail. Preparation for the publishing of  Ukrainian newspapers in Russia has already begun, and links are  being set up between the mass information media of our countries.    [Dolzhenko] Considering your former position of  prime-minister, and your profound knowledge of the Ukrainian  economy, you can hardly watch its decline with indifference....    [Fokin] Naturally. The Ukrainian national economic complex  today is fettered by the paralysis of the credit-financial  system. After all, the bankruptcy of the economic constituents  is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, organized. Holding  back clearing accounts and exceeding the credit "oxygen," is the  easiest way to destroy industrial enterprises, put them up for  auction, and buy them for a song. Here it is no longer a  question of decline, but of infinity.    Our Foundation is doing intensive work on creating a  multi-functional banking network, which will help to make it  possible to set up the passage of payment documents of Ukrainian  enterprises to their foreign partners and back. This will make  it to a certain extent possible to avoid enslaving dependence on  government financial structures and their unpredictable  behavior. The participants in the Foundation are becoming the  founders of our own bank, with a proposed charter capital of  $5-10 million. Prestigious financial institutions of Russia and  the Western countries are being drawn into cooperation.    Because full-value cooperation is possible only with equal  starting conditions, and a serious imbalance has been noted,  inasmuch as Russia has already virtually completed privatizing  state enterprises, the re-establishment of production ties in  many ways depends on the rates of privatization in Ukraine.    The Ukrainskiy Finansovo-Investitsionnyy Soyuz (UFIS) AO  [Joint-Stock Company], working under the aegis of the  Foundation, is assisting in this process. This firm possesses  the necessary technology, and is staffed with fine specialists.  They are helping to develop a privatization program for  enterprises in sectors such as machine building, instrument  making, petroleum processing, building materials, biochemistry  and the light pulp and paper industry. At the same time, we are  striving for a comprehensive approach, encompassing all stages  of privatization, from assessing the property to issuing and  placing securities, and after that, providing post-privatization  service.    In the future, the Foundation will take part in setting up  trans-national corporations of technologically linked production  facilities, through joint-stockholding. A dealer network of the  enterprises of Ukraine and Russia, and vice-versa, is slated for  development. We are seriously engaged in drawing in foreign  investments. Our assistance to enterprises lies in seeking  investors, preparing the documents for extending credit and  developing business plans. Information on potential subjects for  investment are being disseminated along Foundation channels to  the West.    [Dolzhenko] Vitold Pavlovich, when I listen to you, I keep  thinking: why didn't you put such alluring ideas into effect  before, in your days as premier? By the way, how did you, in  your opinion, leave Ukraine's economy, and how do you assess it  today?    [Fokin] Spare me, I'm not going to give an assessment of  either the activity of my predecessors nor my successors. This  is an unworthy occupation. One thing I can say, quoting  impartial statistics. By the autumn of 1992, distinct signs of  stabilization appeared in all sectors of Ukraine's economy. In  June, the depression came to a halt, and in July and August the  increase in the average daily production volume was fixed, not  in the ephemeral monetary expression, but in physical indicators.    Wages were paid regularly, and inflation rates were cut to 8  percent. What is there to say? The exchange rate of the dollar  was 161 karbovanets, and not 50,000, as it is today. The value  of the fixed production capital was brought into conformity with  the rise in prices and monetary incomes. So, as compared with  today's situation, is this good or bad?    As for converting ideas, the answer may prove to be  unexpected: in the sphere of my actual activity, I have scarcely  any more rights than in my days as premier. Allowing for the  scale, of course. I am now surrounded by like-minded people, and  not by dilettantes from parliamentary rostrums.    It is not by chance that the preceding Supreme Soviet of  Ukraine ended its activity in such an inglorious fashion. Having  restricted the rights of the executive bodies to a nonsensical  limit, parliament itself passed sentence. Thank God that it  managed without tanks. For almost four years, the country was  shaken by legal nihilism. The Cabinet of Ministers should have  pursued an active financial policy, but for it, the National  Bank was sealed off. The Supreme Soviet managed the Bank, it was  preparing a monetary reform. The State Property Fund and the  Anti-Monopoly Committee were under it.    I came out in behalf of retaining the state order for  strategic goods, since I realized that the brakes must be  released gradually, but they accused me of conservatism. I  proposed a soft system of state regulation and was branded an  anti-marketist. I tried to maintain, in the transitional period,  the basic structures of state administration, so that, as the  forms of ownership changed, their functions would gradually be  turned over to new formations. And what happened? At the  beginning of March, from the voting in of one of the deputies,  parliament carried out the decision to eliminate the leading  sectorial ministries and departments.    It was precisely then that the possibility appeared of mass  awarding of state property, in general, to the technical  personnel of the newly created structures. The story of  Ukraine's exit from the ruble zone occupies a special place in  the chronicles of our parliament's evil deeds. I hope that it is  still the subject of a special investigation.    Incidentally, your comment is reasonable, the Russian ruble  has strengthened its position, by being relieved of a partner  such as Ukraine. But enough about that. The difficult, tense  work that lies ahead of us to re-establish the economy is  incredible, and I have great hopes for the start of the new  Supreme Soviet's activity. I wish it success with all my heart.    [Dolzhenko] Do you not regret today your unrealized dreams,  and certain plans?    [Fokin] I have an urge to say: "No, I have no regrets." But  this would not be true. Indifference is not inherent in me, nor  is groundless optimism. I can clearly see what political  ambitions and national arrogance can do to the economy. I regret  the wasted efforts, the unrealized intentions. I will permit no  thoughts of hopelessness, though. I often repeat the words of  Chekhov's hero: "The deed must be done, Gentlemen."</p>

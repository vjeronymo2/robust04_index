			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Too much of a good thing - As recycling laws take hold in the US, manufacturers have the most to lose A bitter battle over recycling in the US is pitting environmentalists against many manufacturers, especially in the plastics and food processing industries. The new tension comes from the growing public demand for efficient recycling. While rising public enthusiasm and more curbside collection has boosted the supply of recycled materials, demand for recycled goods is still weak. Many communities pay heavily for recycling programmes only to watch the materials languish unused. What worries many US industries is that more and more cities and states are adopting complex legislation which calls for industry, rather than local governments, to carry much of the recycling burden. The state of Oregon, for instance, has adopted a law forcing companies to adopt one of a series of environmentally friendly options: Use packaging which contains a certain percentage of recycled materials  - 25 per cent by 1995, 50 per cent by 2000. Guarantee a similar rate of recycling for the materials in question - by reprocessing the materials themselves if need be. Severely reduce the total amount of packaging used. The twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul in the state of Minnesota adopted similar, though less restrictive, measures. And a bill even more ambitious than the Oregon legislation was laid aside in Massachusetts only after industry spent Dollars 5.5m (Pounds 3.6m) to defeat a plebiscite vote. Other recycling controls are becoming widespread. Eleven states now require newspaper print to contain a minimum of up to 40 per cent recycled content, and another 25 have voluntary programmes. Nine states enforce 'bottle bills', which require beverage companies to ask for a deposit and re-use collected bottles. And 30 have legislation requiring local and state governments to purchase a certain amount of recycled office materials. Perhaps most frightening to opponents of recycling laws, legislation is before Congress which would institute repackaging requirements on a nationwide basis. 'Public pressure is mounting to boost recycling,' said Roger Bernstein, director of government affairs for the American Plastics Council. Of all manufacturing segments, perhaps none is more concerned than the plastics industry. Plastic is extremely difficult to recycle, since so many types are used. A mere 2 per cent of the plastic discarded in the US is currently reprocessed. Moreover, plastic is criticised by many environmentalists for its indestructibility. The rising tide against the plastics industry has it so worried that it has just launched a national public relations campaign to promote the environmental soundness of the product. Despite industry concerns, repackaging laws seem to be the wave of the future, and defenders of the measures say they are extremely effective in cutting down on waste. 'Several new paper recycling plants have opened up in Oregon over the last few years, and we've seen some real progress on glass,' said Joel Ario, director of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group which sponsored the repackaging legislation. James River Company, for instance, has just opened its first office supply paper recycling plant in Oregon. Nationally, increased demand for recycled materials has led to a big increase in recovered paper used in newsprint. At a time when total newsprint production is declining, the amount of recycled newsprint produced in the US rose from 1.9bn tonnes in 1990 to an estimated 2.5bn tonnes this year, according to the American Paper Institute. That figure is set to surge to 3.2bn in 1994. Still, many observers say progress on the recycling front has been driven more by improved technology than by any increase in demand through environmental legislation. 'We put in a magnetic screening system 12 years ago and just added a non-ferrous metal detector,' said Ronald Sprague, plant manager for glass recycling with Owens Brockway in Oregon. 'I don't think the new laws make any difference. It's the technology that counts. If someone can figure out how to re-use something cheaply, they will. Our recycling rates are between 60 and 80 per cent for glass in this state, well above those required by law up to the year 2000.' Not all segments have such an easy time meeting targets. Critics say that the new repackaging bills can be too expensive, or simply unworkable. 'These sorts of laws can cause chaos,' said Carol Rawlston, vice president in charge of government affairs for the American Paper Institute. 'For instance, some sorts of food packaging - such as for milk - can't use recycled material. There are too many contaminants involved, and it would go against packaging standards set by the federal government to guard people's health.' Similar problems are cited for bottle collection. 'Some of the chemicals people used to use to clean the bottles are now considered toxic,' said Sprague. 'And a lot of small grocery stores have found that they don't have the space to collect used bottles.' Even if more states adopt repackaging laws, environmentalists may face obstacles in getting companies to comply. 'Boxes for Wheaties cereal have been made of recycled paper since 1950, just because that was the cheapest material available,' said Lawrence Sawyer, director of government relations for General Mills. 'But the actual bag that the cereal is packed in within that box is 100 per cent virgin. It has to be for health reasons. You can pass all the legislation you want, but no one can make us comply if the consumers' safety is at risk.' With both sides arming themselves to the hilt, the battle between environmentalists and industry on the recycling question will probably continue for some time. But with the concept of recycling enjoying high rates of public approval, industries like plastics, bottlers and food processors are concerned that, in the long run, they will be the losers.</p>

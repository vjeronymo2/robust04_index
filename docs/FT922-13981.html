			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Britain defends HK airport contracts BRITAIN's trade representative in Hong Kong, Mr Peter Heap, yesterday defended the UK's success so far in winning consultancy contracts for the colony's new HKDollars 114bn (Pounds 8.43bn) airport and related projects and denied there had been any favouritism. Mr Heap's intervention comes at a time when the Hong Kong government is under criticism from some local politicians and the Beijing-sponsored press for allegedly awarding the lion's share of consultancy contracts to UK companies. The government is soon expected to announce the successful consortium to build the Tsing Ma Bridge, and the winner of the contract to prepare the site for the new airport - two of the biggest contracts to be awarded. The complaints stem partly from anti-British elements in the colony. They also come from pro-Beijing forces who believe the airport and its associated projects is a UK device to transfer Hong Kong's riches to the UK via contracts before the 1997 hand over of the colony to China. Mr Heap said it was to be expected that British engineering consultancies would do well in winning consultancy work; many of the world's biggest and best engineering consultancies were British, he said. He denied the UK had benefited disproportionately in the award of larger civil engineering contracts. Out of the 25 works contracts awarded only two had gone to UK companies, he said. In a written answer to Hong Kong's Legislative Council on March 25, Mr James Blake, the colony's secretary for works, produced figures which showed that of the 38 consultancy contracts let, UK companies had figured in 31.</p>

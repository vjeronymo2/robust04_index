			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Lloyd's counters debt rumours Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, yesterday sought to dispel suggestions that its finances would be stretched by a Court of Appeal ruling this week which threatens to disrupt its attempts at reclaiming debt from lossmaking members, Ralph Atkins writes. It said that information supplied to the Department of Trade and Industry this summer had shown its total assets were three times the required minimum for general business. The appeal court ruled this week that Lloyd's might have breached EU law by setting up a 'central fund' to settle claims on policies underwritten when Names - individuals whose assets back the market - refuse, or are unable, to provide the funds. Lloyd's is appealing against the decision.</p>

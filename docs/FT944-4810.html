			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Japanese managers suffer winds of change Hard-pressed managers at Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, are having to face a change in a once honourable tradition - annual bonuses are no longer to be based on years of service, but on performance. About 11,000 Matsushita managers opened envelopes containing the details of their winter bonus packet to find a sum rather different to what they had come to expect. With the new system, complacent managers who have almost always seen their bonuses rise with their years of service, could find the amount they receive to be as much as Y1.5m (Pounds 9,600) less than that paid to the best performers. On the other hand, ambitious younger managers are supposed to find that seniority is no longer a barrier to financial reward. 'The new system could boost the morale of younger managers,' a Matsushita official said optimistically. The company's decision to relate bonuses, which comprise roughly half a manager's annual pay, to performance represents a significant departure from traditional Japanese management practice which values loyal service over real performance. As Japan's economic growth has slowed and the country sees itself going through an industrial transition, company executives have been calling for a review of traditional employment practices, such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay, These practices were formerly considered inviolable by large blue-chip companies but are now seen increasingly as an obstacle to competitiveness and the structural adjustments the country needs. Matsushita is not the first large Japanese company to adopt a pay system that ties employees' remuneration to performance, but its decision is expected to have a significant impact on other companies. The company is considered a symbol of Japanese business conservatism and is a wage trend-setter in the electronics industry. For Matsushita, which has grown over the years into a large and unwieldy corporation, the measure is part of an effort to improve profitability through a three-year restructuring programme. Mr Yoichi Morishita, the company's president, has stated his intention to raise its ratio of operating profits to sales from 2.6 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of fiscal 1996. To soften the blow of the new system, however, the company still retains the seniority system in annual salaries paid to managers. Managers who are affected generally appeared to accept the need for change in theory but the new system is bound to raise concerns about the fairness of performance assessments and the threat the spread of merit-based pay poses to Japan's much-vaunted social equality.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL BATTLE OF THE POTHOLDERS  </P> <P> I have read that the candidates for William Campbell's state Senate seat are  involved in a mudslinging fight. Another image comes to my mind when I think of  the upcoming special election.  </P> <P> I prefer to call it "The Battle of the Potholders."  </P> <P> At first I had little reaction when I received potholders in the mail from two  of the candidates' wives along with letters of support for their husbands. I'm  used to getting potholders and jar openers and refrigerator magnets from the  local realtors.  </P> <P> Then my amusement changed to indignation. What an insult to the women in this  district -- to think that a potholder would have an impact on our votes. We are  intelligent enough to vote based upon real issues that concern us.  </P> <P> Should I vote for the potholder with the pretty flowers or for the potholder  with the nice image of the state Capitol? Give me a break! Or better yet, give  me a real candidate for state Senate.  </P> <P> PATSY JAIMES  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

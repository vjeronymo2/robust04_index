			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Observer: Civil servants' nuclear family Is John Guinness, the permanent secretary at the department of energy, having second thoughts about his decision to throw in his civil service career? After all, if Labour forms the next government, his department will not be axed and the chairmanship of British Nuclear Fuels may not be such an attractive number despite the prospect of a doubling in salary. Sir Christopher Harding, BNFL's 52-year-old chairman, was due to step down at the end of this month but is hanging on until his successor, the 56-year-old Guinness, arrives. If the Tories are re-elected, it is expected that the 900-strong energy department will merge seamlessly into the DTI, since Guinness has done such a good job overseeing the sale of most of the state energy sector except for coal. The official line is that the softly spoken Guinness is staying on until the general election in order to provide some continuity. John Wakeham, the energy secretary, is leaving politics and his two parliamentary under-secretaries are relatively inexperienced. If the Tories lose the election, and Labour's Frank Dobson breathes new life into the energy department, it would not be surprising if he wished to replace the architect of most major energy privatisations. That said, there is a worry that BNFL is replacing a very commercial chairman and one with a prodigious appetite for public relations with an ex-civil servant whose only private sector experience was a brief stint as a trainee at Union Discount, 30 years ago, and whose pr skills are, to put it kindly, untested. Since BNFL remains, like the rest of Britain's nuclear power industry, stuck in the public sector, it is even possible that Dobson will not want a man like Guinness running Sellafield. Guinness's nightmare must be that he somehow gets caught between chairs when the music stops after a Labour election victory. He is, however, too shrewd a political operator not to have spotted that one.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. TO GET HOCKEY TEAM; SOCKERS OWNER CONCERNED  </P> <P> A professional hockey franchise will play in the San Diego Sports Arena this  fall, it was announced Thursday, and the owner of the Sockers said the move may  endanger the future of his championship soccer team.  </P> <P> Harry Cooper, leaseholder of the Sports Arena, and representatives of the  International Hockey League announced that San Diego has been awarded an  expansion franchise that will schedule 41 dates at the arena for the next  season beginning in October. Cooper posted a $2-million letter of credit when  his application was approved.  </P> <P> The IHL is considered the top minor league system for the National Hockey  League. Cooper, who hopes to eventually land an NHL team for an arena he wants  to build on property he owns in Sorrento Hills, views this award as a  steppingstone. The IHL team will start as an independent franchise, but Cooper  said he will attempt to establish a link to an NHL team before the 1991-92  season.  </P> <P> Ron Fowler, owner of the Sockers for the past three seasons, said he will  attempt to meet with Cooper and Vin Ciruzzi, president of the Sports Arena, and  request that they consider starting with hockey in 1991 rather than this fall.  But Cooper said Thursday that the hockey team will definitely play here this  year.  </P> <P> Fowler said he wasn't notified of the possibility of an IHL franchise coming to  San Diego until late Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> "I resent the way it's been handled," he said. "If they were going to do this,  I think they should have talked to us about it some time ago."  </P> <P> San Diego has had four previous professional hockey teams: the Skyhawks of the  Pacific Coast Hockey League, the Gulls of the Western Hockey League, the  Mariners of the World Hockey Assn. and the Hawks of the Pacific Hockey League.  The Skyhawks played from 1939 to 1947, the Gulls, Mariners and Hawks played in  succession from 1966 to 1979.  </P> <P> The NHL is scheduled to award two or three expansion franchises in December.  Cooper hopes San Diego will be one of them.  </P> <P> "We want to send them a message that we're ready for the National Hockey  League," he said by telephone from Vancouver, British Columbia, where he is  attending NHL meetings. "I think San Diego is a hockey town. Everywhere I go in  the past year, so many people are saying that they are hockey fans, and they  are going to support the effort."  </P> <P> What remains to be seen is whether San Diego can support both hockey and indoor  soccer. Fowler is concerned that there won't be enough time to make  arrangements for the Sports Arena to accommodate two professional franchises.  The season for the Major Indoor Soccer League -- to which the Sockers belong --  nearly parallels the IHL's, beginning at the end of October and usually ending  early in June.  </P> <P> The Sockers clinched their eighth indoor soccer championship in nine years last  Friday.  </P> <P> "I think to try to be up and running with a new hockey franchise this year does  not make a great deal of sense," Fowler said. "I wish they'd gotten the  franchise and taken a year to put it together. That would have given us a year  to do things on a realistic, organized basis and probably would have assured  that we had two teams in the Sports Arena. Given what's happening now, unless  we're able to work something out that makes sense, I'm not encouraged at all.  </P> <P> "I don't think they realize the level of outrage that's going to exist with a  number of people within the community," he said. "I think they've handled this  in a very cavalier fashion, and it's inconsistent with the way they've done a  lot of other things."  </P> <P> Among the problems Fowler wants to address are game scheduling and the sharing  of both advertising revenues and office space. Cooper, who will work with  Ciruzzi to form the franchise's principal ownership, said the Sports Arena will  make every effort to take care of the Sockers, but that those efforts will not  include a postponement of the IHL's debut here.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine why we should do that," Cooper said. "There's no reason why we  couldn't start it" this year.  </P> <P> Cooper said he doesn't think such a start will present any serious operating  problems for the Sockers.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be out looking for another franchise if it was going to be at the  expense of the Sockers," he said. "I'm a soccer fan. I want the team to  succeed. It's important that we don't bring in one team and get rid of another  one."  </P> <P> The Sockers' primary source of advertising revenue is the dasher boards that  surround the playing area. Cooper said they will be redesigned so they are  interchangeable, allowing both teams to advertise at full capacity.  </P> <P> According to Cooper, office space at the Sports Arena will be shared, meaning  the Sockers will have to move some employees elsewhere.  </P> <P> Switching the playing surface from ice to a soccer field will increase  maintenance costs but can be done fairly quickly, Cooper said. Insulation will  be put on top of the ice, then covered by the soccer carpet.  </P> <P> The San Diego IHL team is still missing many pieces. Cooper said he hasn't yet  made final decisions on a coach or a general manager, but he hopes to have them  in place in time for a scheduled news conference next Friday.  </P> <P> Division alignments for the 11-team IHL are expected to be determined today.  </P> <P> Cooper said he does not yet know what type of attendance will be needed for his  franchise to break even financially.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Background: Founded in Windsor, Canada, in 1945, the IHL began with four teams  and was designed to absorb young players returning from World War II. The  Detroit Auto Club was the first champion in 1946, winning what still is known  as the Turner Cup. The league has operated continuously since, but rarely with  the same teams returning each season; 1965-66 was the first year in which it  was configured as it had been the previous year, and the league has had a  different look in 19 out of the past 24 seasons. The 1989-90 champion was the  Indianapolis Ice.  </P> <P> Affiliations: Most IHL franchises are tied directly to National Hockey League  teams, with players moving between the two leagues. In 1989-90, two franchises  -- Fort Wayne (Ind.) and Phoenix -- were independent, each with loose ties to  several NHL teams. San Diego is expected to operate this way at first.  </P> <P> Season: Teams play from the first week in October into May, with 82  regular-season games. In 1989-90, eight of the league's nine teams -- four each  from the West and East divisions -- made the playoffs. Quarterfinals,  semifinals and finals were decided by best-of-seven-games series.  </P> <P> Teams: Flint (Mich.) Spirits, Ft. Wayne (Ind.) Komets, Indianapolis Ice,  Kalamazoo (Mich.) Wings, Kansas City Blades, Muskegon (Mich.) Lumberjacks,  Milwaukee Admirals, Phoenix Roadrunners, Peoria (Ill.) Rivermen, Salt Lake  Golden Eagles, San Diego. Ft. Wayne is seeking a move to Albany, N.Y.  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Accountancy: Time for auditors to look back to the future - Andrew Jack examines the delays in publishing a white paper two years after the McFarlane report Judging by the tardy handling of its most contentious proposals yet, a mischief-maker might suggest that the accountancy profession has recently created a new type of 'expectations gap'. It comes in the form of the silent, ever-expanding void into which responses have tumbled since the publication of the Auditing Practices Board's 'Future development of auditing' document. Almost two years after publication in November 1992 of the green paper, widely dubbed the 'McFarlane report' after its chairman, the dozens of submissions reacting to its ideas have now been made public. The official response in the form of a long-promised 'white paper' has yet to materialise  -and is apparently not likely to appear before early next year. Mr Ian Plaistowe, a senior partner with Arthur Andersen, has since taken on and relinquished the presidency of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. He has also taken over chairing the APB, while his predecessor has retired and other members of the board moved on. Mr John McFarlane, who co-ordinated the green paper, has switched from his top role at Citibank to take a board seat with Standard Chartered and recently relocated to Hong Kong. Some have no doubt benefited from the delays. A number of organisations seemed incapable of responding in time for the date for submissions - which was March 1993. More seriously, others may have hoped that its radical ideas would simply fade away, such as Baker Tilly, the accountancy firm which dismissed the entire McFarlane report in a few paragraphs. In the meantime, some of those submitting their views have had time to change their minds. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, for example, has switched its views on auditor liability, arguing then that the position must be reformed, but earlier this year deciding that there was no need for amendments. Overall, the delay might have had some advantages. It does allow a little more time for reflection and a better historical perspective on the debate. As Mr Prem Sikka of the University of London and his colleagues point out, the UK accountancy bodies have persistently taken a sectional view and resisted reform throughout the twentieth century. He says the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales unsuccessfully tried to oppose the publication of a profit and loss account for companies in 1926, of an audit report in 1948, and of turnover in 1967, for instance. Browsing through the responses to the McFarlane report makes interesting reading. Coopers &amp; Lybrand's English firm takes a constructive though critical perspective. Its Irish partner firm is more outspoken, arguing in an unusually candid letter that intensive price competition has led to 'a dramatic reduction' in the level of audit fees for most companies. The firm warns that this situation may risk a limitation on the scope of audits as savings are sought to meet reduced fee levels; and restrictions on the independence of auditors as management threatens to put audits out to proposal or to withhold support for the auditors' reappointment. One depressing element in the submissions is the lack of responses from companies. Most are from accountancy firms, their professional organisations and trade bodies, with just a smattering of - generally far shorter - letters from businesses and individuals adding to the pile. More sad is the correspondingly narrow focus of the responses that results. Most take an extremely blinkered view, concentrating on criticising many of the recommendations for being too radical or 'impractical' or simply too costly. Self-interest is often transparent in the replies, with the Institute of Internal Auditors arguing for a greater role for internal audit, for instance. Nonetheless, the importance of the function carried out by its members is also flagged up by the Royal Bank of Scotland's response, which points to the findings of a recent study showing that a tiny fraction of significant computer fraud issues were discovered by the external auditors. One apparently safe proposed reform is the idea that the dependency of a firm on a single client should be reduced, with the permissable fee income which could be generated being reduced perhaps from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Endorsement of the idea crops up in the responses with a regularity that might lead a cynic to think it was the result of collusion. It is almost the sole recommendation for change endorsed by the Big 6 accountancy firms and the English Institute. The only thing on which these large entities appear to agree is that there should be no other more radical reforms, such as a ban on the provision of lucrative non-audit services to audit clients by the same firm. But hidden among the blandishments and defensive gestures are some important points from others. One of the most controversial is the idea that auditors should not be able to provide other services to their audit clients, such as tax or consulting advice. The large firms always dismiss suggestions that this practice jeopardises their independence. However, Sir Brian Unwin, chairman of Customs &amp; Excise, (also now replaced since the date of his letter), is among those who says he has 'reservations' about the practice, which is all but forbidden for auditors to public sector bodies. Similar views come from others including the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima), a number of the smaller accountancy firms and even from the Association of Authorised Public Accountants (AAPA), representing the rump of accountants recognised by the government to practice but outside the remit of the other professional accountancy bodies. Cima also argues for the creation of an Audit Commission to take over the regulation of auditing in the profession, both standards-setting and policing, wresting the Auditing Practices Board from the clutches of the accountancy bodies alone. The AAPA calls for a Royal Commission to examine - given similar large-scale public inquiries into the subject in the USA and elsewhere. While the process might be cumbersome, the idea does at least highlight the difficulty because of the lack of independent research currently available. Most derives instead from the profession. However, there is almost universal rejection of ideas still being considered by the Auditing Practices Board in the longer-term to introduce some form of 'shareholder panel' to bring auditors back closer to their true clients and away from the pressures of the directors in a way that jeopardises their independence when publicly reporting. Even so, Prudential, Standard Life and others endorse in principle the idea of some form of 'audit panel' which might oversee or mediate disputes over work or auditor appointments across quoted companies. Even some of the larger accountancy firms such as Grant Thornton and Moore Stephens are in favour of further discussions on the topic. A number of organisations do argue for a longer, 'free-form' report from the auditors in companies' annual reports, which would provide some useful information rather than the existing bland pro forma read by so few. These include the 100 Group of leading company finance directors. But if the Auditing Practices Board does not get on and produce its revised white paper soon, in the light of these submissions, any chance of meaningful reforms before the new millennium may start to seem impossible. It should not give its critics that satisfaction.</p>

			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (13): Focused on the essentials - John Kavanagh on manufacturing control systems A manufacturing software package installed by Energizer Rechargeable Products has helped the company to get separate departments working together as a single unit. The impact on quality and customer service has enabled it to retain hesitant customers and gain new ones in a fiercely competitive market. Energizer makes batteries at a factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. It has regional offices in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden producing a European turnover of Dollars 40m. There are 120 staff. In 1992 it replaced an old IBM System/36 business minicomputer running a much amended package, with a PC network version of the Micross package from UK company Kewill Systems. Energizer also considered packages for IBM AS/400 or Unix computers but found the PC product was a third of the price. The company has adapted its own procedures to the package where necessary, rather than change the system. 'By sticking to the standard package we get all the standard upgrades. Previously a user would ask for a new feature and IT would write it. But just because a user has an idea for a new facility, it doesn't mean that is the right way for the company as a whole to go,' says Anthony Elliott, European information systems manager. A big operational benefit lies in the fact that data is entered just once, Mr Elliott says. 'Everything is now done automatically from one entry. This also reduces the margin for keying errors.' Quality manager Bob Evans says the fact that managers and others are now on-line to the same information has had a big impact. 'The easier flow and access to information have helped managers understand the business better,' he says. Energizer has spent Pounds 85,000 on 45 networked Dell PCs and a file processor, plus about Pounds 30,000 on Micross. Return on this investment has not been measured but there has been a Dollars 100,000 annual saving merely from linking in the regional offices. These offices used to contract out their accounting to local firms but it is now all done centrally. In addition, the regional offices used to communicate with the head office on paper, so they had little information about product availability. But the main benefits have been the intangibles resulting from the single data entry and the access to information. 'We are a better run business now and people understand what the business is all about,' Mr Evans says. 'We have a far better view of the things that matter.'

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses volatile, mostly weaker after US losses Wall Street's overnight losses on Tuesday, the steady opening in the US bond market yesterday and the subsequent, continued weakness in US equities left bourses volatile, but generally lower, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT shelved Tuesday's apparent switch from cyclicals into defensive, or interest rate-sensitive stocks and dropped in most sectors, the Dax index falling 20.82 points to 2,147.53, mounting post-bourse recovery and then subsiding to close with the Ibis indicated Dax at 2,151.84. Turnover fell from DM8.2bn to DM7.5bn. Another small cut in repo rates, and a higher dividend did nothing for Deutsche Bank, which fell DM5 to DM795.50; but BHF Bank, with higher than expected profits, rose another DM12.50 to DM449 for a two-day gain of DM20. BHF said yesterday that Metallgesellschaft, of which it is a major creditor, had a good chance of survival after its recent disasters. Metallgesellschaft itself said that its group operating loss narrowed by 38 per cent in the first five months of 1993-94, and rose DM7.60 to DM196.50, up DM17.50 this week. PARIS dropped 1.9 per cent to a new 1994 closing low, suffering from the sea-change in opinion which has seen it move from strategic favour at the beginning of this year to the wrong end of a switch into Italy. The CAC 40 index fell 39.37 to at 2,083.87. Oils were still suffering from Opec's failure to cut production levels, and Total compounded this by suffering from rights issue talk, falling FFr12.30 to FFr298.20. Elf Aquitaine dropped FFr9 to FFr378, below its privatisation sale price of FFr385. Nor were stocks helped by the corporate results season. Pernod Ricard, the drinks company, fell FFr11 to FFr382; its results, after hours, were in line with expectations. Pinault Printemps, the retail group, lost FFr34 at FFr915 with its results due today. MADRID, not surprisingly, was more comfortable with domestic, rather than international concerns as it, too, hit a 1994 low, the general index dropping 5.00 to 319.48 in turnover of Pta40bn. Influenced by the US declines, Telefonica dropped Pta100 to Pta1,665. However, Fecsa, the electrical utility which said yesterday that it would raise its 1993 dividend by 60 per cent, mnaged to rise Pta15 to Pta1,020 against the trend. MILAN continued upward, the Comit index adding 1.72 to 695.54, on the perception that the right-wing Freedom Alliance was making progress towards forming a government. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities recommended, given current uncertainties, taking some profits at current levels. 'A serious dip in the bond and equity markets would, however, be a buying opportunity,' he added. 'Longer term, further successful privatisation and the improving economic fundamentals should ensure a return of the Italian equity and bond market to outperformance.' Insurers were the day's biggest beneficiaries on hopes that they would gain from any move towards private pensions. RAS rose L1,547 or 6.1 per cent to L27,125, Fondiaria put on L559 or 4.7 per cent to L12,438 and Generali added L1,740 or 2.5 per cent to L40,876. Pirelli rose L86 or 3.4 per cent to L2,583 after the announcement that it was launching a L1,000bn bond: investors welcomed the news that the group wanted to move into telecommunications. Olivetti dipped L69 or 2.6 per cent to L2,571 on profit-taking after the strong run-up to Monday's news that it had been granted Italy's second mobile telephone licence. AMSTERDAM's AEX index finished 2.19 lower at 404.71. The market was supported by some light bargain hunting and demand for stocks which trade ex-dividend next month. Mr Marc Slendebroek at Kleinwort Benson, who has revised his Dutch market weighting to neutral from overweight, commented that given the continuous drain on liquidity by cash calls and the depressed dollar, there was little potential for the Dutch market to outperform. VNU went against the trend, rising FL 6.70 to Fl 175.70 following the announcement that it had priced its planned 3m share issue at Fl 169. ZURICH reduced some of its early losses in a technical rebound which left the SMI index to close 12.9 down at 2,814.5, after a low of 2,783.1. Ciba registered, the most active stock, bucked the trend rising SFr13 to SFr877 and halting the profit-taking that followed Tuesday's results. Many investors are seen as underweight in the company which is likely to benefit from a pick-up in industrial activity. HELSINKI continued the painful reassessment of its own, and international interest rate prospects, the Hex index falling 36.4 to 1,766.8.

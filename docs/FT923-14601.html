			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (26): A business-led approach to performance improvement - Case Study / Welsh Water / The best way forward, the company's IT managers decided, was to look at what information was needed by individuals in order to do their jobs effectively LONG BEFORE privatisation, Welsh Water was working at improving its information systems strategy. An approach, known as IBIS (Independent Business Information System) was developed as early as 1984 to provide an overall development framework, writes Michael Powell. Welsh Water has published a brochure describing IBIS. Its mission is to promote and facilitate improvements in Welsh Water's performance by the introduction of integrated business information systems - 'we wanted an overall framework to define how we do systems in Welsh Water,' says group information technology manager, Jeff Maynard. 'Our basic principle was that it should be business-led, not technology-led. We assembled a group of forward-looking IT managers to look at what information is needed to run sections, and we found that there were some good developments, in pockets throughout the organisation.' The group decided to look not at IT, but at what people needed to be able to do their jobs. The resulting systems, developed over the past six years, comprise around 25 modules, which integrate together, consisting of both package and bespoke software - 'the initiative has taken us through privatisation,' says Mr Maynard. 'Senior managers are business-focused and driven, and the IT department now produces the goods they require. You can't extract information systems from the rest of the organisation: the key to all our systems is that the information being reported is consistent right through the company. We've developed quite a bit of software over the last few years, and we must make it available to line managers - to help them through the maze of data.' The company uses traditional organisation and methods approaches to look at business processes and make them relevant to business managers. For instance, if a customer needs a new connection, it must access and update information all along the line, such as the physical position of the mains, the allocation of staff, the withdrawal of items from stock, and billing the customer. One system developed by the company is the geographical information system (GIS). This was developed on Intergraph workstations, using that company's toolkit. This enables software to be built, tailored to the customer's needs, in which rules are set up to define such things as the size and fittings needed to make a connection. It interfaces with customer-billing, service, telemetry and general financial systems. 'We have several thousand kilometres of mains and sewers, so data-capture is significant,' says Mr Maynard. Working with digitised Ordnance Survey maps, the company records the position of its pipework. Against this must be recorded reports of the condition of mains, and the materials from which they are built (many of the services are more than 100 years old), and the points of connection. 'This can help to improve our understanding of the way the whole network links together,' he says. Welsh Water's approach to development is to ensure that all systems come under a common integrated umbrella. One of the main aims of this integration is to ensure that a piece of data needs only to be entered at one point in the overall system. Bespoke systems are developed where necessary alongside packages - 'glued together' as necessary to make a consistent whole.</p>

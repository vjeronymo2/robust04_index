			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Pohl criticises the priorities of EC treaty EUROPEAN Community governments have been too optimistic in aiming for economic and monetary union by 1999 along the lines set out in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, said last night. Speaking at a reception at the Financial Times, Mr Pohl urged the EC to forge ahead soon with the creation of a European central bank, but to abandon such aspects as political union in the treaty for greater European integration. These arrangements would make sense for a 'core group' of European nations. 'I have come to the conclusion that if you want a European currency and a European central bank you should not link that to too many other issues as was laid out in the Maastricht treaty. I think that was a big mistake,' he said. Instead, the tasks of a future European central bank should be limited to setting interest rates and determining liquidity. The institution should aim 'like the old gold standard' at the depoliticisation of money. Mr Pohl - whose speech marked the launch of a book, The Bundesbank: the bank that rules Europe, by David Marsh, European Editor of the Financial Times - recalled that he had experienced antagonism from Bonn when raising interest rates. But the Bundesbank's robust independence had conferred benefits on Europe and Germany. 'The D-Mark has played a substantial role stabilising the European Monetary System. It has led to lower inflation in Europe, not only in Germany, and a narrowing of interest rate differentials until recently.' While a system of floating exchange rates would not be in Europe's interests, he criticised the EMS as being 'half-baked'. Such fixed exchange rate systems would always prompt attacks on participating currencies. Also these systems would always be governed by the strongest currency, in this case the D-Mark. This could be 'a problem by itself', he said. It was 'interesting and amazing' that in spite of the turmoil of German unification the D-Mark had remained the strongest currency in the exchange rate mechanism. German unification, although now posing problems for Europe because of high interest rates, had earlier created 'a demand-push' which had led to more opportunities for exporters in other countries. Mr Pohl said it would be logical for the 'core members', generally thought to be Germany, France, the Benelux countries and possibly Denmark, to proceed soon with their own monetary union.</p>

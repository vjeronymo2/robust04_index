			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Jawad </F> al-'Anani, in Washington, by Muhammad al-Aswad, in Cairo; date  not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Aswad] Dr. Jawad, welcome to the Voice of the  Arabs.    [Al-'Anani] Thank you.    [Al-Aswad] Let us begin with His Majesty King Husayn's visit  to Washington. What will be the main topics of his discussions  with the American officials?    [Al-'Anani] His Majesty King Husayn came to the United  States  for the medical checkup he undergoes every six months. Thank  God, the results of the checkup were excellent. It is customary  for his majesty to meet with senior U.S. officials during these  medical visits. The current visit comes after reaching an  agreement with the Israelis on border demarcation and fair water  sharing. In light of these recent developments on the  Jordanian-Israeli negotiating track, the visit acquires  particular importance.    [Al-Aswad] There have recently been intensive  Jordanian-Israeli contacts in Washington. As you said, the  talks resulted in the signing of an economic agreement involving  several projects. How far have you gone in the subject of  border demarcation?    [Al-'Anani] The agreement reached two weeks ago provided for  the formation of specialized technical subcommittees within a  higher committee of technicians that will work in the field to  demarcate the border, divide the water, and work out security  measures. This will begin in July.    [Al-Aswad] So, the news about an agreement on the  demarcation  of the Jordanian-Israeli border is true. Is this a departure  from the known Jordanian principles concerning the peace process?    [Al-'Anani] Not at all. We are still committed to the joint  agenda signed on 14 September 1993. We have never departed from  that agenda. Moreover, we have not reached a final agreement.  We have agreed to start border demarcation and water sharing.  This does not mean the issue is over. We have only started  actual field work, and we still have some way to go to reach an  agreement on border demarcation. Technical field work must be  done before we can say that we have reached an agreement.    [Al-Aswad] Dr. Jawad, how do you view the future of the  peace  process on the Jordanian-Israeli track and on the other  negotiating tracks?    [Al-'Anani] Our position is clear. We want coordination with  all the Arab sides and we would like to see progress on all  tracks. His majesty will stress the need for progress on all  tracks because we believe that partial peace is unstable peace;  it is not lasting, comprehensive, or just. This is the point we  are going to stress here in the United States.    [Al-Aswad] But is the border demarcation agreement progress  that leaves the Syrian-Israeli track behind?    [Al-'Anani] No. As you remember, in all the meetings of the  Arab cordon states in Beirut, Amman, Cairo, and Damascus it was  stressed that it is possible for one track to move faster that  the others, but there should be coordination and all sides must  agree to the final results. In fact, as you know, all tracks  are mobile; no track is fully dormant, neither the Palestinian  nor the Syrian. But the results depend on the subjects being  discussed. If progress is made on any of the tracks, especially  the Jordanian track, we believe it will positively affect  progress on other tracks. This is especially true since the  Jordanians obtained an Israeli recognition that the cease-fire  border is not the permanent one. The exchange of land for peace  is the deal sought by all the Arab parties, especially since  they all proceed from Security Council Resolution 242, which  calls for the return of the land in exchange for peace.    [Al-Aswad] Can we say that an agreement on a peace treaty  with Israel is now imminent or expected in the foreseeable  future?    [Al-'Anani] I do not think so. I believe that we made a step  toward that development, but we still have a long way to go  before achieving it, especially if we read the items on the  joint Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The discussions of some  subjects have not started yet.    [Al-Aswad] What are these subjects, Dr. Jawad?    [Al-'Anani] For example, the refugees and the achievement of  comprehensive agreements on all tracks.    [Al-Aswad] Thank you, Dr. Jawad.    [Al-'Anani] You are welcome.</p>

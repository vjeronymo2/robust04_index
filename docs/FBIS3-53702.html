			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Alexandria, 16 Jan (MENA)--Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has praised Egypt's leading  contribution to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and to  Arab reconciliation and solidarity.    Speaking to reporters in Alexandria last night, Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid affirmed that pan-Arabism has not and will not  suffer from a setback as a result of ethnic or regional  fanaticism. Arabs will continue to be Arabs from the ocean to  the Gulf; they will not experience what other ethnic groups,  such as those in former Yugoslavia and Mexico, suffered lately,  he said.    'Abd-al-Majid described today's meeting between Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton as a  very important event. He expects that meeting to help reach a  peaceful settlement and resolve problems between Israel and both  Syria and Lebanon. He affirmed Arab League support for Syria  and Lebanon and underlined the need for Israel to withdraw from  the Golan and south Lebanon.    Touching on Egyptian-Sudanese relations, the secretary  general stressed the need to resolve the two countries' border  dispute through dialogue. He said that Egypt is eager to have  good relations with Sudan and to preserve Sudan's unity and  avoid the separation of the south from the north. He remarked  that the problem in southern Sudan requires solution to be  reached through dialogue, while keeping foreign hands off the  region.    Commenting on the Lockerbie issue, 'Abd-al-Majid remarked  that the legal aspects of the case are in Libya's favor, because  it is not obliged to hand over its citizens for trial in another  state with which it has no extradition agreement.  Unfortunately, he said, the political aspect of the case is  dominated by the UN Security Council's escalatory measures. The  risk lies in a possible oil ban against Libya, he remarked.

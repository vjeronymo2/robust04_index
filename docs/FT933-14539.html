			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Standards institute defends quality management benchmark THE BRITISH Standards Institute yesterday attacked critics of BS5750, its controversial quality management standard, and defended its role as a writer of British standards. Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI chairman, said BS5750 was 'a national asset which BSI designed and exported round the world and which has been adopted by more than 20,000 companies in the UK'. Companies which register for BS5750 are required to formalise internal management systems so that a consistent quality is maintained. It has nothing to do with the quality of the product or service and has been criticised by small businesses in particular as being costly and bureaucratic. Mr Thomas said yesterday, at the first of a series of presentations intended to explain the role of BSI, that the BS5750 standard allowed companies to reduce waste, increase productivity and obtain a competitive advantage. 'I want to clear the air because there are a lot of misconceptions about BSI and its terms of reference,' said Mr Thomas. BSI, government subsidies for standards writing and the quality of British standards are being reviewed by the Department of Trade and Industry. As part of its response to criticism of BS5750 BSI issued a policy statement which it said was intended to correct misconceptions about the standard. Organisations certifying compliance with BS5750 must ensure that companies do not misuse their certificates to suggest their products or services have been assessed, it said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shortly before his departure from Ioannina for  Athens today, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed that  Greece continues to defend its national sovereign rights in the  Aegean. Replying to correspondents' questions, Papoulias once  again expressed opposition to the dispatch of Turkish troops to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Begin Papoulias recording] Greece has always defended its  national sovereign rights in the Aegean and this position has  not changed, whether it concerns the state power for the  extension [of territorial waters] to 12 miles, or the air space,  where Greece's positions have been firm since the first PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government. Engaging Balkan  powers in the massacre of the former Yugoslavia causes  additional problems instead of alleviating the situation. The  presence of Turkish forces in Bonsia-Herzegovina indeed makes  things more difficult and, I believe, particularly causes more  tension in the inter-Balkan relations. [end recording]</p>

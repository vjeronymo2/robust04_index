			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / From rich city to Germany's poor-house: David Waller visits Schweinfurt, symbol of a loss of manufacturing industry's competitive edge Within two years the city of Schweinfurt in northern Bavaria has gone from being one of western Germany's most prosperous cities to one of its poorest. From having a surplus of jobs, it now has 17 per cent unemployment, the highest in Bavaria and far above the 8.8 per cent for western Germany as a whole. 'Germany's poor-house' and 'city of Angst' are just two of the labels which have stuck to the small city of 53,000 inhabitants since its troubles attracted the attention of the national media. Schweinfurt, close to the border with the former East Germany, has become a symbol of what can happen when western Germany's manufacturing industry loses its competitive edge. 'The crisis in this city is worse than elsewhere in Germany,' comments Mr Erwin Saal, head of the works' council at FAG Kugelfischer, the big ball-bearings manufacturer which has been the mainstay of employment in the city for more than a century. 'But at the same time it is symptomatic of the hangover German industry has brought upon itself after more than 10 years of unbroken growth. 'In that time wages rose rapidly and the working week became the shortest in the world. As a result we have structural problems overlayed with deep recession - and nowhere in Germany is that more obvious than in Schweinfurt.' The city's past prosperity, and its current problems, are a result of the local economy's dependence on three big employers: Kugelfischer and SKF, two ball-bearings giants, and Fichtel &amp; Sachs, the manufacturer of clutches, shock-absorbers and other vehicle components and which is part of the Mannesmann engineering conglomerate. In the years since the Second World War the three acted as a magnet for employment throughout the Franconia region of northern Bavaria. The city's tax revenues, drawn from the big three's profits, were the largest in the prosperous state of Bavaria after Munich and Ingolstadt. But more recently the big three have suffered - in especially acute form - the combination of high wage costs and the intensified competition from foreign manufacturers that has hit German industry so hard. While the city's tax revenues have vanished, the companies' response to plunging order-books has been a wave of job-cuts on a scale never before seen in Schweinfurt. In the past two years about 7,000 people have lost their jobs. The lay-offs at Kugelfischer have been especially traumatic. Since it came to the brink of collapse in January last year, the family-controlled company has reduced its total employees from 31,000 to 15,700 and sold off 13 subsidiaries. In Schweinfurt the group cut its workforce by 43 per cent, from 8,172 at the end of 1992 to 4,671 at the beginning of February this year. 'Nowhere in Germany has a company gone through so radical a restructuring,' says chief executive Mr Peter-Jurgen Kreher. (The plans for the rationalisation were drawn up by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, more recently called in to sort out Metallgesellschaft, the deeply troubled Frankfurt conglomerate.) Kugelfischer's role as a provider of life-time employment from one generation of Schweinfurters to the next was smashed overnight. 'If someone had said two years ago that Kugelfischer would suffer this kind of fate, you would have been laughed out of court,' reflects Mr Ernst Lang, head of the work's council at the Swedish-owned SKF, where the workforce has shrunk by nearly a quarter to 4,460 in the past two years. 'I still don't think people here in Schweinfurt realise how serious it is. They are hopeful that something will turn up.' Many of those laid off were sent into early retirement and even those who were made redundant received generous pay-offs - in some cases as much as DM150,000 (Pounds 58,365). Mr Lang believes that many in Schweinfurt are suffering from an illusion of prosperity and that the real problems - and real poverty - will emerge in a few years when the pay-outs have been exhausted. 'The rude awakening has yet to come,' agrees Mrs Gudrun Grieser, a former English teacher who has been the city's mayor since 1992. 'I have no illusions: the jobs we have lost by the thousand will only be replaced by the dozen.' She warns about painting the picture too black, praising the skills of the city's well-trained workers and explaining how she has persuaded Bavaria's state government to commit DM100m to promote small business in the Schweinfurt region. 'But the money can't be used - there just aren't enough worthwhile projects to invest in,' she says. The problem for Schweinfurt is that the incentives it can offer to draw new businesses into the region are nowhere near as generous as those on offer in the former East Germany, just 30 miles away. 'After reunification the Ossis (east Germans) used to drive over here in their Trabants looking for jobs,' muses Mr Fritz Glombowski, deputy head of SKF's works' council. 'Soon it'll be the other way round and we'll be commuting to Thuringia.'</p>

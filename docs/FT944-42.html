			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Books: Witness to the fate of the Jews War and Peace (Fact and fiction) KARSKI: HOW ONE MAN TRIED TO STOP THE HOLOCAUST by E. Thomas Wood and Stanislaw M. Japkowski John Wiley New York Dollars 24.95 Jan Karski was a courier for the wartime Polish underground who brought the free world confirmation of the Holocaust. The story of his reception illuminates a squalid corner of Allied conduct during the war. Karski's promising diplomatic career was cut short by war service. When the Polish army collapsed he fled to Russian-occupied eastern Poland where he was interned. He was then shipped deep inside the Soviet Union and would have been murdered, like most Polish officers, had he not concealed his rank and bluffed his way into a shipment of ethnic German Poles repatriated to western Poland. Once home he joined the resistance. Karski's mnemonic and diplomatic gifts made him an ideal courier. After circulating around Nazi-occupied Poland, in January 1940 he travelled secretly to report to the Polish government-in-exile. His account included descriptions of local attitudes towards the Jews, an issue that still divides Jews from Christian Poles. Wood and Jankowski have not written a hagiography, but they present Karski in a favourable light. His report exposed the glee Christian Poles felt towards Jewish suffering, but it also repeated the canard that Jews in eastern Poland had welcomed, and profited from, the Soviet occupation. In fact, Jews greeted the Soviets only because they were preferable to the Nazi's. Before long the communists made Jewish life miserable. This touching-up of Karski's record derogates from later accomplishments. Yet he transcended minor prejudices and attained a lucidity concerning the Jewish question that eluded most Poles. In the summer of 1940 Karski was betrayed to the Gestapo. Savagely beaten, he attempted suicide, fearing that he would break under torture. Salvation came from the underground which freed him, but at a terrible cost. For his third mission he was told to include information on the Jewish plight, so he toured the Warsaw ghetto and was smuggled into a camp holding Jews destined for gassing at Belzec. Shattered by these encounters, he gladly carried Jewish pleas for Allied action to stop the slaughter. Despite the sensational title of the book, by the time he reached London in November 1942, the Allies had received decisive information from Jewish sources about the genocide. But Karski was not a Jew and his electrifying reports propelled the ambivalent Polish exile regime into demanding a response. Nevertheless, foreign office officials suspected the Poles of exploiting the news. Eden dismissed Karski's suggestions for concrete measures, while Lord Selbourne, head of SOE, compared his report to first world war atrocity propaganda. Jewish leaders in Britain and America were also sceptical. Felix Frankfurter, a US Supreme Court judge, told Karski bluntly, 'I am unable to believe you'. Karski's greatest success was a long interview with Roosevelt which may have spurred the President towards the creation of the War Refugees Board, which eventually helped thousands of Jews. Mostly, Karski was a prisoner of the government-in-exile, manipulated according to its desperate efforts to stave off Stalin's territorial demands. Indeed, much of Wood and Jankowski's narrative concerns Karski's role in this diplomatic struggle. Activism on behalf of the Jews was really incidental to his work. When the war ended, Karski was a prosperous exile in New York. He wrote a best-seller based on his experiences, but his fame paled as quickly as interest in the fate of the Jews. He enjoyed a brief revival as an anti-communist serving the State Department and the CIA - a period which the authors skate over suspiciously. The disillusioned hero resigned himself to silence. There is a bitter-sweetness about the fame that has come to him since he was 'discovered' by Elie Wiesel and Claude Lanzmann, who used Karski for his film Shoah. Huge audiences now pack halls to hear him speak, but 50 years ago few heeded his message.</p>

At the conference,  the leaders in charge of literary and artistic work, persons in  charge of literary and art departments, and old and new writers  and artists were gathered together and conscientiously studied  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art and  Chairman Jiang's important instructions on Army literary and art  work. They discussed how to make Army literary and art work  flourish, obtained a clearer understanding of the situation,  confirmed the orientation, specified the tasks, and boosted  confidence. CMC Chairman Jiang, Vice Chairman Zhang, and other  leading comrades had a cordial meeting with the deputies to the  conference. Chairman Jiang gave an important instruction, which  was the greatest encouragement and spur for the literary and art  workers Army-wide.    In pace with the reform and opening up and the vigorous  strides of the overall building of the Army in the new era,  gratifying achievements have been made in the Army's literary  and art work. Many excellent works that are ideologically sound,  refined in taste, and artistically valuable have been created in  literature, dramas, films, television programs, songs, dances,  acrobatics, quyi [collective term for folk art forms including  ballad singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks,  and cross talks], and fine arts. They have exerted an extensive  influence in and outside the Army and on cultural exchanges with  other countries. The old, middle-aged, and young literary and  art workers helped each other make progress and a batch of  outstanding, young, and talented people have shown themselves,  reinforcing the contingent of writers and artists. The broad  ranks of literary and art workers went to the grass-roots levels  with full enthusiasm. They created works and gave performances  for soldiers and were accorded warm welcome. The cultural  facilities at the grass-roots levels have been constantly  improved and the cultural life at the company level has been  enhanced. The CPC Central Committee and the CMC have paid close  attention to, and been very concerned with, the Army literary  and art work. Recently, Chairman Jiang pointed out: "In  strengthening the Army's building of spiritual civilization, it  is imperative to make energetic efforts to advocate healthy,  uplifting, inspiring, and colorful cultural life in the  barracks." The Army literary and art workers should "take pains  to sing the praises of the new people, new things, and new  habits in the Army; provide them with more spiritual food that  is both educational and well accepted by the broad ranks of  officers and men; and make new contributions to the building of  socialist spiritual civilization and enhancement of the Army's  fighting capabilities." "Our army should play a better role as  pacesetter in the building of spiritual civilization and move  ahead in the forefront of the society." To this end, the Army  literature and art must conform to the circumstances and  development, as well as the ever-rising demand of the broad  ranks of officers and men on their cultural life, and develop  and flourish to a greater extent. This is the expectation of  the party and the people and the call of our times and history.    In making Army literature and art flourish, the most  important link is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on  literature and art as the fundamental model. Deng Xiaoping's  thinking on literature and art is an important component of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It  is very rich in content and is highly creative and practical.  On the basis of inheriting and developing Mao Zedong's thinking  on literature and art, it scientifically sums up the experience  of our party in guiding the literary and art work in the past  decades. It is a concrete embodiment of the party's basic line  in the literary and artistic sector, it clearly points out the  direction for the development of socialist literary and art  undertakings in the new historical period, it answers the many  new questions facing the literary and art work in the new era,  and it is the very basis on which we can do a good job in the  Army's literary and art work. We should unify our thinking,  equip ourselves mentally, and guide our practice with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art so that we can  grasp better the laws and trends of the Army literature and art  in the new historical context and enable the Army literature and  art to develop and flourish in the correct direction.    Encouraging the main theme is required of Army literature  and  art in our times and an important premise and basic orientation  of the Army literature and art for making the reinvigoration  possible. In this great epoch we are in now, the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, the  glorious practice and creative spirit of the masses in the  reform, opening up, and modernization, and the traditional  virtues of the Chinese nation constitute the main theme that  promotes social development and the progress of our nation. Our  literary and artistic creation and performance should accurately  grasp today's spirit, profoundly reflect the nature and  mainstream of the real life, and sing praises of the excellent  quality and brilliant achievements that the soldiers and  civilians of our country have displayed in the great cause. In  the meantime, we should strive to improve artistic quality and,  through lifelike, vivid, and moving artistic images and  different styles of expression, impart not only a powerful  ideological persuasiveness, but also a strong artistic appeal to  the works that encourage the main theme, so as to arouse the  enthusiasm and creativity of the broad ranks of cadres and men  in making a good job of Army building and reform.    In promoting the development and flourishing of Army  literature and art, it is necessary to put the focus on the  creation and performance of works on military topics. The  dignity of the country, the soul of the nation, and the spirit  of the people are often more clearly manifested in the Army.  The works on military topics have a special educational,  encouraging, and spurring effect. Army writers and artists  should explore this field of topics in great depth, draw  artistic inspiration from deep within the history of the  revolutionary wars and the fiery struggles in reality,  emancipate the mind, make bold explorations, and make continuous  innovations, express their deep insight and penetrating  judgments on history, society, and life from various aspects,  levels, and perspectives, create the images of today's soldiers  with distinct characteristics of the times, and help the  creation and performance of works on military topics to flourish.    To make Army literature and art flourish, it is imperative  to  build a contingent of writers and artists who are ideologically  and politically sound and have high professional quality. The  contingent of writers and artists in the Army has a glorious  revolutionary tradition and enjoys a high reputation among the  general public. In the new historical context, it is necessary  to keep strengthening the building of professional ethics,  conscientiously resist the influence of money worship,  out-and-out individualism, and decadent life-style, establish a  correct outlook on life and values, work diligently, quietly  dedicate oneself, and make oneself worthy of the title of  engineer of the soul. They should constantly temper themselves  and improve their artistic and cultural understanding,  consistently go into life and maintain a flesh-and-blood  relationship with the masses and the broad ranks of officers and  men, so as to absorb strength from them extensively and inspire  their own creativity. The leaders at various levels should show  concern and care for literary and artistic workers in political  terms, in ideology, in professional activities, and in daily  life, and give maximum play to their wisdom and artistic  talents, so that the contingent of writers and artists in our  Army will always maintain a vibrant life force and vigorous  vitality.    The ultimate objective for making Army literature and art  flourish is to bring up a generation of revolutionary soldiers  "with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of  discipline," to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual  civilization, and to enhance the Army's fighting capabilities.  Therefore, we should not only build well the professional  contingent of writers and artists, but also pay close attention  to the guidance for the mass cultural and entertainment  activities in the barracks. While holding fast to high standards  and cultured taste, it is imperative to ensure the regularity  and institutionalization of the spare-time cultural activities  of the troops, conduct such activities as watching movies and  television, entertainment, reading, and sports extensively, and  make the cultural life in barracks colorful, down-to-earth, and  effective.    The CPC Central Committee and the CMC set great store by the  flourishing of Army literature and art. The broad ranks of  officers and men and the masses place high hopes on the Army  writers and artists. The cause is a glorious one, whereas the  task is heavy and the road is long. Let us unite as one, forge  ahead with a trailblazing spirit, and open up a new prospect of  greater flourishing in the army literature and art with creative  work and rich fruits.</p>

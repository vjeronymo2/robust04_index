			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> 2 MORE BUSINESSES 'ADOPT' CITY SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Two La Habra businesses have become the latest to join a partnership to help  support local schools. Leisure Manor and Landmark Bank have "adopted" the  Walnut and El Cerritos schools, respectively.  </P> <P> Awards were presented to representatives from each business by the Board of  Trustees for the La Habra City School District earlier this week.  </P> <P> Walnut School Principal Pat Miller thanked the retirement home for its support.  </P> <P> "They told us that they would like to host a party for us on Halloween, so we  had a party at the Manor," she said.  </P> <P> Other joint efforts have included a poster contest and visits to the school  each week by eight volunteers from Leisure Manor.  </P> <P> Among support activities provided to El Cerritos School by Landmark Bank are  coloring books and crayons promoting Halloween safety, a supply of candy for  monthly assemblies, balloons for student of the month awards and the  presentation of a Christmas tree.  </P> <P> "We never had (a tree) at El Cerritos. It's in the cafeteria, and we're ready  to decorate it. It's just gorgeous," said El Cerritos Principal Myrna Close.  </P> <P> Pat Rau, senior bank vice president, said plans for additional support include  volunteer work at the school, hosting luncheons for teachers and providing  funds for special projects.  </P> <P> Board member Morrison Clements expressed delight that local businesses have  offered to help improve the quality of education for young students.  </P> <P> "There's a relationship between the kids in the school and activities in the  community," he said.

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS '90;  </P> <P> PROFILING THE NEWCOMERS  </P> <P> SCOTT BAILES  </P> <P> Age: 27  </P> <P> Position: Pitcher  </P> <P> Major league experience: Four years  </P> <P> How obtained: Acquired from Cleveland in exchange for infielder Jeff Manto and  pitcher Colin Charland, Jan. 9, 1990.  </P> <P> Pertinent stats: Has a career 31-41 record and 4.70 earned-run average in four  seasons at Cleveland, where he was a starter and reliever.  </P> <P> Comments: If Bailes can pitch against other teams the way he pitched against  the Angels last season, the left-hander will be a valuable addition. Bailes  struggled against most opponents, but had little trouble with the Angels,  allowing one earned run and striking out eight in 13 innings for a 2-0 record.  General Manager Mike Port says Bailes, primarily a fastball-curveball pitcher,  has shown flashes of brilliance this spring, but he needs to become more  consistent. It appears his role will be middle to long relief.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> NEW FIESTA DAYS PARADE ROUTE OKD  </P> <P> City Council members voted last week to change the route of the city's annual  Fiesta Days Parade and Street Faire, removing the event from Main Street and  placing it on a stretch of Yorba Linda Boulevard running past the Nixon Library  and Birthplace.  </P> <P> The decision was made in response to a request by the Yorba Linda Service  League, a volunteer group that has organized the parade for 22 years.  </P> <P> Some city residents and representatives of the Main Street Merchants' Assn.  protested the proposal, but the council backed it unanimously.  </P> <P> Representatives of the merchants' association said they failed to come to a  compromise with members of the league that would allow the parade to remain in  the old town area of Main Street while still running past the library.  </P> <P> "We never thought the parade should be just on Main Street," association member  Leo Riley said. "But the Main Streets of America are disappearing. This is  another nail in the coffin."  </P> <P> Council member Henry W. Wedaa was sympathetic. "Personally, I think Main Street  is the place for it to be," he said.  </P> <P> "But we owe a debt to (the Yorba Linda Service League) for putting on this  parade for some years," he added, noting that the league has faced problems  holding the parade on Main Streeta and arguing that its request for relocating  the event should be honored.  </P> <P> Suzanne Miller, a representative of the service league, said her group  requested the change because the old route requires closing Imperial Highway  and does not pass by the library.  </P> <P> The council agreed to shift the parade route for this year to Yorba Linda  Boulevard, where it will run between Casa Loma Avenue and Park Place.

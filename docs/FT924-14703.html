			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ball takes Smith Barney post MR George Ball, the former Prudential-Bache chairman, returned to Wall Street yesterday after a long absence when he was appointed to a top post at broking house Smith Barney, Harris Upham. Mr Ball, 53, is joining the firm's executive committee and board of directors. He will be filling a newly-created post of senior executive vice-president with responsibility for developing the marketing strategy for Smith Barney's high net-worth individual investor services, a cornerstone of the broking house's business. The position is likely to have been created to exploit Mr Ball's reputation as an effective salesman and leader of retail brokers, built up during almost 30 years working first at E. F Hutton, and then at Pru-Bache. Mr Ball's appointment at Smith Barney, part of the diversified financial conglomerate Primerica, comes more than a year and a half after his troubled and controversial nine-year reign at Pru-Bache came to an abrupt end with his resignation in February 1991. During his tenure at Pru-Bache (now renamed Prudential Securities), the securities house ran up heavy losses as the ambitious chairman tried to turn the company into one of Wall Street's most powerful firms. Mr Ball's attempt to build a major presence in investment banking, his luring of Wall Street professionals from rival firms with large pay packets, and the aggressive selling to investors of limited property partnerships, proved particularly costly. Today, Prudential Insurance, the parent company of Pru Securities, still faces scores of lawsuits from angry investors who lost millions of dollars on limited partnerships sold by the broking house in the 1980s. After his departure from Pru-Bache, Mr Ball worked as a consultant to an investment management firm and as chairman of a small finance house. CS First Boston (Japan) plans to strengthen its yen fixed-income sales and trading department, including the hiring of more staff. The securities firm wants to increase sales to institutional and regional investors in Japan, as well as foreign investors. To achieve this, the firm intends to improve its research efforts and hire more traders in Tokyo. Currently there are 35 people working in the firm's yen fixed-income department in Tokyo.</p>

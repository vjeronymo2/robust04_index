			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham -- punctuation as published] </F>   [Excerpt] Following UN envoy Cyrus Vance's meeting with  Andonios Exarkhos, the Greek permanent UN representative, the  Athens-Skopje dialogue is being reactivated. Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias confirmed this late last night and mentioned  that the meeting was held last Friday [14 January], and that the  Greek ambassador conveyed the Greek positions.    AS ELEVTHEROTIPIA reported late last week, Vance asked to  meet the Greek side for a new discussion on Skopje. Last  Friday's meeting is the first visible move by the special  mediator to examine the possibility of resuming the dialogue,  either directly or through the United Nations.  <H5>  He Confirmed </H5>   It is recalled that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  last week expressed both officially and unofficially the UN  intention to move the issue again (following Papoulias' letter  postponing the dialogue). So far, Vance has not commented.    Lord Owen, the international mediator on the Yugoslav issue,  arrived in Athens yesterday afternoon and fully confirmed UN  moves on Skopje. Although Skopje is not among the issues he is  handling, Owen (who last year was a mediator on Skopje) said:  "...As you know, the UN secretary general asked Vance to  facilitate, if he can, any dialogue either through the UN  process or through direct talks between Athens and Skopje...."  With this statement, Lord Owen confirmed that "something is  going on" within the UN to resume the talks but presented two  alternative solutions: either through the United Nations or  through direct talks.    Some of the media misinterpreted Owen's remarks, initially  giving the impression that the mediator on the Yugoslav issue  "was revealing" that a "secret dialogue" or secret diplomacy  between Athens and Skopje existed. During their joint news  conference, Owen clarified his remarks, saying: "I do not  believe there is a secret dialogue.... I mentioned two  alternative solutions, direct talks or talks through the United  Nations." He did not hide his preference for direct talks.    For his part, Papoulias stressed: "There are no secret or  behind-the-scenes negotiations." He reiterated the well-known  Greek position and stressed that Greece is ready to accept a  move from [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov's side (about the  flag, symbols, constitution) before the talks can resume.

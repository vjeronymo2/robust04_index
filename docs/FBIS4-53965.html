			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- A breakthrough in deadlocked  trade "framework" talks between Japan and the United States is  looming large, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro  Hata said Tuesday.    With time left for discussion running out, both parties have  basically agreed to get the stalled talks on establishing a new  framework for bilateral trade back on a track, Hata told a press  conference.    Hata said Japanese and U.S. delegates at subcabinet-level  talks in Washington are now working on the final wording of key  points that have divided the two parties since the framework  talks ruptured in February.    If the delegates reach specific accords on resuming the  trade  talks, that would lead to an early meeting of the leaders of the  two countries for a final breakthrough in the negotiations, Hata  said.    But Hata declined to speculate when issues hampering a  restart of the trade talks will be cleared. He denied reports  that it would be "in one or two days."    In Washington, the unofficial trade negotiations entered a  fourth day, with the sticking point being how to define earlier  agreed "objective criteria" as a way to gauge U.S. access to  Japanese markets.    "We are working on final wording of such a term so that it  can be defined in a mutually acceptable manner," Hata said.    The talks to establish a new bilateral trade framework broke  down when Japan rejected a U.S. demand for using "numerical  targets" as objective criteria during the February summit  between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    In search of a breakthrough in the talks, Washington made  three new proposals to Japan in April on three areas --  objective criteria, overall goals of the framework talks and  macroeconomic policy measures.    Heading the Japanese team at the Washington talks are  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry  minister for International affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy  foreign minister for economic affairs. They are believed to  have given Japan's reply to the three U.S. proposals.</p>

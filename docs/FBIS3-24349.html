			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, aide to the president for </F> national security affairs, by Andrey Uglanov and Pavel  Lukyanchenko, under the "Exclusively for the Readers of  ARGUMENTY I FAKTY" rubric; in the Kremlin, date not given: "Yu.  Baturin: `The Anonymous Author Is Being Sought'"]    [Text] Following a storm of rumors and reports about  a "conspiracy" against the president, we sought comments from  Yuriy Baturin, the aide to the president for national security  affairs.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, information about  the  "coup" began to reach the editorial office as early as 6 March.  Later on, a confidential document appeared, which was  subsequently, a week later, published in the newspapers. What  are the reasons for the appearance of this paper? Are you taking  any actions?    [Baturin] This is perhaps the most public of all secret  conspiracies of which I am aware. This is precisely why the  attitude toward it is not that of one toward a conspiracy, but  just that toward a certain political performance aimed at  poisoning the atmosphere and creating an environment of  suspicion.    Two scenarios are possible in this instance. The first  scenario: One of those who thirst for power felt that he had  revealed himself more than necessary. In this case, more smoke  should be blown, as many people as possible should be named, and  when this list has become sufficiently absurd in terms of the  number of names and their combinations, then any other name will  also be obscured on it--this is the smokescreen scenario.    Here is the second scenario. This work is a product of an  overactive investigative imagination. When there are some signs  of feeble encroachments on power, a person assesses them and  arranges them in certain patterns: What could this be? Later,  all of them fit together for the person and grow in volume.  Subsequently, this person himself compiles such a paper and  circulates it as extensively as possible, for example, in order  to bring this to the attention of the people who, for some  reason, do not see these "obvious" conspiracy patterns.    The letter is passed from hand to hand in Moscow; radio, TV,  and newspapers discuss it. Figuratively speaking, the author  sets a house on fire in order to light up its dark nooks and  perhaps banish goblins from it. Such techniques cannot be used  in our situation, which is quite unstable to begin with. After  all, the house would burn down at the same time.    Now about the things that are being done. Everything is  being  done that should be done: Special services and law enforcement  organs are looking for the anonymous author. This is precisely  what it is called. Once he is found, it will be possible to  raise the issue of filing criminal charges, the elements of  crime being slander associated with the charge of committing a  grave crime against the state.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] However, this episode coincided with the  Internal Troops being drawn up to Moscow.    [Baturin] When there are troops, the Army, any other  coercive  structures, they live and move. There is normal life, exercises,  redeployment, regrouping. Or would you like all of them to  freeze, so that nobody would think that they are up to  something? However, all of this may be perceived with suspicion,  that is, in keeping with the models of overactive consciousness.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why does the attending physician of the  president not make an official presentation somewhere?    [Baturin] The health condition of a patient (good or bad)  constitutes a physician's secret. If the president does not want  bulletins about his health, even if good, released on a monthly  basis, he is entitled to this.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] This is done in other countries.    [Baturin] Other countries have a different political  culture.  I do not want to say that ours is worse; no, it is just  different. Nor does it appear possible to change a political  culture for the country, say, effective Monday.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Much has been said to the effect that  this is not even about the president, but rather about somehow  discrediting V. Chernomyrdin. One may hear about certain  financial and industrial groups that are envious of Gazprom. The  concern has become quite influential, perhaps, with some  assistance from V. Chernomyrdin. It is tempting to occupy this  niche and to collect the same dividend.    [Baturin] I do not want to comment on your hypothesis in any  way. It does not quite touch on this letter. However, if you are  putting together versions of this kind, we must say that in this  case, absolutely improper means are being used. We should then  acknowledge that at issue are people who are acting improperly.  You are perhaps aware of what this is.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Could the letter have been initiated by  people close to the president, as an electrical shock of sorts?  Recently, he has withdrawn from current business, in a way....    [Baturin] This question fits within the second hypothesis  which I have already outlined for you. However, I for one am not  aware of such people in the entourage of the president. This is  why I would like not to make such assumptions about the  presidential entourage. As far as I know, such methods are not  used here.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Is the September edict on the early  election of the president on 12 June 1994 still in force?    [Baturin] In December, an edict of the president was issued  which canceled quite a number of his own edicts and certain  legislative acts before the new Constitution took effect. The  edict that you have mentioned did not appear on the list of the  canceled edicts. However, let us not forget about the  transitional provisions of the Constitution in effect in keeping  with which the president exercises his powers until the end of  the term to which he was elected.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] To tell you the truth, we wrote a  commentary on the topic of the "conspiracy." Here is its text:    We can surmise the following. In early March (according  to some data, on the evening of 6 March), the people "at the  top" learned about a certain discrediting action which the  opponents of the president intended to carry out on 9 March. A  meeting of "a narrow circle" was immediately convened, at which  it was decided not only to avert the planned action of the  opposition, but also to strike their own preemptive blow.  Special services were instructed to collect by way of operations  compromising evidence available at the time against the most  "blameworthy" politicians, that is, those who openly crave the  office of the president. The compromising evidence included both  "unguarded statements" of these persons, published in the press,  which testified to their angling for the "position," and  information obtained from informants who were present during the  relevant confidential conversations. All of this information was  "chewed over" by a group of analysts, assumed the form of a  noncommittal "Version No. 1" which will be superseded by  subsequent versions, and disseminated among the members of the  State Duma, journalists, and party leaders by means of a fax  machine (belonging, as they say, to the Dinamo society). Just so  that there would be no telltale signs and so as to cover up and  prevent suspicions as to its genuine source of origin, one or  two individuals loyal to the president were thrown in and in the  second part, the Ministry of Defense "tag" was "attached" to  "authentic" information confirmed 100 percent by materials from  the special services.    Upon what did the creators of this "Version No. 1"  count? Apparently, on killing three birds with one stone. First,  on letting potential "conspirators" know that the eye of the  sovereign is alert and is aware of their apparent and concealed  intentions (for the most part, individuals appear on the list  who remain in the shadows and do not advertise their views very  much). Second, on creating for the people a new image of the  "enemy" who hampers the reform course with all his might and on  learning about the public sentiment. Third, on shaking up the  president by showing him that not everything is good in the  "Danish kingdom" and that it is time to become active.    [Baturin] This is a very far-fetched version. I can say that  I do not know anything about such a meeting; I did not  participate in such a meeting or give assignments. Therefore, a  choice should be made: Either the aide for national security  affairs does not belong to the circle that decides such things,  or this did not happen. Thousands of people work here. Even if  three people did talk about something, you might call it a  meeting, and I might call it just chatter. Nonetheless, I have  not heard about anything of the kind.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   The competent organs are establishing whether the  removal of the president was being prepared. However, changes  have occurred in the Kremlin. At the entrance, the guard  demanded that the operation of a dictaphone be demonstrated,  inspected the tape, and asked whether we had weapons. Quite  recently, it was simpler.</p>

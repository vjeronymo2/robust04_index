			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Is Shkoder Going"] </F>   [Text] Another blood score has been recorded in Shkoder,  as if the 150 people who are besieged in their homes, sheltered  from feuds started in their fathers' times, and possibly even  their unremembered grandfathers', were not enough. These 150  families owe blood under the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. They expect  nothing from the laws of this state. The state does not protect  them. This state throws them on welfare and leaves them under  siege, including their children and associates. This state is  paralyzed, humbled by the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. Meanwhile, the  family of Gjovalin Cekini has a blood score to settle with the  government. They expect the judiciary to respond to the crime  before they heed the call to arms of their ancestors, the  weapons of the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. The government, after  all, has the chance to triumph over Lek showing that it is no  longer the government of 2 April [1991] that murdered by night  and shed tears by day. It has an opportunity to avert one more  murder. It has the opportnity to remove the checkpoint on  Bahcellek bridge, over which criminals enter and leave Shkoder.  It has the opportunity to rescue Shkoder from isolation from  the rest of Albania, as if we were in the time of the  principality of Kara Mahmut Bushatlliu. Shkoder is becoming  isolated. Caught up in the spider's web of the embargo, the  city is writhing in agony and devouring its own citizens. It  was corruption and the representatives of corruption in Shkoder,  tension, and the absence of a political breathing space that  murdered Gjovaiin Cekini. It was the logic of Kara Mdhmut  Buchatlliu in the mouths of oil smugglers and the smugglers of  infants, that called Shkoder the citadel of the Democrats. Once  it was the citadel of the Communists, and before that it was a  principality, before Albania existed, although it was Albanian  before the principality existed. The language of the party  faithful is sending Shkoder back in time, toward experiences of  this kind, inexorably shifting the barrier of the embargo from  Han i Hotit to Bahcellek bridge [from the Albanian-Montenegrin  border to the southern entrance to the City of Shkoder],  separating the city from Albania. This kind of talk calls for  aid from the phantom of Lek Dukagjio. Quo vadis Scutari?  Shkoder, where are you going?</p>

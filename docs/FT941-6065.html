			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities What threatened to be a nasty bang for UK equities turned into an uncomfortable whimper. After yesterday's 22.5 point fall, though, the FT-SE 100 index stands 8 per cent below the peak reached a month ago. Whether that can be dismissed as a healthy correction or marks the begining of a bear phase now turns on developments in the bond markets, not just in Germany. Given the fog that surrounds US monetary policy following Tuesday's data, investors might be forgiven for feeling thoroughly unsighted. Even if bond markets did now recover some poise, these issues will not be resolved quickly. While a yield ratio of around two hardly suggests that UK equities are overvalued when judged against gilts, any further rise in bond yields would doubtless spill over. The main comfort must be that - as the Treasury's monthly monetary report yesterday confirmed - the domestic inflation indicators remain unthreatening. But neither is it easy to argue that UK equities are cheap in their own right. The market's reluctance to see the FT-SE 100 below 3,200 yesterday points to some support at this level. Yet a multiple of around 15 times this year's forecast earnings still demands an optimistic view of profits growth. The results season has offered some encouragement. The worry must now be that higher real long-term interest rates will undermine recovery in Europe and profits growth in the UK.</p>

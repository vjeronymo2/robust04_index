			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Government Cannot Feel Relieved With the FRB's </F> Raising of Official Discount Rate"]    [Text] As currency exchange markets have anticipated, the  Federal Reserve Board [FRB], in a brief announcement on 17 May,  said it will raise the official discount rate by 0.5 percentage  point for the first time in five years and three months. We  would like to applaud the raising of the key interest rate as an  expression of the FRB's effort to fend off any inflation spiral  and keep the dollar from further falling in value.    In response, dollars were supposed to be bought on the Tokyo  Foreign Exchange Market, but they were sold instead, sending the  dollar further down in its value against the yen. The market,  which already anticipated a rise in the key U.S. interest rate,  responded calmly to it. This phenomenon shows the existence of  a long-held view that no change will occur in the trend of the  strong yen and the weak dollar as long as Japan's huge current  account surplus, which hit an all-time high of $130 billion in  1993, is not reduced drastically.    The government cannot feel relieved because the United  States  has moved to halt a slide in the international value of the  dollar by intervening in foreign exchange markets and raising  the official discount rate. It is important for the government  to speedily recover the economy by making further efforts to  expand domestic demand and open the Japanese market. The Bank  of Japan should urge banks to further lower their interest rates  on loans by taking measures to drive down interest rates on  financial markets.    The FRB decided to raise the official discount rate in line  with the policy coordination agreed upon at the meeting of the  G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors.    The currency authorities of Japan, the United States, and  European nations intervened in foreign exchange markets to buy  dollars in a an effort to halt a further slide in the  international value of the dollar when the dollar fell early  this month. With Germany and other European nations lowering  their interest rates and the United States raising the official  discount rate, the G-7 industrialized nations have now made it  clear that they will intervene in currency markets to "prevent  the dollar from further falling in value."    The U.S. Government, which has so far adopted the policy of  reducing its trade deficit with Japan by promoting further  appreciation of the yen, recently adopted a new policy of  keeping the dollar from falling in its value against other major  foreign currencies because of its domestic financial situation.    In the United States, long-term interest rates sharply rose  for fear that the heated economy might trigger inflation,  throwing cold water on the economy and causing a fall in the  international value of the dollar. The weak dollar raises  concerns over inflation and keeps the long-term interest rates  high. If this spiral of the weak dollar and inflation continues  unchecked, it would undermine the U.S. economy.    The recent raising of the official interest rate, aimed to  shift the U.S. heated economy to a moderate one, will keep the  recession from making a comeback although it may somewhat impede  the economy's expansion. The U.S. economy cannot keep growing at  a rate of 7 percent that was registered last fall as long as the  heavy pressure from the federal budget deficit is not removed.    The foundation of the Clinton administration, which was  inaugurated on a platform of giving priority to cutting the  federal budget deficit, appears to be shaking and this concerns  us. President Clinton's leadership is waning in the wake of the  "Whitewater scandal" and at stake is his plan to get Congress to  pass a bill on medical reform that holds the key to reducing the  federal budget deficit in the long term.    If the U.S. Government raises the official discount rate and  rebuilds the current fiscal structure to cut the federal budget  deficit, this would keep the long-term interest rates at a  stable level and help the economy grow for a long period.    Japan must not forget the role it must play. Japan should  seriously work on reducing its current account surplus  regardless of what the United States thinks. Japan will  consistently repel pressure from the United States for  appreciating the yen. If Japan seeks to take advantage of the  U.S. economy's recovery to boost exports to that country for  growth, this would backfire and only result in a further  appreciation of the yen.    The Hata government was formed by political parties that  held  a minority in the Diet, but many opposition parties are not  supposed to oppose promoting the deregulation. We hope that the  Hata government will work on mapping out a set of measures to  turn the Japanese market into a new market by opening it up to  foreign goods and services after brushing aside resistance from  bureaucrats and interest groups. The reform of the tax system  aimed at perpetuating tax cuts is losing momentum. The  discussion of how to reform the tax system should be resumed at  the earliest date.    Japan is being asked to expand domestic demand speedily and  turn the Japanese market into a world market at a time when the  U.S. economy is decelerating and European nations are showing a  slow economic recovery. That is the way for Japan to shore up  the world economy and keep the yen's exchange rate stable.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: Italtel in Greek mobile phone deal ITALTEL, the Italian state-controlled telephone equipment group, and Ericsson Fatme, the Italian subsidiary of Ericsson of Sweden, have won a L100bn (Pounds 41.4m) order to supply mobile telephone equipment for the new second network in Greece. The concession to operate the Greek system, based on the new GSM standard, was won by the Italian state-controlled Stet telecommunications group last August. Stet is also the main shareholder in Italtel. Italtel and Ericsson will supply Stet-Hellas, Stet's Greek operation, with a full turnkey mobile communications package over the next two years. The contract envisages preliminary coverage of the main areas of demand, notably Athens and Salonica, in the country within the first year. The network will be subsequently expanded gradually to cover most of the Greek mainland and the main islands. Saipem, the drilling and construction subsidiary of Italy's Eni state energy and chemicals group, has won a contract worth over L200bn to lay an undersea gas pipeline in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and the Hainan oil fields. The 707km pipeline, commissioned by the US Arco oil group, will supply gas for electricity generation in Hong Kong. Saipem said the deal had helped push new orders in the first four months of this year to L678bn, slightly ahead of the L650bn in the same period last year. The company has recovered sharply in the past year from the crisis in the industry, with turnover of about L2,000bn in 1992, allowing a return to profits after three consecutive years of losses.</p>

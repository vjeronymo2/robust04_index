			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: CALL HIM ALMOST ANYTHING, JUST DON'T CALL HIM DR. DEATH  </P> <P> Team doctor Robert Albo of Golden State is known as one of the NBA's more vocal  referee-baiters, and he was pouring it on at a recent game between the Warriors  and the Seattle SuperSonics at Oakland.  </P> <P> "Terrible call, terrible call!" Albo shouted at referee Joey Crawford.  </P> <P> Crawford looked over, saw who it was, and shouted, "You bury your mistakes."  </P> <P> Add officials: From NBA Commissioner David Stern: "I read the box scores from  the bottom up -- attendance, technicals. Oh, God, six technicals. Was that Earl  Strom again?"  </P> <P> Just asking: When you watched the NFL Today show with Brent Musburger, Jimmy  (the Greek) Snyder, Phyllis George and Irv Cross, would you have guessed that  Cross would outlast them all?  </P> <P> Are you ready?: USA Today oddsmaker Danny Sheridan already has picked the final  four for 1990-91. He tabs Indiana, Alabama, Connecticut and Arkansas, with  Indiana winning it all.  </P> <P> Still hungry: Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas say they'll  both be back next season to try for a second NCAA title.  </P> <P> "We both promised that," Augmon said. "I told Larry, 'Don't you run off and  leave me.' "  </P> <P> Trivia time: Over the last nine seasons, who is the only major league player to  hit 20 or more home runs every year?  </P> <P> They're unique: After Northern Iowa made it to the NCAA playoffs, Herb Strentz,  professor of journalism at Drake University, wrote in The Des Moines Register:  </P> <P> "Even in Iowa, the fun of having Northern Iowa in the NCAA prompts the thought  that, if memory serves, Northern Iowa is the state's only Division I school  that didn't have a basketball player arrested this year and the state's only  Division 1 school that hasn't had an athlete arrested in the last couple of  years for beating up a woman."  </P> <P> Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Said Cleveland Browns' owner Art Modell, recalling  that the first TV contract the NFL signed in 1963 was worth $332,000 a year to  each team: "Our kicking tees cost us that much now."  </P> <P> Daddy knew: Boston Red Sox batting coach Richie Hebner, son of an undertaker,  reflects on his playing career: "I was on eight teams that made the playoffs  and we lost seven of them. I led the league in turning in World Series tickets.  As soon as my father heard we made the playoffs, he knew I'd be home in a week  digging graves."  </P> <P> A masterpiece: From Richard Justice of the Washington Post: "After making a  Willie Mays catch against Julio Franco of the Texas Rangers last week,  Pittsburgh Pirates' outfielder Andy Van Slyke said, 'That's a  once-in-a-five-year catch. All the elements were there. The only thing it  lacked was importance.' "  </P> <P> Dana's Point: From reserve guard Dana Barros of the Seattle SuperSonics: "We  have made so many changes this year that we have adjusted to making  adjustments."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Dwight Evans of the Boston Red Sox.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Oakland Athletics' outfielder Rickey Henderson, on how he kept in  shape during the lockout: "I watched aerobics on TV."

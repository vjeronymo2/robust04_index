			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL SUPT. SAYS FOE'S LOAN ILLEGAL  </P> <P> County Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson on Thursday accused one of his  opponents, John F. Dean, of illegally accepting a $20,000 loan from his  parents.  </P> <P> Dean, 63, a Whittier College professor, accepted the loan from his father,  James H. Dean of Cucamonga, on April 24, according to campaign financial  disclosure forms released by Peterson at a press conference in the Santa Ana  Hall of Administration.  </P> <P> The loan was $19,000 above the legal limit of $1,000 per fiscal year on  campaign contributions from individuals, corporations and partnerships under  Proposition 73.  </P> <P> "We have a candidate here that hasn't complied with the law and far exceeded  what the limits are," said Peterson, 69, who is seeking an unprecedented  seventh four-year term in Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> Peterson said that officials of his reelection campaign committee have notified  the state Fair Political Practices Commission of the alleged violation, but  added that he does not expect the commission to rule on Dean's finances in time  for the election.  </P> <P> Dean, reached at his Newport Beach home, said that members of his campaign  committee found the law to be unclear on contributions from relatives and  accepted the loan. But when told of the FPPC's general conclusions on loans to  campaign committees, Dean conceded that "it was a loan I should not have  accepted."  </P> <P> "We checked with a couple of people who ought to know (about the finance laws)  and they didn't know," Dean said. "We didn't give it a second thought. If have  to turn around and return the check, I will."  </P> <P> FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku would not comment on Peterson's allegation,  but said that Proposition 73 limits contributions to campaign committees from  all sources except from a candidate's personal funds.  </P> <P> "All other contributions, and all other contributions include loans, would be  subject to Proposition 73 restrictions," Michioku said.  </P> <P> Dean said he was unsure if any of the $20,000 loan had been used to finance  campaign-related activities. His campaign treasurer, Ann L. Krueger, could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Peterson also charged that Dean surpassed campaign finance limits by $500 in  accepting $1,500 worth of bumper stickers from Weber Nameplate, a Santa Ana  firm. Dean, however, said a clerk typed in an incorrect figure and that an  amended disclosure form will show that less than $1,000 in bumper stickers was  donated. Henry Weber, president of Weber Nameplate, was not available to  confirm Dean's account.  </P> <P> Dean said he does not believe the allegations will harm his effort to unseat  Peterson. "I think people will be accepting of a mistake like this," he said.  "There's more at stake in this election than a mistake of this kind." TONY  MARCANO  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vilma E. Figueroa B.] </F>   [Text] Carlos Felipe Escobar, chairman of the Legislative  Assembly Drug Control and Eradication Committee, believes the  United States is also responsible for the existing drug problems  in Panama because the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) was  approved two years ago, but the U.S. Senate still has not  ratified it.    Three days ago, Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy assistant  secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said Panama has  become a "very important" center for the laundering  narcodollars. This prompted the Panamanian Government to  prepare a protest note which will be delivered this week to the  authorities of President Clinton's administration.    "MLAT is shelved because there are senators who have been  unwilling to approve the treaty, which would permit both  countries (Panama and the United States) to conduct operations  to counter the drug problem," the president of the assembly's  drug committee said.    For his part, Rodrigo Arosemena, former customs director,  said the Panamanian authorities have countered drug trafficking  but if the U.S. authorities do not want to accept this fact,  they should offer proof.</p>

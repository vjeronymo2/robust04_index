			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Algeria and Italy in Dollars 7bn loan deal ITALY and Algeria yesterday signed a package of loans worth Dollars 7bn. This package is in the context of Italy's decision virtually to double the amount of natural gas it will buy from Algeria over the next five years. In addition, the loans are meant as a gesture towards north Africa's largest country which is engaged in bold reforms aimed at liberalising its political and economic system. They contrast sharply with the more reserved attitude of Algeria's main trading partner, France. The deal will help Algeria's Central Bank which has been sparing no effort to lengthen the average maturity of the country's Dollars 25.3bn foreign debt which had declined to just over three years by 1990, thus pushing up the debt service ratio as a percentage of foreign debt to about 75 per cent. A first tranche of Dollars 2.5bn is earmarked for the refinancing of credits over the next seven years. Many of these are guaranteed by the Italian state and fall due between January 1991 and January 1993. The remaining Dollars 4.5bn, which will have to be raised through banks, will be spent on the purchase of Italian goods and services.</p>

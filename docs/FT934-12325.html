			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Lamont joins Philippine trust MR Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer and recent arrival on the board of NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, is expanding his list of non-executive directorships in an unexpected direction. Mr Lamont is joining the board of the First Philippine Investment Trust, one of the stock market's most successful trusts last year but capitalised at only Pounds 32m. He is joined as non-executive director at First Philippine by another ex-finance minister, Mr Ramon del Rosario of the Philippines, who also had a rough ride before retiring. Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall that manages the trust, called Mr Lamont's decision 'enterprising' and based on the former chancellor's view that the Philippines would enjoy a rapid rate of growth. Mr Lamont had identified the Philippines as a market that would 'catch up' with other south-east Asian markets, Mr Duffield said. The First Philippine Investment Trust was the eighth-best performing trust in the London market last year. Before pursuing a political career full-time, Mr Lamont worked in the investment side of NM Rothschild where Mr John Craig, who is now vice-chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, was then head of banking. Mr del Rosario was chosen as finance minister by President Fidel Ramos and served for more than a year, but his appointment was rejected by Congress as some claimed he slavishly followed the International Monetary Fund's prescription for the country's economic ills. Mr Andres Soriano, chairman of the First Philippine Investment Trust will resign as part of the board reshuffle. Also resigning are Mr Craig, Mr Peter Chesterfield of joint investment manager, Abbey Life Investment Services, and Mr Francisco Dizon of AB Capital and Investment Corp. Mr Soriano heads San Miguel Corporation, the Philippines' largest conglomerate with interests from beer to food.</p>

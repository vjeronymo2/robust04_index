			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL ASKS FOR REVISED PARKING PLAN;  </P> <P> CONGESTION: AN UNPOPULAR PROPOSAL TO CHARGE RESIDENTS OF HIGH-DENSITY AREAS TO  PARK IN FRONT OF THEIR HOMES GOES BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.  </P> <P> Bowing to public opposition, the Glendale Parking Commission told the city's  traffic engineer Monday to rewrite a proposal to charge residents of  high-density areas for permits to park overnight in front of their homes.  </P> <P> After its fourth public hearing on the unpopular proposal, the commission's  members said that they hoped Traffic Engineer Tom Horne could add incentives  that would pacify the more than 100 speakers who criticized the idea as  elitist, unfair and unnecessary.  </P> <P> The commission, with no other business to attend to, called off its November  and December meetings but will schedule an evening hearing in January to allow  public comment on the revised proposal.  </P> <P> To accommodate the expected large turnout, the meeting will be held in the  Glendale Civic auditorium.  </P> <P> The proposal, first presented by Horne as a draft ordinance in March, was aimed  at easing parking congestion in densely populated neighborhoods by forcing  residents to park cars in their garages. It called for paid permits for  residents parking on the streets between 2 and 6 a.m.  </P> <P> The fees would have ranged from $15 to $120, depending on the number of permits  per household and the amount of available off-street parking.  </P> <P> But on Monday, Horne said that the new draft would probably include a  restructuring of the fee scale.  </P> <P> Commission and city staff members said the new proposal will also probably  include fee exemptions for the handicapped, senior citizens and maybe for  applicants requesting their first permit.  </P> <P> To avoid the appearence of discrimination, the proposal would make the parking  restrictions citywide, as opposed to neighborhoods zoned for apartments and  condominiums, as was intended in the original draft, officials said.  </P> <P> These officials hope that the added incentives, along with a stepped-up  publicity campaign, will turn the tide in favor of the parking permit plan.  Last week, at a planning retreat in Oxnard in Ventura County, Glendale City  Council members instructed the city manager to negotiate with New Image, a  Glendale public relations firm, a promotional package for the city proposal.  </P> <P> On Monday a subdued audience of about 30 residents attended the commission  hearing at the Glendale Public Library. Although the turnout was considerably  smaller than at previous hearings on the matter, speakers were as adamant as  ever in their opposition to the city plan.  </P> <P> Two speakers voiced support for the proposal, but the others restated arguments  heard throughout the hearing process: that there are no problems in their  neighborhoods that merit a parking fee, that the proposal amounts to taxation  of the poor and that the council is responsible for the parking crunch by  allowing too much development and should therefore shoulder the cost of any  solution.  </P> <P> Kay McKenzie handed commissioners a petition with 40 signatures opposing the  city proposal. She said after the meeting that her group, the newly formed  Citizens Against Parking Permits, had already submitted 400 signatures to the  commission and that thousands would be gathered throughout the city.  </P> <P> Four police officers stood guard at the auditorium entrance to prevent a repeat  of the scuffle that took place Sept. 18, when a police patrol in riot gear was  called in to control a vociferous, emotional, and at times unruly crowd of 300  that packed City Hall to oppose the proposed parking restrictions.  </P> <P> Monday's meeting began with a stern warning by commission Chairman James  Cashion, who advised the audience that such behavior would no longer be  tolerated.  </P> <P> But the warning seemed unnecessary. In contrast to the constant clapping and  yelling that characterized earlier hearings, Monday's audience applauded only  once.  </P> <P> That came in reaction to a statement by Bob Minahan, one of the speakers: "If  anybody in this commission has any political aspirations he should make a  motion right now to strike down the parking proposal. He will probably be  elected mayor in the next election."  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Unep chief protests over budget THE NEW head of the United Nations Environment Programme complained yesterday that its budget had been cut despite pledges of more support at last year's Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell of Canada, in her first address since taking over at Unep four months ago, told its annual governing council that lack of cash undermined the credibility of the 20-year-old agency. 'The question being asked by many is this: What happened to the agenda agreed at Rio, which called for Unep's role to be enhanced, for its resources to be expanded? And yet its budget has been shrunk,' she said. 'Governments are ready to put only a quarter of the Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 840m) (they pledged) into the environment fund. Is it any wonder that our critics view with scepticism the real commitment?' she said in Nairobi. She gave no figures for a budget cut worked out by a council meeting last week.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark and Italy help tip the balance FOREIGN and arbitrage selling hit Japanese equities last week, as investors who had bought stocks in the Nikkei rally last September decided to lighten their positions. Experience was mixed in the US, with strength in second-line stocks outweighing a flat week for senior blue chips, and it was left to Europe, up 1.0 per cent, to tip the FT- Actuaries World Index into an even more modest 0.1 per cent gain on the week. A strong dollar, interest rate cuts in France and Italy and what optimists hoped was the start of a pre-Christmas rally in Germany, put Europe into the black. The outstanding performers were Denmark and Italy, although Germany's 3.6 per cent gain was important in terms of sheer weight. Denmark, too, was an interest rate story. Until last week, when Japan took over again, it had had the uneasy distinction of being the worst performer in the FT-Actuaries World Indices this year, undermined by rising interest rates in Europe in the spring, the increasing interest-rate differential to Germany after the June 2 Maastricht referendum and, thereafter, its own version of the 1992 disaster in the Nordic financial sector. Last week it galloped up 9 per cent on Tuesday's repo rate cut by the central bank. Unibank Securities thinks that there is potential for at least another 15 per cent increase in Danish equities over the next 12 months with interest rates coming down further and market psychology improving. Italy's gain was the more impressive as it came in steadily rising volume, which registered a heavy L408bn last Friday. Pastorino &amp; Partners says that, in the excitement surrounding the country's privatisation programme, the announcement by Iri that it will sell its entire stake in Credito Italiano has attracted the interest of foreign investors, to a limited extent, and of small savers - 'both longstanding absentees from the market'.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: RWE, Endesa plan shares link THE TWO biggest electricity utilities in Germany and Spain, RWE and Endesa, are understood to be close to agreement on a major exchange of shares. RWE officials in Essen confirmed yesterday that the two companies were in negotiations but said no agreement had yet been reached. In Madrid, however, it has been reliably learned that RWE and Endesa have agreed in principle to exchange up to 10 per cent of their stock with each other. Until now, the Spanish Government has refused to allow foreign utilities to take stakes in Spanish generators and distributors. But earlier this week the large Spanish private sector utility, Iberdrola, said Tractabel of Belgium had agreed to buy 3 per cent of its stock. RWE is a much larger company than Endesa and it seems likely that any two-way investment would be made for equal amounts of money, giving the German utility a bigger share of Endesa than the Spanish would be able to take in RWE. But analysts said it was unlikely RWE would immediately take up a full 10 per cent of Endesa, which at current share prices would cost Dollars 930m. RWE tried in 1980 to take a stake in a smaller private Spanish utility, Union Fenosa, but was blocked by the Spanish government which was then trying to encourage a series of mergers among local electricity companies. RWE is also understood to be talking to Union Fenosa about collaborating in Czechoslovakia. RWE and other German utilities are seeking to expand into eastern Germany and Eastern Europe. In eastern Germany, though, the big German utilities have run into opposition from local municipalities unhappy with the prospect of handing over complete control of power generation and distribution to the powerful western companies. Endesa, meanwhile, would be a vehicle through which RWE could pursue other opportunities in Latin America, where some markets are being opened to private suppliers. The two companies are also heavy users of coal-fired generating plant.</p>

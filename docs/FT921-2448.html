			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (13): Even a beginner can't go wrong - Wingz: User View THE marketing services company, Programmes, picked the Informix Software Wingz package not for its spreadsheet facilities, but for its graphics. Programmes, in Corby, Northamptonshire, provides marketing services ranging from telemarketing to building databases; it offers related consultancy in fields such as market analysis, business planning and information technology strategy; and it provides training in everything from presentation skills to managing corporate change. The company had been using Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet product and still has this for general-purpose jobs but has switched to Wingz for preparing graphs and charts for reports for clients. Analysis of raw survey data is handled by the SAS System, a statistical package starting at Pounds 800 from SAS Institute which itself has over 3m users world-wide. This system is run on a Sun Microsystems computer and the refined data is then passed to an Apple Macintosh running Wingz. 'Wingz is not easy to learn, but once you're into it you find it has a lot more features than Excel, notably on the graphics side, and that makes it a better package to use,' says Mr David Fleming, research director at Programmes. 'In fact, it is probably harder to learn because of the features it has.' Ms Jackie McKay, a marketing information consultant who has a background in design, says that - as a now-experienced user  - she finds Wingz 'extraordinarily friendly, with enormous variety and elegance.' Ms McKay points to the horrors of design which can emanate from amateurs when they are given a package with unlimited choice - 'with the Wingz auto facility, even a beginner can't go too far wrong,' she says. 'Wingz has elegance and produces graphs, pie charts or whatever, which are neater and tidier and have delicate lines.' Wingz does some summary calculations on the survey data and Jackie McKay says that here, too, the product comes out well. 'It was clearly designed by people who knew what information was all about,' she says. Mr Fleming agrees: 'We went for the product initially because of its graphics, but once we got into it we found it has more spreadsheet facilities too.' Despite the praise for Wingz, Excel is still the most widely used package in Programmes for pure spreadsheet work: producing business plans, financial summaries and so on. This is partly to do with the very point made by Mr Fleming that it is easier to learn.</p>

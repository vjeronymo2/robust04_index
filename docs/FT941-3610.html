			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Cellular phones accord takes Nikkei up 2% to 1994 high Resolution of the US-Japan trade dispute, a retreat in the yen against the dollar and signs of improving economic conditions took the Nikkei 225 average up by 2 per cent to a year's high, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was ahead 410.84 at 20,526.15 after an opening low for the day of 20,157.72 and high of 20,580.96. 'The market rose on technical buying amid the feeling that corporate selling was out of the way,' said Mr Rod Smyth, a strategist at Baring Securities. The yen and bond markets stabilised following the US-Japan trade accord on cellular phones over the weekend. A survey by the Ministry of Trade and Industry indicated an improvement in business confidence. Volume was 480m shares, against 737m last Friday when March futures and option contracts were settled. Foreigners and arbitrageurs turned buyers, while dealers, who had refrained from activity last week, citing fears of rising US interest rates, supported share prices. Technical analysts are now focusing on whether the Nikkei 225 index can break through the 21,000 level reached last September. Rises led falls by 882 to 194, with 124 issues unchanged. The Topix index added 19.97 at 1,639.87, while the Nikkei 300 advanced 3.46 to 301.88. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.39 at 1,362.17. High-technology stocks gained ground on broad-based buying. Toshiba, the day's most active issue, moved forward Y13 to Y793. Expectations of a smaller loss for the current year to March supported Victor, the audio visual maker. The stock closed at a bidded price of Y1,560. Overseas buying supported automobile issues. Nissan Motor gained Y23 at Y923. Individual investors supported speculative favourites. Japan Energy climbed Y14 to Y452 on its development of an anti-Aids drug, while Clarion rose Y12 to Y497. Kajima, the construction group, weakened Y14 to Y948 after last week's arrest of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, former construction minister, for allegedly receiving bribes from the company. Kankaku Securities, a second tier Japanese broker, lost Y6 at Y639. The broker announced last week that it had incurred losses of Y50bn from illicit client transactions. But Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the commercial bank which will support Kankaku by extending subordinated loans, rose Y30 to Y1,950. In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 275.24 to 22,372.83 in volume of 114.3m shares. Roundup Yesterday was the Moslem holiday of Eid Al-Fitr. Markets were closed for this, or other holidays, in Bombay, Karachi, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. HONG KONG reversed early losses after a more conciliatory tone emerged from Sino-US talks in Beijing. The afternoon rebound left the Hang Seng index 74.41 up at 9,980.07 after an earlier fall of about 300 points. Turnover was light. Swire Pacific, Dollars 2 higher at HKDollars 55, reported a 5 per cent rise in profits. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index gained 26.2 at 2,179.3, brokers citing Japan's opening of its cellular telephone market to the US-based Motorola, stronger bond prices and a higher Wall Street close on Friday as buoying sentiment. The golds index was 53.9 higher at 2,392.8 on the bullion price, which rose on political tensions in South Africa. SEOUL climbed for the third consecutive session on interest in banking shares and asset plays, the composite index adding 9.41 at 912.83 after touching 921.37. Banks were tipped for support in advance of rights issues, the sector index gaining 25.83 at 604.17. TAIWAN rose 1.2 per cent in a technical rebound from last week's 6.1 per cent drop, the weighted index closing 60.77 higher at 5,333.87. Turnover was thin at TDollars 40.92bn. MANILA rose on bargain hunting and stock dividends from Manila Electric and Filinvest Land, the composite index closing 72.80 up at 2,631.53. SHANGHAI investors went on a buying spree after a package of measures from security regulators to rescue plummeting share prices. Turnover was so high that it knocked out the computer system for a period; the A share index rose 75.44, or 10.2 per cent, to 811.69.</p>

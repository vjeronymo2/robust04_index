			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, 18 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak  affirmed that Egypt has preserved, and will continue to preserve  and guard the moderate Islamic heritage and culture, and that  its people have been an example of forgiveness, moderation, and  religious tolerance since the dawn of history.    This came in the president's message today to the people of  Asyut during a popular celebration to mark the governorate's  annual festival in Markaz Manfalut, Asyut. Awqaf Minister  Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub read the message on the president's behalf.    President Mubarak emphasized that society's peace and  stability is a national issue, the responsibility for which  falls on each citizen--on both the majority and opposition, and  primarily on the political institutions and organizations, and  the popular, professional, and trade associations.    He stressed that Egypt belongs to all Egyptians,  pro-government and opposition alike, and that sustaining its  safety and peace is the responsibility of all its sons. Egypt  is above all and bigger than all, he said.    Reviewing the economic reform march, the president said that  we are about to reap the fruits of that reform. The masses of  the great Egyptian people provided real support to guarantee the  success of that reform, he said.    Mubarak affirmed that the future is promising and calls for  optimism and hope to overcome many of the crises our great  people have withstood and to make up for the sacrifices they had  to make to put the homeland on the right course.    Touching on the current phase the country is going through,  the president said that the success of the human, economic, and  political development march, along which we have gone far,  depends on a cohesive national front and a stable and secure  society. He stressed a number of general principles considered  crucial to ensuring the success of the Egyptian march. These  principles emphasize that society's security and stability is a  national issue and that the Egyptian political system's strength  lies in its effort to expand democracy without disturbing the  criteria that distinguish democracy from anarchy. They also  emphasize that serving the masses can only be done through  serious and sincere work and by giving public interest priority  over all else, that social peace is the safety valve for the  national march, and that terrorism is an open war against Egypt  and its people that seeks to waste the country's resources and  ruin its accomplishments.    The president stressed that Egypt has preserved and will  continue to preserve and guard the moderate Islamic culture and  heritage. Advocates of violence should know that all they will  harvest by indulging in their action is disgrace and social  isolation, he said.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Awfully ephemeral thing television, isn't it? A fleeting flicker in the ether and another programme disappears forever. At 6.00 Channel 4 repeats Happy Days, a series about the 1950s with Henry Winkler as Fonzie, which was made in the mid-seventies and has been playing around the world ever since. At 7.30 ITV screens yet another episode of Coronation Street, a soap which began 32 years ago and has not missed a week on screen since then. At 7.40 BBC2 shows Part 4 of a Doctor Who story which had its first outing in 1968 and at 8.00 BBC1 begins a brand new batch of In Sickness And In Health, a youthful slip of a thing which has only been running since 1985, though its chief character Alf Garnett was originally introduced to us in 1966. Dream On (10.00 C4) is an ultra-modern American sitcom: it is punctuated with frequent monochrome clips from fifties TV series. Head is a 24-year-old movie about The Monkees - remember them? Awfully ephemeral, television. Tomorrow on C4 you can watch three hours of programmes from 1974, including 'Regan', pilot for 'The Sweeney'.</p>

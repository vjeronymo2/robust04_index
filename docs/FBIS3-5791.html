			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chea Sim, National Assembly chairman and </F> acting head of state, by an unidentified AKP correspondent;  place, date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] [Correspondent] Recently, a high-ranking Kingdom of  Cambodia National Assembly delegation headed by Your Eminence  paid an official friendship visit to the SRV, the Lao People's  Democratic Republic [LPDR], and the Kingdom of Thailand. What  was the outcome of these visits? How do you evaluate them?    [Chea Sim] First of all, let me express my most sincere  thanks to you, the AKP special correspondent, for giving me a  chance to inform the people of the outcome of this trip. It can  be summed up in these words: Our delegation's visit to these  three friendly countries was certainly very fruitful. Although  it was the first of its kind, this trip made major and important  contributions. First, it strengthened and expanded the bonds of  friendship and mutual cooperation between our state and people  and the states and peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand who  share our common borders. Second, it opened a bridge of  excellent cooperation between our legislative organ and those of  the three neighboring countries. Third, it elevated our national  prestige in the region and on the international stage.    As the messenger of the Cambodian people and a contributor  to  the defense and advancement of our nation's superior interests,  our delegation did its best to accomplish everything with a high  sense of responsibility in order to promote and encourage new  developments in Cambodia's relationship with its neighbors in a  new form and in line with the new regional and international  trends. In this context, the talks and negotiations we  conducted with the top leaders of the three countries enabled  our delegation to hold consultations and exchange views in  greater depth concerning all aspects of our bilateral relations,  both present and future, which must proceed in a new and  progressive form.    Our delegation sought to acquire a firm foundation capable  of  guaranteeing the durable interests of our country. All of these  top leaders unanimously agreed that the existing traditional  relations of friendship and mutual cooperation between our  states and peoples must be further strengthened and expanded;  good neighborliness is an important factor in the development of  each country; mutual understanding, respect, and trust and a  sense of solidarity must be based on respect for each nation's  independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and right to  self-determination; and bilateral cooperation must be  implemented on the basis of the principles of equality and  reciprocal benefit.    As for problems that remain to be settled, we agreed that we  will work jointly to solve them peacefully. This is the only  good way to guarantee that the sense of good neighborliness will  last.    Because of their geographical proximity to Cambodia, the  three countries expressed their wish to cooperate with and  assist Cambodia in its national rehabilitation on the basis of  the principle of mutual help. This is an excellent fundamental  line that will guide our future relationships.    At the same time, the top Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai leaders  all affirmed their resolute support for peace and national  reconciliation in Cambodia. They consider this to be not only  an important factor for the stability and development of each  country, but also a contribution to the strengthening of  regional and international stability, friendship, and  cooperation.    These prominent dignitaries reemphasized their respective  countries' resolute and unwavering support for the Royal  Government of Cambodia -- headed by His Royal Highness Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh as first prime minister and Samdech  Hun Sen as second prime minister -- both in the rehabilitation  and reconstruction of Cambodia and in the realization of  Cambodia's national reconciliation.    The Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai leaders expressed their  distinguished respects for His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  Varaman, our venerated monarch, and solemnly wished him a prompt  recovery so that he could pursue his noble and historic royal  crusade.    It should be noted that during our visit to these three  countries, our delegation was accorded the great honor of  meeting with all the top leaders of each country. For instance,  in the SRV our delegation met with His Excellency [H.E.]  President Le Duc Anh; H.E. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet; H.E.  National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh; and H.E. Do Muoi,  secretary general of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central  Committee. In the LPDR we met with H.E. President Nouhak  Phoumsavan, H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon, and H.E.  National Assembly Chairman Saman Vignaket. In the Kingdom of  Thailand, we met with H.E. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai; H.E.  Dr. Marut Bunnak, chairman of the National Assembly; and H.E.  Senate Chairman Michai Ruchuphan. Even better, our delegation  was graciously accorded an audience with His Majesty King  Phumiphon Adunyadet of the Kingdom of Thailand at the royal  palace in Bangkok.    Aside from discussing bilateral relations, our delegation  learned about and exchanged experiences on parliamentary work  and other issues of importance to our country's development,  such as agriculture, irrigation, industry, electricity,  education, financial systems, and the market economy.    Our delegation also visited industrial estates, construction  projects, bridges, and hydroelectric dams. It was an important  opportunity for members of the delegation and of the nine  National Assembly commissions to gain a better understanding and  experience for future use in the service of the nation and  people.    Concerning the relationship between our National Assembly  and  the assemblies of the three friendly countries, we agreed to  expand mutual contact through exchanges of delegations at the  top level and at the level of committees, representatives, and  house secretariats. We exchanged documents to help promote the  spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation  between our states and peoples.    Based on this visit, we can draw the conclusion that the  foundation of our National Assembly-to-National Assembly  relationships has already been established.    It should be noted that the legislative organ of each host  country accorded our delegation a great honor by arranging an  excellent reception for us at a high protocol level. This  clearly shows the common desire and wish for friendship and good  neighborliness. Although the visit to each of these countries  was brief, each had profound political significance and was  replete with a great feeling of friendship and mutual regard.</p>

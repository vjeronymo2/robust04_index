			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip as strong economic data spark selling MORE strong economic figures sparked retail selling on US bond markets yesterday, leaving Treasuries lower across the board. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/2 at 104 19/32 , yielding 7.240 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/8 lower at 99 31/32 , to yield 4.250 per cent. The day's economic news was singularly bearish for bonds. The Commerce Department reported that the December US leading economic indicators rose 1.9 per cent, a much bigger increase than analysts had expected. The data followed the news that new home sales surged 6.3 per cent in December, again a bigger rise than the market had forecast. Later in the day, the Johnson Redbook report was released showing a 4.6 per cent jump in store sales for the last week of December. The figures prompted selling across the board, especially by retail players. Prices were also pressured lower by a reluctance among market participants to trade ahead of today's important refunding announcement, which will reveal how much the Treasury will issue of three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities. THE Bank of England saw strong demand for its three-year Ecu notes yesterday when it resumed its quarterly Ecu note programme with its first tender for several months. The Bank's Ecu note programme was halted last October when turbulent conditions in the Ecu and European government bond markets forced it to cancel a planned auction. However, as conditions in the bond and foreign exchange markets have stabilised recently, the Bank announced it would resume its quarterly programme. Yesterday's tender of Ecu 500m of notes was heavily oversubscribed, with a bid-to-cover ratio of five times and a very narrow range of accepted bids. The highest accepted yield was 8 per cent and the lowest 7.99 per cent. The coupon was set at 8 per cent. Dealers said the strong demand for the paper reflected growing confidence in the Ecu market after the turmoil and uncertainty of recent months following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. The tender results had little impact on the Ecu bond market, which weakened slightly yesterday. The Ecu futures contract on the Matif traded at around 110.04 by late afternoon, against Monday's close of 110.08. UK government bonds closed up half a point at the long end, helped by outright buying and some switching out of shorter-maturities. Dealers said hopes of another cut in the base rate are fading, leading to a slight fall in prices at the short end. EUROPEAN government bond prices edged higher in lacklustre trading with attention focusing on developments in Germany. The German public sector pay talks are due to resume today and the Bundesbank Council holds its regular meeting on Thursday. Some dealers are hoping to see an easing at today's repo, but doubt a cut in official interest rates will materialise this week. JAPANESE government bond prices closed firmer, with the futures contract reaching a new high as speculation about an interest rate cut continued. The release of relatively high unemployment figures helped to fuel hopes that the Bank of Japan would ease soon. Unemployment in December rose to 2.4 per cent from 2.3 per cent the previous month. Jiji, the Japanese news agency, reported later that the Bank of Japan was expected to lower its official discount rate by 75 basis points to 2.5 per cent on Thursday. However, news that Mr Yutaka Yamaguchi, director of the Bank of Japan's policy planning department, had emphasised the timing was not right for a rate cut dampened the futures price during London trading. The March futures contract opened at 109.68 and closed at 109.77, the high of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 145 bond, ended the day unchanged at 4.30 per cent, having traded in a range of 4.28 to 4.375 per cent.</p>

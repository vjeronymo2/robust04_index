Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA--No aspect of the African  National Congress [ANC] could be described as communist in spite  of the ANC's alliance with the South African Communist Party  [SACP], ANC national Chairman Thabo Mbeki told a Davis Borkhum  Hare breakfast at the Transvaal Automobile Club in Johannesburg  on Wednesday. The proceedings, broadcast live on M-Net [Media  Network], were attended by leading businessmen, diplomats and  politicians.    Asked to outline the ANC's stance on nationalisation, Mr  Mbeki said the ANC did not have a policy of nationalisation but  would consider state control if it achieved a particular policy  objective. "The ANC has no policy to nationalise any bank or  industry or mine. What we are saying is that these are  instruments of policy. One may decide to privatise a company but  the matter is not approached as an ideology or a policy.    "If in the pursuit of a particular policy objective it can  be  shown that the objective can be achieved by putting company x in  state hands, then of course we would consider it."    He said the ANC intended to bring an end to the violence  because this was crucial in attracting foreign investment that  was necessary for job creation.    Constitutional concessions offered the Freedom Alliance  should be sufficient to ensure its participation in the  elections. The changes had been painful to the ANC but were  necessary to achieve stability.    Economic growth would be central to an anc government. A  democratic settlement had to be underwritten by a programme that  improved the lives of the poor.    "Something has to happen to guarantee the permanance of the  democratic settlement."    The ANC would initiate a public works programme and  restructure the budget to realise its objectives within current  state revenue projections.    In reply to another question, Mr Mbeki said it was not  inevitable that South Africa would decline in the way some  African countries had done. It would be foolish not to learn  from the mistakes of other African countries, he said.</p>

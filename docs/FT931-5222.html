			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / So what do you mean, Mr Major?: Dominic Lawson wonders if the prime minister is suffering from a serious case of inarticulateness J. ALFRED Prufrock, TS Eliot's most poignant evocation of self-loathing mediocrity, had a characteristically plaintive refrain: 'That is not what I meant at all. That is not it, at all.' I am beginning to think that Eliot had a figure very like John Major in mind. The man seems to have developed a worrying tendency to say something publicly on one day and spend the next commissioning his office to say: 'That is not what the prime minister meant at all. That is not it at all.' A month ago, at the Carlton club in London, the prime minister appeared  - in a speech pre-sold as 'visionary' - to endorse the idea of a scheme called workfare for the unemployed. 'I increasingly wonder,' said Major, reading from a prepared text, 'whether paying unemployment benefit, without offering or requiring any activity in return, serves the unemployed people or society well.' Major's words seemed clearly to imply that the government was considering ending the system under which, to receive unemployment benefit, you need only to be unemployed and seeking work. So, at least, the newspapers, and the Labour party interpreted the prime minister's remarks. The next day, apparently surprised at this, the spin doctors at No 10 protested that Major had not meant any such thing. It seems he was just 'flying a kite,' which was hauled in fast. Two weeks ago, John Major, in an attempt to avoid being outflanked by the Labour party's new hard line against youth crime, said that we ' should condemn a little more, and understand a little less.' What Major meant to say, I suppose, is that he felt that we should be more censorious and less sympathetic towards criminals. But that is not what he actually said, in a phrase which merely made him seem silly. Now Major has again - as Ronald Reagan once immortally put it - misspoken himself. On Wednesday, he told the Independent newspaper that he did not agree with the 1980s' ethos of allowing manufacturing to look after itself, and giving industry no special assistance. 'I don't agree with it. I didn't agree with it in the 1980s. I was a minority view in the 1980s. I am not a minority view now and, anyway, I am in a better position to expound my views.' I do not think it was wilful of the press to interpret this as a not-so-thinly-veiled criticism of the Thatcher administration's attitude to manufacturing industry. In any case, the Thatcherites were duly furious at Major's remarks, not least for their insouciant attitude to collective cabinet responsibility. Yet again, Downing Street's paid apologisers were sent out to make amends, if The Times is to be believed. It reported yesterday: 'Baroness Thatcher was reported by close colleagues to be satisfied after the prime minister and his staff spent much of an embarrassing day emphasising that his comments had not been intended as an attack on the former prime minister . . . the conclusion among ministers last night was that Mr Major must have been referring to Lord Lawson, his former boss at the Treasury.' Oh, so that's all right, then. It is interesting to speculate about the reasons for this apparent inability of the prime minister to say exactly what he means. Perhaps it is not an inability at all, but a deliberate ploy: fly a kite and, if the public and the press do not like the colour, you can always say you did not really like it, either. But that suggests a high degree of deviousness, which I do not believe Major has. The more frightening possibility is that he is simply inarticulate. That is a very unusual thing in a prime minister.  Thatcher, it is true, was no great orator but she was - and is - highly articulate and almost incapable constitutionally of being misunderstood. Inarticulateness might not be such a handicap for a politician who wants to remain a back-room boy, a technocrat. Major though, has recently shown signs of wanting also to be a prophet with 'a vision.' But words fail him. As Prufrock intoned: 'I am no prophet - and here's no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid.'

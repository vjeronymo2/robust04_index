			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 4 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of  the Yugoslav Chamber of Republics Radmilo Bogdanovic said  Wednesday that a possible attack on Brcko (northern Bosnia)  would be an aggression because Brcko was a free Serb town in  which people lead normal lives with a functioning state and  economy. In a statement to TANJUG Bogdanovic warned that Brcko  was a "fabricated Gorazde" aimed at cutting off the corridor  between the Serb lands and linking the newly-formed Moslem-Croat  Federation with Croatia in the north.    In the last few days the Moslem Army has been concentrating  its forces in the Brcko area to attack the town and cut off the  corridor which links the eastern and western parts of the  Bosnian Serb Republic. This was openly admitted Monday by the  commander of the Moslem Army Rasim Delic who said that Brcko was  the "key to the Bosnian war". Despite this statement many  Western media, who had formerly showered the world with untruths  about the destruction of the Moslem enclave of Gorazde (eastern  Bosnia) and the number of civilians killed there, are now  fabricating similar untruths about the Serbs massing forces to  attack Brcko, as if the town was not in their control. At the  same time, it is insisted, particularily in U.S. Adminsitration  circles, that NATO should carry out air strikes on the Serbs if  they go into action.    After all the mistakes the international community has  admitted to having made and after so many victims and  destruction, the world should realize that the war which has  been stirred up in the former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans is  in nobody's interest, Bogdanovic averted. Bosnian Serb  President Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday in his talks with  Special U.N. Envoy Yasushi Akashi that the Serb side was  offering a ceasefire in the Brcko region and that it would be  implemented unilaterally even if it is not accepted by the  Moslems.    Karadzic also agreed to the deployment of U.N. observers on  the Serb and Moslem sides in the area to prevent an escalation  of the crisis.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Treasury discusses proposals for more open style THE TREASURY has unveiled far-reaching proposals to meet criticisms that it has made serious mistakes over economic policy and become remote from the City and industry. The initiative could lead to a more open style at Whitehall's most important department, whose reputation has been severely dented during Britain's longest recession for 50 years. One plan under consideration would lead to non-government economists being asked to work on Treasury forecasts to improve their accuracy, in the biggest shake-up at the Treasury since the early 1980s. Other ideas being considered include: Greater efforts to recruit people with experience in industry and financial markets, possibly by increasing salaries for specific individuals. Paying companies to undertake studies in areas such as financial deregulation. Less secrecy in internal discussion of proposed policy changes, for instance over taxation, as part of a new policy to encourage wider swapping of ideas with the private sector. Revamping procedures for making economic forecasts, which in the past two years have turned out to be optimistic. Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, presented the ideas at an unpublicised meeting of the Treasury's top 70 officials on Monday, held at the Institution of Civil Engineers in central London. The proposals are being drawn up as the Treasury attempts to find a new economic strategy after the shock of Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism three weeks ago. The Treasury's tactics in attempting to defend the pound ahead of ERM suspension have been widely criticised in the City. The department has also come under attack from politicians and industrialists for misjudging the seriousness of the recession. Sir Terry's ideas are being presented as a 'green paper' for internal debate, and lack detail. They may need to be refined after discussions with ministers, who may be worried that less Treasury secrecy could lead to more potentially embarrassing 'leaks' about details of policy actions. That could involve drawing more on ideas about how the economy is progressing from people in industry and the City, possibly by paying such individuals for specific aspects of forecasting. Steps may also be taken to improve training and flexibility among the 1,500 employees in the central policymaking departments. Observer, Page 19</p>

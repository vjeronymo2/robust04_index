			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORMER LAGUNA SCHOOL TRUSTEE ELMER BROWN DIES  </P> <P> Elmer Brown, a former Laguna Beach Unified School District trustee, died of  cancer Wednesday. He was 78.  </P> <P> Brown, a longtime Laguna resident, was chairman of Laguna Travel Service, the  county's third oldest travel agency, founded in 1946.  </P> <P> Brown bought the agency in 1953. Before that he was in the construction  business, building six different housing projects in the city.  </P> <P> Brown met his wife, Ruth, a doctor, at a general store he owned in Keene,  Calif. While his four children were attending public school, Brown decided to  run for the school board in 1954 because he felt it was his civic duty, his  wife said. During his tenure, the school district underwent tremendous growth  as the city itself grew in population.  </P> <P> After his term ended, Brown returned to private life and never ran for public  office again.  </P> <P> Born in Los Angeles, Brown attended UCLA, where he graduated in 1934 with a  degree in accounting. He later served as an Army finance officer during World  War II.  </P> <P> In addition to his wife, Brown is survived by four children and seven  grandchildren.  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held Friday at 9:30 a.m. at Laguna Beach  Presbyterian Church.  </P></p>

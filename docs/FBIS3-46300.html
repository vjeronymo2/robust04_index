			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Ching Chi (5427 2765): </F> "Stability, Legal System, Consensus Essential for Reforms, Says  Official of State Commission for Restructuring the Economy"]    [Text] This year is being looked as one in which China  will tackle "key problems" in its reform in the economic  structure. A high-ranking official from the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economy pointed out that the difficulties  China is facing in reforms are unprecedented and wide-ranging.  In his view, the greatest pressure right now is inflation,  which however was not caused by reforms, but by people's  expectations. Reforms in China's macroeconomic system are  themselves the greatest inflation-curbing factor.    Feng Bing, State Commission for Restructuring the Economy  spokesman, pointed out a few days ago that reforms in  macroeconomic systems such as taxation, financial, and  investment systems and reforms in the microeconomy consisting of  creating a modern corporate system are the two main programs for  this year's economic reforms, both of which display the five  characteristics of clearness, standardization, matching  supports, increasing speed, and unexampled novelty.    How to handle the relationship between reforms and  development? Vow to prevent as much as possible the unveiling of  reformist measures from touching off relatively big social  turmoil? Will inflation slow down the pace of reform? These  have become the focus of attention from all circles.    Feng Bing pointed out that speeding up reforms is brought up  under the historical demand of speeding up development, while  speeding up development is achieved within the framework of  speeding up reform. As the objective of creating a socialist  market economic system becomes clear, there is now a more  harmonious, mutually reinforcing and supporting relationship  between reforms and development. Although new problems and  contradictions appear, the focus now is on initiating parallel  reforms in different subsystems within the reform system to  solve new problems that appear in development, and not an  all-inclusive and sweeping generalization on the kind of  environment development will provide for reforms. This official  believes that future fluctuation cycles produced by  contradictions between reforms and development will shorten. On  balance, reforms have been responsible for promoting sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development in a way that is much  more powerful than the impact of the economic environment on  reforms.    The beginning of new year saw the implementation of a new  tax  system and the smooth integration of renminbi rates, giving the  "reform year" a good start, though there are still many points  of difficulty. Mainly these are: One, will the pursuit of  reforms in the financial system before the establishment of a  new framework affect financing? Two, will reforms in the  investment system that closely follow the financial reforms  trigger another round of investment craze? Three, the  promulgation of the "company law" signals the beginning of a  modern corporate system. But many state- owned enterprises are  heavily in debt, draining away huge state- owned assets, and  there is not yet a social security system. Where to begin with  all these problems? Four, how can rural reform be deepeneds?  How can the problem of the slow growth of peasant income be  solved? Five, how can speculative behavior be curbed and  inflation pressure eased during the process creating a capital  goods market?    Feng Bing believes that price rises might delay the  promulgation of some specific reformist measures, but will not  affect overall reform of the macro-system. At this stage, where  the old overlaps with the new, essential administrative measures  should be kept. The urgent thing right now is to start reforms  in the financial system.    Feng Bing pointed out that now more than ever China needs  stability and understanding of reforms. It must create an  environment of "stability, legal system, and consensus" for  reforms.    In specific operations, Feng Bing draw attention to the  following points: One, the unveiling of reformist measures  should be well timed, go through a certain procedure, and  conducted scientifically to avoid "clashes between projects."  Two, make the best use of circumstances and channel reform  thought to popular actions. Three, increase the pace of  legislation; 54 of this year's 152 legislative measures concern  economic matters. Four, speed up progress toward "reentry into  GATT," which will introduce external dynamics into domestic  reforms.    This official of the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economy stated that overall, he is optimistic about the reform  situation in China this year.</p>

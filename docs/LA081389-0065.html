			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: INVENTION WAS HIS TRUE CALLING  </P> <P>  -- Next time you touch someone from a pay phone, think of William Gray, who --  100 years ago today -- filed U.S. Patent No. 408,709 for "A Coin-Controlled  Apparatus for Telephones." As usual, necessity played a role. Gray's foreman at  a Connecticut factory had refused to let him use the company phone to call his  sick wife, even though he had offered to pay. The first pay phone was installed  at the Hartford Bank, and there are now more than 2 million of them in the  United States alone, from the White House to the middle of Death Valley.  Intellicall, a manufacturer of private pay phones, notes these landmarks: The  first outdoor pay phone booth was installed in Cincinnati in 1905; the use of  slugs cost New York Telephone $417,370 in 1935; the first phone booth with a  double-hinged door was installed in 1910, and Clark Kent first used a phone  booth as a changing room in the September-October, 1949, issue of D.C. Comics.  Gray went on to conquer other challenges, inventing an inflatable chest  protector for baseball catchers.  </P> <P>  -- Another invention, the toll booth, evokes other sentiments. Residents in  Jacksonville, Fla., this weekend are celebrating the end of 36 years of tolls  in their community. "We have taken a quantum leap forward in improving the  quality of life for our city," Mayor Tommy Hazouri said at ceremonies Friday on  the Mathews Bridge, which opened in 1953. Tolls also ended, thanks to a newly  enacted half-cent city sales tax, on three other bridges and an expressway. The  atmosphere on the Mathews Bridge was festive, with crowds cheering, horns  honking and the St. Johns River City Band playing. Fireworks went off. The  mayor and Chester Stokes, chairman of the Jacksonville Transportation  Authority, climbed aboard a large yellow crane, and with the help of a crane  operator, toppled several toll booths. The Florida Times-Union proclaimed:  "Un-tolled joy: KEEP THE CHANGE."  </P> <P>  -- The Navy isn't talking, but the producers of a video showing Cher in a  revealing body stocking singing to hundreds of sailors on the battleship  Missouri said they were told that the top brass in Washington feels tarnished.  The clip was shot on Independence Day on the deck where Japan surrendered to  the Allied forces in 1945, but the Navy apparently was unaware of the video's  sexual overtones. "When you OK Cher's presence on board you have to expect the  unexpected," a spokeswoman for the singer told Reuters. LARRY PRYOR  </P></p>

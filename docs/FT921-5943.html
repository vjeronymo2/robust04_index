			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Pension funds boost voting power MEMBERS of the National Association of Pension Funds will this weekend receive notice of the setting up of a scheme to help funds use their votes when public companies ask their shareholders to approve important proposals. The proxy early-warning service announced yesterday at the NAPF's annual investment conference in Eastbourne will form part of the association's campaign to encourage member funds to vote regularly. There is a particular need in the short run to help companies to pass measures enabling them to move on to the London Stock Exchange's new Taurus electronic settlement system. It is intended to start the scheme within the next few weeks in order that the forthcoming round of end-1991 annual reports and resolutions at annual meetings can be covered. The scheme, initially covering only the biggest 125 companies, could eventually include all 650-odd constituents of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. Mr Angus Matheson, newly appointed chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, also foreshadowed several other initiatives at the annual investment conference in Eastbourne. He announced that Mr David Adams of the British Rail pension fund is to head a monitoring group which will check that investment managers are complying with a new code on the advertising of investment performance. The group would also propose changes to the code where necessary. Mr Matheson disclosed that the investment committee would soon reopen the controversy over guidelines for share-option schemes by issuing a consultative document. It would represent, he said, a search for a 'credible consensus'. He also described plans for a working party to investigate the sometimes confusing ways in which fund management firms impose charges on their pension fund clients. The proxy warning arrangement, said Mr Matheson, was intended to be useful not only to pension funds but also to companies concerned that they might not be able to achieve a quorum. The working party on remuneration is expected to study existing practices and recommend ways of improving transparency of charging. It hopes that it will be able to report later this year. Pension funds have for some years been complaining about hidden or 'dirty' charging methods through which basic fees are substantially increased, for instance by means of charges for in-house unit trusts and extra commissions for overseas transactions. Mr Brian MacMahon, NAPF chairman, yesterday attacked the government for its moves to add a 1 per cent age-related rebate to those aged over 30 who are contracted out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme through a personal pension. 'This is not the level playing field which the government advocates,' he said. 'There appears to be a definite and unjustifiable tilt in favour of personal pensions.'</p>

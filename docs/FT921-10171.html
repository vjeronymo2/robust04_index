			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Yeltsin raises spectre of dictatorship in Russia RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin yesterday warned of a new dictatorship if his government's reform programme should fail, and appealed for the support of the international community. Mr Yeltsin, who is on a three-day state visit to France, has been lavished with ceremonial honours by the French government, which will grant Russia a FFr2bn (Pounds 200m) loan to buy cereals, as well as a FFr1.5bn line of credit to import industrial goods. However, he warned: 'If Russia fails in its reforms, notably its economic reforms, a dictator will appear. Now neither Russia nor the international community can permit the appearance of a dictator. That is why the international community must contribute to the solution of the problem. 'I have confidence in our reforms, which are irreversible,' said Mr Yeltsin. 'But, if they fail, I can feel already on the back of our necks the hot breath of those who wear red shirts and brown shirts.' The prospects for new injections of western aid are not good, however. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday that Germany had reached the limit of its capacity in providing finance for the recovery of eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. However, he is convinced that it is essential to provide more large-scale assistance to the ex-Soviet republics, while linking it directly to control of nuclear and chemical weapons, and the observance of all existing disarmament treaties. In an interview with Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, and the Wall Street Journal Europe, the German leader argued more forcefully than ever that it was up to other countries in Europe, but also in particular Japan, to share the burden of helping the ailing east European and former Soviet economies. An Ecu500m (Pounds 356m) loan to the former Soviet Union to pay for food imports, held up since last November, is expected to be finalised within a week, EC officials said yesterday, Richard Waters writes from Luxembourg. The loan had been delayed by confusion caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr Karel van Miert, EC commissioner responsible for investments, said yesterday. The position has been resolved by the issuing of a guarantee by the Russian republic to back the loan. As a result, the entire Ecu500m would be lent to Russia. Relations between Russia and Ukraine deteriorated yesterday over Russian claims to the Crimean peninsula and a counter-attack by Ukraine over nuclear weapons located on its territory, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. The Crimea always a source of tension between Moscow and Kiev, was yesterday the subject of a resolution passed by Ukraine's parliament which criticised Russian legislation questioning the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine. Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk later asserted that there was no reason to hold a referendum in the Crimea on independence. Local activists began collecting signatures for a referendum this week. He also countered a statement by Mr Yeltsin this week about nuclear weapons located in Ukraine. Contrary to Mr Yeltsin's statement in the Russian press, Mr Kravchuk said only half the tactical nuclear weapons had been removed from Ukraine and that not all strategic nuclear weapons had been taken off alert.</p>

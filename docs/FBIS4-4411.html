			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- U.S. trade pressure on  South Korea this year will focus on the country's annual 1.1  million-car market, Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry  officials said Friday.    In a comprehensive survey of the practices of its trading  partners called the National Trade Estimate (NTE) released  recently, the U.S. Government designated South Korea as a  country erecting unfair barriers in the automobile sector -- a  target of investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative under  the revised Super 301 Trade Provision -- the officials said  after analyzing the NTE report.    Less pressure is expected on the country's services and  intellectual property markets.    Washington demanded that Seoul remove or lower such trade  walls as auto import duties, car taxes and national campaigns  against luxury imports that limited automobile imports to 1,463,  or 0.2 percent, of the 1.1 million-unit market last year.    Early this year, the government lowered car import duties to  the European union level of 10 percent, yielding to U.S.  pressure, but Washington continues pressing for a further cut to  2.5 percent, the same as the American rate. It also demands  removal of restrictions on foreign car advertising and dealers.    The officials said the U.S. call for a further cut in car  import duties is unacceptable because Washington "is putting  this demand to Korea only, putting aside many advanced  countries."    They admitted, however, that the 15-percent acquisition tax  on cars priced 70 million won or more is too high compared with  the 2-percent tax on autos worth less than 70 million won,  suggesting that the tax on luxury cars will be lowered.    Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su will meet  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during talks on economic  cooperation slated for April 4-5 and again during the GATT  (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) ministerial meeting  opening in Morocco on April 12. He will also visit Washington  in May in a bid to ease trade friction over automobiles.    Meanwhile, trade circles expect American pressure for a  broader opening of the services market, intensified protection  of intellectual property rights and a further reduction in  export subsidies to ease somewhat, as many of the U.S. demands  related to these issues were met during the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade negotiations last year.    But Washington will include South Korea in the priority  watch  list being announced at the end of April to push for a wider  Korean market opening.</p>

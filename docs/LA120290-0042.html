			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> AT HOME;  </P> <P> IT'S A FATHER!  </P> <P> EXPECTANT FATHERS who feel neglected during mom's pregnancy can get equal time  with the Labor Coach Kit. This playful attache case full of goodies designed to  help fathers become more involved in the labor and delivery process is the  brainchild of Elise and Dimitri Vazelakis.  </P> <P> When the couple began childbirth classes in preparation for the arrival of  their first child, Dimitri excitedly went shopping for such items as a  stopwatch to time contractions and a paper bag to prevent hyperventilation.  "But when we found there was nothing on the market that had everything in one  place to help dads," Elise says, "we developed the Labor Coach Kit and decided  to market it for soon-to-be fathers."  </P> <P> Baby Alexander arrived last March, and the Labor Coach Kit (about $35) shortly  thereafter. According to Elise, all the items in the kit -- a baseball cap,  stopwatch, therapy ball, sports bottle, telephone lineup chart to list  essential phone numbers, earplugs, time-of-delivery pool card for fans, and  flash cards containing helpful coaching tips for each stage of labor -- revolve  around a sports theme "because we felt like we were in training for the main  event," Elise says. In addition, there are assorted informational "score  cards."  </P> <P> "Some items are functional," she says, "but a lot are for fun. We want new  parents to find some humor in the situation."  </P> <P>  The Labor Coach Kit is available by mail order: P.O. Box 67308, Los Angeles  90067, or by telephoning (213) 550-8299. It is also sold at all Babyland  locations.  </P> <P> DOLORES LONG  </P></p>

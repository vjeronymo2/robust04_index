			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S LEFT FOR FERNANDO AND THAT LEFT SHOULDER?  </P> <P> In the months between the worst summer and the most anxious spring of his  baseball career, Fernando Valenzuela has had a lot of time for soul-searching.  </P> <P> Time to reflect on a year turned sour by a shoulder that gave out after 255  consecutive starts for the Los Angeles Dodgers.  </P> <P> Time to mourn a father who saw him leave the family's home in Etchohuaquila,  Mexico, for a shot at fame and fortune in El Norte, and who perhaps never quite  understood, even at the time of his death from cancer last summer, the  magnitude of his son's accomplishments on the mound.  </P> <P> And time to wonder whether he will ever recapture the magic that made him the  toast of this town as a 20-year-old rookie in 1981.  </P> <P> Those were the days of Fernandomania, of sellout crowds, of color posters  snatched by adoring fans as fast as they were printed, and of opposing batters  shaking their heads after futile attempts at hitting the kid's dazzling  screwball.  </P> <P> These are the days of uncertainty. As the Dodgers prepare for spring training  in Vero Beach, the question is not only can the team repeat its world  championship, but can Valenzuela be a factor in helping them do so.  </P> <P> The Valenzuela of even three years ago can. The one from the last couple of  seasons would have trouble cracking the starting rotation.  </P> <P> After a marvelous 21-11 season in 1986, with a National League-leading 20  complete games, Valenzuela managed only to split 28 decisions in 1987.  </P> <P> Last year, he went 5-8 with a 4.24 ERA and registered more walks than  strikeouts for the first time ever. Valenzuela was placed on the disabled list  last July 31 because of a strained left shoulder. Some baseball people  speculated that heavy use of the screwball had contributed to the injury. The  left-hander returned for two brief appearances in September but did not pitch  in the playoffs or World Series.  </P> <P> Fernando fans are pondering whether Valenzuela's shoulder has given out after  2,000 innings pitched in the majors and a few hundred more in the minor and  Mexican leagues, or whether there is any mileage left in it.  </P> <P> Nobody can be certain of that. Valenzuela, however, is optimistic about the  1989 season.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to know how much the shoulder has improved . . . but it feels  stronger," said Valenzuela during a recent workout at Dodger Stadium. "I've  worked on a program set by Pat (Screnar) since the season ended and will  continue to do so throughout spring training."  </P> <P> Screnar, the Dodger physical therapist, prepared a strengthening program for  Valenzuela that consists of different exercises with weights. "He has been  monitored during the off-season and the shoulder is definitely stronger," he  said.  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine a 28-year-old former Cy Young Award winner as a candidate  for Comeback Player of the Year, but that's what Valenzuela will be in 1989. At  least he hopes he will be. And so do a lot of his fans who have admired not  only Fernando's pitching prowess but also the way he has conducted himself with  style and dignity.  </P></p>

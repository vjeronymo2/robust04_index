			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 AT INS CENTER NAMED IN DRUG INDICTMENTS  </P> <P> A six-month undercover investigation has led to federal drug indictments  against nine people, including seven who worked at an Immigration and  Naturalization Service center, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> The indictments, issued in McAllen, were ordered unsealed Thursday after seven  arrests were made, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Crews said. An eighth person was  arrested later Thursday, he said.  </P> <P> Seven of those indicted had worked either for the INS or a private security  firm at the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, where illegal aliens are  detained before deportation, authorities said.  </P> <P> The indictments allege that cocaine and marijuana were sold to someone working  in cooperation with investigators, Crews said.  </P> <P> "The amounts of drugs are relatively small," he said. "What makes it  exceptionally significant, to us, however, is that the offenses are alleged to  have occurred either at the service processing center or by individuals  employed by the United States."  </P></p>

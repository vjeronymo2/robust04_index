			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / East Germans urged to curb pay rises A PANEL of economic experts drawn up by the German government yesterday issued a strong plea for east German workers to tone down wage rises to help recovery in the former Communist part of the country. Prof Karl Schiller, the 80-year-old former economics minister, who yesterday re-emerged before the press as the chairman of a Strategy Forum on east Germany, said 'moral suasion' was needed to curb wage rises in the east. The Forum, set up by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, concluded at its first meeting yesterday that high wages in the east were contributing to mass unemployment. Repeated calls from business and economic leaders for wage moderation have fallen upon deaf ears in both east and west. Warning strikes in the west German metalworking industry continued yesterday in pursuit of a 10 per cent pay claim with 120,000 workers downing tools for short periods. The stoppages, concentrated in the north and south-west of the country, were more limited than earlier in the week. But the metalworkers' action was supplemented by isolated stoppages yesterday in the printing industry, where workers are stepping up pressure for an 11 per cent pay increase. Mr Mollemann today meets union leaders in east Germany. He will tell them the share of wages and salaries in east German gross domestic product - at 60 per cent last year - was much higher than the 45 per cent in west Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under pressure from within the Bonn coalition over his party's waning electoral fortunes, yesterday remained defiant after cancelling a planned meeting with Bavarian party leaders. The Bavarian Christian Social Union, which has lately stepped up criticism of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats, meanwhile signalled a more conciliatory tone to limit the damage from the coalition squabble.</p>

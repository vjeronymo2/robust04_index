			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Profits dip 9% at National Bank of Canada NATIONAL Bank of Canada, the smallest of the Big Six, yesterday reported first-quarter net profit of CDollars 49.8m (USDollars 41.8m), or 32 cents a share, down 9 per cent from CDollars 55.3m, or 36 cents, a year earlier. The bank attributed the decline to the long recession, continuing high loan-loss provisions and higher non-interest expenses due to systems expansion. These factors were partly offset by the benefits of declining interest rates and good results from the investment banking and brokerage subsidiary. Return on equity was 11.3 per cent, against 13.4 per cent, and return on average assets 0.53 per cent, compared with 0.60 per cent. Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 37bn, against CDollars 36bn a year earlier. National Bank, which operates mainly in Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes, said signs of economic recovery were still meagre, but it is confident the worst is over.</p>

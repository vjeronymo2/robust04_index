			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Analysis: The 'Struggle' for Arms </F> Exports and the Struggle for Power 'At the Top'"]    [Text]  <H8>  1. </H8>   The policy of the Yeltsin regime in the sphere of trade in  Russian arms and military equipment has caused colossal  political and economic damage to the long-term state interests  of the Russian Federation.    Beginning in 1990 in Russia there has been a sharp reduction  of export deliveries of arms and military equipment. By now  military and technical cooperation with almost 30 foreign  countries has been cut back or halted. In 1992, $2.3 billion  worth of military products were sent abroad or one-third the  amount in 1991. In 1993 a total of about $2 billion worth of  high-technology military products were exported. While in 1993  the share of the United States in the exports of arms and  military equipment to developing countries reached 57 percent,  Russia's share decreased to 5.5 percent!    The incompetence of the ruling "Demothieves" is striking!  For  example, $5.4 billion worth of military products were ordered in  1992 from Russian enterprises of the military-industrial complex  for export. This order was approved by Russian Federation  Government Decree No. 171-11, of 17 March 1992, signed by Ye.  Gaydar. Domestic plants manufactured $3.1 billion worth of arms  and military equipment but only $1.1 billion worth was actually  delivered abroad.    And so in recent years, because of the lack of sales of  military products manufactured for export under unsubstantiated  orders, the lost advantage exceeded $2.6 billion, which in  October 1993 amounted to more than R3 trillion. But, in that  same 1993, the Russian Ministry of Finance was unable to find  financial resources to cover the debt to Russian peasants for  delivery to the state of 9.2 million tonnes of wheat valued at  more the R800 billion, for the construction of housing for  military servicemen at R600 billion, for the development of the  fuel and energy complex, or for solving other socioeconomic  problems.  <H8>  2. </H8>   It says in the president's 18 November 1993 edict: "In order  to provide for a state monopoly on exports and imports of arms  and military equipment to the Russian Federation, Oboroneksport,  Spetsvneshtekhnika, and the GUSK [Main Administration of Special  Contracts] shall be withdrawn from the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations and merged into the Rosvooruzheniye company  and placed under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation  Government."    Thus public opinion in the country was told that a) the  regime had reacted to the critical problem of exporting arms; b)  it had "discovered" the main cause of this problem--the lack of  unity of specialized exporters; and c) it had solved this  problem by creating a consolidated state corporation.    But the real essence of the 18 November 1993 edict lay  elsewhere. The sale of arms for export has always meant large  amounts of commission in foreign currency for lobbyists and  middlemen. Therefore various political groups in the regime have  always carefully made sure that access to this feeding trough  corresponded to the existing balance of forces at the very  "top." For example, when Burbulis was especially close to B.  Yeltsin he was given the opportunity to control arms exports  through a specially created system of deputy ministers. The  decline of Gennadiy Eduardovich led to a situation where new  people appeared among the leaders of the specialized exporters.    In the view of the top bureaucracy, in November 1993 after  the turbulent events of the preceding 10 months the time had  come for another redistribution in front of the "trough" of  military exports.  <H8>  3. </H8>   On 9 November 1993 the leader of the president's  administration, S. Filatov, sent document No. ACh-5631 to O.  Soskovets. Filatov wrote: "In my opinion, the question of  military and technological cooperation between Russia and  foreign countries requires a special review." What does he have  in mind here when Yeltsin's 18 November special edict had  already been signed?    Actually, in this document Filatov proposes that the  government in conjunction with the administration share the  "pie" of arms exports, that they act jointly against common  "enemies," and that they outline certain rules of the game on  this field under the new conditions.    The document addressed to Soskovets lists a number of  organizations and dozens of names (from the deputy prime  minister on down to the chief of the ministry department) who  would be "scapegoats" (among them were Gaydar, Khizha,  Karaoglanov, Deynekin, B. Fedorov, etc.). The selection was  broad, which provided an opportunity for Filatov to bargain with  Soskovets regarding whom to protect and how.    It says in the document: "Certain high officials from a  number of ministries and the Russian Federation Government were  drawn in to these illegal actions. In essence the commercial  structures were 'fed' at the expense of state funds." Concrete  examples follow after that. Soskovets might not like certain  cases on this list (he had to consult with Chernomyrdin). Well,  Filatov was prepared to be flexible!    On page 8 comes the conclusion: "All this indicates a lack  of  proper control on the part of the Russian Government over the  implementation of its own state decisions--over arms trade." On  page 9 there is an even more radical proposal: "To send the  materials of the inspection for consideration and the adoption  of measures to the Russian Federation procurator general."  Naturally, the latter was an obvious bluff: The most important  law of the bureaucracy is to avoid public scandals in its midst.  <H8>  4. </H8>   Ultimately the process of forming the Rosvooruzheniye state  company was an attempt at some kind of compromise among the  various groups. From the present "demi-establishment": V.  Shumeyko (he okayed the edict on the creation of  Rosvooruzheniye), O. Soskovets (he approved the edict on behalf  of the government), and V. Chernomyrdin (he approved the  company's charter)--these are the ones who immediately made  their interests known. Moreover, the extremely busy First Deputy  Prime Minister Soskovets assumed the post of chairman of the  KVTS (Interdepartmental Commission on Military and Technical  Cooperation, which is directly in charge of Rosvooruzheniye). A.  Korzhakov, the chief of B. Yeltsin's personal guard, also  announced his claims: He was given control over "observance of  state interests" in the activity of the Rosvooruzheniye state  committee. S. Filatov, whose relations with Korzhakov were not  very good, got Ye. Shaposhnikov appointed as the president's  representative on the Rosvooruzheniye state committee. And  Rosvooruzheniye itself was headed by General Ye. Samoylov--one  of Shumeyko and Grachev's men.    The following fact provides a fuller picture of the balance  of various groups. For the sake of "foreign currency funds  expenditure control" Rosvooruzheniye was to conduct its activity  through authorized banks. Even Vneshtorgbank of the Russian  Federation, which handles two-thirds of the operations for  government agreements, was not included among these privileged  banks. And the ones that were authorized were Menatep,  Most-Bank, Intermed, and the Moscow National Bank. Anyone who is  aware of the group whose interests are reflected by these  commercial banks can guess who is receiving the most from the  business of exporting arms.    The intrigue (or affair) with arms exports continues at  the very top. Against the background of the degradation of  high-technology branches of the military-industrial complex, one  can understand why the "Demothieves" hate Stalin!</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the cellular level, a substance might interfere with cellular processes like protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthesis, leading to a reduced production of neurotransmitters and brain dysfunction (Bondy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985). Nicotine and some insecticides mimic the effects of the neurotransmitter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acetylcholine. Organophosphorous compounds, carbamate insecticides, and nerve gases act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by inhibiting AChE, the enzyme that inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in a buildup of acetylcholine and can lead to loss of appetite, anxiety, muscle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> twitching, and paralysis. Amphetamines stimulate the nervous system by releasing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blocking reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from nerve cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cocaine affects the release and reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs can cause paranoia, hyperactivity, aggression, high blood pressure, and abnormal heart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rhythms. Opium-related drugs such as morphine and heroin act at specific opioid receptors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the brain, producing sedation, euphoria, and analgesia. They also tend to slow the heart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and cause nausea, convulsions, and slow breathing patterns. Other substances can alter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the synthesis and release of specific neurotransmitters and activate their receptors in specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuronal pathways. They may perturb the system by overstimulating receptors, blocking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitter release and/or inhibiting transmitter degradation, or blocking reuptake of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotransmitter precursors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also at the cellular level, the flow of ions such as calcium, sodium, and potassium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> across the cell membrane may be changed and the transmission of information between nerve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells altered. A substance may interfere with the ionic balance of a neuron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides produce autonomic dysfunction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organochlorine insecticides increase sensorimotor sensitivity, produce tremors and in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases cause seizures and convulsions (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Lindane, DDT,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pyrethroids, and trimethyltin also produce convulsions. Conversely, solvents act to raise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold for eliciting seizures or act to reduce the severity or duration of the elicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convulsions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role of excitatory amino acid (EAA)-mediated synaptic activation is critical for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal function of the CNS. Because endogenous EAA-mediated synaptic transmission is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widespread excitatory system in the brain and is involved in the process of learning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> memory, the issue of the effects of endogenous and exogenous EAA-related toxicity has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad implications for both CNS morbidity and mortality in humans. Much of the injury and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuronal death associated with toxicity is mediated by receptors for excitatory amino acids,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially glutamic acid. When applied in sufficient excess from either endogenous or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exogenous sources, EAAs have profound neurotoxic effects that can result in the destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of neurons and, as a consequence, lead to acute phase confusion, seizures, and generalized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weakness or to persistent impairments such as memory loss (Choi, 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final common path in the activation of these receptor classes is an increase in free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cytosolic Ca <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 20052070 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 20052070 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that can result in the release and activation of intracellular enzymes (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> break down the cytoskeleton) and in further release of glutamate, both of which can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cytotoxic (Choi, 1988). Critical to an understanding of the etiopathology associated with at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least some of the neurotoxic degeneration may be the link that impaired energy metabolism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could have with excitotoxic neuronal death. It is likely that reduced oxidative metabolism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in the partial depolarization of resting membrane potential, the activation of ionotropic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> membrane receptor/channels, and the influx of Ca <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 20052070 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 20052070 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or its release from intracellular stores.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

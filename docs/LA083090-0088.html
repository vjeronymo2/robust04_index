			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN SENDING MORE WARSHIPS TO GULF;  </P> <P> BUILDUP: A DESTROYER AND THREE MINE-HUNTERS WILL JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL  FLOTILLA ENFORCING U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ.  </P> <P> Declaring that Western weapons have already made "further aggression a risky  venture indeed" for Iraq, British Defense Secretary Tom King disclosed  Wednesday that his government is dispatching more warships to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> King, who is touring the region, told reporters on board the frigate Battleaxe  in port in Bahrain that three mine-hunters will be sent from the eastern  Mediterranean, along with the destroyer Gloucester from Britain. They will join  three British warships in the gulf.  </P> <P> In the little more than a week since the Bahraini government approved use of  its air bases by British forces, this small island nation, which is linked to  the Saudi mainland by a 15-mile-long causeway, has begun to bristle with  foreign arms.  </P> <P> A 12-plane squadron of Tornado fighter-bombers arrived Tuesday at Manama's  Muharraq International Airport. In addition, a battery of Rapier anti-aircraft  missiles has been deployed to protect the Tornado base.  </P> <P> Military sources said American aircraft are using another airfield, on the  southern part of the island.  </P> <P> King said the British government has no immediate plans to send ground troops  to the region, but "we are keeping all these matters under review."  </P> <P> He spoke of the "total unacceptability" of Iraq's invasion and annexation of  Kuwait and added, "We rule nothing out."  </P> <P> With the eight ships of the U.S. Middle East Task Force operating in Persian  Gulf waters, and warships from France, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands,  Spain, Belgium and Greece pledged to the gulf defenses, the waterway that  carries more than 25% of the world's oil to markets -- or did so before the  blockade of Iraqi and Kuwaiti ports -- promises to be thick with warships.  </P> <P> King said British, American and other forces are attempting to harmonize their  operations, "making sure we don't trip each other up." So far, no multinational  naval command has been established.  </P> <P> All the Western countries involved have separate intelligence operations  tracking Iraqi shipping, King said, but when asked whether there is a "big  board" somewhere collating intelligence reports, he replied, "The answer is  yes."  </P> <P> The Iraqi response to the teeming patrol forces in the gulf, which are backed  by three U.S. aircraft carriers off the Arabian Peninsula, has been to lie low,  British military officers said.  </P> <P> Lt. Comdr. Nick Harland, second in command of the Battleaxe, said, "I think  it's already become a very effective embargo."  </P> <P> He said the Battleaxe and its sister ships of what the British call their  Armilla patrol have not sighted an Iraqi ship for 10 days. The last was an  outbound tanker, riding high and empty. No attempt was made to stop or to board  the ship, he said, pointing out that the encounter took place before last  weekend's U.N. Security Council resolution permitting the blockaders to use  force.  </P> <P> With the balance of forces sharply against him at sea, Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein has ordered his tanker skippers not to resist boarders. There have been  no reports that his navy of five frigates and eight missile boats has left  Iraqi waters at the top of the gulf.  </P> <P> But among the Western ships, "it's getting very crowded," Harland said.  Nevertheless, he added, sometimes "you can go for some hours without seeing  another warship." U.S. and British ships coordinate movements on a daily basis  and patrol separate areas.  </P> <P> "We all talk to each other when we pass," he said, "trying to develop easy  relations. . . . . We also talked to the Soviets (a single frigate deployed in  the gulf), and they seemed to be very friendly."  </P> <P> On the Armilla patrol, ships at sea are at a condition of readiness called  "defense quarters," with 50% of the crew on watch at all times.  </P> <P> The highest concerns are hostile aircraft and mines. No mining has been  confirmed so far, but it is not a difficult operation. During the 1980-88 war  between Iran and Iraq, mines were laid in the gulf from low-flying helicopters  and speedboats.  </P> <P> The Battleaxe, 425 feet long, was designed for anti-submarine warfare but  carries a variety of armaments, including Exocet anti-ship missiles, a Seawolf  air-defense missile system and two Lynx helicopters, which, Harland said, "can  do all sorts of things."  </P> <P> British marines on board the Battleaxe conducted a demonstration Wednesday to  show that in an air attack, every weapon would be thrown into the battle.  Marine teams operate a hand-held Javelin anti-aircraft missile launcher.  </P> <P> "You just stand up here against this rail, get the plane in your sights and  fire," one explained.  </P></p>

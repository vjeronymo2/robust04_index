			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARLENE DIETRICH WELCOMES GERMAN REUNIFICATION  </P> <P> Lendary screen star Marlene Dietrich broke a self-imposed silence today to  welcome the unification of the Germany she has not seen for 30 years, saying  blood was thicker than water.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from her Paris retreat, Dietrich, 88, said: "Of course  I'm happy.  </P> <P> Anything that brings people together and encourages peace always makes me  happy. Happiness is so rare in this troubled world."  </P> <P> Dietrich starred on the Berlin stage in the 1920s but emigrated to the United  States in 1930 before the rise of Nazism to begin a glittering Hollywood  career.  </P> <P> At that time she said she wanted nothing more to do with her native country,  and she refused to say if she now planned a return to the newly unified  Germany.  </P> <P> "I cannot and do not want to answer that question," she told a reporter from  the Paris daily France-Soir.  </P> <P> "It will take some time for people to get used to each other again, but their  inner power will overcome. As the old saying goes, 'Blood is thicker than  water,' " said Dietrich, who last visited Germany in 1960.  </P> <P> Dietrich, famed for her husky voice, high cheekbones and legs insured by Lloyds  of London, reached Hollywood stardom in 1930's steamy "The Blue Angel." Her  other major movies include "Morocco," "Destry Rides Again," "Touch of Evil" and  "Judgment at Nuremberg."  </P></p>

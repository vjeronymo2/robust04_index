"Sometimes the people want peace so badly that the  politicians have to let them have it," said Evans, comparing the  situation in Somalia with that in Cambodia before the  implementation of a UN peace plan that he helped develop.    The minister, here on a one-day visit to visit Australian  troops, said there were "visible developments that give ground  for encouragement" in the political situation such as an  agreement between rival clans and a peace festival Sunday  attended by hundreds of thousands in the south of the city.    "The momentum for peace is developping in Somalia," Evans  said, adding there was "evident pressure from below."    Rival Mogadishu leaders Mohamed Farah Aidid and the  self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed have both  signalled a willingness to reach agreement after years of  ferocious rivalry that reduced the country to chaos and famine.    Evans also pointed to conciliatory comments made by three of  Aidid's top officials after they were released from UN custody  on Tuesday.    Osman Hassan Ali, the financier for Aidid's Somali National  Alliance (SNA), called for an end to clan violence and a  resumption of talks between his group and the UN operation in  Somalia (UNOSOM).    The Australian minister met Aidid in the Kenyan capital  Nairobi on Saturday and received assurances that the warlord  supported moves by a Mogadishu religious leader to bring the  faction together.    Aidid "did not discard a UN role in the transition in  Somalia," Evan said.    Ali Mahdi, who heads an alliance of 12 clans, also told  Evans  during a meeting Sunday that he was willing to continue talks at  the initiative of the Imam of Hirab.    "Ali Mahdi indicated a degree of flexibility in the position  of the 12 and a general willingness to do what is necessary in  order to achieve a result," Evans said.</p>

Over a two-day period, Wednesday and Thursday, Napolitano  has  met with his U.S. counterpart Thomas Foley; with the chairman of  the house foreign affairs committee, Lee Hamilton; with former  national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinsky; with the State  Department's director for European Affairs, Stephen Oxman and  with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Michael  Camdessus.    Napolitano said he received the distinct impression that  while American authorities took a keen interest in Italian  affairs, they were determined to remain impartial with regard to  the various political forces in play in Italy today. Americans  are seeking to get a better handle on the envisioned government  prospects of the Democratic Party of the Left (the former  Communist Party), the evolution of the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] neofascist party as led by Gianfranco Fini, and the  entrance onto the political scene of media mogul Silvio  Berlusconi, who they are quick to liken to Ross Perot, he said.    With regard to the Left Democrats, Napolitano stressed that  they were interested in pursuing the policy of recovery and  reconstruction launched by the present Ciampi government.    However, Napolitano would not be drawn into making any  guesses as to the outcome of the March general elections,  insisting that the results were unpredictable, although he was  fairly certain that the toughest and most innovative of the  Ciampi government's policies would be continued. Italians are  demanding renewal and recovery, he added.</p>

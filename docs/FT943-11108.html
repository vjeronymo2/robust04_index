			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Pause for breath as old fears niggle - London The disappointing response to last week's auction of Pounds 2bn government securities, and the renewed nervousness in gilts on base rate worries, is potentially alarming for equities. Just when the investment strategists were congratulating the market on successfully shifting from an interest rate to an earnings-driven phase, all the old fears seem to be returning. Or perhaps not. While BZW and Strauss Turnbull, to name only two, quickly revised their views on base rates in the light of the manufacturing sector survey from the Confederation of British Industry, there seems little overall change in views on prospects for the equity market. Unfortunately, Friday afternoon provided a sudden challenge to near-term prospects on the interest rate front. The Bank of England's willingness to see short-term rates rise dramatically brought the fear that the authorities planned a defensive strike - by raising base rates without waiting for inflation prospects to worsen. Both BZW and Strauss Turnbull went on to emphasise that the strength of recovery in equities implies that share prices still have a good deal further to go before interest rate worries become a serious problem. Strauss is raising its year-end Footsie target to 3,350-3,500, with next year expected to bring the index within a 3,600-3,750 range. The reasons given are the strong growth in gross domestic product in the UK, as elsewhere in Europe. Strauss sees growth of share earnings at near 50 per cent this year and next, with growth in dividends at a cumulative 21 per cent over the two years. NatWest Securities stresses that economic fundamentals 'do not point to an immediate rate rise'. At Kleinwort Benson, Mr Albert Edwards comments that the gilts failure merely emphasises 'equity headwinds'. The UK market is still seen, admittedly by London-based analysts, as one of the most attractively valued international markets, a view which had been strengthened by the fall in sterling against the D-Mark until that trend was reversed on Friday afternoon. The City of London has turned nervous ahead of tomorrow's Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin which, so the market rumours ran, will confirm that the Bank is worried about inflation and determined to ensure that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, does not forget it. Equities now stand at a yield discount to index-linked gilts, and this alone, comments S. G. Warburg, suggests that a pause by equities is warranted in the high-yielding equities which have been leading the stock market forward.</p>

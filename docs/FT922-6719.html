			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's Bank of England figures on sterling lending to the M4 private sector contain something for everybody. Bulls of the economy will doubtless claim that April's Pounds 5.1bn leap shows credit demand started to pick up after the election. Bears will point to the notoriously unreliable seasonal adjustment. April's growth followed a Pounds 400m fall in March. That could suggest borrowing was deferred until after polling day. More likely the series is simply erratic. Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association appear to offer some support for the optimistic school. Although there is certainly no sign of a recovery in construction and property lending, there is a faint stirring of activity in the manufacturing sector as well as in the wholesale and retail distribution trades. The figures for corporate borrowing must be treated with some caution, since prior weakness in the lending aggregate partly reflected a switch of borrowing activity to the bond market. Net corporate borrowing in the bond market was sharply down in April. So perhaps companies were simply turning back to their banks because the government was hogging the limelight in the bond market. The BBA says bank lending on house purchases is not much above the level of recent months. That suggests there is not much building society component to the official money supply figures either. Had there been a sharp rise in house lending in April, estate agents would surely have been trumpeting the turnround in the market in February. All in all, the figures point to a weak recovery at best.</p>

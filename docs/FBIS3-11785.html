In remarks to the  local press, he added the state government, which he heads, and  the federal government will continue their steadfast efforts to  promote and reach peace.    The EZLN, the governor has said, has respected the  cease-fire. Bishop Manuel Ruiz, mediator of the Chiapas  conflict, said on 26 March in San Cristobal de las Casas, the  site of the peace talks between the EZLN and the federal  government, the Zapatists' decision to halt the consultations  and declare a state of alert responds to the country's  prevailing situation. He added the date for the second peace  talks has not been set yet.    The Zapatists, according to the communique issued 25 March  and carried by the local and foreign media, came in the wake of  the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of  the Institutional Revolutionary Party, on 23 March.</p>

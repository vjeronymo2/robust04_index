			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Points to consider before you decide Before taking out a personal pension you should take advice, preferably from a fee-based independent adviser who will not be influenced by the amount of commission he can earn, writes Debbie Harrison. And you should consider these points: Will the provider remain strong financially over the long term - or does the organisation look a potential target for a takeover bid or a merger? Is the performance consistently good over the long term? Is the investment team that achieved this performance still in place? How much of my premiums will disappear in charges? Does the adviser have a good software system to check providers' real charges? Are the contract conditions flexible? Can I increase, decrease or stop payments without penalty? Can I retire early/late without penalty? Will the adviser ensure that all commission payments are stripped out of the plan if I pay on a fee basis? (If you pay on a commission basis, then opt for a series of one-off or 'single' premiums to avoid the high up-front charges associated with long-term, regular-premium plans).</p>

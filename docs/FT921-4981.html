			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Unigro to buy third Spanish unit UNIGRO, the Dutch groceries retailer and wholesaler, said yesterday that it intends to acquire the Spanish supermarket group Grelar Asturias from Banco de Bilbao y Vizcaya, marking its third acquisition of a stores group in Spain since 1989. Financial terms were not disclosed. Grelar Asturias, with annual sales equivalent to Fl 270m (Dollars 150m), operates 73 supermarkets under the El Arbol name in northwest Spain. Unigro's two previous Spanish acquisitions - the Sagara group in 1989 and Penagrande in 1991 - are also located in the Asturias, Cantabria and Castilla Leon regions of Spain. The latest acquisition will lift Unigro's Spanish turnover to roughly Fl 900m and give it a market share in north-west Spain of around 15 per cent. Unigro, which operates supermarkets in the Netherlands under the names Spar and Super, is also active in Belgium, where it generates annual turnover of Fl 900m. It had total turnover of Fl 3bn in 1990-1991. Wessanen, the Dutch foods group best known for its range of cheeses, reports net profits up by 20 per cent at Fl 105.6m for 1991 following a 5 per cent increase in turnover to Fl 3.9bn. The company said all divisions contributed to the improved result.</p>

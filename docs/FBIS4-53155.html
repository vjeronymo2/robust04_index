			<p>BFN     [Text] Rivals Telstra and Optus have teamed up with  Indonesian carrier PT [Private Limited] Indosat to lay a 2,100  km fibre-optic submarine cable linking Western Australia [WA]  and Indonesia.    The $140 million project will provide a third fibre  communications path out of Australia and reinforce WA's push to  become a regional business hub.    Companies dealing with Asia would be able to set up leased  services linking them with their trading partners and offshore  offices in the region taking advantage of the wider bandwidth  available on the new link, officials said.    The Australian cable will make land near Port Hedland and  Jakarta at the Indonesian end, providing 60 times the capacity  of the existing analogue link between Australia, Indonesia and  Singapore which will gradually be withdrawn.    A joint statement from Telecom and Optus said tenders would  be called in July for the cable which would be ready for service  by the end of 1996.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Talking to the Black Sea Fleet's veterans in Moscow,  the First Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy Admiral Igor  Kasatonov said the Russians were the predominant force in Crimea  and the Black Sea Fleet had been and would remain Russian. The  Black Sea Fleet was an integral fighting unit of the Russian  Navy, Kasatonov said.    According to Kasatonov, the most difficult stage in the  efforts to decide the Fleet's fate was over. Negotiations were  underway, he said, and moves were being made to find political  solutions to the remaining problems.    Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, Kasatonov said, the  Black Sea Fleet enjoyed, with support from the Rumanian  [Romanian] and Bulgarian Navies, superiority in both the Black  and Mediterranean Seas. It was also supported by submarines of  the Northern Fleet, he said.    According to Kasatonov, three quarters of the Black Sea  coast  had been working to protect the southern borders of the Soviet  Union, Rumania [Romania] and Bulgaria. At that time there was  not a single Turkish ship or submarine in the southern part of  the Black Sea, Kasatonov said.    If a plane took off in Turkey or a naval target appeared,  Kasatonov said, the Black Sea Fleet came to know about it in no  time.    Kasatonov wished the Ukrainian armed forces had not moved  its  attention away from NATO and switched it to the Black Sea Fleet.  As of date, Kasatonov said, up to 60,000 Ukrainian special and  other troops were stationed in Crimea. The Black Sea Fleet had  3,000 Marines and Coast Guards in the same area.    Kasatonov said "the destructive Ukrainian forces and the  British" were planning to celebrate something to be known as the  Day of the British Soldier in Sebastopol [Sevastopol], to pay  tribute to the memory of the British troops killed in the  Crimean War of 1856. Kasatonov said the Russians had four months  to prepare to honor the memory of the Russian soldiers killed in  the same war.</p>

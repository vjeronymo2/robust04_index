			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN BACKS U.S. ON PLANT  </P> <P> Britain on Wednesday backed American charges that Libya was building a chemical  weapons plant near Tripoli and said London has received independent information  to prove the allegations.  </P> <P> The British government also said it accepted the U.S. position that two  warplanes that shot down two Libyan jet fighters on Wednesday had acted in  self-defense.  </P> <P> The United States said the air clash was not linked to rising U.S.-Libyan  tension over the alleged weapons plant, which Libya says is a pharmaceuticals  factory.  </P> <P> "We have been in contact with a number of countries to make the point that we  have independent information on the Libyan chemical weapons program," a Foreign  Office spokesman said in the first British comment on the controversial plant.  </P> <P> "This information shows that the plant is very large and that there can be no  doubt it is intended for chemical weapons production," he added.  </P></p>

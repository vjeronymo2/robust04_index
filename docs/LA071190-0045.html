			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL BROKE LAW, D.A. RULES  </P> <P> The Thousand Oaks City Council violated the state's open-meeting law two weeks  ago when it voted without public notice to provide free office space for  Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, the Ventura County district attorney's  office announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> But council members -- acting on the advice of City Atty. Mark G. Sellers --  apparently did not realize that they were breaking the law when they took the  action June 26 without putting the item on the agenda beforehand, Deputy Dist.  Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said.  </P> <P> As a result, county prosecutors will not file criminal charges against Thousand  Oaks officials, Hardy said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Hardy warned officials in a letter sent to Sellers on Tuesday to  be more careful in the future. Under the Ralph M. Brown Act, a city council  cannot take action on a measure unless the item has been posted on an agenda at  least 24 hours before the meeting.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks council members had tried to get around the Brown Act requirement  by declaring an emergency, which would have allowed them to vote on the measure  without public notice. But Hardy said VanderKolk's request for office space at  the old city library on Wilbur Road could hardly be construed as a calamity  that needed immediate attention.  </P> <P> "Our primary concern now is to assure that no future violations of the Brown  Act be committed by your City Council," Hardy wrote. "Please understand that  repeated violations of the Brown Act may result in our concluding that such  actions, rather than innocent mistakes, are really deliberate abuses of the  act."  </P> <P> Sellers, who has served as city attorney for six years, said the district  attorney's decision is unfair.  </P> <P> "They took a hard, fixed position" without seeking the city's side of the  story, Sellers said. "They didn't want to talk to me. They just went on their  own merry way. It's a silly investigation, it's a silly issue, and it's an  unfortunate situation."  </P> <P> Sellers defended the council's action, saying that VanderKolk had asked the  city officials the day before the meeting for the office space, which she said  she needed immediately. He said that according to his interpretation of the  open meeting law, the council was allowed to act on the request because it was  made after the agendas were prepared.  </P> <P> Although the council was scheduled to vote again on the issue late at its  meeting Tuesday night in an attempt to clear the record, VanderKolk said  Tuesday afternoon that she is no longer interested in using the office.  </P> <P> "The last thing I need right now is public controversy," said VanderKolk, who  defeated Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in the June election by 98 votes. "I  don't want to start on a bad note."  </P> <P> VanderKolk had requested use of the office because she said she had nowhere to  work until she takes over Schaefer's position in January. At that time, the  county will provide VanderKolk with funds to rent office space in the 2nd  Supervisorial District, which is centered in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Since the city had unused space, officials thought it would be a nice gesture  to allow VanderKolk to use an office rent-free.  </P> <P> "People look at this thing as a gratuitous thing when it's a gesture of  goodwill," VanderKolk said.  </P> <P> She said she will conduct business out of her home until she takes office in  January.  </P> <P> A complaint by Gregory P. Cole, a Thousand Oaks dentist and a Ventura County  Community College District trustee, prompted the district attorney's office to  investigate the matter.  </P> <P> Cole, a supporter of Schaefer, said he was so irritated that the council did  not place the item on the agenda or allow public comment on the issue that he  requested the investigation. Hardy agreed to look into the matter, as he does  on all alleged violations of the open-meeting law.  </P></p>

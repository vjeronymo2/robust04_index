			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] As the inauguration of the new president of South  Africa draws near, the relationship between outgoing President  F.W. de Klerk and his likely successor, ANC [African National  Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, has plummeted.    It appears from public statements that Mr Mandela is finding  it difficult to contain his impatience and contempt for Mr de  Klerk's handling of national affairs.    Tension between the leaders stems primarily from a  disagreement as to who should dictate the course of action to be  taken in the weekly crises that have been occurring during the  pre-election period.    It was evident two weeks ago during the crisis in  Bophuthatswana, and it showed itself again at a press conference  in Pretoria on Thursday over the impending crisis in kwaZulu.    Mr Mandela made it quite plain two weeks ago that he was not  satisfied with the agreement Mr de Klerk obtained from  Bophuthatswana's former president, Lucas Mangope, that he would  participate in the elections.    It did not follow that this implied co-operation in allowing  free and fair elections to take place, he said. He was not  satisfied, and insisted that IEC [Independent Election  Committee] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler be sent to  Bophuthatswana to secure these assurances from Mr Mangope.    As it turned out, Mr Mandela was right, and his concerns  that  Mr de Klerk dismissed so confidently were in this case justified.    Not only did Mangope start making noises that he would  renege  on his agreement on participation in the elections, but he could  not give satisfaction to Judge Kriegler that he would co-operate  with the IEC.    The handling of the crisis in kwaZulu has once again drawn  the two men together -- to argue and to disagree.    On Thursday Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk could not agree on  the  course of action to be taken in the violence-ridden homeland.  Mr Mandela wanted swift action; Mr de Klerk wanted to hold  back a little longer.    After the meeting, Mr Mandela referred at great length to  the  attack that Mr de Klerk made on ANC secretary-general Cyril  Ramaphosa, who had called for the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council] to replace the kwaZulu government with an administrator.    "Unfortunately, Mr de Klerk has not acted like a state  president who himself is interested in ensuring that there  should be free and fair elections in that province," Mr Mandela  said. "He has acted not like a state president but like a petty  politician who is concerned with electioneering and is ignoring  major national issues facing our country."    He also accused Mr de Klerk of refusing to address the  question that the kwaZulu government was using state funds to  destabilise the elections.    "We regard this statement as cheap politicking, and it is  for  that reason that I think the people of South Africa are  determined to throw out the National Party in the elections," Mr  Mandela said.    "I am completely disgusted," he continued.    "I have refrained from handling matters in a way that will  complicate Mr de Klerk's own problems. I don't get a similar  response and cooperation from him. I totally condemn the manner  in which he is handling national issues."    Mr de Klerk has not responded to this latest attack.</p>

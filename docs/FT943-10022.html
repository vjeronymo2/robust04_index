			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Sport: Cricket and its gift of boredom Sporting events are, I have decided, much more rewarding when attended in the north of England. Compared with its London counterpart, a football match at Old Trafford is a rich occasion; rugby league, which is almost exclusively northern, creates a more intense and genuine atmosphere than any other sport. And, for all its grandeur, Lord's cricket ground is an unyielding, forbidding place when contrasted to Headingley in Leeds. Lord's is so sure of its own legendary status that it need extend no welcome to those non-members who wish to partake of its myth; entering the ground is a great pleasure, but there is something nerve-wracking about it, as if at any moment one might be stopped and thrown out for harbouring seditious, anti-cricketing thoughts. Entering Headingley is almost hilariously informal. One waves a bit of paper at a cheery Yorkshireman - 'Go on, love, you're alright' - and suddenly there one is, close enough to the outfielders to see the nicotine stains on Philip Tufnell's fingers. To be, as I was on Saturday, at a Test match that has the aspect of a game of village cricket is wonderfully comforting. That old boy with the Deputy Dawg moustache and the gammy walk, why, that's Graham Gooch. And that big lumbering chap, could be the local pig farmer, that's Gus Fraser - not a bad bowler, he can get a bit of pace up. The South Africans look a little more rigorous, as if they have come to the village green to win the game rather than enjoy the beers afterwards. But the general impression given by the players is of an aimless ordinariness quite unlike the highly-defined sheen, the air of conscious physicality, acquired by most professional sportsmen. Of course, as with village cricket - or 'Statues', as my mother once called it, after she and I had watched my brother make about five runs in five hours - a Test match seen from this homely, parochial perspective is very boring. That does not matter, but it is true, and I believe nobody who denies it. Anyone who is perturbed that the years are slipping by too quickly should go to lots of cricket matches. Then life will seem about twice as long. Theoretically, every cricket ball bowled carries with its flight a little hope, that this time something spectacular might happen. Yet that feeling evaporates very easily. When, on Saturday, Philip DeFreitas took two wickets with consecutive balls, Headingley was galvanised and for some minutes every delivery was greeted with comic-strip whoops and winces. But in effect, all that had happened was that there had been a respite from the boredom. For a few moments, time had passed unnoticed; soon, every second would regain its full weight. The beauty, and the bane, of Test cricket is that it replicates precisely the rhythms of life: the long expanses of nothingness, the sudden flurries of adrenalin. If one submits to this, one finds contentment. Sometimes, though, there is a slightly precious quality to this submission, especially at Lord's, where the cognoscenti behave as if they had found an almost religious significance in the game. Yes, they are right, the boringness of cricket has a point to it; within those longueurs lie infinite amounts of patience and strategy; but they are still longueurs and there is nothing inherently magical about that fact. At Headingley, the boredom is accepted with much greater simplicity. The crowd submits itself to the rhythms of the game, but it does so with ease and humour, rather than an air of mock-holiness. When the game gets boring, people do what they would do when their lives get boring: they nip off for a pint, they study the crossword, they dig into their hampers and come up with a surreptitious sandwich. They don't bother to hide their languor beneath a panama hat or the Daily Telegraph or a self-conscious expression of mystic communion. They just accept, and wait, and hope. It is almost impossible, in this sensible place, to connect the desultory spectacle before one's eyes with the effect that it has upon the world outside that expanse of green. That decent young fellow with the slight, apologetic stoop - can he really be Michael Atherton? Can the contents of those untidy pockets, in which his hands are even now being casually placed, really have engrossed the attention of nations as remote as Australia and Pakistan? One even begins to wonder if it really matters that much who wins or loses; which makes one realise how very different the actuality of sport is from the version that television, and indeed newspapers, have made familiar. How odd it is to see a wicket taken within the natural progress of the game, to see it taken only once, to see it taken without the benefit of analysis. One is forced back on oneself - one's own opinions, one's own emotions. One is forced to take a wider view, in every sense: the drama between bowler and batsman is the focus, but it is part of something real, part of the lives of both players and spectators, not an artificial and disembodied highlight. The significance of the event is muted, of course. We are so used to having our instincts magnified by commentators, so used to having life edited for us by the fast forward, the rewind, the slow motion replay. But it is good sometimes to accept the whole for what it is, rather than to rely on the interpretations of an outside agent. Boredom is a small price to pay for the pleasure of true engagement with a sporting occasion.</p>

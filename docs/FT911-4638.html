			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / US troops survey sites in Iraq for Kurdish havens US TROOPS yesterday moved into northern Iraq to begin surveying sites for six or seven refugee centres for Iraqi Kurds under the protection of US, British and French forces. Initial Pentagon plans envisage between 5,000 and 10,000 US soldiers building, running and guarding the camps. Protection against possible Iraqi attack will be provided mostly by 'quick reaction forces' of army and marine units based outside Iraq, probably in Turkey, and mainly US combat air patrols. Britain is expected to send about 2,000 troops. The UK 1st Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment, was last night on standby. France is to supply about 1,000 troops. Mr Pete Williams, Pentagon spokesman, said it would be two weeks before the camps were 'ready to go'. He added that the refugees would probably be disarmed to prevent the camps becoming bases for Kurdish rebels. Iraq denounced the move as a continuation of unwarranted foreign intervention in its affairs. It said it would hamper what Mr Ahmed Hussein Khudayer, foreign minister, described as Baghdad's own efforts to resolve the refugee problem. A ceremony at which United Nations and Iraqi officials would have signed an agreement on a plan for UN relief camps was abruptly cancelled at Iraq's request. An Information Ministry official said it 'needed to study further' some parts of the plan, which would establish 'humanitarian centres' operated by civilian UN personnel in northern and southern Iraq. In Luxembourg European Community foreign ministers last night backed US insistence that the return to Iraq was justified under the UN's resolution 688. But the Anglo-US-French move took senior UN officials off guard. Ambassador Eric Suy, who heads a UN team visiting Iraq to discuss the refugee crisis, described the allied plan as 'absolutely a new element in the light of which we will have to reconsider our position'. Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN Secretary General, said in Paris that the western plan to deploy troops in northern Iraq would require Baghdad's permission. 'We would like first to be in contact with the Iraqi authorities, to see what would be their reaction to such a military presence on their territory,' he said. Mr Perez de Cuellar said that, if the troops were to be deployed under the aegis of the UN, 'it would be necessary to obtain the agreement of the Security Council'. Britain stressed its desire for the work of allied troops to be transferred to the UN as soon as possible. Downing Street indicated it would support another UN resolution to that effect if necessary. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said his motive had been to take action as swiftly as possible. 'We do not have a long time to leave the Kurds where they are at the moment,' he said. The prime minister received support from opposition parties for his persistence in pushing his plan for havens.

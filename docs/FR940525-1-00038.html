			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the banking organization's exposure to be converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent typically is the full face value of the item. However, for direct credit substitutes, such as purchased subordinated securities that are carried on the balance sheet that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from a third-party asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the banking organization's off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the banking organization's off-balance sheet exposure may be the same or greater than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the banking organization's balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For risk-based capital purposes, non-standard representations or warranties a banking organization may extend in transferring assets (including the transfer of servicing rights), or may assume in other transactions, including the acquisition of loan servicing rights, are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 27a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Standard representations and warranties, which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights are acquired. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions that provide for the return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Representations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  are statements, express or implied, regarding a past or existing fact, circumstance, or state of facts pertinent to a contract, which is influential in bringing about the agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Warranties <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  are promises that certain facts are truly as they are represented to be and that they will remain so, subject to specified limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A cash advance by a loan servicer does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. A servicer cash advance is an arrangement under which the servicer advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> D. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before an off-balance sheet item can be incorporated into the risk-based capital ratio, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount of the item must be determined. Once the credit-equivalent is determined, the amount is then assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The method for determining the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is set forth in section III.E.2 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount is determined by multiplying the full amount of the banking organization's exposure under the item by the applicable credit conversion factor as set forth below and in Attachment IV to this appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The sufficiency of collateral and guarantees for off-balance sheet items is determined by the market value of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the face amount of the item, except for interest- and exchange-rate contracts, for which this determination is made in relation to the credit-equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B of this Appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in sections III.B.5 and III.D.1 of this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of a banking organization's exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with the item against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of banking organization's exposure may be the same or greater than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of standby letters of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of a customer's loan or debt instrument that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the full face value of an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount and incorporated in weighted risk assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital requirement. However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction is limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the institution if this amount is less than the effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other claim supported by the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

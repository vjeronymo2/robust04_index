			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (12): Democracy from the top - Appraising a decade of Hosni Mubarak IN OCTOBER 1991 Hosni Mubarak celebrated his 10th anniversary as Egypt's third president. Asked to list his greatest achievements, the former Air Force pilot was characteristically plainspoken. First, he said, came the great improvement in Egypt's infrastructure. Next came a widening of democracy. No one would dispute the first of Mr Mubarak's claims. Many would challenge the second. Egypt has a freer press than it ever did under previous presidents. Elections to the People's Assembly in November 1990 maintained the oppositions's minority voice in the legislature. Compared with most of its Arab neighbours Egypt remains a bastion of tolerance. But 1991 also marked Egypt's 20th year under a constitution that enshrines what the French call an etat rais, (rais being the Arabic for leader). Under the Egyptian system, presidential decrees have the power of law. The head of state effectively appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers, armed forces and security chiefs, provincial governors, university presidents and other officials. Last year was also Egypt's 10th under Emergency Law. Enacted at the time of the assassination of Mr Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar al Sadat, the law permits arbitrary detention for up to 60 days and trial for some crimes in State Security Courts with no right of appeal. Human rights groups charge Egypt's security forces with systematic abuse of the law including the practice of torture. More outspoken opponents say trigger-happy police have shot suspects, usually Islamic activists, in cold blood. Egypt's much-touted freedom of the press is true enough if taken literally to mean the printing press. Opposition newspapers can be hysterical in their attacks on the regime. But literacy is barely above 50 per cent. The important media television and radio remain state monopolies; their version of events is heavily doctored to express the government line. Film, theatre and music are censored for overtly political content, and recent cases have shown that even book publishing is not safe from officialdom's scissors. Given the persuasive powers of the state it is hardly surprising that the ruling National Democratic Party has retained an 85 per cent majority of seats in the People's Assembly through the three general elections held since Mubarak took office. After a promising flowering under the relative liberty of the early 1980s, the legal opposition's continuing ineffectualness has demoralised Egyptian democrats. The government does not deserve all the blame for the opposition's failure. Egypt's half dozen opposition parties, which ostensibly represent trends from Green to National Socialist to Liberal to Islamic, have proved remarkably inept at gaining grass-roots support. Still, there is one political trend that challenges the government: political Islam. Its activists range from pious liberals and mainstream Moslem Brothers to violent extremist fringes. In the past decade, as Egyptian society has grown more conservative, the breeding ground of fundamentalism has grown. Unlike many neighbouring governments, however, the Mubarak regime has proved adept at containing the Islamicist tide. By control of religious broadcasting, mosque sermons and Islamic institutions the Egyptian state has coopted Moslem orthodoxy. Although permitted to operate, political groups such as the Moslem Brothers are carefully circumscribed. Extremists face the harsh teatment of the security forces. What the government fears more, and with good reason, is the emergence of economic problems that may arouse popular anger. Memories of serious urban riots over bread prices in 1977 have not faded. Mubarak's advisers are aware that food prices sparked the riots that forced governments in Algeria and Jordan to loosen their holds on power. When he spoke of being proud of Egypt's democracy, Mr Mubarak did not have the Algerian model in mind. For the President and his lieutenants Egypt's stability - meaning the stability of the regime  - will always be paramount. Faced with a choice between popular unrest and sticking to economic reform, Mr Mubarak would probably choose to let down his foreign creditors.</p>

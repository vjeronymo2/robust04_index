			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following review of the 17 May  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Publishers of Book Criticizing Islam Condemned    2. Shop Signs Must Be in Arabic    3. Grand Imam To Inaugurate Round of Lectures for Imams    4. Reasons for, Options of Repeated Pilgrimage Viewed    5. Writer Assails Mufti Over Court Case    6. Preacher Recounts Incident of Challenging Extremists    7. Satellite Dishes: Moral or Immoral?    8. Islamic Ifta' Council: Imams for or Against?    9. The Koran at the White House    10. Writer Condemns Yemeni War    11. Saudi Preacher Interviewed    12. Copts Congratulate Muslims on 'Id al-Adha    13. Writer Laments State of Muslims During 'Id al-Adha  <H5>  PUBLISHERS OF BOOK CRITICIZING ISLAM CONDEMNED </H5>   Salah 'Abd-al-Mu'ti writes in a 300-word report on page 1  about "a new crime committed by the General Book Committee,"  which has published a book entitled "Toward the Real  Islam--Studies in the Koran Bring to Light the True Islam" by  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-'Arusi, a professor at an unspecified  university. The book attacks some Islamic rites and rituals and  their timing. The writer also makes some "demands" such as  "unifying prayer times, the world over, for all Muslims,  throughout the year." The writer claims his motive for writing  the book was that "it became evident that we are remote from  Islam while clinging to its facade and have forgotten its  essence." The report maintains that the Awqaf Ministry will  prepare a book to counter these arguments.  <H5>  SHOP SIGNS MUST BE IN ARABIC </H5>   A 100-word report by Mustafa 'Alam-al-Din on page 2 says  that  Cairo Governor 'Umar 'Abd-al-Akhar has demanded strict measures  against shop-owners who use foreign languages in their shop  signs. He threatened to withdraw the licenses of those who  violate this law. "The language of the Koran, the Arabic  language which is this country's national language, should be  respected," the report says.  <H5>  GRAND IMAM TO INAUGURATE ROUND OF LECTURES FOR IMAMS </H5>   On page 2 'AQIDATI carries another unattributed 100-word  report that on 17 May Grand Imam of al-Azhar Jad-al-Haq 'Ali  Jad-al-Haq will inaugurate "the 25th round for imams and  preachers of the Islamic world organized by the General  Secretariat of the al-Azhar Higher Council for the Call." The  report lists the countries participating as well as the speakers  and lecturers.  <H5>  REASONS FOR, OPTIONS OF REPEATED PILGRIMAGE VIEWED </H5>   Page 3 of 'AQIDATI features an opinion survey by Musa Hal  and  Mahmud 'Ushub polling ordinary citizens, imams, and men of  religion on the issue of the fairness of performing the  pilgrimage more than once in a lifetime. Islamic shari'ah  stipulates that pilgrimage once in a lifetime is enough, but  many citizens travel every year. They have turned pilgrimage  into what travel agents are calling "touristic pilgrimages."  The issue here is that the Islamic Conference Organization has  set quotas on the number of pilgrims that various countries can  send, giving well-to-do pilgrims an edge over the poor. Among  other men of religion, the survey poses this question to the  mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, who maintains that  "those capable of performing the pilgrimage every year should  give an opportunity to those who have never done so in their  life." He believes there is nothing in the shari'ah that can  prevent the issuance of a law on this matter. Other men of  religion agree with the mufti's opinion and claim that instead  of performing the pilgrimage a second time, people should donate  food and money to the poor. To conclude, the survey interviews  a psychiatrist who analyzes the reasons why people perform the  pilgrimage over and over again, including such things as habit,  religious overstatement, and tourism.  <H5>  WRITER ASSAILS MUFTI OVER COURT CASE </H5>   In his 400-word column on page 6 entitled "With All  Frankness," Basyuni al-Halawani maintains that the "Court ruling  the mufti of the republic, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, secured  to imprison Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il, Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, and their  colleague 'Ali Faruq, is not a victory for the mufti in this  case against those who do not agree with his opinion and oppose  some of his fatwas and teachings. The real arena for settling  such a matter is the arena of the intellect, opinion, and  counteropinion, not in court where only the guilty and deviant  normally go." Al-Halawani stresses that he does not defend one  side against the other, but says he is sad at the state of  affairs our wise men have reached. He reminds the mufti that  "Islam set the ideal principles and bases for dialogue and  allowed each individual to express his opinion and ideas in a  way that does not abuse others." The writer concludes that some  ulema tend to forget these basic Islamic principles, thus losing  the people's confidence in them.    PREACHER RECOUNTS INCIDENT OF CHALLENGING EXTREMISTS    A 200-word unattributed report on page 7 cites a sermon by a  preacher in which he tells a story that happened to him 20 years  ago when he challenged the ideology of the Repudiation and  Renunciation Group as a student in his village in al-Sharqiyah.  Three bearded men with a great deal of money settled in his  village, bought many houses and shops, and claimed that true  Muslims do not need to work since God provides for all their  needs. At first they had a great following, but he managed to  expose them by watching them for 24 hours. He found out that  truckloads of various supplies were being delivered to them at  0300 in the morning. He informed the residents of the village  who kicked them out of their village.  <H5>  SATELLITE DISHES: MORAL OR IMMORAL? </H5>   In a 3,000-word report on page 8 prepared by Musa Hal,  questions from citizens on various religious issues are  answered. One query comes from a young girl in al-Daqahliyah  Governorate on whether the large-scale use of satellite dishes  is moral or not. This is answered by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Athim  al-Humayli, member of al-Azhar's Fatwa Committee, who is  flattered by the young lady's concern about such a matter. He  ascertains that the same law that applies to other media applies  to the dish. In other words, the use of the dish in itself is  not bad, but if the programs it brings to the viewer are  immoral, "then the Muslim state is reponsible for putting an end  to this." He says: "The West has directed these dishes at us;  they are dishes for hunger and starvation. There is evil in  them. This goes against our religion because religion wants  mankind to improve themselves and elevate their feelings and  conscientiousness."  <H5>  ISLAMIC IFTA' COUNCIL: IMAMS FOR OR AGAINST? </H5>   Jamal Salim's 2,000-word report on page 10 feels the pulse  of  various imams and muftis on the establishment of a higher  council for ifta' [legal jurisdiction] in the Islamic world. He  cites various religious leaders from Macedonia, Bosnia,  Belgrade, Singapore, and elsewhere, all of whom support the  establishment of such a council. "Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi,  the mufti of Egypt, also supports the establishment of such a  council for muftis. He said he will work with all his might to  establish it" the writer maintains. Al-Azhar University  President Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh has a different opinion  on the matter, though. He believes that "al-Azhar's Islamic  Research Center could serve instead of such a council, if  everyone adheres to its fatwas."  <H5>  THE KORAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE </H5>   A 100-word report on page 20 cites a report in the French  magazine JEUNE AFRIQUE that President Bill Clinton discovered in  September that there is no copy of the Koran in the White House.  He was preparing a speech to be delivered at the signing  ceremony of the peace agreement between the Palestinians and the  Israelis. One of his aides drew his attention to the fact that  he had used quotes from the Bible and the Torah, but not the  Koran. The magazine claims "Clinton used a copy of the Koran  from one of the libraries in Washington."  <H5>  WRITER CONDEMNS YEMENI WAR </H5>   In a 200-word column on page 20, 'Adil Dayf wonders in whose  interest the internecine fighting in Yemen is taking place. He  stresses that the sole beneficiaries are "the foreigners, of  course." The Yemeni people are the losers, as is the Islamic  world and nation. Dayf says: "We call on the sons of the  nation to set aside their marginal differences and concentrate  their efforts on catching up with progress while adhering to  their religion, which condemns all forms of violence and  destruction, and always calls for forgiveness."  <H5>  SAUDI PREACHER INTERVIEWED </H5>   On page 20 'AQIDATI carries an interview by Mustafa Yasin  and  Tariq 'Abdallah with Dr. Mana' Khalil al-Qattan, a Saudi Islamic  preacher, in which he discusses attacks by Westerners and the  West's hostility, which are the two most dangerous things for  Islam now. He also stresses that all Islamic resources should be  unified to serve contemporary matters.  <H5>  COPTS CONGRATULATE MUSLIMS ON 'ID AL-ADHA </H5>   A 400-word article on page 23 by Mamduh Bishri carries  congratulations to the Muslims on 'Id al-Adha from the Copts of  Egypt. The column notes that both religions stress love for our  fellow man.  <H5>  WRITER LAMENTS STATE OF MUSLIMS DURING 'ID AL-'ADHA </H5>   In his last-page 500-word column entitled "A Call to Common  Sense", al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf wishes he could have  congratulated the Muslim world on 'Id al-Adha with an open heart  and great hope for the future. He says he hoped the 'Id would  have come after the Muslims had succeeded in saving their  brothers in Bosnia, started developing Somalia, helped the  Muslim minorities around the world, and had a greater say in the  new world order. "In fact, we were surprised that the  government crisis in `united' Yemen turned into a civil war", he  laments.</p>

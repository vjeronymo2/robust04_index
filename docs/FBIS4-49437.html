			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview by staff reporter Zhou Qing (0719 1987) with </F> Liang Heng, Deputy Director of the State Press and Publications  Administration; date, place not given: "A Common Problem For  Almost 10,000 Kinds of Newspapers and Publications Is To Improve  Quality -- Liang Heng, Deputy Director of the State Press and  Publications Administration, Answers This Reporter's Questions"]    [Text] [Zhou] There are now 2,040 kinds of newspapers and  7,596 kinds of magazines in China, totaling 9,636 kinds. The  increase in their numbers is astonishing. These almost 10,000  kinds of publications are important weapons in fostering  socialist spiritual civilization. They are busily providing  readers with spiritual food and are greatly affecting all of  society. Facing this unprecedented situation, what are the main  guiding principles of the State Press and Publications  Administration in its management over publications?    [Liang] There is a need to change two concepts in  publications management at present. First, attention should be  switched from increasing the quantity to improving the quality.  As Comrade Ding Guangen [chief of the Propaganda Department]  has pointed out: Macromanagement over propaganda and culture  should be strengthened, with attention paid to providing  guidance, controlling the total amount, improving the  composition, and producing better results. This is also an  important task of the State Press and Publications  Administration. Of course, we can discuss whether these almost  10,000 kinds are adequate or not. As a matter of fact, they  will increase in the future. The most urgent problem at  present, however, is to review their quality, whether their  composition is rational or not, and how their results are. For  a time in the past, the department in charge focused its  attention on running new publications and did not care much  about problems emerging in publications. As a result, a  situation arose in which "new publications were increasing" and  "the bad coexisted with the good." This situation must be  changed. The existing publications should be managed and run  well before running new publications. At least, there should be  basically no approval for new publications in the near future.    Second, tough criteria should be set for management. There  are two criteria in press and publications management. One is  the minimum criterion, which means that a publication must meet  publication standards, its contents must not violate state law,  and its publication procedures must not go against publication  regulations. Some of the publications that have met this  criterion are neither good nor bad; others are borderline cases;  still others are like certain industrial enterprises --  consuming much, but producing low economic results. It will not  do to maintain our management at this level. The other  criterior is the maximum, which requires publications to be  first-rate in all aspects. Requiring every issue of a  publication to be problem-free may be a little excessive, but  this can be achieved if efforts are made. This criterion is  determined by the particularity of publications. For example,  management over material products is like filling a bamboo  basket with bricks; it does not matter if the basket is woven  tightly, or a little loosely. Management over spiritual  products is like filling a pail with water, allowing no leakage.  Let us compare management over material products to repairing a  highway; if there is a hole on the highway, a car can still  skirt it. Management over spiritual products is like repairing  an aqueduct; if there is a breach in one of the dikes, the  aqueduct will leak.    This high criterion is for the sake of the people, the  reader, and the next generation. A manager should be very  careful, as careful as walking on a thin ice; on the other hand,  he should be brave and firm, and try to achieve the best results.    [Zhou] On publications' quality criteria, what specific  management requirements do you have in mind?    [Liang] Whether or not a publication is run well depends,  generally speaking, on whether or not it can fulfill the main  task set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin for current propaganda  and ideological work. This main task is to hold firm to the  fundamental principle of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, to arm the people with scientific  theory, to guide the people with correct public opinion, to  create good images with a noble spirit for the people, and to  encourage the people with fine works. There are six primary  aspects of quality in terms of what can be seen in the layout  (there is also personnel quality and operational situation  relating to the layout):    1. Political quality -- Unquestionably, the first demand on  newspapers and publications is a correct and firm political  orientation. On the one hand, this is because newspapers and  publications are spiritual food, and rotten food should not be  given to others; as mass media, newspapers and publications  should not mislead the country by providing wrong guidance. On  the other hand, newspapers and publications have a commercial  nature, and publishers frequently overlook social effects out of  commercial motives. The political quality of newspapers and  publications is sometimes like a boat sailing against the  current: A slight absence of mind could weaken their political  quality.    2. Information quality -- As we are focusing on economic  construction and on developing the socialist market economy, we  should particularly stress the importance of information. This  is the main function of newspapers and publications in serving  the four modernizations. For periodicals, information quality  alone is not adequate, there also should be academic quality.    3. Cultural quality -- Newspapers and publications fall into  the category of culture. Their cultural quality has a direct  impact on readers' sentiments.    4. Publishing quality -- This refers to the quality of  editing, proofreading, composition, printing, and binding.    5. Advertising quality -- The development of the socialist  market economy has brought about the great development of the  advertising business. Publishing advertisements has become  another main function of newspapers and publications in serving  society. In particular, advertisements have occupied large  spaces in newspapers. Whether an advertisement is true or false,  poorly or beautifully printed, directly affects the newspaper's  quality.    6. Circulation quality -- All the functions of newspapers  and publications finally manifest themselves when they reach the  reader. No matter how much a newspaper contains, it must have a  certain quantity. Under the socialist market economy structure,  in which efficiency and results are valued highly, the amount in  circulation should be taken as the basic factor in assessing the  quality of newspapers and publications and as a necessary  assessment criterion.    For newspapers and publications in open circulation, none of  these six aspects of quality are dispensable.    [Zhou] What is the management policy to ensure the  fulfillment of these requirements?    [Liang] First, we should control the quantity and improve  the  quality, with the focus on two procedures -- one being an  approval procedure and the other being a routine management  procedure.    1. "Three principles" on management over approval.    This year three principles on approval have been  implemented:  Basically no approval is granted; approval is granted after an  adjustment; and approval is decided on improvement in  management. After a large increase in newspapers and  publications over the last few years, they basically have coped  with economic construction and the people's cultural needs.  Therefore, approval for new newspapers and publications  basically has stopped this year. If provinces and units wish to  run new newspapers and publications, they should reduce the  original newspapers and publications. The number of new  newspapers and publications to be approved depends on the number  of old newspapers and publications reduced. No approval will be  granted to new newspapers and publications if the old newspapers  and publications are not reduced, the purpose being to promote  the good and eliminate the bad. In addition, management quality  will be taken into account; no approval will be granted if  management does not improve. This will be taken as a condition  so as to improve management.    2. "Three measures" for daily management.    Daily management gradually should take on a procedural  nature  and should proceed in a scientific way, with the aim of  establishing a normal and effective mechanism. First, we should  pay attention to assessment. An annual assessment of newspapers  and publications will be carried out so as to make them meet  minimum criteria. After an assessment, bad-quality newspapers  and publications with a low circulation must be eliminated  resolutely. Second, we should pay attention to appraising the  good so that the good will meet the maximum criteria. This was  begun many years ago, and the results were very good. In a  region and a department, there is a need to establish several  influential newspapers and publications to promote the rest.  Third, we should pay attention to grading. After fulling the  first and second measures, scientific grading gradually will be  introduced to all newspapers and publications to form a rational  management mechanism. After grading, different management will  be exercised over advertisements, distribution, operations, and  position titles. The grades of newspapers and publications will  be adjusted according to the annual assessment and appraisal,  forming a normal, self-restrictive, and stimulative mechanism.    To summarize, there are two transformations, six criteria,  three principles, and three measures. In the past, our main  efforts were devoted to increasing the number of newspapers and  publications. Now efforts should be switched to improving  quality. This is a difficult change, but we are confident of  carrying out this task.</p>

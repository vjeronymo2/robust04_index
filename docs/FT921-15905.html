			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Portugal's pioneering approach to product research pays off: An unusual alliance between academics and industry has won praise from the Community WITH limited government resources to fund research programmes and few companies able to undertake their own research, Portuguese academics and industry have formed an unusual alliance by creating private institutions to help companies develop products and improve their production and management techniques. Among them, the Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores (Inesc), which specialises in information technology, telecommunications and computers, has won praise from the European Community for its pioneering approach. Its success has encouraged others such as the Oporto-based Instituto de Engenharia Mecanica e Gestao Industrial (Inegi) which concerns itself with engineering and management. Today there are 17 such institutions in Portugal covering a wide range of sectors from biotechnology to physics. Inesc was founded in 1980 as a private non-profitmaking organisation by academics and state-owned telecommunications companies which wanted to pool research resources. Today it has a budget of Es5bn (Dollars 36.4m) and has added training and sponsorship of new high-technology companies to its research and development work. Finance comes from Inesc's shareholders, which include companies and universities, from participation in EC programmes such as Esprit and Race, and from research contracts. It is involved in about 50 large research projects. 'The government didn't have the money to meet our needs, so we adopted a (North) American model. We offered to train engineers and technicians for the big companies so that they don't have to send people abroad, and in return they help to finance our work and our equipment,' says Prof Jose Tribolet, a founding member of Inesc. Inesc has trained more than 5,000 young technicians  - school students with no work experience and company employees requiring new skills. It employs directly 150 full-time staff, with another 250 part-time employees including a large number of professors seconded from the university. About 200 post-graduate students do research at the institute and some 300 undergraduates undertake their final year project there. The relationship works both ways as Inesc can provide research conditions and equipment which the universities cannot afford. 'We didn't want to take people away from the university, but to improve and enrich it,' Prof Tribolet says. The relationship has been crucial in bringing universities closer to the needs of industry. Prof Tribolet says education in Portugal for too long has been seen as a source of personal status rather than as a tool to promote wealth creation. 'Our objective is not to create a heaven for researchers, but to make Portugal rich,' he says. That philosophy is extended into Inesc's promotion of new high-tech ventures through Aitec, an investment company set up in 1987 by Inesc and Investimentos e Participacoes do Estado (INE)  - a state-owned holding company  - each with a 50 per cent share. Aitec acts as an incubator for new technology-based companies, providing some of the initial risk capital, expertise and assistance with research. The promoters of the company usually provide about 15 per cent of the start-up capital, but once the company is established Aipec pulls out. 'We lead the market when it comes to risk capital. The so-called risk capital and investment companies do everything except invest in risk, but they come to us to back companies we're involved in.' Inegi began more modestly and operates mainly in the industrial north. Established in 1986, it is linked to the Mechanical Engineering and Management department of the University of Oporto from which most of its staff and researchers come. It is involved in more than 100 projects including pilot studies to develop safety devices for car seats, finding an alternative plaster for broken limbs or a new technology for producing cast iron. 'In the early days it was difficult to convince people in industry we could be useful to them, so at the beginning we worked for nothing. Demand grew and we found it difficult to cope, so we created Inegi. Companies come to us because they need to develop a new product and they don't have the qualified people to do it,' Prof Silva Gomes, Inegi president says. He says Inegi, with an annual turnover of close to Es200m and a budget about 10 times the size of that of the engineering department (excluding salaries), has more resources for research and can respond quicker than the university to requests from industry. All money earned from research is ploughed back into the institute and to help pay for some of the university's own staff and equipment.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Problems on all fronts for Canary Wharf - Hopes for keeping project out of administration / Failure would hit confidence in property market and push down prices CANARY WHARF, the project at the heart of Olympia &amp; York's predicament, could still avoid being put into administration under UK insolvency laws. However, its bankers may well judge that this would be the best way of dealing with the project, given the O&amp;Y decision to seek protection from its creditors. If so, the Reichmann brothers' hopes of building a prestige office centre to rival London's West End and the City would probably be dashed for good. Canary Wharf's administration would make it far less likely that the project, now less than half complete, would ever be finished. Administration would not solve any of Canary Wharf's problems. Banks are usually loathe to take property companies out of the hands of their managers. Administrators generally have less expertise than developers and their appointment is seen by potential pur-chasers as a reason to drive prices down. The administrators' task in finding tenants to fill the unlet 40 per cent of the 4.5m sq ft project would be complicated by uncertainty over the ownership of the project and doubts over the extension to the Underground's Jubilee Line. Attracting tenants will be a long, difficult process, whoever is in charge of the development. According to APR a research group, in the Docklands, 58 per cent of space is empty. The quality of the Canary Wharf buildings is superb, but rents have so far been greater than anywhere else on the Isle of Dogs. Tenants are paying around Pounds 30 per sq ft - although incentive packages, including fitting-out costs, rent-free periods and rights to buy the freehold cheaply have sometimes halved the headline rent. The banks are believed to be prepared to lower rents to Pounds 18 a sq ft, although the inducements offered by O&amp;Y would no longer be available. That may not be cheap enough. The government, which is seeking 500,000 sq ft for the Department of Environment and parts of the departments of transport and trade and industry, is believed to be offering just Pounds 10 per sq ft. The administrators' task in selling the Canary Wharf buildings would also be tough. There is a huge surplus of buildings on the market in London, although the strong covenants of the Canary Wharf tenants would be an advantage. In the case of many failed property companies, banks and administrators have been anxious not to sell buildings cheaply, but rather to wait for an upturn in the market. If the banks decide to fund O&amp;Y's share of the Jubilee Line extention, there would be an added incentive to have a long timetable for disposals. The sale of the buildings would be unlikely to repay anything like the Pounds 1.3bn that has been spent on the project. Canary Wharf's complex construction and expensive finishes have made it a costly development, in spite of its low land costs. The prospects of rental growth, which were a key part of the original premises, have evaporated. Unlet space is virtually worthless at the moment. Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyor which is advising banks on the project's value, may arrive at values that are significantly lower than previous valuations which used special assumptions. At the start of the year, it valued 10 Cabot Square, a 600,000 sq ft building, at Pounds 215m by assuming that the buyer could take advantage of the tax breaks and ignoring the risk of tenant default. Its US associate Landauer valued the Canary Wharf tower at Pounds 680m, which also is thought unlikely to be realised. The consequences of Canary Wharf failing for existing tenants would also be severe. Not only would the Jubilee Line extension be in doubt and the prestige of their headquarters dented, but many would face the prospect of double overheads. In many cases, O&amp;Y agreed to take responsibility for their tenants' existing offices in central London. Legally, the costs of renting the old space would revert to the original tenant. There is speculation that the risk of being burdened with double overheads in this situation spurred some of the most recent arrivals at Canary Wharf to include let-out clauses in their contracts. The sums are significant. Property agents estimate that O&amp;Y has taken back at least 500,000 sq ft of space, including, for example Shearson Lehman's 240,000 sq ft of offices in the Broadgate complex. The severely depressed state of London's letting market suggests that they will have difficulty in attracting new tenants. That could leave Canary Wharf tenants paying an extra Pounds 20m in rents and rates on their old property. For the banks, the downside of putting Canary Wharf into administration would extend beyond the project to the rest of the property market, which underpins a large proportion of banks' total lending. If a large quantity of new space was dumped on the market, it could drive prices down across the board. A further risk for the London market stems from the damage that Canary Wharf's failure would inflict on confidence. Canary Wharf's central role in bringing down the largest and most admired property developer in the world will cast a shadow over London's attractions for international investors, particularly the less sophisticated. The impact on London's letting market might not be so dramatic, although the City and West End will not welcome increased price competition from Canary Wharf. But even now, the remoteness of Docklands limits its impact on the centre. Moreover, the mothballing of future buildings in Canary Wharf would reassure a market that is grappling with record quantities of unlet space. Perhaps the longest shadow cast by the failure of Canary Wharf would be over Docklands and the government's decision to allow the private sector to lead its development. Its evolution might have been very different had the government taken the lead and put in infrastructure at the outset. Late in the day, the government has thrown itself behind the project's infrastructure, channeling Pounds 5bn of investment into east London between 1985 and 1995. This spending may yet save the area, particularly if the Jubilee Line extension goes ahead. It may be, however, that its image has been irretrievably dented, limiting its potential to that of other parts of London such as Hammersmith or Croydon.  -------------------------------------------

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BWD Securities shows 25% advance to Pounds 2.25m BWD Securities, the USM-quoted stockbroking and financial services group, reported pre-tax profits 25 per cent ahead to Pounds 2.25m for the six months to May 31, on turnover 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 8.73m against Pounds 7.43m. Earnings per share rose to 7.7p (6.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted by 13 per cent to 1.7p (1.5p). BWD began as a stockbroker and unit trust manager in Huddersfield but expanded by acquiring the Liverpool-based Rensburg. Capital for Companies, an independent Leeds BES and venture capital fund manager followed. The group then set up Northern Registrars, a subsidiary using Huddersfield's lower overheads to compete nationally for share registry business. BWD Rensburg has now completed a Pounds 650,000 investment to upgrade electronic systems and equipment ready for the Stock Exchange's move to rolling settlement next week. The stockbroker's nominee service has grown by 600 clients to 4,000 which should also help smooth the transition, the company said. BWD Rensburg has also acquired new buildings in Birmingham and Sheffield, where significant growth is now forecast. Capital for Companies raised Pounds 30m for BES assured tenancy schemes, making a total of Pounds 78m, its last chance to do so before BES is replaced by the Enterprise Investment Scheme, which the company is looking at along with venture capital trusts. Northern Registrars won 15 new clients to bring its total to 85.</p>

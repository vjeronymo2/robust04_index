			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: TAXING FOR SCHOOLS, INVESTING IN THE FUTURE  </P> <P> The governor of New Jersey -- pressed by a lawsuit in the state's highest court  -- has introduced legislation to reform property tax financing for education in  an attempt to give poorer, urban school districts something approaching the  quality of schools in richer suburban districts.  </P> <P> In Texas, the state Supreme Court has ordered the Legislature to make school  funding more equitable, and the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled last year that the  education system violated the state constitution. So Kentucky has totally  reformed its system from curriculum to standards to financing -- putting in a  half-cent sales tax to help equalize funding between rich districts and poor.  </P> <P> The trend is powerful and spreading. Fresh lawsuits alleging discrimination  because of unequal funding based on property taxes are pending in eight states  (Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Oregon, Massachusetts and  Alabama), and suits may be filed in four more (Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio and  Virginia).  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 10 states have overturned their school finance system in the last  decade and others, such as Colorado, have moved voluntarily to make funding  more equitable.  </P> <P> The concept is simple: "that the quality of education should not depend on the  wealth of the local district but of the state as a whole," as the Texas  constitution puts it.  </P> <P> The controversy, as argued in many lawsuits through the years -- beginning with  a 1971 case in California -- is that property tax financing leads inevitably to  inequalities of education because some districts have higher property values,  and hence more money for schools, than others.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling that the U.S. Constitution says nothing about  education, has left the issue to individual state courts. And those courts  lately have been saying with increasing vigor that the way we finance education  must be changed -- now. In Texas, where Gov. William C. Clements vetoed sales  taxes earmarked for education reform, the court has appointed its own director  of schools who says he will take a "Robin Hood" approach and shift state aid  from wealthier districts to poorer ones.  </P> <P> If there is a trend for the '90s, this is it. The pattern of court decisions  amounts to nothing less than an expression of the national will that  educational opportunity be equitable -- and also that educational quality be  improved.  </P> <P> That's not a painless sentiment. Taxes are normally required to offset the gap  between rich and poor. Kentucky's half-cent sales tax raises $500 million a  year; Texas' proposed tax would raise even more. Property taxes could go up in  some areas if state governments cut back on aid to better-off schools to shift  money to poorer ones.  </P> <P> It's not social engineering, says Texas Lt. Gov. William Hobby: "The aim is not  to make each district equal -- wealthier districts can spend more on their  schools if they wish -- but that children in poor districts should have a  fighting chance."  </P> <P> Nor is it a do-gooder cause. What is galvanizing the courts as much as anything  is recognition by business people of two problems: One is that funding schools  in their own neighborhoods, while opposing taxes and bond issues to finance  general education, is shortsighted. The undereducated students in other  neighborhoods are business' future employees.  </P> <P> Two, a related problem is the quality of education everywhere; a labor force  that is 25% illiterate is not merely unfortunate, but counterproductive.  Scholarly studies, such as a recent one from RAND Corp., blame poor basic  education for stagnant U.S. productivity and the lack of investment in "human  capital" -- meaning that the schools leave many people almost incapable of  being trained for today's high-tech world.  </P> <P> A little perspective: We have always had high school dropouts. In fact, in  1920, only 21% of the students finished high school -- a 79% dropout rate,  compared to today's 40% or so in some areas. But in 1920, the skills needed for  work in industry and agriculture were lower than what is demanded today, where  every job demands knowledge and judgment -- and a country whose students score  lower than every other nation in math and science tests is at a disadvantage.  </P> <P> We're already spending money -- federal, state and local expenditure on primary  and secondary education totals $185 billion a year. So, clearly, redistributing  state aid must be accompanied by other reforms; the Kentucky Supreme Court  probably had the right idea in ordering a redo of the system from the ground  up.  </P> <P> Nobody argues that money is the whole solution, says Mary Fulton, a director of  the Education Commission of the States, a Denver research organization.  "However, money can buy textbooks and science labs, and it can maintain  facilities and pay teacher salaries."  </P> <P> Note the shift in emphasis: In the 1980s, it was fashionable to say we can't  solve problems by throwing money at them; in the '90s, the courts say that's no  reason to give up.  </P> <P> The result could be the start of improvement in U.S. education or, even more  important, recovery of the sense of American equality in our public schools. It  could make all our other problems more manageable.  </P></p>

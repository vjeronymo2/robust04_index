			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO OIL SPILL ALONG COAST  </P> <P> The tragedy of last week's oil spill lies in its inevitability and our failure  to legislatively take action to avoid it. The irony is that it will happen  again.  </P> <P> In spite of numerous warnings by the Department of Interior, environmentalists  and the oil companies, we persist in ignoring the truth. Oil and water do not  mix.  </P> <P> There are many legislative opportunities at hand to change the current policies  governing offshore oil drilling, tanker traffic, toxic waste disposal, sewage  dumping and emergence preparations. For example, the California Ocean Sanctuary  Act and the National Ocean Protection Act of 1990.  </P> <P> Southern Californians, as you watch the damage to our shorelines escalate,  remember that if we truly want to, we can effect changes for the future. I  challenge you to contact your representatives today.  </P> <P> BARBARA ELIE  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

In a government meeting Tuesday, Seoul decided to withhold  the announcement of suspending this year's South Korea-U.S.  military exercise "Team Spirit" until it actually sits down for  talks with North Korea, Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae  said.    Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi  Yong- tok coordinated the government position with Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, National  Security Planning Agency Director Kim Tok, and Senior  Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs  Chong Chong-uk after North Korea rejected Seoul's earlier  proposal for inter-Korean dialogue on Tuesday and instead  rescheduled the date for Thursday in a telephone message.    The government decided to agree to the new date on an  interpretation that the communist regime showed positive  attitude toward exchange of special envoys despite its delay for  talks.    In its telephone message on Tuesday morning, North Korea  said  it will send officials to the southern side of Panmunjom at  10:00 a.m. Thursday.    It added that it was happy that the South proposed  working-level meeting to discuss exchange of special envoys.</p>

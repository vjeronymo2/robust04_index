			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of the commenters who opposed the proposed requirement, almost half argued that there is no connection between the proposed regulation and administrative capability and the Secretary therefore should not regulate in this area. A half dozen commenters believed that students were aware of their own special needs and it was their responsibility to ensure that these needs were met. Several other commenters believed the proposed requirement was unnecessary because either institutions that had students with special needs were already attending to those needs, or such students would already be getting help from appropriate social service agencies. One commenter who objected strongly to the proposal noted, among other concerns, that students need to learn to become self reliant and that employers with whom the commenter's institution deal say the institution is already coddling its students too much.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is persuaded that regulation in this area is unnecessary at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision that provides that an institution that serves significant numbers of students with special needs must have and implement plans for providing students with information about how to meet their needs has been removed from these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters supported the provision that would require institutions to have procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student complaints but requested that the Secretary clarify the proposed language. One of these commenters asked that the Secretary make it clear that institutions would be expected to handle only those complaints related to the educational programs and support services offered by the institution. The other commenter thought that institutions should be required to publicize their system for handling complaints and maintain a log of student complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary appreciates the commenters' support; it is good administrative practice to have a mechanism to resolve student complaints. However, the Secretary has decided the proposed requirement is not an essential administrative standard as there will be other means of addressing student complaints about an institution. Each SPRE will be setting up a student complaint system to process student complaints about the postsecondary institutions in its State. Further, SPREs will be reviewing the handling of student complaints at institutions they review. Accrediting agencies will also be required to assess student complaints about institutions they consider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;668.16(j) has been removed from these final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received many comments on the proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aimed at institutions with educational programs with the stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective of preparing a student for gainful employment in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized occupation. Many of the commenters opposed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed requirements that the institution: (1) demonstrate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable relationship between the length of the program and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational entry level requirements and (2) establish the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the training. The commenters believe the responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of program length and the need for training rests with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other members of the Triad, principally the accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. Some of these commenters argued that if the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were to regulate in this area, the Secretary would exceed his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory authority and be intervening inappropriately in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic affairs. Other commenters asserted that need for or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length of training programs has nothing to do with ability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to administer Title IV, HEA programs. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters recommended the elimination of this proposed standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While some commenters were concerned that the standard, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed, is unreasonably vague, other commenters charged that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary would be micromanaging if it were implemented. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of these commenters noted that, for several reasons, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be difficult to determine whether program length really is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Many commenters noted that their students are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared and hired for positions that are above entry level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters saw the proposed standard as harmful or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unworkable because of the use of minimum State standards as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure of appropriate length. One commenter noted that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no provision for evaluation of the method by which a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines the minimum hours. Another commenter said State-mandated hours are too low. Other commenters questioned what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would happen if the State sets an inappropriate length. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter represented an institution that trains students from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many States, each with different minimum requirements, and argued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it would be entirely inappropriate to limit the length of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that institution's programs based on the minimum standard of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State in which the institution is located. Many commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that the proposed regulation is unnecessary. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that disclosures to prospective students are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated under the Student Right-to-Know Act and that SPRE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards will be addressing the abuses of the type described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble to the February 28, 1994 NPRM and this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would thus be duplicative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposed this provision to curb  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing abuses in these areas. The Secretary questions the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motives of any institution that claims it is necessary to greatly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed the minimum number of clock hours required by the State in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the institution is located for adequate training for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular occupation. The Secretary is also concerned with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that provides training for occupations for which no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training is necessary, or for which on-the-job training is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate. Although an institution's SPRE and accrediting agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may regulate in these general areas, the Secretary believes it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> specifically <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  target areas of past abuse. Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary believes it is consistent to require an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program and occupational entry level requirements established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by any Federal agency. See the discussion in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section that addresses the definition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible program (&sect;668.8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

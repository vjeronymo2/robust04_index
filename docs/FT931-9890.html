			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Observer: Van hopes Wheels within wheels. Motor-industry watchers goggled at the speedy departure from DAF of Sandy Mathieson to return to his former British Leyland haunts with Rover. Could this herald a Rover-led rescue of Leyland DAF's Birmingham van plant? For one thing, Mathieson was in the front seat beside current Rover chairman George Simpson while he was turning round British Leyland's van business before the merger with DAF in 1987. For another, the man who then took over the controls - Graham Morris - is also back with Simpson overseeing European marketing operations. And, for good measure, the faltering van plant supplies the key body components for Land Rovers and Range Rovers to boot. Alas, hopes that Simpson and Morris had pulled in Mathieson for a mercy dash appear to be mere wishful thinking. It's said he'd decided to make his move well before DAF ran out of road.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Hong Kong bridge decision queried HONG KONG'S government is being urged to allow Hyundai of Korea to press its case to build the Tsing Ma bridge. Hyundai's tender was rejected in favour of a higher bid by an Anglo-Japanese consortium, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's chief secretary Sir David Ford is seeking legal advice on the request by the United Democrats that Hyundai be allowed to address the Legislative Council, which is due to approve the HKDollars 7.14bn (Pounds 517m) contract next week. Hyundai was disqualified because of a short-fall on capital requirements, but the company claimed yesterday it could meet these.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News in Brief: NCB NATIONAL Commercial Bank, the Saudi bank, is to raise paid-up capital to more than SR5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) from SR30.2m, Reuter reports from Manama. The capital increase plan was completed last year but will be announced when privately-owned NCB's results are published 'in the next few weeks,' according to Saudi press reports. NCB, which has not reported audited results since 1989 and which ran into trouble over the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, has vigorously denied foreign media reports that its business is threatened. The press reports did not indicate how the additional capital would be raised. But the bankers said NCB did not plan to go public to raise the capital in Saudi Arabia's stock market. At the end of 1989, NCB had assets of put at the end of 1989 at SR86.6bn. Sheikh Mohammad, chief executive officer, said last month the bank would soon issue audited 1992 financial results which 'will demonstrate the solid foundation and high standing enjoyed by the National Commercial Bank'.</p>

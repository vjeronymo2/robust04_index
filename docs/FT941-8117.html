			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Promotion boost for BCI ahead of sell-off The international promotion of the privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) has moved to continental Europe and the Far East following a roadshow in London yesterday for institutional investors. Pricing of the issue will be set next Saturday in the wake of the announcement of a 37.8 per cent increase in net profit to L301.2bn (Dollars 180m) last year. The sharp increase in profitability of the group, controlled by IRI, the Italian state holding company, was attributed largely to a turnround in the performance of BCI's Canadian and French subsidiaries. The results had already been foreshadowed in those of the parent company and during the road-show in the US. Net interest income was marginally up at L3,430bn from L3,386bn; while non-interest income jumped 89 per cent to L2,100bn. With operating costs of L3,409bn held to a 6.5 per cent rise, group operating profit rose 74 per cent to L1,901bn from L1,088bn. The group set aside L853bn for possible loan losses compared with L566bn the previous year. Pre-tax profits were L1,163bn against L599bn but BCI was obliged to make substantially increased tax provisions, up from L367bn to L840bn. At the year end, the group's total assets stood at L134,106bn compared with L128,607bn in 1992. Deposits grew 5.7 per cent to L113,657bn while total cash loans increased 7.5 per cent to L99,232bn.</p>

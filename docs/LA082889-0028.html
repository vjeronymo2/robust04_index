			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MEYER OFFERS A STUDY OF LOVE IN 'THE GEOGRAPHY OF LUCK'  </P> <P> In the struggle between good and evil . . . it's easier to dramatize evil. We  saw that in Marlane Meyer's first two plays, "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish."  </P> <P> "The Geography of Luck," which opened Saturday night at the Los Angeles Theatre  Center (after an earlier production at South Coast Repertory), is again set in  a tawdry landscape: Las Vegas. And it ends with a story about a person eating a  snake.  </P> <P> But this time the snake doesn't have all the lines. Meyer's hero (Arliss  Howard) and heroine (Deirdre O'Connell) make the breakthrough that we were  hoping they'd make. Life isn't just a matter of eating or being eaten.  </P> <P> A love story, then -- eventually. But one that demonstrates that the walls  between two people don't come down easily. Meyer has an uncommon sympathy for  the male point of view here. She sees that it's not a simple thing for a man to  give in to the female in himself, a requisite if he's ever going to love a real  woman.  </P> <P> Nor is it easy for a woman to relinquish her impulse to punish males, for  reasons just as deeply-rooted in her history. Actors Howard and O'Connell show  us two busted-up people achieving intimacy an inch at a time, with many a  glance at the door. Who finally takes the bull by the horns? The woman. This is  realistic.  </P> <P> "Geography of Luck" is not realistic in manner, though, and there are problems  with that. Meyer finds a B-movie glamour in strippers, ex-cons, shady  leased-car operations and rich women who have more than a few miles on them,  and the play at times seems a goof on yesterday's stereotypes.  </P> <P> Susan Tyrrell ankles onto Howard's leased-car lot and works her way up to a  "test drive" like Ida Lupino sizing up some teen-age gas jockey, circa 1948.  The point may be that we are still trapped in yesterday's sex games, but so  much love is lavished on this one stylistically (David Schweizer directed) that  we almost seem to be envying the '40s. Mixed signals here.  </P> <P> Meyer's characters also have an unfortunate way of deserting hard, concrete  speech (something she's very good at) for such generalizations as "a man is not  a man without a language" and "we appease our appetite for diversity with  things."  </P> <P> Anybody is liable to come out with something like this, but especially Howard's  old cellmate and true spiritual father, played by Tom Rosqui. Rosqui has a  wonderful scene with O'Connell when she comes to see him in prison, but he's  doesn't know what to do with the philosophizing, and you can't blame him.  </P> <P> The play goes better, though, than it did at South Coast. Not that the cast is  necessarily more acute, or that director Schweizer has a firmer grasp of it  intellectually. But he understands its music better.  </P> <P> It is a play of many small and rather cryptic scenes. Rather than ending each  of them in a blackout, Schweizer and his designers (John Iacovelli, set;  Douglas D. Smith, lights; Gregory Poe, costumes) give us something to watch  between scenes -- a revolving light stanchion, maybe, to remind us that we're  in glitzy Las Vegas; or perhaps just the sight of an actor going offstage.  </P> <P> It's interesting how effective that can be if the actor goes off in character.  Rather than an evening of dots and dashes, the play finds connection.  </P> <P> Schweizer has also taken some of the direness out of the older male characters.  John Considine doesn't play Howard's father as a dead-eyed crook, but as a guy  with some concern for his son -- not much but some. And Garrett Morris isn't  necessarily up to the devil's business with his mojo, at least not from his  point of view.  </P> <P> "The Geography of Luck" also plays nicely against LATC's "Boys' Life," another  script about men trying to come to terms with the female principle. One could  also relate it to LATC's third current play, "The Marriage of Bette and Boo,"  in which another young man confronts what his father and mother did to each  other.  </P> <P> Basically, though, "The Geography of Luck" is worth seeing because it's a play  by Marlane Meyer, a writer with a real gift for language -- when it's her  language and not psychobabble.  </P> <P>  Plays at 514 S. Spring St. Tuesdays-Sundays at 8 p.m., with Saturday and  Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Closes Oct. 15. Tickets $22-$26.

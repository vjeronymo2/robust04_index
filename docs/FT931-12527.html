			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / BNFL faces safety charges BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is to be prosecuted for four alleged breaches of site licence conditions at its Sellafield reprocessing works in Cumbria, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday. The prosecution follows investigations by the HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate into an incident during routine testing work last April at the Windscale Vitrification Product Store, part of a Pounds 240m complex opened in February 1991. The inspectorate alleges: An unauthorised modification had been carried out, disabling gamma monitor interlocks (radiation detectors) designed to ensure safety. Operations were done for which there were no adequate written instructions. The interlocks were not properly connected. There were not adequate arrangements for testing the interlocks associated with the product flask. The HSE said that while there were no radiological consequences from the alleged events, it was prosecuting because of the importance it attaches to compliance with licence conditions. BNFL will appear before Whitehaven magistrates on February 26.</p>

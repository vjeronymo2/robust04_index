			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1000 GMT on 26 May broadcasts a 4.5-minute report that radio  and television companies across Russia are going to set up a  league as a measure against the law on mass media which is about  to be adopted by the State Duma. The announcer says that the  proposed law stipulates the creation of the state Duma's  exclusive TV and radio service, which, the announcer says, will  be financed from the federal budget, thus reducing the amount of  financial support presently allocated to other state media.    Anatoliy Batyushkin, head of the department of radio and  television at the Ministry of Communications, is asked by a  Radio Rossii correspondent about the present financial situation  in the broadcasting industry. He says:    "At present we owe the power engineers about 50 billion  rubles [R] for the electrical energy already supplied to TV  centers. The TV and radio broadcasting companies' debt for the  first quarter stands at R192 billion. Until now only R100  billion have been repaid. Only R25 billion has been used to pay  salaries, buy spare parts, etc, while in fact, the power  engineers need at least R50 billion for the first quarter year."    Asked whether broadcasting will go back to normal in the  near  future, Batyushkin says:    "I think that we will be able to work well if the federal  television and radio broadcasting service does in fact achieve  stable financing. If we are paid, no conflict situation,  nothing will interfere with nonstop broadcasting, just as it  used to be when we had a system when a single minute of unused  time at some or other transmitter was considered to be an  emergency situation."    In response to that comment, Radio Rossii correspondent  Aleksandr Kurekov says:    "First of all, a few words from a note on technical  stoppages  of transmitters broadcasting Radio Rossii programs. From 24  May, because of lack of energy supplies, transmitters in Taldym,  near Moscow, Blagoveshchensk in Amur oblast, and in Chita are  inoperative. These transmitters used to provide one of the most  stable feeds of radio programs on longwave." Kurekov adds that  people in these areas can no longer hear the 650 or so reports  from localities provided by Radio Rossii's correspondents, or  the 200-300 reports filed by them from near-abroad and other  countries. He also said that Kaluga, Smolensk, Tver, and  Voronezh oblasts have been left without Radio Rossii's programs  as well.</p>

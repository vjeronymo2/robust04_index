			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Wills advance to Pounds 1.56m WILLS GROUP, the expanding distributor of high specification fluid handling equipment, achieved a profits rise from Pounds 519,000 to Pounds 1.56m pre-tax for the year ended July 3. The figures included a two months' contribution from Platon International, the former USM-quoted instrumentation company acquired for Pounds 2.7m. Along with the purchase, which followed the acquisition of Lightfoot Refrigeration in December, a 1-for-3 rights issue was launched to raise Pounds 5.2m. The money raised will help restructure Platon's finances and develop new products. Group turnover for the year expanded from Pounds 15m to Pounds 19.28m, including Pounds 1.33m from acquisitions. Interest charges were cut to Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 133,000). Earnings per share improved from 0.72p to 1.6p basic, or from 0.6p to 1.28p diluted. A final dividend of 0.3p makes a 0.4p (0.1p) total. The directors hoped the first six months would see further progress in profitability as sales and profits are weighted towards the second half.</p>

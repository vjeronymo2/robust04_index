Zheleznaya, </F> and N.I. Matviyenko, Molecular Diagnosis and Treatment  Institute, Moscow, Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics  Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, and Protein  Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino; UDC  577.152.314'1]    [Abstract] The new site-specific endonuclease R  Bli7361 and methylase M Bli7361 have been  isolated from Bacillus licheniformis strain 736 by  blue-agarose, hydroxyapatite-Ultragel, and heparin-Sepharose  chromatography. The new enzymes were found to be free of  interfering impurities. The endonuclease R Bli7361  recognizes the DNA sequence 5'-GGTCTCN1-3'[downward  arrow-pointing] and 3'-CCAGAG5N-5'[upward-pointing arrow] and  cleaves it, as indicated by the arrows, at a distance of 1 and 5  nucleotides from the recognized sequence to form single-strand  4-nucleotide 5'-protruding termini. This new endonuclease is  thus an isoschizomer of Eco31I, PpaI, and  BsaI. The isolation of MBli736I was hailed  as opening the possibility of studying the nature of the  methylation of the enzyme site recognized by it. Several  possible applications of the new enzymes were discussed: (1)  using R Bli7361 with the DNA of the plasmid pBR322,  which has only one site for this restrictase that is located in  the gene of resistance to ampicillin, in order to cleave the  molecule and thus permit radioactive labeling that would in turn  facilitate more precise restriction mapping (by Smith and  Bernstiel's method) of DNA fragments integrated at the  PstI site; (2) using Bli7361 with the DNA  of the phage _l_ for selective labeling of terminals by using a  Klenow fragment as an alternative to using labeled  oligonucleotides complementary to the natural ``adhesive''  terminals of the DNA of the phage _l_ in ``cos''-mapping of  recombinant phages; (3) using Bli7361 to create  selective ``holders'' for site-specific mutagenesis or to create  vectors for directed unilateral shortening of integrated  fragments and to create ``restoring'' and ``multiplication''  vectors. The promise of using the new restrictase to create  ``restoring'' vectors was given special attention. Specifically,  it was stated that because the phage M13mp18 does not contain  sites for Bli7361, taking two oppositely directed  sites for Bli7361 that have a GC-dinucleotide between  them and introducing them into a polylinker sequence will result  in the creation of a site for the ``blunt-ended'' restrictase  NruI, for which there is no site in the vector  either. This NruI site may then be used to clone  chemically synthesized oligonucleotides for the purpose of  subsequently assembling a whole gene in a single ligation  reaction from oligonucleotides cut from recombinant DNA by using  Bli7361.

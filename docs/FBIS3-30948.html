			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E.Cz., E.K., and Ma.S.: "PSL-SLD Negotiations; </F> Evening Compromise"]    [Text] The leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] reached a compromise  yesterday a few minutes before 2300; by doing so, they put an  and to the crisis which started 11 days ago.    In line with the joint communique, both parties want to  maintain the coalition until the elections in four years' time.  The coalition members agreed to unanimously support the budget  bill submitted by the government. They expressed very positive  opinions on the "knowledge, competence, and activeness of Marek  Borowski." The coalition agreement, as both sides unanimously  stress, is still binding. Therefore, the candidate for the  vacant post of the finance minister will be proposed by SLD.  Borowski already knows his name, but, as he said, he cannot  reveal it yet.  <H5>  Hours Before </H5>   On Tuesday [8 February] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  irrevocably accepted the resignation of Marek Borowski, deputy  prime minister and finance minister. The president signed the  prime minister's motion concerning his recall. The coalition  talks, which started in the evening in the hotel of the Office  of the Council of Ministers [URM] at Parkowa Street, were  preceded by an hour-long meeting between Kwasniewski and Pawlak,  which had not been the first one in the past two days. The  prime minister's Press Secretary Ewa Wachowicz told the  journalists, who had come to the URM seat in quite a large  number, that there would be no comments either before or  immediately after the meeting.    The Council of Ministers, which held a session on that day,  despite earlier declarations, did not issue its opinions on the  Sejm committees' amendments to the budget bill (they were  presented by Minister Borowski, who had already handed in his  resignation). The government members met later in the  Constitutional composition (only the prime minister and  ministers) in order to discuss the situation that had developed  after Marek Borowski's resignation. As we learned from one of  the participants of this sitting, the meeting was held so that  ministers would not find out about the events concerning the  government from the mass media.  <H5>  The Left Miscalculated </H5>   "The decision concerning the recall of Minister Marek  Borowski was not made because I wanted this -- it was made  because of the declaration of the interested parties," said  Prime Minister Pawlak in Radio "Zet." The prime minister  believes that Borowski's decision to submit his resignation was  unnecessary.    The response of SLD politicians to the prime minister's  decision, or rather, its lack, suggests that they were taken  aback by it.    According to PSL members, Aleksander Kwasniewski and his  cooperators made a second attempt to force PSL to make a  decision that is favorable. They claim that the first attempt  was when the composition of the cabinet was being negotiated.  They say that the first list submitted in the Belvedere was  fully agreed with SLD. SLD queried it and renegotiated the  filling of the posts in the key economic ministries, which,  according to the peasants, was a deliberate propaganda ploy of  SLD. Pawlak, who was obliged to meet the deadlines set by the  Constitution, had to agree to these SLD proposals. In PSL  circles one can hear opinions that the issue of Borowski was a  similar ploy.    According to unofficial information, which was confirmed by  several credible sources, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski knew  earlier about the scheduled recall of his deputy; he consented  to it, but kept delaying the decision to sign off on it. Thus,  it was Pawlak who did it. The violent response of SLD was  received by PSL as another propaganda trick, which was once  again supposed to help SLD gain greater influence in the  government as well as to limit the role of Prime Minister Pawlak  and Minister Strak: Such a version of the developments seems to  be borne out by unofficial statements of SLD politicians, who  claim that Marek Borowski's resignation was a tactical ploy. It  was supposed to force PSL to hold talks on the functioning of  the government, economic policy, cadre policy, information  policy, and the cooperation within the coalition -- that is, all  the controversial issues. SLD accuses the prime minister of  steering the work of the government rather inefficiently; it  also points out that Minister Strak, when making decisions  concerning the cadres in the state administration, favors his  party colleagues.    Prime Minister Pawlak, backed by his party, did not yield in  this conflict. The peasants emphasize that they would not allow  anyone to place them in a second position, just as it was in the  time of the Polish People's Republic. For the time being SLD  lost, or rather, it was outmaneuvered. Will it receive anything  in return for Borowski's recall? There were speculations that  it would be the recall of Michal Strak. According to credible  sources, the prime minister did not agree to that.  <H5>  What Does the SLD Want? </H5>   When the conflict between the prime minister and Minister  Borowski came to the surface, SLD politicians started to say  increasingly louder that the government head should sign as soon  as possible appointments of the coalition's representatives in  the presidential ministries, that is, in the Ministry of  National Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SLD politicians unofficially  confirm that they want to force Pawlak to make such a decision.  It would be a bargaining chip for Kwasniewski's party over the  "issue of Kawalec."    Despite the efforts of SLD leaders, the prime minister has  so  far been unable to make a decision on "strengthening the  coalition" in the presidential ministries.    SLD also wants a stronger position of the Presidium of the  Government. It consists of the prime minister and the deputy  prime ministers. It is an extra-constitutional body. In line  with the SLD proposal, it would be the presidium, not only the  prime minister, that would steer the work of the cabinet.    To their surprise, journalists were admitted to the URM  premises, where, in line with earlier official information, the  coalition talks were supposed to be held. Fifteen minutes after  the announced time when the talks were supposed to begin, the  journalists were addressed by Ewa Wachowicz, who said that the  talks had already begun, but she was not authorized to tell them  where the meeting was being held. When asked bluntly whether  the talks were being held at Parkowa Street, she replied:    "I do not confirm this, but I do not deny it, either."    Therefore, most of the journalists went to the hotel at  Parkowa Street. Twenty minutes later, those few who decided to  stay in URM saw the prime minister with two bodyguards walk  toward his office.    "We have only just started," he told the surprised  journalists. The actual coalition talks began at Parkowa Street  at approximately 2000 [1900 GMT].</p>

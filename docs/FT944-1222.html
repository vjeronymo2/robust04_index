			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Terra Nova acquired by Bermuda operation Terra Nova, the privately-owned London insurance and reinsurance group, has been acquired by a group of mostly US investors, via a new Bermuda holding company, as a prelude to seeking a NYSE listing. The new holding company will also own an operation in the expanding Bermuda reinsurance market, making Terra Nova one of only a handful of companies with a significant presence both on the island and in the London market. Mr John Riddick, managing director, said the Bermuda base would attract US investors because of its tax and regulatory regime. 'The successful (reinsurance) companies of the future will be those which are able to access the capital markets of the world. The scope for privately-held reinsurance companies is limited,' he said. He envisaged the company floating within two years. It reported a pre-tax operating profit of Pounds 27.3m last year. Terra Nova has raised Dollars 106m (Pounds 65m) in equity from an expanded shareholder base and Dollars 85m in debt from US and UK banks via a syndicated loan. A large part of the funds has been used to buy back shares. The holdings of the existing three main shareholders - Aetna Life &amp; Casualty and Cigna Corporation, the US insurance companies, and Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker - will be cut from about 80 per cent to 38 per cent. The holding company has acquired Underwriters Capital (Merrett), a Bermudian reinsurance company formed last year to provide reinsurance facilities to Lloyd's syndicates managed by the Merrett Underwriting agency. With the Merrett syndicates now in run-off, the Bermuda company has, in effect, been dormant. UCM has been renamed Terra Nova (Bermuda) Insurance and will have an initial capitalisation of Dollars 55m.</p>

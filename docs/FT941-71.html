			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rationalisation helps Gt Southern rise 19% Tight cost controls and rationalisation at Great Southern Group helped the funeral service operator to lift profits last year by 19 per cent. Despite property write-downs as part of its rationalisation programme, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.2m in 1993, against Pounds 5.2m restated under FRS 3. Turnover rose from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds 32.7m. Mr James Smillie, chairman, said the profits improvement reflected a strong commitment to cost controls. A 4 per rise in mortality rates had reversed falling trends - particularly in London and the north. Of the three divisions, retail funeral services continued to dominate - with profits up 15 per cent at Pounds 4.83m. This was offset slightly by a Pounds 60,000 loss on the disposal of three properties, while a Pounds 475,000 provision was also made for falling values on four further sites. Nevertheless, group operating profits rose to Pounds 7.13m (Pounds 6.35m) following improved results by the crematoria division and pre-arranged funeral services. Mr Eric Spencer, chief executive, said sales had been held back by the group's decision not to increase funeral prices. Cremation costs, however, were subject to an average 10 per cent surcharge to cover environmental improvements at crematoria, which must be completed by 1997. Earnings increased by 27 per cent to 30.4p (24p) basic. The 8.2p (7.4p) final dividend lifts the total to 12.2p (11p).</p>

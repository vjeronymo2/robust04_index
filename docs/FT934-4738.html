			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Stammers set to resign second post Mr Lionel Stammers is expected today to resign as non-executive director of BBA, the car components group - just 24 hours after stepping down as non-executive director of BTR, the industrial conglomerate. Mr Stammers is believed to have decided to quit both posts after concerns arose about possible future conflicts of interest between the groups. He wanted to behave in an even-handed manner over any potential conflict of loyalty. It appears BTR is still smarting over the departure of one of the industrial conglomerate's most promising executives, Mr Roberto Quarta, 44, who last month left to become chief executive of BBA. Mr Stammers's resignation from BTR yesterday severed a 29-year connection with the group. BTR said the possibility of future conflicts of interest with a competitor meant his resignation had been announced 'with regret'. Mr Norman Ireland, BTR's chairman, stressed he was not suggesting any impropriety by Mr Stammers, who he accepted had played no part in Mr Quarta's selection. He had the highest regard for Mr Stammers, a former joint chief executive of BTR's European region and an executive director until 1988. Mr Ireland said: 'There's nothing in the air between us - it's just a situation that arose.' However, since Mr Stammers joined BBA's board in 1989, the scope for a conflict of interest is scarcely new. BTR watchers will be left wondering what role had been planned for Mr Quarta, the US-born son of an Italian tailor who was seen as a future candidate to succeed Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive.</p>

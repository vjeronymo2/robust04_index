			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Biotechnology The US biotechnology business has hit a cash crunch. The median quoted biotech group has insufficient capital to survive beyond the next 25 months, compared with 34 months a year ago. The industry is used to waves of investment interest and disenchantment, but this time the sector seems to be suffering a more significant malaise. Between 20 and 30 per cent of the quoted sector is in serious financial difficulties. The reasons for the cash shortage are various. Investors were over-enthusiastic during the 1980s; although biotech groups were supposed to reduce the risks of developing new medicines through their greater understanding of science, many investors did not realise the risk of failure nevertheless remained high. Then the Clintons' proposals for healthcare reform and the separate deceleration in growth of the world drugs market have cast a general pall over the industry. Since 1991, biotech stocks have underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by nearly 50 per cent. This does not mean the death of the US biotech industry, but it heralds rationalisation. Costs can be cut and ambitions reined in. For those making good scientific progress, alternative sources of funds are available, particularly from the drugs industry. Those incapable of raising additional money must merge. The sector's long-term future remains bright. Healthcare providers remain willing to prescribe expensive novel treatments if they reduce overall costs. The rewards for those successfully developing innovative drugs have never been greater.</p>

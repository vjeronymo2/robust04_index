			<p>BFN     [Text] Law enforcement agencies and financial supervisory  authorities unanimously support money laundering legislation now  being drafted by a government committee, Deputy Prime Minister  Amnuai Wirawan said yesterday.    Amnuai said he had ordered the government panel in charge of  drawing up new laws, in cooperation with Chulalongkon  University's Faculty of Law, to study money laundering laws  already in use in other countries.    "We have discussed the matter and all government agencies  have given their full support," Amnuai said. "I have also  raised the issue with the Bank of Thailand. There should be no  problem (in introducing the law)."    Amnuai, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics Control  Board (ONCB), said he was advised by the anti-drug agency that  such a law would make it difficult for drug traffickers to  convert their proceeds into legal currencies and assets.    "The measures against money laundering are a good thing. And  it would not hurt law-abiding citizens either," Amnuai said. "No  private individual's rights will be compromised."    He sought to allay fears expressed by some members of the  banking community and politicians that a money laundering law  would turn away foreign investors and shoot down Thailand's  aspiration to become a financial hub in Southeast Asia.    "I don't think a money laundering law, if introduced, would  affect local or foreign investors. And there is no question  about whether commercial banks would cooperate with the  government on the matter. All we need is appropriate guidelines  and procedures.    Amnuai said a money laundering law would require banks to  report to law enforcement agencies "unusual transactions",  particularly large cash deposits, by their clients." (The  anti-money laundering measures) will seek to control and monitor  cash transactions. No restrictions will be imposed on the  issuance of personal cheques which can already be monitored."    Senate Speaker Michai Ruchuphan, a legal expert, said a  money  laundering law was like a "two-edged sword" because although it  would be useful as an instrument against drug traffickers and  other organized crime, it would have a wide-ranging effect on  all members of the public.    "The money laundering law would affect everyone of us. The  law would require everybody -- no matter who he is or what he  does -- to identify the source of his money," Michai said.    He said the government should carefully consider the  advantages and drawbacks of such legislation before deciding  whether to enact it. Among possible drawbacks is abuse of  authority by government officials who have access to people's  financial records.    Earlier this week, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he  approved of the proposal by anti-drug officials to introduce a  money laundering law provided that it did not infringe upon the  freedom of the individual.    Also yesterday, John Gieve, president of the Group of  Seven's  Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) said  senior Thai government officials he met during a two-day visit  Thursday and yesterday had expressed support for the proposed  introduction of a law to combat money laundering.    Gieve, also under-secretary of the United Kingdom's  Treasury,  met Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit on Thursday and  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday, among other  senior Thai officials.    The FATF was established by the Group of Seven Economic  Summit in 1989 to develop a multilateral response to the threat  posed by the growth of international money laundering,  particularly the laundering of drug trafficking proceeds. The  body now has 26 member countries.    FATF member countries in Asia-Pacific include Japan,  Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.    Dilwyn Griffiths, secretary to the FATF, said although money  laundering was never an issue in Thailand because the country  has not made it a criminal offense, there must be some  laundering activities given the fact that Thailand is a major  transshipment point for heroin from the Golden Triangle to the  world market.</p>

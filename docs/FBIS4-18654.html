			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ankara/Bonn (DPA) -- In connection with the  halting of deliveries within the framework of NATO equipment  aid, Turkey has warned Germany against "indirectly encouraging  terrorism." The Federal Government's decision to temporarily  halt already agreed deliveries of NATO equipment was received  "with regret and concern for the future of German-Turkish  relations," it was said in Ankara.    In a statement aired by the Turkish state television TRT on  Thursday evening [7 April], Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin said that, in a telephone conversation with FRG Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, he had affirmed that Turkey is  "confronted with serious terrorism." However, Turkey is  determined to fight for its national and territorial integrity  with the means of a rule-of-law state and of democracy. Hereby  it is particularly important that Turkey's friendly and allied  states "do not indirectly encourage terrorism," Cetin said.    Cetin advocated the view that the halting of the delivery of  German equipment aid to Turkey is due to "the elections campaign  atmosphere in Germany." However, it must not be that "such  sensitive topics are turned into domestic policy election  campaign material." "Destroying relations is quite easy and can  be done very quickly; reestablishing them is difficult and takes  long," Cetin said. [passage omitted]</p>

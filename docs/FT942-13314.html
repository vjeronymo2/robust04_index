			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / MPs urge R&amp;D incentives The government should reconsider its long-standing opposition to tax incentives for research and development, the Commons science and technology committee said yesterday. The committee called for a 'determined and sustained effort' to reverse the 'disturbing decline' in Britain's R&amp;D spending compared with competitors. The decline caused particular concern because of recent evidence 'which suggests that there is a significant payback to the economy as a whole from increased levels of investment in innovation', the committee said. In last year's white paper on science and technology the government rejected calls for R&amp;D tax incentives - partly because of studies in the 1980s which suggested such incentives were inefficient. The committee cited 'impressive' new international studies which took the opposite view. 'We believe the time has come for a major re-examination of the case for fiscal incentives for investment in R&amp;D, both at personal and at company level,' the committee said. 'Such a review should be conducted openly and its conclusions should be considered by experts outside the Treasury.' The MPs were influenced especially by the first extensive study of the long-term effect of R&amp;D tax credits introduced in the US in 1981. This study, by Professor Bronwyn Hall of the University of California, Berkeley, showed that the incentives stimulated companies to spend an extra Dollars 2bn a year on R&amp;D at a cost of about Dollars 1bn in lost tax revenues.

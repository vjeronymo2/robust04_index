			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC REPORT URGES SHIFT IN ADMISSIONS OF MINORITIES  </P> <P> A faculty report on UC Berkeley freshman admissions policies that could lead to  slightly more restrictive rules on admissions of blacks, Latinos and American  Indians and slightly less restrictive ones on Anglos and Asian-Americans was  submitted Wednesday to the school's Academic Senate.  </P> <P> Although the report by the nine-member Admissions and Enrollment Committee of  the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate, chaired by sociology professor  Jerome Karabel, was couched in often complicated language with many uncertain  terms, university officials termed its recommendations an important step toward  a new admissions policy to take effect in the fall of 1991.  </P> <P> The report is subject to review by Berkeley admissions officials and could  undergo changes before the policies it advocates are put into effect.  </P> <P> But two of its recommendations could, if adopted, have a significant effect on  the balance of student admissions by ethnic group.  </P> <P> First, it says that "The proportion of the fall freshmen . . . selected by  academic criteria alone should be increased from 40% to 50%." This probably  would increase the number of Asian-Americans and Anglos admitted, because they  account for a higher percentage of the best-qualified applicants, according to  both school grades and scholastic aptitude test scores.  </P> <P> Second, it would give UC Berkeley the option of following UCLA's lead this year  and not automatically admit all blacks, Latinos and American Indians who are  eligible by virtue of being in the top 12.5% academically of their high school  graduating classes.  </P> <P> UC Berkeley, as well as many other universities, have faced much controversy  over their admissions policies. Asian-American groups have charged that  Berkeley restricts admissions of members of their community below what their  academic standing would indicate, while just this week a prominent Latino group  called for increased admissions of Latinos to the school.  </P> <P> For the 1989-90 academic year, UC Berkeley has had about 22,000 applicants for  freshman positions but only about 3,800 positions to offer.  </P> <P> In the total applicant pool, UC Berkeley already finds that it has far more  applicants each year who are eligible by the UC system's 12.5% academic  standard than it has openings in the freshman class. But up until now, it has  admitted all of the academically eligible blacks, Latinos and American Indians  while turning down many of the academically eligible Anglos and  Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> But even while advocating some change in this arrangement, the report still  contains many provisions for admitting students on the basis of cultural and  ethnic diversity.  </P> <P> For this reason, campus officials cautioned Wednesday that the report's precise  effect on the ethnic balance of admissions is uncertain.  </P> <P> One campus official, who asked not to be identified, said the faculty report  represents an assessment that "Berkeley has succeeded in diversifying its  student body more quickly than we thought we would, and admissions policy must  become more balanced as we reach parity between ethnic groups and their  representation in the state's high school graduating classes.  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Crops under doctor's orders A single body to monitor the use of agricultural pesticides, which would save millions of pounds spent on cleaning up drinking water, should be set up in the UK, according to a study by Newcastle University published last week.* The study advocates the introduction of a prescription service for crops with the chemicals doled out by independent crop doctors, rather than representatives of agro-chemical companies who could tend to encourage greater use of pesticides. This would entail a completely regulated market in pesticides similar to the National Health Service. It could prove cheaper in the long run than paying for the clean-up of drinking water, thereby reducing water bills. Water companies estimate it will cost Pounds 800m in equipment and Pounds 80m a year in running costs to treat polluted drinking water and bring it up to EU standards. But the study points out that a national ban on the herbicide Isoproturon could greatly improve the water at a cost of only Pounds 28m. The monitoring of pesticide use could come under the auspices of the proposed new Environmental Protection Agency, the study suggests. But it would need additional information about the use of chemicals on the land if it is to do its job properly. The study found the monitoring of agricultural pesticides is 'grossly inadequate,' and regulation has been geared more to the needs of agriculture than the environment. The principle of polluters paying for environmental damage is not being applied to pesticides since water companies are removing chemicals from the water supply and passing the bill on to consumers. The report suggests imposing a levy on agro-chemicals with the highest tax applied to the pesticides that appear in greatest concentrations. *Water Pollution from Agricultural Pesticides, Centre for Rural Economy, Department of Agricultural Economics and Food Marketing, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, NE1 7RU, Pounds 10</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Recovery in autumn, says central bank THE Bank of Japan in its quarterly survey of the economy published yesterday conspicuously failed to back up the government's assessment that the Japanese economy has hit the bottom of its long downturn. The central bank said it was too early to say the economy had bottomed out because consumer spending and capital expenditure were still depressed. On Thursday, the head of the government's Economic Planning Agency provoked controversy and criticism from business leaders and the powerful industry ministry after he said the agency's quarterly report suggested the economy was bottoming out. However, the bank believes the trough of the recession will be reached in the next few months, paving the way for a moderate recovery from the second half of this fiscal year which began in April. It believes consumer spending will pick up as consumers start to replace durable goods they bought in the 1980s. This will be underpinned by the Y24,000bn (Pounds 148.6bn) of emergency public spending the government has approved over the past year. The bank's quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment found that the key gauge of corporate confidence had stopped declining for the first time since August 1989, its last peak. The index of business conditions for major manufacturing enterprises stood at -49 in the survey, conducted in May. The February survey also recorded sentiment of -49. The index measures the difference in the percentage share of companies reporting business conditions as favourable, minus those reporting it as unfavourable. The measure has declined from -24 a year ago. The bank warned that the survey of 716 large enterprises was taken while the yen was trading at Y110 to the dollar. Since then the yen has strengthened further to about Y106 to the dollar, which is likely to have further depressed the short-term outlook for exporters. The index of business conditions for non-manufacturing enterprises fell from  33 in the February to -38 in the May survey. Manufacturing companies reported a slight improvement in the balance of demand and supply for their products and a reduction in their inventories. A balance of about 31 per cent of companies reported they had excess inventories, compared with 38 per cent in February. A continued reduction in inventories could lead to a pick-up in industrial production in the second half of the financial year. However the survey suggests Japanese manufacturers are facing intense price competition, partly as a result of the strengthening of the yen, which is likely to eat into their profit margins. Among manufacturers the index of price conditions, which measures expected increases in output prices against expected falls, stood at -23.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Receiving Haitian refugees aboard a U.S. ship in  Jamaica's Kingston Harbor costs $120,000 a day, according to the  25 June SUN-SENTINEL, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida newspaper. The  use of a Coast Guard patrol boat to process the Haitian people  costs $2,100 an hour.    A flight hour for each of the six helicopters accompanying  the patrol boat costs $750, the newspaper reports. The operation  for relief and repatriation of Haitian refugees constitutes the  Coast Guard's largest operation since the second World War, a  U.S. Coast Guard official told the newspaper. According to him,  there have never been so many U.S. warships, from both the Coast  Guard and the Navy, on the open sea. Eight U.S. ships, 15 Coast  Guard patrol boats, and hundreds of immigration service members  are participating in the relief and repatriation operations. The  U.S. ship, USNS Comfort, which is anchored in Kingston Harbor,  is temporarily receiving the Haitian refugees to allow them to  present their political asylum requests to the United States.  The Haitians, whose requests have been rejected, are repatriated  to Port-au-Prince. This is what the SUN-SENTINEL reported on 26  June. It said that $120,000 is spent daily [pauses] must be  spent daily on Haitian refugees.</p>

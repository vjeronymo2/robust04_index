			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Defeated Irish government faces election IRELAND is to hold a general election in three weeks, following the defeat of the government on a confidence motion yesterday. The opposition parties were joined by the Progressive Democrats (PDs), who had withdrawn from the coalition on Wednesday evening, in voting against the government on the motion, resulting in its defeat by 88 votes to 77. The election date will be November 25. An abortion referendum originally scheduled for December 3 will now be held on the same day. In yesterday's debate on the confidence motion, unemployment, the recession, taxation, Northern Ireland and public probity were signalled as issues that will dominate what will be a brief but intense electoral campaign. In the first clashes of the campaign, the prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, accused the PDs of undermining his government. He said: 'Coalitions where the junior partner holds the senior one to ransom do not work with the same cohesion and effectiveness (as single-party governments).' He claimed that the opposition parties would be unable to form a stable government and said: 'I believe that single-party, Fianna Fail government under my leadership can do far more for this country that a chaotic motley coalition led by deputy Bruton.' Mr John Bruton, the leader of the main opposition party, Fine Gael, accused Mr Reynolds' party of having been 'a glitzy soap opera' while in government. Mr Des O'Malley, the PD leader who was at the centre of the recent coalition crisis, said he regretted his decision to abandon the coalition, but added: 'The need to give this country the opportunity to choose an effective government must come first.' Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, which may hold the balance of power in a hung parliament after the election, warned that in any new coalition 'there will have to be fundamental changes in the present set of policies on offer from (Fianna Fail and Fine Gael), and a fundamental commitment to a much higher level of integrity than has been evident up to now'. His party intends to wage 'an all-out attack on unemployment' which would be accompanied by 'a judicious and carefully planned increase in our borrowing capacity' he said. See Irish survey</p>

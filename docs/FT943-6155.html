			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Argyll The Pounds 19.7m Argyll raised from the sale of 151 Lo-Cost and Presto stores may look modest when set against their Pounds 150m of turnover. But to realise more than asset value is a satisfactory result given the tough conditions small discount stores now face. The superstore groups, including Argyll's Safeway, have responded very effectively to the increased threat from the discounters as the problems of Shoprite show only too clearly. Kwik Save is having to work hard to grow sales and the continental European newcomers are thought to be finding the pickings less easy than they imagined. The going is particularly tough for the smaller shops, and the fact the Lo-Cost outlets are to be converted into the Spar convenience format reflects the view that, at an average of 2,100 square feet, they are no longer big enough to succeed as discount stores. Argyll's remaining Lo-Cost outlets are more than twice the size and can be expected to fetch better prices. The problem for the smaller stores was that they did not have the range, particularly in fresh foods, to compete with the new breed of convenience stores. Groups like Watson &amp; Philip and T&amp;S Stores are bringing to convenience shops the technology now standard in larger supermarkets. Thanks to the huge changes in retailing systems in recent years, Tesco argues that it can now make money out of much smaller units. But they are unlikely to become more than a sideshow for the leading chains while the returns from superstores remain so attractive.</p>

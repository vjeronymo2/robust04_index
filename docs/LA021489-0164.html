			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PACERS SHOOT FOR KINGS' WITTMAN  </P> <P> The Indiana Pacers are attempting to trade for veteran NBA guard Randy Wittman,  an Indianapolis native and former player at Indiana University, general manager  Donnie Walsh confirms. The 6-foot, 6-inch Wittman, a three-year starter with  the Atlanta Hawks, has played sparingly this season with the Sacramento Kings,  averaging 4.0 points in 29 games.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get him, but Sacramento has something to say about that,"  Walsh told the Indianapolis News. He would not say what the Kings were asking  in return. Walsh also would not comment on other recent trade talks with  Dallas.  </P></p>

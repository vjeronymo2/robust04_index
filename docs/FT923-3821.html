			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Lloyd's choices A TOP job at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market that has been weighed down by losses and scandals, is the very opposite of a bed of roses. Yet Mr Peter Middleton, the banker and one-time diplomat whose appointment was yesterday approved by the ruling council, has at least one consolation as he sets about his new job. Things have been so bad that they could hardly get much worse; and Lloyd's fortunes might just conceivably be on the turn. The revolt of the Names, who provide capital to the market, appears to be dying down. Indeed the risk may now be that the council's reformist inclination may lose some of its impetus. Mr Middleton should pre-empt criticism on this score by indicating his priorities. The report of the Lloyd's Task Force, published in January, provides a convenient menu from which to choose. One of its central recommendations was to strengthen the capital base. Lloyd's has been encouraged on that score by the prospect that fewer than 2,000 Names are expected to resign this year. Yet this understates the damage, since many more would-be deserters are locked into syndicates where accounting years remain open with unresolved long-term liabilities. A vigorous attempt to close those years through some form of reinsurance would be sensible. So, too, would renewed efforts to settle outstanding litigation. But the key to Lloyd's future, apart from conditions in the insurance market generally, must lie to a large extent in eliminating the perception that the balance of risk and reward at Lloyd's is unfavourable to outside Names. Leaving aside the regulatory issues that are outside Mr Middleton's remit, this points to the urgent implementation of the Task Force's recommendations on cutting costs. In 1988 and 1989, when Lloyd's losses were Pounds 511m and Pounds 2.06bn respectively, syndicate expenses rose by 40 per cent or more. That looks like the definition of a death wish.</p>

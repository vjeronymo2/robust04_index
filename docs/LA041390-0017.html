			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARTER LIFTS HIS BURDEN, NEW TEAM;  </P> <P> PADRES: HIS FIRST HIT OF THE SEASON, A BASES-LOADED SINGLE IN THE EIGHTH  INNING, SCORES TWO RUNS TO PUT TEAM AHEAD FOR GOOD ON THE WAY TO AN 8-6 VICTORY  OVER THE DODGERS.  </P> <P> Joe Carter was sitting alone in front of his locker Thursday morning, hours  before the Padres would defeat the Dodgers, 8-6, when Padre Manager Jack McKeon  stopped by for a quick chat.  </P> <P> "How's it going?" Carter said, looking up nonchalantly.  </P> <P> McKeon: "I'm doing great, but I want to know how you're doing, Joe? I want you  to quit worrying. Just go out there and have fun. Everything will take care of  itself, don't worry about it, because I'm sure not."  </P> <P> Carter: "Thanks, but I'll be all right. Things could be a lot worse than this.  I could be back in Cleveland, and it's snowing there right now."  </P> <P> Carter managed a weak smile, hoping to convince McKeon, along with everyone  else in the clubhouse, that he was OK.  </P> <P> But who was he trying to kid? Here he was, the new guy in town, making more  money than any player in Padre history, and he still had yet to reach base this  season.  </P> <P> Sure, he had hit the ball hard a few times, all the way to the warning track  twice Wednesday night, but all he had to show for it were zero hits in 11 plate  appearances.  </P> <P> "I knew what he was going through," said Fred Lynn, the Padre left fielder. "No  matter how many times guys tell you to take it easy and not to worry, it  doesn't do any good. I know it was eating him up. We all knew that."  </P> <P> Carter even started to incur the wrath of the 37,204 fans at San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium Thursday, and when he struck out for the second time in the game  in the sixth -- extending his hitless streak to 14 at-bats -- what could he do  but stand there and listen to some wise guy yell, "That's a $3 million swing?"  </P> <P> So you can just imagine the anxiety churning inside Carter when he stepped to  the plate in the eighth. The bases were loaded. No outs. The infield was in.  And the game was tied, 4-4.  </P> <P> It's the situation every power-hitter dreams about. Yes, even if you are 0 for  the season.  </P> <P> "If there was ever a time for me to get a hit," Carter said, "that was the  time."  </P> <P> He walked slowly to the plate, allowing the bat to dangle from his hand. He dug  his spikes into the batter's box, then stepped out as catcher Mike Scioscia  walked to the mound to discuss strategy with pitcher Don Aase.  </P> <P> They decided they would pitch Carter just as they have this entire series.  Throw him an assortment of breaking balls and off-speed pitches outside and  hope he chases them. Heck, it had worked for the past 3 1/2 games, Scioscia  said. Why change anything now?  </P> <P> Aase went into the stretch and fired a slider about six inches outside. Carter  swung anyway. Strike 1.  </P> <P> Carter groaned, stepped away from the plate to tell himself to relax, dragged  his bat across the plate and stepped in to try again.  </P> <P> Aase threw another slider, this time across the strike zone. Carter swung  again. This time, there was contact. The ball scooted sharply across the  infield dirt . . . past shortstop Alfredo Griffin . . . and, yes, into the  outfield.  </P> <P> Base hit.  </P> <P> Roberto Alomar came running across the plate. Tony Gwynn was right behind him.  And Jack Clark stopped at second.  </P> <P> The mighty drought had ended.  </P> <P> Carter showed no emotion as he stepped across first base and didn't even look  in the dugout toward shortstop Joey Cora, who had predicted after Carter's  pop-up in the second that Carter would later get the game-winning hit. Instead,  Carter said a word of thanks to the man upstairs and for the first time was  able to take that deep breath and relax.  </P> <P> "When I hit the outfield grass," Carter said, "you're talking about a big sigh  of relief. I said, 'Baseball's not supposed to be that hard, is it?' "  </P> <P> Carter's hit opened the floodgates for what surely figures to be one of the  ugliest innings the Dodgers will play this season. The Padres scored two more  runs in the eighth after a walk to Lynn and a two-run single by Benito  Santiago, and by the time the inning was over, the Padres had an 8-4 lead.  </P> <P> The Dodgers allowed just two singles in the inning, but when you walk five  batters and botch a double-play ball, funny things can happen.  </P> <P> Of course, it was a rather strange game all-around. The Padres' eight-run  outburst was three more than they scored in the first three games combined.  Calvin Schiraldi, who came onto the scene in the eighth, won his first game in  relief since July 28, 1989. Lynn, who hit his second home run in the second  inning, recorded eight putouts, just one short of the club record for  outfielders in a nine-inning game.  </P> <P> And by the time Craig Lefferts induced Jeff Hamilton into a fly out --  obtaining his second save in less than 19 hours -- 39 players, including 12  pitchers, had wandered in and out of the game. Little wonder it lasted 3 hours  34 minutes, tying the franchise record for a nine-inning home game set in 1982.  </P> <P> "It was like an American League game," said Lynn, who spent his past 15 seasons  there. "I'm used to these type of games. Hey, after about five innings, I was  just getting warmed up."  </P> <P> Actually, maybe it's the Padre offense that is just warming up. They were on  base 15 times Sunday, including six by the top two hitters in the lineup --  Joey Cora and Roberto Alomar, who also stole three bases.  </P> <P> "This is exactly what we want to do," Gwynn said. "We showcased ourselves  today. I can see a lot of games like this. Just get on base. Start running at  every opportunity. And let the big guys drive us in."  </P> <P> Yeah, even if the big guys are driving in runs with singles instead of homers.  </P> <P> "I'd rather get 100 hits with runners in scoring position rather than getting a  bunch of homers with no one on," Carter said. "The home runs will come, anyway.  I'm not worried. Especially now, because I feel like a huge burden has been  lifted from my shoulders.  </P> <P> "I feel at home now."  </P> <P> And not just because he finally was able to move out of a hotel Wednesday and  into his new house in Poway.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter where you're staying," Carter said. "If you're not hitting,  you don't do a whole lot of sleeping."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre Manager Jack McKeon, after reading about the plight of San Diego  motorcycle Sgt. Jim Kelley, telephoned him Thursday morning at Sharp Memorial  Hospital before the game and then visited him afterward, showering him with  gifts. Besides sending flowers and a card, McKeon brought Kelley and Kelley's  12-year-old son Padre caps, shirts, autographed baseballs, notebooks, pens and  about everything else McKeon could rummage out of his office. Kelley was hit  while on his motorcycle Tuesday night at 9:15, when directing traffic, by a  48-year-old woman who was charged with drunken driving. He suffered five  fractures in his lower left leg. "I just wanted to cheer him up," McKeon said.  "When I called him up, he said, 'You really made my day.' I feel good just  doing something like that for someone." Besides, McKeon figured, "Now if he  stops to give me a ticket, maybe he'll think twice." . . . As long as McKeon  was talking to Kelley, Padre catcher Mark Parent wondered, could he ask for a  tiny favor? You see, a certain major league catcher happened to be driving 78  m.p.h. on Interstate 15 Thursday morning on the way to the game, was stopped  and received a ticket.  </P> <P> Former NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and Padre chief executive Jerry Kapstein  spent the afternoon together watching the game. National League President Bill  White also attended. . . . Former Padre pitcher Dave Leiper is scheduled to  undergo open-heart surgery today in Redwood City, and several Padres are  planning to visit him Saturday after their afternoon game with the Giants. . .  . Padre reliever Mark Grant arrived in the clubhouse recently a bit surprised  to see the item someone had left above his locker. Heck, he didn't even know  what it was. To his best guess, it's a wooden Chinese dragon head. "Hey, who  left me this thing, come on, who did it?" Grant yelled to no one in particular.  Finally, Padre traveling secretary Doc Mattei stepped forward and admitted that  he was the culprit. Mattei said the item is actually a Japanese dragon head  that was presented to him this spring by the Yakult Swallows baseball team.  "It's to ward off all the demons and evil spirits," Mattei said. Said Grant:  "Thanks, I could use all the help I can get."  </P> <P> Kansas City reliever Mark Davis, who got his first save Wednesday night, sent  his regards to his former teammates via a telephone call with Grant. The  biggest adjustment for Davis? "He told me he can't believe how clean the  stadium is in Kansas City," Grant said. "There's not even a gum wrapper in the  stands. And as soon as there's a piece of paper in the bullpen, someone picks  that up." . . . Shortstop Jose Valentin of the Padres' double-A team in Wichita  suffered a dislocated left shoulder while playing Wednesday and is expected to  be out four to six weeks. . . . McKeon rested infield regulars Garry Templeton  and Bip Roberts, instead starting Joey Cora at shortstop and Mike Pagliarulo at  third for the first time this season. Catcher Benito Santiago will be given the  day off Sunday, McKeon said, allowing Parent to make his first start. . . .  McKeon said he wanted to keep Roberts out of the starting lineup for a day to  help him relax and quit putting so much pressure on himself to hit .300 again.  Roberts, the Padres' leadoff hitter, is one for 12 this season without a walk.  "I told Bip, 'The only way you can help me is by getting on base,' " McKeon  said. " 'Don't worry about hitting .300 again. Just get on base.' "  </P></p>

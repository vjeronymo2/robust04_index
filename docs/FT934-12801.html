			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Leading Article: High times on newer markets EMERGING markets are becoming popular, and to match the flurry of new funds in the west to cash in on the interest of investors there is a corresponding wave of flotations and bond issues in developing countries. Last week's proposed offer of Dollars 400m worth of shares in Telecomasia in Bangkok is a case in point. Is this flood of money becoming dangerous? US closed-end funds alone have raised nearly Dollars 4bn this year to invest in these suddenly glamorous opportunities. There is an obvious element of marketing man's gloss even in the title emerging markets itself: these are in fact high risk or immature markets, and certain of them, especially in Latin America, have been emerging for at least 150 years. Behind the hype, however, there are some solid reasons at present for investors to look outside the investment mainstream. Economic growth in the G7 industrial countries has averaged only about 1 1/2 per cent a year in the 1990s so far, and many investors in the US, for instance, appear to have concluded that shares on Wall Street have become overpriced in relation to corporate growth prospects. Yet many developing economies have been expanding at 6 per cent or more. There has been a general extension of market-oriented capitalist economic systems. China has been a sleeping giant but is now undergoing rapid change and has far greater potential than the various smaller emerging markets that have occupied investors' attention in the past. Advanced technology Improved communications have made it more practical for foreign investors to manage their portfolios in far-flung territories. Advanced technology has also transformed the dealing and settlement aspects of investment in securities, at least in the better markets. A general relaxation of financial restrictions has made the international movement of capital easier. In addition, moves towards privatisation are making available for investment substantial companies of the kind which institutional investors often find more comfortable to hold in their portfolios than they do the creations of colourful local entrepreneurs. More fundamentally, it is arguable that the whole balance of the world economy is shifting, as developing world labour is harnessed to the exploitation of imported technologies. But whether the political structures in developing countries can cope with the stresses is another matter. 'President overthrown' is the kind of news story which tests the nerves of an emerging markets investor; it is even alleged by police in Caracas that stockbrokers and other financial professionals took part in a terrorist bombing campaign in Venezuela this summer in order to force profit-making opportunities in the financial markets. Potential bubbles The immediate problem is one of potential bubbles, with market prices being pushed sky-high by the sheer volume of inflowing capital, creating a self-feeding spiral. This appears to be happening in Hong Kong, where after a previous bubble, in October 1987, share prices crashed by 42 per cent in a single day. Selecting the sound from the unsound is no easy task. Once the US was an emerging market, and much more recently so was Japan. But some of today's burgeoning markets will not make the transition to maturity. Values to an overseas investor depend not only upon the achievement of economic growth but on whether a country considers it important to honour liabilities to foreigners. Where hyperinflation exists, as it still does in too many Latin American and east European countries, it is a sign of unwillingness even to recognise domestic obligations. In China, the source of the most ambitious projections among emerging markets promoters, the suspect quality of information makes reading economic developments even more difficult than in London and New York. The fear is that when money is plentiful investors become less discriminating. Indeed the riskiest markets will, for a while, tend to be the best performers: Nigerian bonds head this year's league table. Investors in emerging markets will find life dangerous in anything but the very short term if they fail to recognise the right balance between risk and return.</p>

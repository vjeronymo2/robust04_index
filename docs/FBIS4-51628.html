			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam stressed Thursday that close relations among Korea,  the United States and Japan are essential in resolving the North  Korean nuclear dispute.    "For this reason, I hope the political state of Japan  stabilizes as soon as possible," Kim said in an interview with  the ASAHI SHIMBUN at Chongwadae (the presidential office) in  Seoul.    China firmly opposes North Korea's possession of nuclear  arms, Kim said, citing talks with Jiang Zemin during his visit  to Beijing last month.    Noting the military threat posed by North Korea cannot be  overlooked, he said Seoul and Washington are prepared to act  under any circumstances.    However, he told the Japanese vernacular daily that there  are  no signs of an imminent North Korean attack.    "The foreign media's reporting on tension on the Korean  peninsula is too exaggerated to some extent," he added.    Kim said Washington would not make a decision on the North  Korean nuclear issue and announce it without consulting him  first.    He said he anticipated substantial results at the upcoming  North Korean-U.S. working-level negotiations.    "North Korea wants better relations with the United States  to  escape from its economic straits, but the United States is  unlikely to agree unless full nuclear inspections are complied  with," he told ASAHI.    He noted that China can influence North Korea more than any  other country but does not want to unnecessarily provoke its  communist ally.    "But China holds the firm position that North Korea  absolutely should not have nuclear arms and I think its stance  is stronger than any other country in the world," he said.    Kim said he hoped to see the Japanese political situation  soon return to normal as the Seoul-Washington-Tokyo front was  very important in blocking North Korea's nuclear program.    During his summit in Toyko last month, Kim said, former  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had told him that Japan did not wish  to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council at present,  but would support Seoul's bid for a non-permanent seat in 1996.    He predicted that North Korean leader Kim Il-song was  unlikely to attend the United Nations General Assembly session  in New York this fall.    "Time is on our side, not on North Korea's side. I believe  an inter-Korean summit will take place naturally some day," he  said, adding that Seoul would not approach Pyongyang first.</p>

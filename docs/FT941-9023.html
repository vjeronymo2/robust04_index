			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Moscow devolves power to Tatarstan republic Moscow has ceded extensive financial and other powers to Tatarstan, one of its richest and most independent-minded republics, hailing the move as a model for others in the Russian federation to follow. Details of the deal, signed on Tuesday by President Yeltsin and President Mintimer Shamiyev of Tatarstan, will emerge tomorrow when the treaty is debated in the Duma. However, it appears that Moscow has allowed Tatarstan to retain its own constitution, unamended - a constitution in which Russia is mentioned only three times, once as a 'neighbouring state', and where full sovereignty including the right to veto Russian legislation is vested in Tatarstan. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the minister responsible for the regions, admitted yesterday that the Tatar constitution would stay and that it would be 'a long time' before the Tatar parliament amended it to be consonant with the Russian constitution. However, he said that Tatarstan's demand to decide what share of taxes it sends to Moscow had been turned down though the federal government would take a relatively small share of locally-raised taxes. According to newspaper reports, Mr Shamiyev admitted that the resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier in charge of finance, had made agreement possible - presumably because he had objected to the financial arrangements in the treaty. Mr Yeltsin, commenting that the agreement had been 'hard-won', nevertheless said it was 'a completely new kind of act'. Mr Shakhrai said the model could be used for other 'problem' regions and republics within Russia - such as Chechnya, where General Dzhokar Dudayev, the president, has declared independence; and in the Kaliningrad region in Russia's extreme north-west, where the local authorities have declared a customs-free zone. The deal is also being seen as a model beyond the Russian Federation. Mr Valerian Advadze, the Georgian ambassador in Moscow, said yesterday that the treaty could become a model for his country in attempting to strike an agreement with the breakaway region of Abkhazia, where fierce fighting raged until Georgian troops were expelled last September. The agreement has saved Russia from the embarrassment of having an important republic with 5m people nearly half of them ethnic Russians, effectively outside the federation. However, the concessions made may in future threaten the integrity of Russia - if other regions and republics demand the same terms.</p>

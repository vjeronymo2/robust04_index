			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERIC DAVIS MISJUDGES FLY BALL, AND REDS DROP THE OPENER, 4-3;  </P> <P> NL PLAYOFFS: VAN SLYKE'S DRIVE GOES OVER LEFT FIELDER'S HEAD, ALLOWING THE  PIRATES TO SCORE THE DECISIVE RUN.  </P> <P> Eric Davis has spent much of the last seven summers in the Riverfront Stadium  outfield. He knows the walls and corners and warning track like a homeowner  knows which doors creak.  </P> <P> So it was quite a surprise Thursday night when, in the seventh inning of a tie  game in the opener of the National League championship series, the Reds' left  fielder misplayed a drive to left by Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke, turning it  into an RBI ground-rule double that gave the Pirates a 4-3 victory over  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> "I misjudged it," Davis said quietly afterward. "I was playing shallow and the  ball was hit harder than I thought and I just misjudged it."  </P> <P> From the emptiness in Davis' voice and stare, he has not misjudged what this  loss has done to the Reds. Even though they trail only one game to none in this  best-of-seven series, their championship hopes could be in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Before 52,911 at Riverfront Stadium, they scored three runs in the first  inning, then blew the lead with their best pitcher, Jose Rijo, on the mound.  Then they lost the game because of their best defensive player, a three-time  defending Gold Glove winner.  </P> <P> As if that wasn't enough, the game ended because the Reds could not score in  the ninth inning even though their first two runners reached base.  </P> <P> With Todd Benzinger on second and Davis on first, Ron Oester bunted but forced  Benzinger at third, pinch-runner Billy Bates was thrown out on the back end of  a double steal attempt and Chris Sabo was struck out by Ted Power to end the  game .  </P> <P> "When we were down 3-0, with Rijo pitching, I really thought we didn't have  much of a chance," Van Slyke said. "I don't think anybody in the stadium  thought we had much of a chance.  </P> <P> "But this is something we have been doing all year. Somewhere, somehow, we  believe we can pull it out."  </P> <P> Even in unbelievable fashion, which is what happened after an RBI triple by  Jose Lind in the third inning and Sid Bream's two-run homer in the fourth  inning tied the score, 3-3. The Pirates might have known something good was  going to happen, since they were 15-0 during the regular season when Bream  homered.  </P> <P> With one out in the seventh, Gary Redus, batting for winning pitcher Bob Walk,  hit a one-out single up the middle against reliever Norm Charlton.  </P> <P> With Jeff King batting, Redus stole second. After King flied out, Charlton  pitched around Jay Bell, walking him to bring up Van Slyke, who was hitless in  three at-bats with two strikeouts.  </P> <P> The Reds' coaches instructed Davis to play Van Slyke shallow. So Davis moved  in.  </P> <P> "I understood it, with a quick runner on second," Davis said. "It was a good  move."  </P> <P> On the second pitch, Van Slyke hit a fly ball to left, and everyone assumed the  inning was over.  </P> <P> "We all turned to grab our gloves and go back to the field," Barry Bonds said.  </P> <P> "Just a fly ball," Charlton said.  </P> <P> Everyone in the stadium apparently knew where it was. Except Davis.  </P> <P> "I rounded first and saw him backpedaling and I thought, 'Man, maybe he's in  trouble,' " Van Slyke said. "As an outfielder, you are taught never to  backpedal."  </P> <P> Said Davis: "After my third step, I knew I was in trouble."  </P> <P> He ran back, back . . . then realized that he could not get back far enough.  All he could do was turn and watch the ball bounce on the warning track and  over the fence, scoring Redus.  </P> <P> "When I was on second base, I heard them calling him to move in," Redus said of  Davis. "I guess that move kind of backfired."  </P> <P> Davis showed no reaction after the play, simply patting his glove and returning  to his position. In deeper left field.  </P> <P> "What did you want me to do, stand there and rub my head on my shoulder?" Davis  asked. "Ten times out of 10, I catch that ball. One hundred times out of 100, I  catch that. Just tonight, I misjudged it."  </P> <P> He has played fewer games in left field this season, 55, than center field, 66.  But he would not use that as an excuse.  </P> <P> Said Van Slyke: "A slicing ball by a left-handed hitter off a left-handed  pitcher to left field, coming right at the fielder -- that's the hardest play  in baseball, if you ask me."  </P> <P> But Davis would also not use that as an excuse.  </P> <P> "I misjudged the ball -- that's what you can write," he pleaded. "Nothing else,  none of those other things. If I make that catch, nobody asks me about those  other things."  </P> <P> Davis properly noted that the ninth-inning throw to second base by Pirate  catcher Mike LaValliere might have been nearly as important.  </P> <P> With Davis on second and pinch-runner Bates on first and one out, Davis knew he  had to get to third before Sabo took any swings. That way, a fly ball could tie  the game.  </P> <P> But the Pirates, who had a conference with just-entered reliever Power, knew it  too.  </P> <P> "On the mound I told Jim (Leyland, Pirate manager) that if Davis got a good  jump going to third, I was going to throw to second base," LaValliere said.  "It's something you don't do very often, but sometimes you don't have a choice.  </P> <P> "When Power lifted his leg to go into his windup and I saw Eric take off, I had  to throw to second."  </P> <P> The gamble paid off. Davis reached third, but it didn't much matter because  Bates was thrown out at second. And Davis was stranded on third by Sabo's  game-ending strikeout.  </P> <P> "The most important play of the game for them," Davis said.  </P> <P> Although in an odd way, the Pirates' true hero may have been Walk. By the time  he had thrown his first 18 pitches, the Pirates trailed, 3-0.  </P> <P> "I thought this thing was going to be a nightmare," he said.  </P> <P> The first Red batter, Barry Larkin, walked on five pitches. Billy Hatcher laid  a perfect bunt down the first-base line, then Hal Morris singled to left,  scoring Larkin.  </P> <P> Davis then lined a ball into the right-field corner. Morris scored and Bobby  Bonilla bobbled the ball, allowing Davis to take third. Paul O'Neill then  doubled to right-center, scoring Davis.  </P> <P> The Reds had won 39 of 52 games this season when they scored in the first  inning. Leyland came to the mound, there were relievers working in the bullpen,  and Walk was stunned.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'Here I am, not even going to get out of the first inning,' " Walk  said. "In the first game of the playoffs, on national television even. Oh man."  </P> <P> But Walk gave up only one hit and allowed two baserunners over the next five  innings to earn the win.  </P> <P> "I've been through this before. I knew if I could get through the first inning,  I would be OK," Walk said. "I always win ugly."  </P> <P> The Reds can only hope they don't always lose this ugly, although today at  12:18 p.m. PDT, it could get worse. Doug Drabek, the favorite to win the Cy  Young Award, pitches for the Pirates against struggling Tom Browning.  </P> <P> "We're still OK," Davis said. "It's not a two-game series, is it?"  </P></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Engineer lobby resists decline A NEW industrial pressure group aimed at reversing almost 50 years of decline in Britain's manufacturing and engineering industries was launched in London yesterday. The UK Industrial Group expects to draw its membership from mainly small to medium-sized manufacturing companies. The 30 founding companies, representing a variety of manufacturers from all over the country, are launching a recruitment drive to increase the group's membership to 1,000 companies by the end of next year. The group is to seek a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, the Industry Secretary. It is demanding the creation of a national economic policy to foster closer co-operation between government, industry and the City of London. The strategy is more in tune with the industrial policies of the 1960s and 1970s than the 1980s. Mr David Turnbull, director general of the new pressure group, said that in the '80s 'Mrs Thatcher saw off the unions but then left industry to sort it out in a free-for-all which was fatal'. He said the group was non-political and that British manufacturing's ills could be blamed on a succession of different governments and the development of a national culture that encouraged youngsters to become bank managers and accountants rather than encouraging them to be engineers. Mr Turnbull said there was a lack of strategy in the economy, such that Britain's industrial base had been neglected for more than four decades. The position was deteriorating almost daily. The group believed that reversing Britain's balance-of-payments deficit was the key to turning the economy round. The City had to be encouraged to invest in manufacturing.</p>

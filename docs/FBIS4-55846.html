			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by </F> correspondent Gyoergyi Orban; place and date not given; Kucan  speaks in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed Hungarian translation  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Orban] On the territory of  the former Yugoslavia, war is being waged for the state borders.  Slovenia would also like a border revision with Croatia.  [passage omitted] In your view, where will all these border  battles lead?    [Kucan] The war against Bosnia-Herzegovina is being waged  because of the nationality problems. The striving to resolve  the nationality issues is justified at all events; but the means  are not justified. The method that Serb politics have chosen  for the solution is antidemocratic, and the revanchist voices  being heard from the direction of Italy luckily reflect only  certain peoples' stances on the matter of Slovenia's borders. I  hope that Europe, in the interest of its own future, will make a  stand for its own position and will defend the principle that  European borders are inviolable and cannot be altered by force,  by war.    As for the Slovene-Croatian border, on land this is  definitive; but the marine frontier has not been designated. We  have now set up a joint commission; I hope that this  professional committee will recommend to the politicians  solutions with which the Croatian-Slovenian marine borders can  also be designated definitively.    [Orban] Mr. President, you personally still know a lot of  leaders from the former Yugoslavia, but also from the new  successor states. You see events from the inside. What will be  the outcome of this war?    [Kucan] I am mostly acquainted with those leaders who also  held office in former Yugoslavia. My opinion is that the Balkan  crisis does not really depend on personalities. It is true that  in Serbia, for example, most of the threads are held in the hand  of President Milosevic; but Milosevic is not the intellectual  author of the concept of greater Serbia. The history of this  idea goes back to much older times. [passage omitted] Also,  Milosevic, from Serbia's point of view, is a really successful  implementer of this concept. As you see, a lot of people support  this concept, even from the ranks of the opposition. So, not a  lot depends on personalities. The fate of the war depends on  whether the opposing sides will accept or not the logical  European norms that are also included in the Helsinki documents.    [Orban] What is your opinion on Central European  cooperation?  Do regional relations of this kind have a future?    [Kucan] Central Europe is an objective reality, which  stretches from the Baltics to the Adriatic. I consider this as  an intellectual position. Let me quote one of your compatriots,  Gyoergy Konrad [writer], who said that Central Europe  constituted a world outlook. I agree with him, by all means.  Central Europe is a spiritual quality, a life situation, a  stance, a value system. This is where these countries' mission  lies. They have to bring these values into the common Europe.  I am convinced that the European ideal can be realized. But,  if it turns out in the end that an associated or joint Europe is  not possible after all, Central Europe will gain a new sense and  meaning. Then we will have to consider the idea of an  association in an institutional form, from the point of view of  Central Europe, as against Western and Eastern Europe.  Naturally, the question of where the borders of Central Europe  begin is still to be answered.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Study of council redundancy plans DISTRICT AUDITORS in England and Wales are to study recent local authority redundancy payments to decide whether they are lawful, in the light of a test case High Court ruling on North Tyneside council's enhanced severance scheme. The Audit Commission confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Childs, its solicitor, was preparing guidance, to be sent to all district auditors within the next month, to enable them to decide whether any enhanced payments made by councils exceeded their powers. The commission said that since the ruling councils had 'fought quite shy' of offering enhanced redundancy terms. Now the judgment had been upheld after a legal challenge from North Tyneside, the commission was to issue advice on this complex area. North Tyneside council, which made enhanced payments to 332 redundancy volunteers in 1990-91, has been advised by Mr David Allsop, district auditor, that it should consider seeking to recover the money.</p>

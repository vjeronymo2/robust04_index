			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / L800bn decree for Italy's steel industry backed The Italian government yesterday approved a decree providing L800bn (Pounds 324m) to restructure the steel industry in order to comply with production cuts agreed with the EU, writes Robert Graham from Rome. The approval came in advance of Monday's important meeting in Brussels which will review progress in implementing last December's agreement on reducing capacity in the European steel industry. It also came on the day that preliminary bidding closed for the privatisation of Ilva, the state steel concern. Bids are being made on the basis of Ilva being split into two groups - flat products and special steels. The government undertook last December to complete the privatisation this year. The decree is mainly concerned with private-sector steel producers and provides a series of financial aids and fiscal incentives to cut production and switch to other product lines. The L800bn will be available for the period 1994-97.</p>

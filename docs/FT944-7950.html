			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Electrolux may spin off metals division Electrolux of Sweden, the world's leading manufacturer of household appliances, says it may spin off Granges, its aluminium and metal-working unit, in the first half of next year. Analysts believe it could fetch up to SKr3.5bn (Dollars 477m), excluding debt. The company, which was bought by Electrolux in 1980, has a book value of about SKr2bn. The group wants to sell the unit to Swedish, European and US investors and list it on the Stockholm stock exchange, subject to market conditions. The sale is in line with Electrolux's strategy of concentrating on core business. The company has sold three industrial operations this year, with total capital gains of SKr2.78bn helping to inflate group nine-month profits to SKr5.08bn. Granges is the biggest unit in Electrolux's industrial products division, with 1993 sales of SKr7.6bn. About half of its sales are outside Sweden, with the UK being the largest single market. Its four business areas comprise aluminium, recycling, automotive and distribution. Operations include a smelting plant at Sundsvall with production capacity of 100,000 tons. Granges has benefited from the recovery in aluminium prices and the weakness of the krona. Both factors helped lift operating profits after depreciation to SKr295m from SKr182m in the first nine months as sales expanded to SKr6.8bn from SKr5.7bn. Electrolux has been dismantling its industrial products division. Earlier this year it sold Autoliv, Europe's leading supplier of car safety equipment, and two US operations, Copes-Vulcan and Blaw-Knox. Apart form Granges, the division comprises materials handling equipment, a goods protection operation, and Granges Metalock.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / LDP warns Japanese recovery is in danger: Public spending boost will need to be continued THE emergency public spending package announced by the Japanese government in August will not be enough to stimulate a recovery in Japan's ailing economy, the senior policymaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party warned at the weekend. Mr Yoshiro Mori said the Y10,700bn (Pounds 51.9bn) package would have to be accompanied by other measures to stimulate the economy, which he said was in such a depressed state that the government would have to use public spending as a stimulus for several years. Mr Mori's comments are the closest LDP leaders have come to admitting that the package was insufficient to generate a recovery. His assessment contradicts a consensus among officials and many Japanese economists that the emergency spending will create a recovery by the middle of next year. Mr Mori told a weekend seminar of LDP politicians that the government should expand borrowing to finance higher spending as the downturn in the economy will reduce tax revenues. Debate about Japan's fiscal policy is increasingly likely to extend beyond details of how to finance the emergency package and is set to encompass the question of how higher spending should be paid for. The Finance Ministry is against borrowing in order to finance a supplementary budget although it is prepared for a limited increase in borrowing through so-called construction bonds which are linked to public investment. However, it is firmly opposed to special deficit financing bonds as it fears this could open the way for politicians to continue to press for higher borrowing even when the economy has recovered. Higher borrowing during the recession of the mid-1970s led to a marked deterioration in Japan's public finances. Increased borrowing at the height of the recession proved difficult to reduce once the economy had recovered because of political opposition to cuts in public spending. Within the broader financing debate, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, is coming under pressure to consider plans for an income tax cut financed by higher consumption taxes. Although the ministry would favour higher indirect taxes, it recognises that such a move would be extremely unpopular in the depths of a recession. The ministry also opposes an income tax cut because it believes it would lead to higher savings rather than stimulate consumption.

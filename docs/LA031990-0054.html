			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MELDRICK TAYLOR'S CLAIM IS PROVED WRONG BY TAPE  </P> <P> The men who say they have Meldrick Taylor's best interests at heart called a  news conference Sunday to convince the boxing world that their man was cheated  Saturday night against Julio Cesar Chavez. Instead, they wound up proving the  opposite.  </P> <P> Promoter Dan Duva, co-managers Lou Duva and Shelly Finkel, and Taylor himself  -- after being discharged from a Las Vegas hospital after spending the night --  tried to talk their way to the victory that Chavez snatched from Taylor with a  dramatic, last-second technical knockout when he was hopelessly behind on  points.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, doctors had an injury report on Taylor that could have been the  result of a car accident, and the chief physician of the Nevada State Athletic  Commission said if it were up to him, Taylor would still be in a hospital bed.  </P> <P> "It's a hell of a way to lose a fight," Lou Duva said. "We were winning the  fight for 11 rounds, two minutes and 58 seconds. Then the referee took it away  from us."  </P> <P> Not exactly. What really happened was Taylor, leading by seven- and five-point  margins on two cards, got nailed by a Chavez right with 26 seconds left. He was  hurt, but dug in to trade punches once more.  </P> <P> Taylor had thrown more than 1,100 punches in the fight and landed 457 -- about  200 more than Chavez. But only Chavez's last punch really mattered, a  thunderous right that caught Taylor flush on the jaw with slightly more than 10  seconds left in the bout.  </P> <P> Taylor dropped on his back in a neutral corner, and referee Richard Steele  began the count. Taylor used the ropes to pull himself up at six, but sagged  backward into the corner post, supporting himself with his arms on the ropes.  At eight, Steele asked if he was OK. Taylor did not respond, but instead looked  at his corner, where Lou Duva was climbing into the ring. In that moment's  hesitation, Steele waved the bout over. There were two seconds left in the  bout.  </P> <P> "No way in hell he should have stopped the fight," said Taylor, who lost his  140-pound International Boxing Federation title to Chavez.  </P> <P> "I can't believe (Steele) would do a thing like that in a fight of this  magnitude. If I have to lose, I would have liked to lose being knocked out, not  able to get up. I was winning. It's ludicrous."  </P> <P> But Taylor -- who showed up 90 minutes late for a 10 a.m. news conference  Sunday because doctors were advising him against checking out of Valley  Hospital -- was a badly beaten and injured fighter. Although the damage was  masked by dark glasses and a small bandage on his cheekbone, Chavez's fists had  taken a terrible toll.  </P> <P> There was a "blowout fracture" of the orbital bones surrounding the left eye, a  lacerated lip that caused him to lose and swallow two pints of blood, bleeding  in his kidneys and dehydration. Taylor was placed on a stretcher and taken to  the hospital by ambulance. He was given fluids and blood transfusions at the  hospital, and took a CAT-scan to check for brain damage. The state boxing  commission suspended him for 90 days for medical reasons.  </P> <P> And yet, Taylor, the Duvas and Finkel continued to insist that a terrible  injustice had been done. Taylor had fought a masterful fight for 11 rounds and  had even outslugged Chavez for much of the 10th. But he also was tiring badly  late in the fight, and the vision in his left eye was diminishing with each  round. When asked afterward to recount the final seconds of the bout, Taylor  said, "(Steele)) didn't say anything to me. He didn't ask, 'Are you OK,' count,  or give me no kind of directions. I nodded my head, 'I'm OK, I'm OK.' And he  still stopped it."  </P> <P> But repeated viewings of the videotape -- which Taylor had not seen -- reveal  that Steele did indeed count and ask Taylor if he was OK. And Taylor did not  respond, either verbally or with gestures, until after Steele waved the bout  off.  </P> <P> Although after the fight Chavez spoke of giving Taylor a rematch, promoter Don  King is said to be working on a Chavez-Hector Camacho bout.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN TO USE GRANT TO HELP CHINA TRAIN ITS EDUCATORS  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge officials Wednesday announced that the university has  received a grant from the People's Republic of China to assist in a massive  overhaul of that country's educational system.  </P> <P> The university will use a $965,888 grant to run a series of educational  workshops aimed at boosting the quality of teaching in rural China, officials  said.  </P> <P> CSUN was selected by the Chinese government over three other universities to  receive the grant.  </P> <P> The university's application for the grant spurred some dissent last year among  faculty members who said they feared that the university would appear to be  supportive of China's totalitarian regime.  </P> <P> But physics Prof. Paul Chow, who helped the university prepare its grant  application, said the university's efforts will benefit common Chinese  citizens, not the country's political leaders.  </P> <P> "People should make a very, very clear distinction between the people and  politics," Chow said.  </P> <P> "The people must be educated. Education has no boundary."  </P> <P> More than 75% of the People's Republic of China's 2 million junior high school  teachers do not have any college education and some did not finish high school,  Chow said.  </P> <P> As part of a long-range plan to expand compulsory education in rural areas from  six to nine years, the government has launched a massive effort to retrain some  of these "unqualified" teachers.  </P> <P> China received a $50-million loan from the World Bank earmarked for educational  improvements.  </P> <P> Some of the money will be used to purchase equipment for schools, Chow said.  </P> <P> With the grant money, Chow said, staff members with the campus's China  Institute will recruit educational experts from around the world to go to China  to run a series of two-week workshops.  </P> <P> The sessions will be on topics ranging from methods of teaching physics and  geography to the use of computers for educational management.  </P> <P> Each workshop will accommodate about 40 faculty members of China's Institutes  of Education, where Chinese secondary schoolteachers go on weekends, nights and  vacations to improve their teaching skills, Chow said.  </P> <P> CSUN competed for the grant against Ohio State University, Columbia  University's Teachers College and the Ontario Institute for Studies in  Education in Toronto.  </P> <P> Some faculty members at the university were upset because they did not want to  appear to support the Chinese government that in June, 1989, killed scores of  students in a massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men square.  </P> <P> They had urged the university to sever any educational links with China until  its citizens were granted more freedom.  </P> <P> But other CSUN professors argued that a better educated populace would be  better able to press for change and freedom in their country.  </P></p>

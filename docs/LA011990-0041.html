			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> A tight structure of interlocking bars marks Ned Evans' newest abstract  paintings. Vertical and horizontal angles allude to earlier brick-wall motifs.  </P> <P> These works have a surprisingly free-flowing momentum due to the spontaneity of  thick plaster surfaces. Despite geometric regimentation of structure,  happenstance seems to ooze like liquid light from the four panels of the black  and white "Duale." Thick bands of black line act like window frames  unsuccessfully holding onto panes of milky, yellowish glass.  </P> <P> In other paintings the pattern created by right-angle meetings of colored bars  has a mesmerizing, Zen sand painting kind of motion. It suggests watery  currents and pathways through quiet gardens. Flanked on either side by small,  thin, vertical panels of solid color, the activity feels compressed and bounded  like water in a deep channel. Thick-to-thin surface treatment adds rich,  textural appeal, especially when color turns bright and assertive. (Michael  Maloney, 602 Colorado Ave., to Feb. 28.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

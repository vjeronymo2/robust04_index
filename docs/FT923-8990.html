			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BP and Italians reveal details of styrene venture BP CHEMICALS and Enichem, the Italian state-owned chemicals group, yesterday fleshed out details of their broad strategic alliance announced in May with a memorandum of understanding to set up a joint venture in styrenes. Under a new company, Styrenics Joint Venture, they will pool their activities in styrene monomer, polystyrene, expandable polystyrene and styrene acrylontrile resins. Annual sales of L1,000bn (Pounds 467.94m) are expected. The venture - which is subject to European Commission approval - will rank equally with BASF of Germany as Europe's biggest styrene group and among the world's top five producers, and should be formed by early next year. The interim period will probably be taken up assessing the value of the businesses being contributed by the partners. Although EniChem's output is much higher, it is not expected to be the bigger shareholder in Styrenics. A company official said final ownership levels had still to be decided. EniChem makes about 520,000 tonnes of styrene polymers, against BP Chemicals' 170,000, while its output of styrene monomers is about double that of the UK group. The deal reflects the strategy of EniChem, which lost L742bn after minority interests last year, to pick partners in various product areas in order to raise market share and cut costs. In May, the company agreed with BP Chemicals to use its gas process to produce 200,000 tonnes a year of high and low density polyethylene at a plant in Brindisi.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Sealink helps Stena recover STENA LINE, the Swedish ferry group, returned to the black in 1992 after improved passenger and freight volumes and a sharp turnround in the performance of Sealink, its UK operation The profit after financial items was SKr212m (Dollars 27m), compared with a SKr302m loss a year earlier. Turnover climbed 7 per cent to SKr7.98bn from SKr7.47bn, despite recession in the group's main Scandanavia and UK markets, as the number of passengers carried rose 2 per cent to 14m and freight volumes increased by 6 per cent to 788,000 units. The group's cost-cutting programme within Stena Sealink, which resulted in 1,800 job losses, changed working practices, and the closure of the Folkestone-Boulogne route, returned the unit to profit after 1991's heavy loss. The group's other ferry operations were also profitable, except for the Dutch operation, Stena Line BV, which posted a small loss. No dividend will be paid for the year, because the group said it did not have sufficient unrestricted equity following its big loss in 1991. Stena is aiming to save a further SKr200m a year from 1994, largely through job cuts. The board has confirmed plans for a SKr750m preference share issue to repay two loans taken out in autumn 1991.</p>

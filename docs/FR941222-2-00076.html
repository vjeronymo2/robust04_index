Davis, M.D., Revocation of Registration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> On June 27, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued to Robert C. Davis, M.D. (Respondent), an Order to Show Cause proposing to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, AD2917182, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The statutory basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), based upon criminal convictions in the United States District Court, District of Utah. These criminal convictions included Medicaid, insurance and mail fraud counts, as well as some counts pertaining to prescribing controlled substances not for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of professional practice. The proposed action was also based upon Respondent's lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances in the State of Utah. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail and was received by him on July 5, 1994. Respondent filed a request for hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On August 3, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition based upon an order of the State of Utah, Department of Commerce, Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (Licensing Board) which revoked Respondent's medical license and authority to handle controlled substances for an indefinite period, effective July 7, 1993. In his response to the Government's motion, Respondent argued that a hearing on this matter should be held because Respondent was appealing the criminal convictions on which the Licensing Board's revocation order was based and that Respondent would reapply for a medical license in the State of Utah if his convictions were overturned on appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 19, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, issued to him in Utah, be revoked based upon Respondent's current lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances in Utah. Neither party filed exceptions to the recommended decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 22, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that on July 7, 1994, the State of Utah, Department of Commerce, Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issued an order revoking Respondent's medical license. As a result, he is not currently authorized by Utah to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  James H. NIckens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott F. Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled that when no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks. Philip E.

This scenario is only speculation. Until the Licensing Board reinstates Respondent's medical license, the DEA does not have the statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to continue the registration of a practitioner unless that practitioner is currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the state where he is registered with the DEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator, having considered the entire record, adopts the administration law judge's opinion and recommended decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AD2917182, previously issued to Robert C. Davis, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied.

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / People: Troika beavering away at the Industrial Society Bill Beaver, director of corporate affairs at National Westminster Bank until he left abruptly in March, has turned up in the new position of marketing director at the Industrial Society. A registered charity training between 20,000 and 30,000 people a year, the Society has had a new lease of life since the arrival last year of Rhiannon Chapman as director. Beaver says she, finance director Andrew Cameron (formerly of RTZ) and he make up a 'troika leading a quiet but determined revolution'. Keen on words like 'empowerment', Beaver thinks the organisation, which in the past few years had rather lost its way, can return to the excellence in training it enjoyed in its heyday under John Garnett who stepped down in 1986 after 24 years as director. 'Lots of people go to work in fear; they ought not to. Lots of people are cynical about their work; they shouldn't be,' according to Beaver, who spends part of his free time as a Church of England priest in Brixton. 'The idea is, we don't charge as much as Harvard but we deliver the goods.' Courses range from teaching small business how to cope with EC regulation to such 'grown-up' subjects, as Beaver puts it, as helping women to deal with the 'glass ceiling'. A 46-year-old American who says that while he sounds as if he is 'just off the boat yesterday', is in fact British-trained. He studied Imperial history at Oxford, and later worked for JWT in the UK and then Barnardo's (where he 'took the Dr out of Dr Barnardo's'). Next he moved to AGB Research; some two years after he joined, it was acquired by Robert Maxwell's private group of companies, and he became the tycoon's chief of staff 'for three whole weeks'. He stayed at NatWest for 18 months. ***** Body Shop International, the 'green' personal care products group, has appointed Michael Ross to the main board as international director responsible for supporting the operations of the company's overseas franchisees. Body Shop is continuing its rapid overseas expansion and further diminishing its reliance on the UK market, which has been hard hit by recession in recent months. Ross, 38, previously ran the company's Soapworks factory in Glasgow which was intended as an exercise in improving community relations in a depressed region as well as manufacturing most of Body Shop's soap needs. Before joining Body Shop, Ross gained international business experience in the oil and gas industry. ***** Liam Strong, the recently-appointed chief executive of the struggling Sears retail empire, has moved to shake up the company's sports and leisurewear businesses, including Olympus and Millets, which have performed 'disappointingly'. Alan Vickers, the division's managing director, will leave the company to 'pursue other interests'. He will be replaced by John Fallon, previously finance director of British Shoe Corporation. The division will also be strengthened by the appointment of Kevin Gunter, currently operations director of the Budgens grocery chain, as retail operations director. Fallon will be succeeded as finance director of BSC by the financial controller, Peter Ellis. ***** Richard Macey, formerly md UK for Christian Dior Parfums, has been appointed sales director of WARNER'S UK, a subsidiary of Warnaco Inc. ***** Brian Kennerley, md of WHIRLPOOL UK, has been appointed md of a new regional sales area for the UK, Ireland, Norway and Finland. ***** Kenneth Brown, recently appointed md of J BIBBY &amp; SONS' materials handling division on the retirement of Clive Innocent, has been appointed to the main board. ***** Christopher Chaloner, executive manager, business planning, of Amerada Hess, has been appointed to the board of PICT PETROLEUM. He replaces Michael Laws, Amerada Hess's previous nominee, who has retired but remains a non-executive director of Pict. ***** David Jewell has been promoted to md of Cowie Fleet, part of T COWIE. Guy Trehearne, formerly md of T Cowie Property Developments, is being retained as a consultant to oversee current development projects, but is returning as a property consultant to an earlier employer, Edward Rushton Son &amp; Kenyon. ***** David Hall, sales and marketing director, and Peter Casben, finance director, have been appointed joint group mds of CHARLES LETTS (HOLDINGS). ***** James Dawson has been appointed sales and marketing director of AG BARR. ***** Paul Clarke, finance director of FULLER SMITH &amp; TURNER, has been appointed to the main board.</p>

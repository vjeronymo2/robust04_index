			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Triumph of the human spirit AN EVIL CRADLING by Brian Keenan Hutchinson, Pounds 16.99, 256 pages WE ARE lucky, in retrospect, that Lebanon's hostage was someone as articulate as Brian Keenan. Our good fortune has the kind of irony that the author of An Evil Cradling, whose senses of proportion and humour and curiosity seem to have survived 4 1/2 years of random torment remarkably intact, just might appreciate. Without self-pity and without pandering to voyeurs of human pain, his story surprises by emerging as one of love as much as of anguish. The true subject of the book, its preface tells us, is how in the most inhuman of circumstances men grow and deepen in humanity. It is an honest claim. One of Keenan's defences against the 'gross indignity' inflicted on him was to try and split his being to see things with distance. Perhaps because of this, the book's real voyage is not so much into the dungeons of Beirut and the Bekaa as into the minds and emotions of Keenan, his fellow hostages and their jailers. Beginning with a sketch of a gloomy Belfast youth, the story balloons in detail with the description of his abduction only four months after arriving in Beirut to teach English literature. At first he is thrown into solitary confinement, a trial so severe that further years of brutalisation pale by comparison. Keenan evokes the extraordinary power of the imagination to create worlds, a power which can terrify to the point of madness. 'I sat upon that foam mattress and it became for me a raft in a vast sea,' he writes. Later his dark cell fills with imaginary birds: 'Their frightened flight seemed endless. These birds flew backwards, flew upside down . . . I found myself hissing 'Enough, enough' as I tried to flail my way out of that insane aviary.' From this horror Keenan is rescued by the sudden arrival of his companion of the following years, John McCarthy. Their meeting is memorable. A growing friendship clearly not only sustains but enriches them. It is this love that saves them from the worse degradation of their fellow captives and even allows them to pity their tormentors. Fear of separation comes nearly to outgrow their will to be free. In some way they are able to turn their cell inside out, to reverse roles with the world beyond. Mercifully, Keenan spares us excessive detail of the humiliations inflicted by his guards. More often he dwells on their troubled and impoverished psyches, their self-loathing that translates into a fetishism for violence and a desperation for love. His sallies into the murky politics of Lebanon, too, are human-scale. He recalls watching a Rambo cheapie at a Beirut cinema before his capture, when he was appalled to find the teenage audience excitedly cataloguing the weaponry. During his extended nightmare Keenan was moved 17 times. Some quarters were relatively comfortable, some wretched. It was the process of moving that was most painful. Each time, inevitably, hopes for release would rise and then crash. Mummified with packaging tape and trussed with chains, he would be shoved into a dust and exhaust choked compartment under the chassis of a truck, 'Like bread into an oven.' Struggling to breathe over a six-hour journey was like being 'A child trying to escape from the ever tightening carcass of a dried-up womb.' A prison story without a great escape is unusual, and might have been too bleak a thing to contemplate. Keenan and McCarthy tried at every opportunity to get out. But if they failed to break their physical confinement, they succeeded heroically in every other way.</p>

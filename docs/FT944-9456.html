			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (10): Middle managers close ranks - Document image processing Middle managers in British financial services companies have for several years successfully closed ranks against the large scale introduction of document image processing. The larger the institution, the more layers of middle management it has and the less inclined it has been to embrace image processing on a large scale. A large number of jobs are at stake. Only in autonomous or green-field operations without such a bureaucratic heritage have image systems been widely installed. Most financial firms remain intensively paper-bound. The rise in their office productivity in the past decade has been minimal compared to that of the manufacturing sector and they still await their equivalent of the just-in-time systems revolution. Imaging has the potential to bring huge savings on storage space and to simplify office routines drastically. So far that potential has not been fulfilled. But the middle managers may not be able to hold out much longer against this type of automation. Systems suppliers are confident they will soon be able to convince boards of directors that they cannot do without the new technology. Once critical mass has been gained, image processing could proliferate in the same way as word processing did in the 1980s, affecting the prospects for middle managers much as word processing did those of typists. This threat has been staved off so far partly because middle managers have claimed that it was impossible to do away with paper because paper gave them the structure of their work. Without it people would not know what to do next to process a claim on an insurance policy or authorise a loan. This argument is being undermined by the progress of workflow systems, which can take over the task of supervising the sequence of actions. While no convincing cost-justification could be made for adopting image processing from the early implementations which began in the mid-1980s, David Allcock, marketing manager for Wang UK's workflow and imaging division, insists there is now strong evidence that image processing can cut costs and improve customer service and staff morale. At Birmingham &amp; Midshires Building Society, for instance, the average time taken to approve a mortgage application up to the point of an offer has been cut by image processing and workflow systems from five weeks to three. A study by the society revealed that out of the five weeks which the task had been taking the actual processing of the application took only seven and a half minutes; the rest was all waiting time. The new systems have enabled inquiries to be carried out in parallel instead of in sequence, according to the society's head of lending services Chris Marney - 'a file can be in several people's in-trays at once. It's no longer so easy for a file to go missing. And without a pile of paper on their desks the staff feel a lot better about their work.' At the TSB, a productivity improvement of about 20 per cent resulted from a rationalisation of the processing of general insurance claims. This involved the introduction of image processing and workflow systems. Fred Shaftoe, TSB's director of customer service for general insurance, says the benefit came mainly from bringing discipline into processes which were previously 'a bit of a shambles.' 'When a customer calls you can answer the inquiry at once, instead of having to get up and search for the file, which is impressive,' he says. In some European countries bank statements are being issued to customers incorporating miniature copies of their cheques. This service has not only reduced the number of queries but proved popular and has spread from Switzerland to Austria and Belgium. British banks have yet to approve its use. Another argument often used against investing in imaging was its high cost in a proprietary mainframe environment. But as the prices of powerful workstations and personal computers have fallen sharply, it now looks much more attractive to downsize to client/server systems using these machines. The cost of installing image systems is proportionately lower. Images are stored on optical disks; a 5.25-inch disk can hold about 30,000 A4-sized pages and a jukebox of disks can hold 10m gigabytes of data. Phillip Jones, an account manager for software supplier Filenet, estimates that it is now possible to support four times as many users at a quarter of the cost needed five years ago and to store four times as many documents. Many applications involving documents in finance companies look ripe for automation. Most of these companies already use scanning to capture a customer's initial hand-written inquiry, but few of them follow this through the entire system to gain the full advantage. 'The market leaders are beginning to make strategic integration of these systems, but they are still the exception rather than the norm,' says Steve Ball, a product marketing manager for Rank Xerox. The systems usually come from several different vendors, so that such integration demands the creation of a new set of standards. A central standard is likely to be Postscript, the document reproduction system developed by Adobe Systems, which recently merged with the desktop publishing firm Aldus. An important emerging standard is Den, the document enabling networking standard which is backed by a group of systems vendors led by Xerox and the network software company Novell. Recently they have been joined by several other significant forces in the industry, including a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak and the leading database supplier Oracle. The likely rapid spread of image processing systems may cause alarm among the thousands of people in the supervisory tiers of finance companies. But Mr Allcock of Wang UK argues that they can only avoid redundancy by welcoming the technology and acquiring the new skills which will be in demand, not by continuing to try to block its advance.</p>

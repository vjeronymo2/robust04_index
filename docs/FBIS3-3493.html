With 52.4 percent of the province's land covered by woods,  Fujian ranks first in the country in term of forested areas. It  has 73 percent of land reserved for forestry industry.    Over the past four years, the province has reclaimed all the  barren mountains and hills.    Places such as roadsides, river banks and villages are also  included in the annual greening program.    Newly-forested areas are usually sealed off to protect the  seedlings.    Priority was given to construct a shelter-belt along the  coast.    Governments in all localities also focused their work on  state- owned forestry centers and collectively-owned forestry  and fruit- growing centers.    By 1995, Fujian is expected to have 533,000 ha [hectare] of  firs for timber and 660,000 ha of pine for timber.    Now the province has 6.14 million ha of woods, including  680,000 ha of bamboo and large acreages of fruit trees, herbs  and flowers.    In addition to developing its national and provincial  forestry parks, Fujian aims to tap these resources to produce  paper, plywood and chemicals.</p>

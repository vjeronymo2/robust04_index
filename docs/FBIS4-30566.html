			<p>BFN     [Text] A preliminary contact for the South-North summit  talks began at the Freedom House in our side's area at Panmunjom  at 10:00 [0100 GMT] on 28 June.    Attending today's contact are Yi Hong-ku, head delegate from  our side, and delegates Chong Chong-uk and Yun Yo-chun; and Kim  Yong- sun, head delegate from the North's side, and delegates An  Pyong-su and Paek Nam-chun.    At today's contact, head delegates from both sides will  exchange greetings; delegates will exchange greetings; and Yi  Hong-ku, our side's head delegate, will be the first to deliver  a speech, followed by a speech by Kim Yong-sun, the North side's  head delegate. They will begin the discussion on the time and  venue of the summit talks.    Through his speech, our side's head delegate Yi Hong-ku will  attach importance to the South-North summit talks and will  present, in advance, a draft of an agreement proposing a  concrete time, venue, protocol procedure, and itinerary for the  summit talks.    It has been learned the draft proposes that the date of the  summit talks be mid-July and that President Kim Il-song visit  Seoul first.    This notwithstanding, as for the date of the summit talks,  if  the North side makes concessions to our side by not presenting  the date of 15 August--when the pannational rally will be  convened--our side will push for the dialogue by making  concessions on the venue for the summit talks.    At the Secretariat for the South-North Dialogue this  morning,  our side's delegates gave a final study of our side's position  and the North side's expected proposals.    Prior to departure, head delegate Yi Hong-ku said: I view  the prospects for today's preliminary contact as somewhat  affirmative in view of the North side's attitude up until now.</p>

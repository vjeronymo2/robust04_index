			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Rail unions poised to back 4.5% pay offer UNION leaders representing 116,000 rail staff were yesterday considering a fresh pay offer of 4.5 per cent from British Rail costing Pounds 79m. The TSSA white-collar union and the Aslef drivers' union looked set to recommend acceptance. A meeting of the largest rail union, the RMT, went on longer than expected. It is the first public-sector pay offer since the election and is  1/2 a percentage point above the rate of inflation. Earlier this month the unions rejected BR's offer of 4 per cent. It would also be the first pay offer for the rail industry for nearly a century which, as far as BR is concerned, did not take place within the structure of the Railway Staff's National Council. The British Rail board terminated the existing negotiating machinery on April 6 and wants to devolve as much bargaining as possible to BR's five businesses and 30 profit centres. In principle the unions are not opposed to this. They are worried, however, about not being able to refer upwards matters discussed at profit-centre level. Interim arrangements will prevail up to September. Until then talks will continue on the final shape of the new devolved-bargaining system. The BR pay offer means an extra Pounds 8.95 a week for drivers, whose basic rate will be Pounds 207.55 a week. Typical station staff will receive an extra Pounds 6.20, with a new rate of Pounds 143.85. BR's latest offer is conditional on an early settlement. The board is understood to want agreement before the Easter weekend. BR is in the final phase of a two-year change from a regional structure to a business-led structure. The TSSA said it would definitely recommend acceptance to other unions. It is understood that the TSSA's position could change if other unions reject the deal. Pay talks are likely to resume next week for 250,000 civil servants. The government is committed to raising the pay bill by between 4.5 per cent and 8 per cent following a survey of comparable private-sector jobs.</p>

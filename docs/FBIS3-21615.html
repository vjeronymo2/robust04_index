Party leader Fernando Cajias has said that the important  thing in this democratic war is to defend and preserve the  project that the party has historically endorsed.    [Begin Cajias recording] To this end it is essential to  introduce changes, because we believe that [passage indistinct].  [end recording]    The new MIR proposal is that in addition to giving an  explanation to the public, the party has to reorganize itself.

Yet this  does not prevent him from the obligation to give orientation and  guidance.    (I made) a proposal, but I did not say that he has to give  an  overly encompassing explanation of some problems, but he does  have to break his silence, particularly at an internal party  level, in order to guide party members.

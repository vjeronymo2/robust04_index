			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Ending Clause 4 cuts ties with past The words have been inscribed on every membership card issued by the Labour party since 1918. Clause 4 of the party's constitution, committing the party to the 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange', is the symbol of Labour's attachment to a collectivist past. Mr Tony Blair promised when he was elected as leader to abandon that past. His call yesterday for a fundamental overhaul of the party's constitution was the proof of his serious intent. The terms of the surprise proposal - a call for a clear, up-to-date statement of the party's objectives instead of a blunt repudiation of Clause 4 - were framed to avoid immediate controversy on the conference floor. The emphasis deliberately was on the new statement of aims and values which he will present jointly with Mr John Prescott to the party's national executive. The conference applauded loudly, although it did not quite know what it was cheering. But there was no doubt about Mr Blair's intentions. Labour has abandoned the pretence that it can run a command economy, that it can re-nationalise the privatised industries, and that the state knows better than the market. It is time, the new leader has decided, for the rhetoric of the constitution to catch up with the reality. He was confident yesterday that the move will succeed, that he will not suffer the ignominious defeat inflicted 35 years ago on the then Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell by the party's traditionalists. Then, Mr Gaitskell's vain attempt to scrap Clause 4 destroyed his leadership. Mr Neil Kinnock, the architect of the painful modernisation process which started in 1983, thought about taking up the fight again before the 1992 general election. But after forcing the party to abandon the policies which once gave substance to Clause 4, he judged that a battle over the treasured words would have been too divi-sive. Earlier this year Mr Kinnock raised the idea in public. But his successor, the late John Smith, decided to draw a line under constitutional change after his bruising battle with the unions over party democracy. In a party dogged for decades by a culture of struggle and fears of betrayal by the leadership, many of the traditionalists still regard Clause 4 as the litmus test of its socialist credentials. It was clear from the words yesterday of Mr Arthur Scargill, the miners' leader, that the unreconstructed left will fight Mr Blair as their predecessors fought Mr Gaitskell. The opponents will win support among the party's romantics. The Labour leader has decided that he has no time for such ideological purity. More importantly, nor do the voters who have kept his party out of government for 15 years. He has decided to convince the electorate that Labour really has changed. As Mr Blair told the delegates in Blackpool: 'This is a modern party living in an age of change. It requires a modern constitution that says what we are in terms the public cannot misunderstand and the Tories cannot misrepresent.' For all their attachment to the past, most in the party look ready this time to accept that Mr Blair is right.</p>

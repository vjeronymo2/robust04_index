			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAM BENNETT RESIGNS  </P> <P> Apparently Bennett, watching faithfully all these many months over our chemical  morals, feels things are well enough in hand that he can turn the job over to  someone else. Does this mean that he will start smoking again, or will he  continue to get his nicotine by way of the special gum he started chewing when  he took his anti-substance abuse show to Washington?  </P> <P> ROBERT L. BRIGHAM, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of Liberal </F> Democratic Party (LDP) by Yoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN  political department chief; place and date not given]    [Text] [Oikawa] What do you think of the compromise  reached between the coalition and the LDP to save the political  reform bills?    [Mori] There was no option left to the LDP. We had our backs  to the wall. Two cabinets have collapsed under LDP rule for  failing to achieve political reform. Consequently, the LDP also  failed to maintain its lower house majority. For all that,  could we still continue to put off settlement of this issue?  No, we could not do that. This was the time to end the  political reform impasse. The move for a compromise between the  ruling coalition and the LDP began when lower house Speaker  Takako Doi proposed a mediation plan. However, the whole thing  started when the upper house rejected the reform bills. All was  the disposition of God.    [Oikawa] The new electoral system is a combination of  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation.  What is the merit of introducing such a system?    [Mori] An electoral system should exist for the sake of the  public, and not for the benefit of politicians. If we want to  keep the new system for a while as a transitional system, the  partial introduction of proportional representation seats is  unavoidable. This time, the less powerful upper house played a  significant role, by rejecting the unconvincing political reform  package presented by the coalition government. This fact is  very important, because it proves the significance of the  existence of a two-chamber system.    [Oikawa] How soon will the political reform bills be revised  and enacted by the regular Diet session?    [Mori] It is better to strike while the iron is hot. The  amendments should be passed as soon as possible, before the Diet  starts deliberations on the budget bill for fiscal 1994.    [Oikawa] Is there no problem inside the party?    [Mori] The LDP is a mature party. All the party members will  follow once the decision is made. What we want is to initiate a  proper system as soon as possible. Once the fiscal 1994 budget  bill is placed on the agenda, we will be able to give details on  the partial revision of the political reform bills.    [Oikawa] Will the LDP take any punitive action against its  reform-shy members who disobeyed the leadership?    [Mori] I am not sure whether they really wanted to oppose  the  reform package, because they just abstained from voting by not  attending the plenary session. We may say that it was a  discreet act on their part: they took care not to make the  situation worse, while expressing their will in some way. There  is no need to call them to account.    [Oikawa] Is there a possibility of a party split?    [Mori] I cannot say whether there is such a possibility or  not. When the LDP was in a delicate situation because of the  sharp divisions between pro-reform and reform-shy camps, both of  them said that united action was indispensable. So, President  Yohei Kono and I once thought that there would be no other way  but to let the bills die. We were able of avoid a party split,  and that was really a disposition of providence.    [Oikawa] LDP lawmakers elected from urban districts are  expected to have a tough time in the next election under the new  system. Do you not think that these members might leave the  party?    [Mori] We have to find a way so that 80 to 90 percent of  incumbent LDP lawmakers can be reelected, because those who may  withdraw from the party are mostly concerned about reelection.  To cope with the new electoral system, we will soon discuss how  to prepare for the next election by reorganizing the party and  creating a new structure.    [Oikawa] Some people say that President Kono is planning to  support the government from outside the cabinet or to form a  grand alliance with the ruling coalition. Is this true?    [Mori] The collaboration between the ruling coalition and  the  opposition LDP brought about the settlement of the much-awaited  issue. The public should feel relieved to see both forces  arriving at a compromise after a long quarrel. I cannot  definitely say that the LDP is planning to support the  government from outside the cabinet. I can only say that  President Kono has made many suggestive remarks.</p>

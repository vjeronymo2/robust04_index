			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Zavarskiy report: "`Rosvooruzheniye' Company Press </F> Conference. A Small-Caliber Show to be Held In Vladimir"]    [Text] The "Rosvooruzheniye" state arms company held a  news conference in Vladimir yesterday devoted to a firearms and  small-caliber artillery weaponry show from 24 to 28 May. While  rather representative delegations of potential foreign buyers  are expected to be on hand at the show, "Rosvooruzheniye"  representatives seem to be worried by other problems.    Russia has two fairs selling its arms -- in Nizhniy Novgorod  (heavy combat equipment) and in Vladimir (small arms). As was  announced at the news conference, the May exhibition in Vladimir  will showcase many of the latest models of small and special  arms including models not yet mass-produced. They are mainly  portable submachine guns (in particular the "Vikhr" and the  9A-93 model) superior to the Israel's Usi, as well as individual  weapons of an "enhanced stopping power" -- the "Gyurza" pistol,  and the "Udar" 12.7mm revolver. Right there at the show (it  will cost 170 million rubles) one would be able to buy sporting  guns made in Tula and Izhevsk plants.    The troubles involved in arranging the show are much less  than the anxiety clearly plaguing the "Rosvooruzheniye" company.  The point is that the government decree of 8 May 1994 grants  weapons manufacturers the right to independent external economic  activity. According to Colonel Aleksandr Semenov, deputy chief  of the "Rosvooruzheniye's" regional policy administration, the  decree does not rule out cooperation between the company and the  manufacturers as regards marketing, looking for customers, and  pricing. However, Mr. Semenov said, the "Rosvooruzheniye" is  yet to make sense of the decree whose issue came for the company  as somewhat a surprise. "Rosvooruzheniye" representatives were  more specific talking in the press conference lobby -- they  thought the government decree clashes with the president's edict  under which the company was set up. According to one guess, the  decree was just a "tranquilizer" given to the arms manufacturers  many of whom "reacted rather nervously to the setting up of a  state monopolist in the shape of the "Rosvooruzheniye."</p>

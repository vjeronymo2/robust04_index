			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUEEN AT 3;  </P> <P> COMMERCE GIRL POSSESSES POISE BEYOND HER YEARS  </P> <P> The 3-year-old beauty queen was on the living room floor, her eyes fixed on the  television screen as a videotape of her victories rolled.  </P> <P> When it ended, Brandi Nichele Alvarez rose with a smile and walked across the  room. Because she is shy and young, she did not talk about the two beauty  contests she has won, nor did she mention the six- and seven-foot trophies, the  $75, the rabbit fur coat, the six-inch television set, several decorative  crowns and the "Talking Mother Goose." She has also won the right to compete  for the Miss American Beauty Pageants' national title this summer in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> But John Alvarez tells a story that reveals some of his daughter's thoughts.  </P> <P> "There was one time we called her princess and she said 'I'm not a princess.  I'm a queen,' and then she starts to laugh," said Alvarez, 27, a bartender and  long-time Commerce resident.  </P> <P> Alvarez and his wife, Nancy, hope the beauty contests eventually will lead to  parts in television commercials and perhaps a modeling career when Brandi grows  up. But they say it is too early to tell whether Brandi will be successful or  happy in that role. "I'd like to see her be a performer," Alvarez said. "We'll  just guide her and let her make her own decision."  </P> <P> The young queen smiles easily but is quiet. She is petite with round dark eyes,  long lashes and auburn hair. Brandi likes to look at books and sing when she is  at home. Her mother said Brandi is trying to learn the words to "Over the  Rainbow." Her parents say she has plenty of "ham" in her, that she has always  enjoyed dressing up and being in front of a crowd.  </P> <P> Brandi has long drawn the compliments of admiring adults.  </P> <P> "I went to this Tupperware party and this girl told me I should put her in a  baby contest," her mother said. "I had to hold her (during the contest). She  was about six months old."  </P> <P> Initially, Brandi competed only in city-sponsored baby contests. She won first  place for the longest eyelashes in 1986, an award for cutest nose in 1987, and  another for longest eyelashes in 1988.  </P> <P> Then came the Christmas Wonderland Beauty Pageant last December at the Park  Hotel in Anaheim. The event was sponsored by Miss American Beauty Pageants of  West Covina. Miss American stages preliminary pageants throughout California  and in 15 other states leading up to its national contest, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Brandi won the overall title for 3-year-olds and an award for having the  prettiest eyes. She competed against 10 other girls.  </P> <P> "When she won we both looked at each other and didn't know what to say," said  Nancy Alvarez, a cashier at a fast-food restaurant. "I was shaking."  </P> <P> Brandi possesses ability and poise beyond her years. She flashed a little smile  and appeared to be at ease as she walked down the runway. A petticoat filled  out her pink and white dress.  </P> <P> "There's no problem with her going up on stage or before people," her mother  said. "She's not afraid."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Preparation  </P> <P> Nancy Alvarez said she did little to prepare her child for the December  contest. But for the second one, Brandi studied the tape from her first victory  to see how some of the more experienced girls moved.  </P> <P> "She kept watching and watching it," her mother said. "I kept showing her,  'See, that's how you stand.' "  </P> <P> Brandi swept every category she entered in the Valentine Sweetheart Pageant in  Anaheim in February, taking home overall honors for 3-year-olds. She competed  against 11 other girls.  </P> <P> But the mini-beauty queen has only just begun. The Alvarezes, proud and still a  little surprised by their daughter's success, say they plan to keep entering  her in contests.  </P> <P> The Alvarezes, who have three other children, say they are careful not to  pressure their daughter.  </P> <P> "We don't push her. Some of the parents get on their daughters," Nancy Alvarez  said. "If she wins, she wins. She likes being with the girls and getting  dressed up."  </P> <P> Some of Brandi's showmanship qualities surfaced last week during activities at  her day-care center at the city's Rosewood Park. The instructor taught the  3-year-olds a step to a Mexican folk dance.  </P> <P> After Brandi performed a rough rendition, she smiled and took several bows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Classmates Don't Notice  </P> <P> Her beauty goes virtually unnoticed by her classmates. "They're still a little  too young for that," day-care instructor Mary Anne Griego said. And Brandi  takes part in the usual childhood antics -- a young boy turned his hands into  the shape of a gun and shot at Brandi. She returned fire.  </P> <P> The Alvarezes say they are mindful of the pitfalls that accompany beauty.  </P> <P> "She hasn't changed at all," John Alvarez said. "We've noticed no change. We  hope there won't be."  </P> <P> So Las Vegas, with all its glamour, awaits the young beauty queen who has a  knack for charming a crowd. She has been practicing her walk in the family  living room, and her mother plans to buy her a new pageant dress. The  competition is expected to be stiff, but Brandi seems unworried.  </P> <P> Asked if she thought she would win, Brandi nodded her head, smiled and said in  the tiniest of voices, "yeah."  </P></p>

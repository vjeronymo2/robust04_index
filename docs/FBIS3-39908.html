			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "voel": "Crimes Down 1.7 Percent"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Two weeks ago, Interior Minister Franz  Loeschnak presented the "most pleasing," but only preliminary  1993 crime statistics: Criminal offenses decreased by 0.5  percent. On Tuesday [22 February], he presented the final  figures: The total number of criminal offenses went down by 1.7  percent in 1993. The total number of offenses committed was  493,786, that is 8,654 fewer than in 1992.    The decline in crimes is reflected in eight of the nine  provinces; only in Vorarlberg was there a 7.7 percent increase.  At 6 percent, Burgenland saw the biggest decrease; in Vienna  the crime rate went down 1.4 percent.    Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek said that for the first  time in seven years the number of crimes fell. The Justice  Ministry will present a draft to change the criminal law in  order to be better able to fight major crime. This should hit  organized crime particularly where it is most vulnerable, at its  financial center. It must be made easier to get at the profits  from criminal offenses, Michalek said.    Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider  accused  the interior minister of "being at war with truth." He said  Loeschnak was doing "first-rate cosmetics." If fewer offenses  are indicated, this is due to the fact that fewer are being  registered.    Haider also criticized the fact that criminals continue to  draw social benefits, such as unemployment and social welfare  benefits, while they are in prison. "The longer you are in  jail, the richer you get," he concluded.    The Justice Ministry rejects these accusations: The fact is  prisoners draw neither unemployment benefit nor social welfare  benefits. It is only after release from prison that they have a  right to social welfare benefit, or -- if they worked in prison  -- unemployment benefit. Incidentally, the FPOe was involved in  passing this regulation in parliament.</p>

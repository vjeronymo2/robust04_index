			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has denounced  the use of destructive weapons and the shelling of secure  villages and cities by missiles, inflicting heavy human losses.  This is in addition to the material and moral damage involved.    The party said innocent citizens killed in secure  residential  quarters and villages are the victims of secessionist disputes  and selfish interests that govern the conduct of those who  showed no seriousness and credibility toward the crisis.    The party reiterated its adherence to, and support for,  unity  by all legitimate Constitutional means since it is more  important and precious than any other objective in its struggle  and existence.    The party said it will spare no effort to protect unity. It  strongly rejected any reasoning and conduct that harms unity.  The party said now that blood has been shed, bodies have been  torn apart, and children, women and old people have been  terrorized, the required position should be to show concern  about the suffering of the homeland and transcend narrow,  conflicting whims and interests that distort the homeland and  destroy the deep-rooted values and meanings that associate the  Yemenis with the Constitutional institution, avoiding regional  and sectarian loyalties.    The statement of the Ba'th Party in Yemen, addressed today  to  the masses of the Yemeni people, reasserted the party's  rejection of any Arab or foreign intervention under the pretext  of disengaging the warring troops, stressing that this is an  internal question.</p>

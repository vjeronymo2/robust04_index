			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Greenspan calls for freer banking Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve board, yesterday renewed his call for Congress to do away with the remaining barriers that cut US banks off from the rest of the financial services industry. He said that banks should be given broader authority to sell insurance products, and urged the abolition of the Glass-Steagall act, which stops commercial banks selling or underwriting securities. 'Insurance sales are virtually riskless, and our experience over several years with Section 20 affiliates (banks' securities subsidiaries), and the increased dealing activities in derivatives, securities and foreign exchange suggest that the risks resulting from repeal of Glass-Steagall are largely manageable,' Mr Greenspan told a financial services conference run by Boston College. He said that there should be only two tests of whether to let banks enter new businesses: whether the activity improves the deployment of assets, capital and human resources to meet the public's need for financial services, and whether the risk is acceptable. Although banks have taken advantage of new technologies to serve their customers, Mr Greenspan said he was concerned that they 'may be reaching the limits' in their efforts to do so. Mr Greenspan's call was seen yesterday by some in the banking industry as an attempt to set the agenda for the next stage of US banking reform, after the passage through Congress this month of the inter-state banking bill. This measure, when it has been signed into law by President Bill Clinton, will let banks open or buy branches more freely outside their home states.</p>

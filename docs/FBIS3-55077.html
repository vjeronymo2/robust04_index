"In the near future we want to appeal with  an initiative to the Liberal International, which unites parties  from the whole world that have a liberal democratic orientation,  to deprive the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia of its name,  because being chauvinistic in content, this party has  discredited the ideas of liberalism and democracy, said  Volodymyr Klymchuk.</p>

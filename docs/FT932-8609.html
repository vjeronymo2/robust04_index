			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Lower krona lifts Atlas Copco 10% to SKr315m ATLAS COPCO, the Swedish tool manufacturing group, increased profits after financial items by 10 per cent in the first three months to SKr315m (Dollars 42.9m) from SKr286m in the same period last year. The group said it benefited from the lower value of the krona, which offset a substantial drop in volumes. Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr4.29bn from SKr3.83bn, while orders were 5 per cent higher at SKr4.62bn. Operating earnings after depreciation fell 13 per cent to SKr285m, reflecting the drop in volumes, the group said. 'Demand in Europe continued to decrease during the first quarter due to the overall weakened economy, particularly in Germany, Italy and Spain. Rising demand in Great Britain and North America did not compensate,' it stated. The group's main division, compressor technology, saw operating profits slump to SKr202m from SKr261m, although sales rose to SKr1.96bn from SKr1.78bn. Profits in construction and mining technology fell to SKr38m from SKr46m, but industrial technology improved to SKr78m from SKr41m on the back of cost-cutting. The lower overall operating performance was offset by a sharp drop in interest expenses and a positive impact from exchange rate movements. The group is sticking to its forecast of improved earnings for 1993. However, the weak sales trend is expected to continue, especially in Europe, which now accounts for 54 per cent of orders, compared with 61 per cent a year ago. All other regions have increased their share at Europe's expense, with Asia/Australia accounting for 17 per cent of orders, North America 16 per cent, Africa and the Middle East 8 per cent and South America 5 per cent.</p>

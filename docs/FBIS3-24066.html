They are accompanied by no less interesting events which have a  direct influence on the fate of each of the residents of the  free economic zone "Nakhodka."    We will begin, perhaps, with the second of these--the  official statement adopted by a group of businessmen,  politicians and jurists of Nakhodka. Among those signing it are  people who are rather well known in the city: Sergey Bondarev,  Oleg Oksuzyan, Sergey Diltayev, Gennadiy Zuyev, Igor Sirotinin,  Sergey Romanchenko, Raisa Govorukha, Valentin Zavadnikov, Viktor  Pokotilov and others. This statement is a reaction to the  actions of the city administration, and primarily Mayor Viktor  Gnezdilov, in regard to the free economic zone. The most  important and perhaps the most frightening is the fact that, as  a result of these actions the FEZ [free economic zone]  "Nakhodka" is becoming, in the opinion of those signing the  statement, an unfavorable place for enterprise. And the very  project of the FEZ may turn out to be a complete fiasco.    In essence, all this is the result of opposition of the two  primary political forces in the city. One of them is represented  by the managers of most of the city's major enterprises, who  have made their careers within the command-administrative system  and who are trying to hold on to their positions at any cost.  The other is comprised of self-made individuals, people who  represent the entrepreneurial milieu. Both occupy an important  place in the structure of the FEZ. But, unfortunately, they have  still not found a common language. Nevertheless, certain goals  have been achieved. Government decree No. 540 regarding the FEZ  "Nakhodka" has largely lost its effectiveness, especially in  regard to customs and tax benefits.    The actions of Viktor Gnezdilov may have a much more  lamentable effect for the territory. In the opinion of the  financial director of the FEZ administrative committee, Valentin  Zavadnikov, as a result of the aggressive exercises of the  mayor, the zone will never even see the new tax credit for 1994.  And this means a loss of over 100 billion rubles (R), a  considerable portion of which would have been handed over on a  non-compensatory basis to the city administration for social,  cultural and domestic needs.    There is another piece of joyless information for the  stockholders of Nakhodka enterprises. In the opinion of the  director of the Nakhodka Financial Joint-Stock Company, Gennadiy  Zuyev, the result of the perturbations which are taking place  will be a sharp and significant decline in the exchange rate of  stocks in local AO [joint-stock companies]. The decline in  business activity on the territory of the FEZ not only by  domestic, but also by foreign businessmen is entirely  predictable.    The situation underlying the events is rather primitive--a  banal struggle for power. For this V. Gnezdilov needs to  maximally weaken the positions of the FEZ administrative  committee and place his own people in key positions. And that is  what is going on now.    Why did the heads of administration of Nakhodka and  Partizanskiy Rayon adopt a decree on the de facto elimination of  independence of the administrative committee, giving it the  status of a department under the city administration? This  contradicts the government decree, according to which the  administrative committee is subordinate to the government of  Russia.    Making use of the fact that former administrative committee  chairman Igor Ustinov became a deputy in the State Duma and left  to work in Moscow, V. Gnezdilov decided to arbitrarily replace  the head of the committee. The general director of the TOO  [Limited Liability Partnership] "Nakhodkagrazhdanstroy," Sergey  Dudnik, was named to this position. We might add that this  decision was made in spite of the opinion of the city  administration board of directors, as well as of the  entrepreneurial circles. We will add that if we consult the  opinion of residents of the Northern Microrayon of Nakhodka  regarding this candidacy, they would have a few unflattering  things to say about Sergey Aleksandrovich. And, a fact which is  of principle importance is that here too the procedure specified  in government documents was violated. According to these  documents, the agencies of local self-government only recommend  candidacies for the position of administrative committee  chairman, and the government makes the decision regarding the  appointment. In fact, according to Igor Ustinov's last  directive, Aleksandr Kotikov is to perform the duties of  chairman until the lawful appointment of a new chairman. In  other words, we may speak of violation of the law.    Since that is the case, the authors of the statement intend  to insist on the restoration of legality, the appointment of  chairman of the FEZ Administrative Committee with involvement of  all interested parties. Otherwise, they will demand the  resignation of the mayor.    But for now, on the threshold of the March elections, the  mayor is in a hurry to place the necessary people in the  necessary positions. And his desire to retain his seat stands  above the idea of a free economic zone, whose forefather Viktor  Semenovich considers himself to be. We are afraid that as a  result of the palace intrigues, the city's residents will lose  their prospects for improving their standard of living, as well  as new jobs and many other things that the FEZ can give them,  yet an ordinary provincial city, of which there are hundreds in  Russia, can never give them.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japan has eyes for Vietnam's market - Many companies are studying the possibility of investing When Japan's Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama arrives in Hanoi today, his Vietnamese hosts will be hoping that their guest, in true Japanese tradition, does not arrive empty-handed. For whatever small gift Mr Murayama may bring with him, whether it be a rumoured expansion of trade insurance coverage or even a murmur of support for greater trade, is likely to have a favourable effect on economic relations between the two countries. While Japan is Vietnam's largest donor of official development aid, and responsible for 27 per cent of the trade Vietnam does with the rest of the world, it has contributed only about 5 per cent of the value of foreign direct investment in Vietnam and ranks seventh after countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and others in the Asia-Pacific region. 'In many respects, the conditions are not yet ripe for Japanese companies to invest in Vietnam,' says Mr Morihito Kosuda, of Nissho Iwai, a Japanese trading and publishing company. It is true that in the past few years, interest in Vietnam both as a market and manufacturing base has spread considerably among Japanese businesses. A wide range of companies, from machinery makers to financial institutions, have opened offices in Vietnam; some manufacturers have started to implement local production plans. Mitsubishi Materials and Nihon Cement have tied up with a Vietnamese public corporation to build the country's largest cement facility with a capacity of 2.3m tonnes a year. Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Corp, the trading house, have set up a joint venture company with Proton, the Malaysian vehicle maker, and a Vietnamese public corporation, to make small buses. Production of an initial 1,000 buses a year is scheduled to start early next year and the company hopes to make passenger cars eventually. Showa Plastics and Sanyo, the consumer electronics company, through their joint venture company in Singapore, are building a factory in Ho Chi Minh City to manufacture TV exteriors and video-tape recorders which they hope will eventually manufacture air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators. Fuji Bank, which is doing buoyant business guaranteeing letters of credit issued by Vietnamese banks, hopes to upgrade its office in Vietnam to a branch next year so that it can meet the growing needs of Japanese businesses. Many more companies, including Sony and Toyota, are studying possibilities in the Vietnamese market. But on the whole, Japanese companies have been relatively slow to respond to the emerging opportunities in Vietnam. 'The Vietnamese market will eventually grow into a very big one, there is no disagreement on that,' says Mr Kosuda. 'Where opinion is divided is on the short to medium-term prospects.' Japanese companies frequently cite the poor state of Vietnam's infrastructure as a deterrent to investment. 'If you go to Ho Chi Minh City, this is immediately noticeable,' says Mr Hiroshi Matsumoto, of the trading company Mitsui, which has been exporting oil and sea food from Vietnam to Japan and importing machinery and chemicals from Japan. 'Power shortages are frequent and the basic infrastructure, such as ports and roads, is lacking'. The relative lack of information on Vietnam and the difficulty of procuring materials, combined with the inherent caution that Japanese businesses have towards investing overseas, has also held back many companies. 'Vietnam is going through a period of reconstruction after the war and of transition from a social planning economy to a more market-oriented one at the same time,' Nissho Iwai's Mr Kosuda says. 'That makes it very difficult to ascertain the true state of the markets there.' Honda, for example, despite having more than 90 per cent of the Vietnamese market for motorbikes, exports neither motorbikes nor vehicles. Many were sold into Vietnam prior to the Vietnam war, while others have come in from third countries. 'We don't have the information and the know-how to justify the considerable investment that would be required to start local manufacturing,' a company representative says. It is, anyway, early days for Japanese companies, which tend to take a long-term view, says Mr Kosuda. 'It is only six months since the US embargo was lifted, and some Japanese companies only started to think about Vietnam after that.' Another powerful disincentive for Japanese companies, says Mr Kosuda, is the lack of an official government system supporting Japanese trade and investment in Vietnam. 'The only formal agreement Japan has with Vietnam is the bilateral aviation accord signed in May.' Vietnam has much that Japan is seeking. Unlike most other oil sources in south-east Asia, Vietnam produces oil that is the right price and quality for the Japanese market, especially the electricity industry, with Japan buying 70 per cent of Vietnamese oil, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. Oil, sea food and garments, all of which face growing demand in Japan, are Vietnam's biggest export income earners. If the Japanese government now gives a concrete sign of its support for greater trade and investment in Vietnam, it will be sending a strong message to Japanese businesses, Mr Kosuda adds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Maria Romantschuk report: "EU Dominated Debate in Nordic </F> Council"]    [Text] Stockholm -- As expected, the EU [European Union]  ended up dominating the general debate at yesterday's session of  the Nordic Council.    Advocates of the EU are convinced that cooperation within  the  EU will have a positive effect on Nordic cooperation, whereas  Norwegian opponents, in particular, doubt this.    During the debate, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the  leader of the Moderate Coalition Party, who seemed to be the  person most enthusiastic about the results of the negotiations  with the EU, cited Carl Jonas Love Almqvist and made a  comparison with Robinson Crusoe's meeting with Friday.    "Regarding the platform that Almqvist sketched out, he says  that it would be valuable to have a coin of the same value,"  quoted Bildt from the 1846 work of the writer, Almqvist.    "It was right then," he continued. "It has been right since  then, and it continues to be right," he said, responding to a  question raised by Norwegian Center Party leader Anne Enger  Lahnstein, who may be said to symbolize EU opposition in Norway.    In her speech, she wondered how politicians who are in favor  of the EU intend to get the people on their side and pointed to  opinion polls showing that opposition to the EU has a firm base  among the broad masses.    "When policies get really bad, then they hide behind opinion  polls," remarked Bildt.    He praised the informal cooperation that also characterized  Nordic cooperation and views the EU as a possibility.    "We are taking the step into the European, but this is  providing us with opportunities to give Nordic cooperation a new  lease of life. I am convinced that those who believe that  cooperation will now be weakened do not understand what is  happening. It is now that the Nordic area has its big chance."    When Enger Lahnstein said that she was worried about losing  independence, Bildt made his comparison with Robinson Crusoe:  "Robinson Crusoe was independent on his isolated island. He  made all his decisions for himself until Friday appeared on the  scene. When Friday arrived, Robinson Crusoe lost a little of his  independence," Bildt admitted, but he went on to say that in  today's world there was no room for a Robinson Crusoe policy on  an isolated island.    Anneliese Dorum of the Norwegian Labor Party wondered  whether  conservative or social democratic policy will be pursued in the  united Europe. In reply, Bildt could only say that it would be  the voters who decided that. Norway's Kjellbjorg Lunde, from  the Socialist Left Party, said that she believes that Bildt  wants the help of the EU to scrap the Swedish welfare state.  Prime Minister Bildt sees a no to the EU as a yes to isolation  and views this as the worst alternative in every respect.    Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson, the leader  of  the Swedish opposition, also spoke of the EU in glowing terms:  "The Nordic area is being given a whole new platform to  revitalize its own cooperation," said Carlsson, who does not  believe that Nordic cooperation will be watered down within the  EU. "Brotherly and sisterly feelings are not lessened by  getting together with our cousins. If the political will is  there, then I am convinced that, on the contrary, European  cooperation will strengthen the family's togetherness."  <H5>  Nothing About the Nordic Council in the EU Agreement </H5>   Eduskunta deputy Mats Nyby of the SDP [Finnish Social  Democratic Party] wondered why Nordic cooperation had not been  written into the outcome of the negotiations with the EU that  had been achieved the previous week in Brussels in the same way  that it is written into the EEA [European Economic Area]  agreement. He is worried that the omission of this clause from  the EU agreement could hinder Nordic cooperation in the united  Europe. Nyby suspects that Council cooperation was deliberately  left out of the agreement.    Meanwhile, Eduskunta deputy Claes Andersson of the Left-Wing  Alliance wondered why the EEA administration is already being  dismantled before the referendums have been held in the  respective candidate member states. In his opinion this  demonstrates a contempt for democracy and the will of the people.    Ole Norrback, the minister for Nordic cooperation, made it  clear that membership in the EU did not mean that there would  necessarily be any haggling over Nordic cooperation. On the  contrary, such cooperation is a more active period.    "Nordic cooperation can certainly function best if all the  Nordic countries have the same relationship to the EU, but no  country can be left out of Nordic cooperation, regardless of  what happens with the membership of the remaining countries."    Eduskunta deputy Erkki Tuomioja (SDP) said that the Nordic  Council must not become an oversight body for Nordic European  policy.  <H5>  A European Line Vis-a-Vis Russia </H5>   During yesterday's session, Prime Minister Esko Aho  reiterated his conviction that the EU simply presents Nordic  cooperation with a challenge. In his speech, he also touched on  the line to be taken toward Russia.    "As far as Russia is concerned, there is only one European  line, which the Nordic area should also support and actively  promote. We must avoid isolating Russia or allowing Russia to  isolate itself from the European community or from Nordic  cooperation."    Hjorleifur Guttormsson of Iceland's People's Alliance  wondered why in his speech Aho did not go into the EU's foreign  and security policy, which Finland as an EU member state must  embrace.    Aho stated that Finland has said that it is ready to  participate in that process "if we are members of the EU when it  happens." However, he said that in the future too the guiding  principle in Finland's foreign and security policy will continue  to be military nonalignment and an independent defense force.    Also Finnish Social Democratic Party leader Paavo Lipponen  believed that it was important for Finland to be involved in  shaping the EU's foreign and defense policy.    Lipponen also promised that the Social Democrats in Finland  will make a constructive contribution to resolving any  outstanding questions concerning Finland's national subsidies  for farmers "after the government had examined the matter and  reached a decision on its proposals."    The Center Party's Timo Jarvilahti outlined Finland's  farmers' need for additional support, "so that it will be  profitable to cultivate crops throughout the whole country."</p>

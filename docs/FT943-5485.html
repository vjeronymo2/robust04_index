			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Research focus provides the edge  -Swiss drugs groups are pursuing diverse strategies The increasingly divergent strategies of the three big Basle-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals groups - Ciba, Roche and Sandoz - have been tested severely in the trying circumstances of the first half of 1994. For the moment, Roche, which has decided to focus on developing leading-edge drugs and diagnostic equipment, has emerged the clear winner. Ciba and Sandoz, which have opted for more diversified business portfolios, have yet to prove the wisdom of that choice. Roche's first-half net income of SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.2bn) was not only the largest among the three, but it reflected the highest profit margin and probably the greatest growth. Issuing an interim profit statement yesterday for the first time, the group gave no comparative figures. However, first-half net income was equivalent to 65 per cent of the result in the whole of last year. Its operating profits have also grown strongly: the first-half result was equivalent to two-thirds of the full-year 1993 figure. Roche has, therefore, again confounded many investors. They believed the group was going to suffer as much as other international drug groups from the price squeeze being applied by governments throughout Europe and North America. Investor scepticism peaked in July when the group issued a cautious sales forecast. The non-voting shares, which enjoyed a premium rating for much of last year, plunged from a February peak of SFr7,270 to SFr5,160 in July. Yesterday, they bounced up SFr190 to SFr6,270 on the interim figures. Roche has argued that its concentration on leading-edge drugs has enabled it to maintain sales and margins better than some of its competitors. In the interim report, it claimed its pharmaceuticals division sales in the US and Europe 'easily outperformed the market as a whole'. And, in spite of the high costs and risks of its research-intensive strategy, it is convinced it can continue to develop winning drugs. Its Dollars 5.3bn acquisition of Syntex was motivated in large part by the US drugs group's substantial R&amp;D efforts in areas complementary to its own. Ciba and Sandoz, on the other hand, are inclined to hedge their bets on the increasingly uncertain pharmaceuticals sector by nurturing other, more stable health-related businesses as well as their traditional cyclical industrial and agricultural chemicals businesses. Their significant acquisitions in the past year have been in the health-related businesses. Sandoz has just completed its Dollars 3.7bn takeover of the US Gerber baby food group, and Ciba has made two large deals to boost its Ciba Vision eye-care side. These businesses are performing respectably, but the cyclicals have yet to respond in the way investors hope. Roche has also shown up its rivals in the game of managing liquid funds. Ciba's net financial income was down 30 per cent, Sandoz plunged from a SFr79m profit to a SFr90m loss. However, Roche's SFr506m net financial income was equivalent to 64 per cent of that earned in the whole of last year. All three suffered from the sharp decline in market values of many investments held, especially bonds, in the first half, but only Roche offset those losses with higher returns on other investment and asset sales. Roche is guarded about its investment strategies, but it is known to favour equities over bonds. Mr Henri Meier, finance director, said earlier this year it invested only in Triple A securities. 'We do take risks, trying to anticipate market moves, but we think our risk management is as good as anyone's,' he said.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                 CIBA      ROCHE    SANDOZ First-half 1994                (SFr m)   (SFr m)   (SFr m)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales                          11,600     7,300     8,200 Operating profit                2,000     1,600      NA Net financial income (loss)       199       506      (90) Net income                      1,400     1,600     1,000 Net financial assets            1,500     9,300     1,500 Operating margin                17.2%     21.3%     16.5%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

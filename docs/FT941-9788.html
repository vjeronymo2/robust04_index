			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Base metals suffer from hangover Base metals prices were suffering the after-effects of over-indulgence late this week as speculators backed away from markets that they been mainly responsible for pushing higher since late last month. Leading the retreat was zinc, which yesterday dipped to a two-month low of Dollars 960 a tonne for three-months delivery at the London Metal Exchange before steadying to Dollars 972.50, down Dollars 61 on the week. That sorry performance reflected first rumours then confirmation that European zinc producers' efforts to forge an agreement for jointly financed production closures had collapsed. On Thursday Eurometaux, the Brussels-based organisation that provided a forum for the producer negotiations, said that they had been suspended and no new meetings were foreseen. It added, however, that the overcapacity in Europe still had to be addressed and that structural changes were needed within the European industry. 'Developments over the last months are demonstrating that such changes are beginning to take place,' it said. Producers remained tight-lipped about the reasons for the failure of their latest attempt at co-operation. But the general manager of the Netherlands' Budel smelter said earlier in the week that there were still 'quite a lot of legal issues involved', possibly a reference to anti-trust problems. Financial troubles and top management changes at some big zinc groups may also have complicated the situation. The announcement yesterday of a sharp rise in LME warehouse stocks added to the zinc market's woes, but the copper market took little comfort from a proportionally much larger fall in its stocks. A wave of investment fund, speculative and trade selling took the three-months copper price to Dollars 1,844.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, down Dollars 31 on the day and Dollars 44 on the week. The aluminium market, already buoyed by recent production cut announcements following last month's multilateral agreement in Brussels, began the week in good heart. Monday brought news of the first cut at a Russian smelter (by 20,000 tonnes a year at Novokunznetsk in Siberia) as well as further Australian and US reductions. At the same time a Russian official seemed to succeed in reviving flagging confidence in his country's ability to deliver the promised 500,000 tonnes of cuts this year; and the former Soviet state of Tajikistan's smelter (which produced 280,000 tonnes last year) warned that it would have to shut if raw materials from Uzbekistan remained blocked at the border because of its failure to pay for earlier shipments. But after that the supply of bullish news dried up and the market's euphoria faded. A run of four daily price falls at the LME - ending with Dollars 13.25 yesterday after the announcement of another big rise in warehouse stocks - left the three-months price at Dollars 2,265 a tonne, down Dollars 30.50 on the week. At the London Commodity Exchange cocoa and coffee prices remained within their recent trading ranges, but GNI, the London trade house, said in a market report that coffee's fundamentals pointed to the market being 'on the verge of a major rally'. Oil prices surrendered some of the gains encouraged by the recent arctic weather in the north-east US as temperatures there turned milder. In late trading yesterday the London International Petroleum Exchange's April crude contract was at Dollars 13.75 a barrel, down 52 cents on the week.  ------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium            +11,275    to    2,544,525 Aluminium alloy         -200    to       46,960 Copper               -11,450    to      583,400 Lead                  +3,050    to      324,900 Nickel                  +966    to      131,352 Zinc                  +5,200    to    1,016,025 Tin                     +125    to       21,560  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

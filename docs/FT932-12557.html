			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Minister could face legal action over group failures THE LABOUR party has prepared the ground for a legal action against Baroness Denton, the consumer affairs minister, to be brought by customers who suffer from the next collapse of an unbonded travel company, Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said yester-day. He told the Association of British Travel Agents convention that Baroness Denton and the Department of Trade and Industry had failed to provide package travellers with the financial protection required by an EC directive which came into force at the start of the year. Mr Griffiths added that the proposed action was based on work carried out by solicitors acting for customers of Land Travel, the coach com-pany which collapsed last year. He said a group of Land Travel customers was attempting to obtain a court judgment against Mr Edward Leigh, then consumer affairs minister, for failing to act on warnings from the chairman of the Boston Conservative Club, among others, that the company was in financial trouble. Land Travel was not an association member. Mr Griffiths said that because non-association members were permitted under the new regulations to arrange their own customer protection insurance, future collapses were inevitable. He said that trading standards officers, who are to monitor non-association members, did not have sufficient staff to do the job. Mr Griffiths added that it was not necessary for the government to licence all package tour operators. It would be sufficient to licence non-association members who sell about 1m of the 11m package tours sold in the UK each year.</p>

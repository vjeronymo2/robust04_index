Seventeen district heads and two government commissioners  signed the document, also saying that Kovac's "reckless and  false accusations" of Premier Vladimir Meciar and some members  of the government "cannot be described as being other than an  expedient aimed at destabilizing political situation and  discrediting the government."    They said that Kovac's "attacks" addressed to State  Secretary  of the Privatization Ministry Ivan Lexa were a show of "vanity  incompatible with the post held by Michal Kovac," and that in  this way, Kovac detracts from the weight of his office.    The statement says that Kovac is playing into the hands of  the forces which lost in the elections, were against the Slovak  independence and work for its destruction.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Why savers are now facing a zero return - A look at the returns you are getting from building society accounts in the light of base rate cuts SAVERS with cash in the building society used to have a rule of thumb to calculate their annual interest payments by dividing their deposit by 10. The frequency of base rate cuts will have escaped few investors. But the degree to which new rates have eroded savings rates is taking longer to register. The tables show what the top ten building societies, which most savers use, are paying at the moment. Those who depend on building society deposits for income may well have seen their returns cut by half over the past two years. A survey carried out by Save &amp; Prosper last month, before the last base rate cut to 7 per cent, showed that 37 per cent of those with an instant access account believed the rate of interest they were earning was between 7 to 9 per cent net, when the true rate was between 4 to 5 per cent net. Halifax's main instant access account shows three phases of double digit gross investment rates during the 1980s. These were from July 1978 to November 1982, from February 1985 to November 1987 and from September 1988 to October 1991. The real return to the investor differed enormously during the three periods because of the rate of inflation. The graph shows the real, and after tax, returns on Pounds 10,000 invested in a Halifax instant access account since January 1 1978. For most of the first phase of double digit investment rates, the real return to basic rate and higher rate taxpayers was negative. The annual inflation rate was 13 per cent for 1979, 18 per cent for 1980 and 11 per cent in 1981; the highest investment rate reached during the period was 15 per cent. During the second phase, from February 1985 to November 1987, however, inflation rates were low. Annual inflation rates were 6 per cent in 1985, 3.4 per cent in 1986 and 4.1 per cent in 1987. The combination of these relatively low rates of inflation with high base rates (between 14 per cent and 9 per cent during the same period) allowed basic rate taxpayers, in particular, to earn an average real rate of 4 per cent on their building society deposits during that period. Higher-rate taxpayers fared less well, earning real returns of 1.2 per cent during the period of positive returns from February 1986 to June 1987. Relatively high rates of inflation of 7.8 per cent and 9.5 per cent in 1989 and 1990 again dented real returns during the third phase from September 1988 to October 1991, in spite of base rates being well over 10 per cent for most of the period. The average real return to basic rate taxpayers was 1.4 per cent during the period. Higher rate taxpayers mostly received negative returns. Indeed, the graph shows that, on Pounds 10,000 at least, a building society instant access is rarely a good investment for higher-rate taxpayers in real terms. Higher-rate taxpayers received an average real return in only four years since 1978 - in 1986, 1988, 1991 and 1992. This shows the importance of taking inflation into account when looking for returns. Base rates are expected by some analysts to fall by another percentage point in the near future. Building societies would then once again drop rates for savers. While the housing market is weak, building societies have been keener to pass on the benefits of lower base rates to borrowers rather than savers. But the balance may soon be tipping, particularly if there is a revival in the housing market and demand for mortgages rises. 'If there is another base rate cut, the lenders may not follow it right down because of their savers,' said Gill Colver of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. The tables show current savings rates on both instant access accounts and 90-day notice accounts at the top 10 building societies which together hold more than 80 per cent of total building society savings. Some of the smaller building societies may also be offering higher rates but the tables show that there is a considerable difference in the returns offered within the top 10 itself. This is partly because of the wide difference in size, assets and branch presence between the top 10. Halifax, the largest building society, held Pounds 58.7bn of assets at the end of 1991 and had 8.7m shareholders, while Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest society, had Pounds 7.1bn of assets and just over 1m shareholders. These differences influence the lending and savings culture of the institutions. For example, the top five building societies with their large high street presence do not have postal accounts, while Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Britannia and Bristol &amp; West all have postal accounts offering highly competitive rates of interest. Bristol &amp; West's Balmoral postal account, pays the highest rate on an instant access account and also beats most of the 90 day accounts, though its rates are under review. It is paying 9.10 per cent gross on Pounds 5,000 in an instant access account compared to 4.8 per cent gross on Woolwich's Prime Gold account. If inflation continues to fall, and investment rates are not cut unduly, savers may not see much of a difference to their returns in real terms. This is of little comfort to retired savers who will see nominal incomes fall while prices rise. In any case, the graph shows that real returns for basic rate taxpayers are much lower than the 1986 peak and on the verge of becoming negative again for higher-rate taxpayers. Low real interest rates at the building society indicate it is time to diversify by using other investments, such as index-linked gilts and equities to protect against inflation.

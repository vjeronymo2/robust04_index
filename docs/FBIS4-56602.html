			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Orlando Mendiate] </F>   [Text] Legislator Leo Gonzalez, vice president of the  Legislative Assembly's Drug Affairs Committee, charged yesterday  that Fidel Castro's regime is "meddling" in the Panamanian  electoral process to favor and support the Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD).    Gonzalez, who delivered some very compromising documents to  Foreign Minister Jose Mulino, said that he received these  documents on Sunday from a reliable source who has never failed  him with information on drugs and narcotics trafficking.  Gonzalez preferred to withhold the name, as this is very  delicate information. According to Gonzalez, who did not  disclose the full contents of the documents, there is  information on high-ranking PRD leaders traveling to Cuba to  meet allegedly with political and government figures of that  island.    These persons -- Gonzalez added -- include PRD Secretary  General Michel Doens, who traveled to Cuba at least five times  between 1992 and 1993. Also included on the list are Ramiro  Vasquez Chambonet, Nils Castro, and Luis Gomez.    The documents include a letter dated 12 January 1994 on the  letterhead of Roberto Infante, acting Cuban consul in Panama,  addressed to Cuban Foreign Minister. In this letter, the Cuban  consul tells the Cuban foreign minister that he held meetings  with "the boys from the eleven" [a reference to the PRD's flag],  allegedly from the PRD. Infante told Robaina that in Panama  "everything is progressing according to the strategy of the  People to Power" [a reference to the PRD's campaign slogan],  adding that everything is being done according to his  instructions, and -- best yet -- to his wishes.    "The atmosphere is favorable to our friends, and the polls  show it. Once again, we reiterated our solidarity and  unconditional support," says Infante's note to Robaina. Infante  added that an "expert from the eleven" will visit him and  explain further on the advice and technical assistance they will  need for the next game, that is, the 8 May elections.    "With regard to comments, I believe everything can be  summarized in only one remark: The bull [reference to PRD  candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares] is in charge of this farm,"  Infante says, adding that the necessary peons have been provided  so that there will not be any interruptions in the scheduled  activities.    Gonzalez, who is seeking reelection on the Morena Party  [National Renewal Movement] ticket, said that he has the  documents that prove his charges, and he is waiting for Foreign  Minister Mulino to verify the authenticity of the documents.  Gonzalez added that members from the PRD Tendency faction and  Papa Egoro Movement are taking trips to Cuba to coordinate  logistics support for these parties from Cuba. "This is a  communist country meddling in the Panamanian elections," he  emphasized.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mulino said that given the  importance of the issue and the seriousness of the alleged  charges, he has initiated a "very careful" investigation of the  case. Mulino said that he will not make any comments until he  has analyzed and read the documents Leo Gonzalez gave him. "I  do not know what decision I will make," the foreign minister  concluded.</p>

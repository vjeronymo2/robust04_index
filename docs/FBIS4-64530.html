			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Prime Minister-Designate Silvio </F> Berlusconi by Vittorio Testa in Milan on 30 April: "Berlusconi  Promises Instant Government" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Milan -- "Yes, I am optimistic. My program is  ready. There is enthusiasm, optimism, on the part of the people,  the financial markets. We will do our utmost to boost the  economy and development, to eliminate bureaucracy and poor  services. Consultations with the social partners will begin at  1500 hours Monday [2 May]. Tuesday evening we will start  discussing names for the government. When will the government  be ready? By the end of the week." Silvio Berlusconi feels  like a prime minister-designate whose path ahead is a fast,  downhill one, to be covered all in a single swoop. At 1500  hours he arrived from Porto Rotondo, where in the morning he  inspected the security work going on at his two villas on the  Costa Smeralda. After a brief visit to Marcherio to see his  family, he returned to Arcore, where he installed himself in  front of his fax machines and teleprinters to bring himself up  to date on the day's political developments.    [Testa] The Milan attorney's office is requesting [Northern  League leader] Umberto Bossi's remittal for trial. Is this an  obstacle to your government?    [Berlusconi] No, I do not think so. The foundations of the  alliance remain intact. The election results mean that the  country's moderate majority enjoy political representation. By  preventing the Left from acceding to government, we have done 80  percent of the work. Now we still have to do the remaining 20  percent -- to form a good government. There is already  agreement on the program, condensed into a draft version of 24  pages. The government will be ready by the end of the week.    [Testa] Will it also include ministers belonging to the  National Alliance [AN]? Many people, including authoritative  foreign politicians, are demanding that there be no neo-fascist  ministers.    [Berlusconi] There will be ministers of Forza Italia, the  League, and the AN, too, of course -- but people who do not have  an illiberal past. And there will also be people who do not  belong to the parties of the alliance, people chosen on the  basis of their capabilities. And also teachers, businessmen,  managers, experts.    [Testa] Perhaps from Segni's Pact? Tremonti, for instance?    [Berlusconi] There is no agreement on this. We cannot rule  out cooperation with individuals, but there are no contacts yet.  Certainly, Tremonti is excellent.    [Testa] Will Antonio Martino be foreign minister?    [Berlusconi] I think that would be right.    [Testa] And Dini treasury minister?    [Berlusconi] I would say so.    [Testa] What about the interior minister? Will it be a  League member?    [Berlusconi] No comment. I can tell you that the League has  never officially made any such request. What it has requested,  however, is responsibility for local government, but  unfortunately the ministry cannot be split in two.    [Testa] What about [Radical leader] Marco Pannella?    [Berlusconi] I would like him to join the government.    [Testa] Has the League reaffirmed its veto?    [Berlusconi] No comment.    [Testa] Certainly Di Pietro will not join your government.  The Milan prosecutor's office remains unchanged. Are you  disappointed?    [Berlusconi] There have never been any approaches, either  official or unofficial, by the prime minister to Di Pietro, who,  I repeat, I greatly esteem. Those were just journalistic  rumors. Be that as it may, I think the matter is now entirely  closed.    [Testa] Still on the subject of the Milan prosecutor's  office, the magistrates have made it known that the corruption  investigations will continue along their path. It is a long  path. However, some people are in favor of a solution....    [Testa] Yes, I know. I have always said that accounts must  always be settled. So I think that we must proceed, go ahead,  and hold the trials. This, of course, so that justice can be  done, with no desire for revenge. No, there must be no  whitewashes, but I do believe that in the future we must also  start considering possible solutions. In the past few days I  have been pondering certain things. The political class has  been almost totally renewed; the great prominence with which the  media is reporting this and the dramatic television  representation of the trials are themselves a kind of  punishment, of atonement, as far as image is concerned. Then  there are the businessmen: Often they had no other way to  enable their factories to function...    [Testa] One of the businessmen that has been charged is  your brother, Paolo. Are you worried?    [Berlusconi] Of course, it would be better for such things  not to happen. But how can you expect a businessman to carry  the cross? Be that as it may, I have not been active in public  construction programs since 1976; there were things about it  that I did not like. And I am glad that I made that decision.    [Testa] With regard to the corruption trials, are you  opposed  to the presence of television cameras in the court rooms?    [Berlusconi] I have always been so. It is barbaric; justice  cannot be turned into trial by the masses.    [Testa] Let us return to the government, to the problem of  guarantors and the criticism that is leveled at you: namely,  that the subject of supervision has himself appointed his own  supervisors...    [Berlusconi] I did not choose the three experts on my own.  They were chosen on the basis of suggestions from several  people. But I will be surrounded by guarantors, by ministers, by  parliament, by the opposition forces, by the media, by the  public, by the public prosecutors' offices, by the antitrust  committee, by the television watchdog committee. Furthermore,  there is no reason why the three experts cannot introduce  further changes.    [Testa] What about blind trusts?    [Berlusconi] That is impossible in the case of enterprises  and factories.    [Testa] Will you sell your television companies?    [Berlusconi] I am not even considering it. My appointment  could last a year, a month, or a day. And I have five children.  Anybody with a little common sense can understand that.    [Testa] But has the president asked you to do so?    [Berlusconi] No. Scalfaro is someone with a great deal of  common sense. But I would also point out that people voted for  me partly because they know that I will be able to distinguish  between my own interests and the country's. They know that I  will never make a decision that could benefit my own companies.  People are sensible.</p>

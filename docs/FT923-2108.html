			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance sells most of 14.2% CU stake SUN ALLIANCE, the UK composite insurer, finally disposed for Pounds 280m most of its 14.24 per cent stake in its rival Commercial Union yesterday after several days of speculation that it was trying to sell the shares. The company was able to take advantage of the rise in equities following sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism on Wednesday to sell the 13.5 per cent holding for more than the purchase price of 465p three years ago. Sun Alliance sold 60m shares in Commercial Union to Smith New Court, which in conjunction with Cazenove, placed the shares with a number of institutions. The shares were sold at 470p and placed at 475p, generating a profit of Pounds 3m believed to have been equally split between the two securities concerns. Sun Alliance was rumoured to have put in train an attempted bought deal last Tuesday but it was subsequently abandoned when word of the deal, rumoured to be at 470p a share, leaked. A bought deal is a bid by a securities house for a block of shares in a company which it takes onto its book on risk and then attempts to place at a profit. Smith New Court, which has gained a reputation for executing most of the bought deals in the market in recent years, lined up the deal. It had been targetting the CU stake, one of the largest 'loose' holdings in the market, for some time. Cazenove and SG Warburg are joint brokers to Sun Alliance. The bulk of the Sun stake in Commercial Union, a holding of 13%, was acquired in August 1989 from Adelaide Steamship, the investment group then run by Mr John Spalvins, who had built up the holding over 12 months. The purchase happened when the UK composite insurers feared the prospect of hostile bids from European competitors and built up stakes in each other's companies. The deal leaves Sun Alliance with 3.45m CU shares, or 0.77 per cent. See Lex</p>

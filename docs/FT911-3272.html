			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Protesters rally to sacked Slovak PM TENS of thousands of supporters of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the ousted Slovak prime minister, took to the streets of Bratislava yesterday demanding his reinstatement. In one of the largest rallies in Slovakia since the overthrow of the communist regime in 1989 demonstrators accused the regional parliament of 'treachery' and called 'We want Meciar'. Public transport workers staged a token stoppage and traffic in the city was brought to a standstill. Workers in several factories called for strikes and protests also took place in other towns around Slovakia, the state news agency CTK reported. The all-party presidium, or steering committee, of the parliament dismissed Mr Meciar and brought to a head a six-week political crisis which began when he led a breakaway from the ruling Public Against Violence (VPN). Mr Meciar was replaced by his deputy Mr Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement, who said the VPN split had led to the isolation of Slovakia both internationally and within the Czechoslovak federation. The leading Czech newspaper, Lidove Noviny, expressed the hope that Mr Carnogursky could lead independent-minded Slovakia to more normal relations with Prague and greater acceptance of economic reforms. Mr Milan Sutovac, chairman of the Upper House of the Czechoslovak Parliament and a former political ally of Mr Meciar, suggested that the ousted leader might try to rebuild his political position in Slovakia 'via the streets'. Mr Meciar is by far the most popular politician in Slovakia and recently formed his own rival movement, Platform for a Democratic Slovakia, which seeks to slow the pace of economic reforms.</p>

It added that the voters needed to see the prime minister pushing forward with the reforms of the 1980s. That meant he should associate himself more closely with Conservative programmes such as the overhaul of the health services; that he should be seen to be heading the challenge to the educational establishment; and that he should be pushing for tax reform as well as tax cuts. Backing Mr Major's pledge to reduce the burden of inheritance tax, the group said he should go further and make all family bequests of less than Pounds 500,000 tax-exempt.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Hans-Ulrich Klose, the  leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party] group in the  Bundestag, has said the NATO operation at Gorazde was a correct  step. Speaking on Saarland Radio today, Klose said: "The  United Nations resolutions are constantly being violated; now  the United Nations has reacted."    In certain situations the international community has no  other option but to reply to force with force.    Klose said he was skeptical about a unanimous stance by the  UN Security Council toward the Serb troops. To him, Russia's  real role in the conflict remained unclear. On the other hand,  the determination of the Americans regarding the Serbs had  obviously grown.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Freeport impresses with a net income of Dollars 4.63m Higher metals and phosphate fertiliser prices helped Freeport-McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources group, report second-quarter net income of Dollars 4.63m, or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 77.4m, or 54 cents, a year ago. For the six months to June 30, Freeport recorded net income of Dollars 17m, or 12 cents, against a net loss of Dollars 132.7m, or 93 cents. Second-quarter revenues benefited from increased sales volumes too: Freeport's metals affiliate, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, sold 168.6m lbs of copper and 185,400 troy ounces of gold, up from 140m lbs and 127,200 ounces in the same quarter of 1993. A price protection hedging programme also lifted the average realised price of copper to Dollars 1.02 a lb against 90 cents while gold sale prices averaged Dollars 353.82 an ounce compared with Dollars 338.60. However, copper production costs were abnormally high in the quarter - at 61.4 cents a lb against 59.4 cents in the first quarter - because of low ore grades and recoveries. Freeport said costs would be significantly lower in the second half of 1994.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A prison brawl that involved up to 400 inmates and left nearly 30 men injured  was prompted by racial tensions, a official of the California Correctional  Center at Susanville said. Chief Deputy Warden Michael Pickett said the melee,  which spread into 11 dormitories, apparently was related to continuing tension  between black and latino prisoners. The fighting broke out Monday night in a  50-man dormitory and quickly spread. "It was like a domino effect," Pickett  said. Twenty-eight inmates and one guard were injured, none seriously. Guards  broke up the brawl, firing one warning shot.  </P></p>

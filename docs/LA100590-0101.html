			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CURRICULUM THAT FIGHTS DRUGS, GANGS UNVEILED  </P> <P> A classroom program aimed at curbing rising drug use and gang violence among  elementary and junior high school students was unveiled Thursday during a news  conference and reception at the Orange County Department of Education.  </P> <P> The program, developed by the county Department of Education and dubbed Project  YES!, for Yes to Education and Skills, is the first in the state to blend  anti-gang and anti-drug messages into classroom curriculum, eliminating the  need for teachers to set aside extra time to deliver prevention lessons to  students, according to state and local education and criminal justice officials  on hand for the announcement.  </P> <P> "The ultimate answer (to drug and gang prevention) is education," said state  Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on  Substance Abuse, who was one of five officials who unveiled the project. "Our  objective is to raise a clean generation of kids . . . who go beyond the slogan  of 'Just Say No.' "  </P> <P> The program includes lesson plans, teacher training manuals, audiotapes and  videotapes and interactive computer programs to be used in third-, fifth- and  seventh-grade classrooms. It was developed over two years under a $400,000  grant awarded by the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning to the county  Department of Education, which won a statewide competition to earn the grant.  </P> <P> Lesson themes include "Responsible Citizenship," "Dynamics of Cultural  Diversity," "Choices and Consequences," "Refusal Skills" and "Success and  Achievement." Each is designed to educate youths on the pitfalls of joining  gangs or using drugs and to heighten self-esteem.  </P> <P> G. Albert Howenstein Jr., executive director of the Governor's Office of  Criminal Justice Planning, said the new curriculum has been field-tested  throughout the state and is available for immediate use. He added that  education officials expect it will be years before the success of the program  is determined.  </P> <P> "Changing these values is a marathon -- it's not a sprint," he said.  </P> <P> The county Department of Education's Media Services Unit will distribute the  curriculum in a kit at a cost of $299 per grade or $800 for all three grades.  </P> <P> County Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson said the funds should cover the cost of  packaging and distribution and that any excess money will be used to develop a  similar curriculum for second-, fourth- and sixth-graders. He added that grades  three, five and seven were initially chosen because developers of the program  wanted to reach both younger children and junior-high school students, but  there was not enough money available to fund more than three grades.  </P> <P> Not Peterson, Howenstein or any of the other state and local officials at the  news conference were able to provide specific figures on the annual cost of the  program, despite repeated questioning. Howenstein would say only that the  project would be funded through a combination of state money allocated for  drug-prevention programs and federal anti-drug funds administered through the  state Department of Education.  </P> <P> More than 100 local civic leaders, politicians, law enforcement personnel and  educators were invited to the board room of the County Department of Education  for the announcement of the program. The audience viewed a videotaped overview  of the program and heard remarks from a host of officials before being treated  to an outdoor reception.  </P> <P> In addition to Howenstein and Seymour, Peterson was flanked on stage by Robert  Philibosian, chairman of the California Council on Criminal Justice, and state  Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk). Each took time to praise Peterson's  involvement in the program and deliver congratulatory messages from Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The announcement of the program comes just one month before the November  election, in which Peterson faces his toughest challenge in his 24 years as  superintendent from challenger John F. Dean.  </P> <P> Peterson said the timing of the announcement of the new program was  coincidental to the upcoming election but added, "It is fortunate it occurs  now, I admit."  </P></p>

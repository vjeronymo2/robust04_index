			<p>BFN     [Text] The two U.S. banks operating in Port-au-Prince --  First National of Boston and Citibank -- closed their doors on  23 June, following U.S. President Bill Clinton's executive order  freezing Haitian assets in U.S. banks. These two banks had been  operating in Haiti for 20 years and ranked fourth and fifth,  respectively, out of the nine foreign banks operating in Haiti.  These banks operate under and are subject to Haitian law. A  reliable financial source has reported that a judicial  injunction compelling them to reopen or to return their  customers' assets should reach them in the next 48 hours.</p>

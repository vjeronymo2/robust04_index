			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Clouds on the retirement horizon: A classic case of fund stripping Victor Edwards, a 57-year-old foreman at Greenfield Mill on the Lancashire side of the Pennines, has spent most of his working life with the same company, paper maker Robert Fletcher. For most of that time Fletcher was a subsidiary of Imperial Group, a paternalistic employer celebrated for the generosity of its pension benefits. But the company, whose paper is used in cigarette making, has now changed hands; and with eight years to go to retirement, Mr Edwards is worried, both for himself and his fellow workers. The problems started at the time Imperial was under threat from a hostile takeover by Hanson, the acquisitive conglomerate. Imperial was keen to dispose of the mills; and when they were parcelled up individually for sale in early 1986, the workers were asked to consent to their pension rights being transferred to two new funds. This they did, despite misgivings, on the basis of assurances by the Imperial management that safeguards would be maintained and that benefits would be at least as good as those in the old schemes. The buyer of both mills turned out to be Melton Medes, an unquoted Nottingham-based conglomerate run by Mr Nathu Ram Puri. Through Melton Medes and another company, Melham Holdings, this Indian-born entrepreneur has acquired large stakes in quoted concerns such as British Syphon Industries, Delaney Group and Marling Industries. Mr Puri has also attracted attention with unsuccessful bids for state-owned enterprises, including Rover Group and North East Shipbuilders. His approach to pension fund management is unorthodox. Soon after the two Robert Fletcher mills changed hands, Mr Puri embarked on a classic exercise in what is known as pension fund stripping. First, the existence of a surplus was used to justify an immediate pension fund holiday, whereby company contributions into the funds were suspended. They remain suspended today. Then Melton Medes Pension Trustees, a company registered as an investment manager with the self-regulatory fund management watchdog Imro, took charge of the Fletcher pension funds. It was effectively controlled by Mr Puri. The annual accounts of Melton Medes, audited by Kidsons Impey, declare each year that 'the scheme funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the company's finances'. Yet despite this assurance, and the earlier assurances from the Imperial management, the two Fletcher pension funds suddenly found themselves advancing a Pounds 5m loan to Melton Medes at an interest rate of just 2 per cent. The only security was a second charge on the freehold properties of the Fletcher companies. Those terms appear wholly uncommercial; and for Fletcher's Greenfield workers, the loan constituted more than 30 per cent of the total value of the pension fund in 1987, implying a dangerously unbalanced portfolio. Members of the pension fund were unaware of this conflict of interest when the transaction was undertaken. Nor could they extract much information from the management and the trustees - effectively one and the same - about the safeguards that were supposed to be built into the new funds. They were constantly denied access to information. But when the Occupational Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 1986 came into force, they provided a lever for the Greenfield foreman, Mr Edwards, to prise a set of fund accounts from Mr Puri. 'When I did see the accounts my worst fears were realised,' he says. 'I was shocked at what had happened. How could the loan and some of the investments be regarded in any way in the interest of the trust's beneficiaries? 'Any impression that my pension fund was protected with lots of safeguards for its future members had disappeared.' In 1987 Mr Puri and his two fellow trustees appear to have had second thoughts about the loan. The interest rate was raised from 2 per cent to the prevailing National Westminster Bank base rate. Yet that still appears to fall short of a commercial rate for a loan to an unquoted company secured by a second charge on less than prime property. Today the loan has been repaid. But the pension funds have not been compensated by the company for the uncommercial terms on which their trustees advanced the money, thereby raising questions about a possible breach of trust. How were the trustees fulfilling their obligation to the beneficiaries, if the fund's biggest investment was yielding an uncommercial return in circumstances where the trustees were involved in a potential conflict of interest? Mr Edwards and the workforce at Greenfield continue, meantime, to worry about the potential conflict of interest between Melton Medes' own investment activities and those of the pension funds. Through Melton Medes Mr Puri has acquired substantial stakes in quoted companies whose shares have suffered mixed fortunes. One such is the diversified group Marling Industries. Melton Medes acquired its holding in Marling in 1988. Subsequently the two Fletcher pension funds and Melton Medes' own group pension fund have invested heavily in the shares. And in the year to end-June 1990 Marling emerged as the largest equity holding in all three funds. In the Fletcher Greenfield fund the holding accounted for no less than 9 per cent of the pension scheme's total assets. The risk in this overweight position in a company capitalised at a little more than Pounds 30m has since been underlined by Marling's results. In its latest half-year the dividend was cut, following a sharp fall in profits. At the loss-making Delaney Group, in which Melton Medes and Mr Puri have a controlling stake, the Fletcher Greenfield fund acquired 75,000 shares when Mr Puri bought into the company in the late 1980s. It has been a disastrous investment, with the share price plunging from more than Pounds 1 down to 6p. All this suggests that the pension fund members have good reason to be nervous about Mr Puri's investment judgment. According to the last published accounts of Melton Medes, the market value of its quoted investments, had fallen Pounds 8.7m below the book cost of Pounds 20.4m. The fund members might reasonably question, too, the use of their pension money in tandem with Mr Puri's wider corporate investments. How does this square with a trustee's overriding obli Finally, the Greenfield pensioners might question whether the investment performance justifies a more than trebling of administrative costs, including management fees, to Pounds 174,000 between 1988 and 1989 for a Pounds 13m fund, the greater part of which was handled by an outside fund manager, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The Financial Times was unable to raise these issues directly with Mr Puri, because he was ill. But Mr James Philpotts, the chief executive of Melton Medes and a trustee with Mr Puri of the pension funds, said that the loan from the Fletcher funds to Melton Medes had been used to finance the Fletcher businesses, to which the parent company passed on the full benefit of the low loan rate. This, he said, had helped provide security of employment to the workforce. But that fails to address the issue of the conflict of interest vis a vis existing pensioners. As for the pension funds' investments in companies in which Melton Medes itself holds substantial stakes, Mr Philpotts said 'you do have your good ones and you do have your bad ones'. On the overweight pension fund position in Marling Industries he saw 'a commonality of interest' with Melton Medes. He added that he thought part of the holding had been bought direct from Melton Medes at market value, part in the stock market - though what the market value of large parcels of shares in such a small company might be is a moot point. Mr Philpotts did not believe that the management fees were unduly high. These arguments do not impress Mr Edwards. His worries about the conflict of interest in Mr Puri's position are magnified by the present financial difficulties of the two main companies in his loosely-knit empire. Melton Medes' net debt of Pounds 48.7m, most of it short term, towered above shareholders' funds of Pounds 33.6m at end-1990. Melham Holdings, though profitable in the year to December 31 1990, had a deficiency of assets against liabilities of Pounds 2.1m after excluding goodwill. The chances of the pension funds receiving compensation in relation to the uncommercial loan terms are also mixed. After an approach from Mr Edwards, the Graphical Paper and Media Union has decided this week to take legal action on the pension fund members' behalf. But the potential cost of Pounds 250,000 is daunting. Union official Mr John Brough says: 'Where problems are discovered in pension funds and where there appears to be a good case in law, we have to risk hundreds of thousands of pounds to fight the point in the law. The companies involved risk nothing, since their managers are invariably trustees and can defend any action from the fund itself.' Whatever the outcome, Mr Puri's pensioners will be worrying about their retirement prospects for some time yet.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Reckitt &amp; Colman Since the European rationalisation programme announced by Reckitt &amp; Colman yesterday is its second such initiative in under five years it is debatable how 'exceptional' the related Pounds 56m provision really is. The fact that the company was vague on details only added to the impression that it was part of an on-going process. True, the previous operation was carried out before the group acquired Boyle-Midway in 1990. But that suggests it has taken the group rather a long time to identify opportunities to rationalise manufacturing and distribution. It is tempting to conclude that the programme is a reaction to the group's poor performance in Europe. The fall in European profits was disappointing when compared with Unilever's results, and though much can be put down to recession, the signs of switching to own-label products raise questions about the eventual impact of economic recovery. In North America consumers are not returning to previous spending patterns in a hurry while competition in the supermarkets remains intense. That in turn throws doubt on Reckitt's confidence that it can continue to increase margins which have now topped 16 per cent. Even if it continues to grow well in Latin America and Asia the group outlook is dull unless it can restart sales growth in the mature economies. Against this background it would be surprising if Reckitt were not looking at large potential acquisitions like Eastman Kodak's household products business. But only the chance that Reckitt itself might become a target justifies the stock's small premium rating compared to Unilever.</p>

GERMAN SOURCES CONFIRM GAS STORY  </P> <P> West German government sources confirmed that Bonn has evidence that Libya  produced 30 tons of mustard gas in a test at a chemical plant built with  assistance from West German companies. "We passed on the information to  Washington in February," a senior government source said. Foreign Ministry  spokesman Hanns Schuhmacher said the Bonn government is working "shoulder to  shoulder" with the Bush Administration in seeking ways to prevent further  production of the chemical weapons at the Rabta plant, about 60 miles southwest  of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.  </P></p>

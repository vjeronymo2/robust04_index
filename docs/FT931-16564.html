			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / How managers' styles differ: British Psychological Society Conference BRITISH executives manage from experience, their peers in Korea use manuals, while Iranians are guided by national beliefs, according to a survey of almost 2,000 decision makers in 16 countries. Only the Finns and the Dutch are more individualistic and independent in decision-making than UK managers, delegates were told yesterday at the British Psychological Society's occupational psychology conference in Brighton. The survey, which was completed by at least 100 managers in each country, also found that Portuguese managers were likely to rely on guidance from superiors and that managers in Nigeria tended to make their decisions by the book, using company manuals or rule books. The research, funded by the Japanese photocopier and camera producer, Canon, found that Japanese managers relied partly on their own experience and training and partly on their superiors, as did the Americans, Australians and South Africans. Dr Peter Smith, reader in social psychology at Sussex University's School of Social Sciences, said: 'Multinational companies need to be very aware of the different preferences as to how decisions might be taken in different parts of the world.' He said: 'Outside of western countries, we found much more reliance on superiors, much more reliance on manuals on rules of procedure and in some countries, particularly Muslim countries, people said they rely on beliefs which are widespread nationally.' The survey suggests managers in all countries believe decisions based on their own experience and training usually give the best results. Management, Page 9</p>

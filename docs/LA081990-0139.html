			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA LOSES 10TH OFFICIAL;  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATORS: THE RESIGNATIONS HAVE COME IN A CLUSTER SINCE THE FORMER CITY  MANAGER ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR THAT HE WAS LEAVING.  </P> <P> The city's director of public works and transportation is joining the parade of  administrators who have departed from City Hall in the last year.  </P> <P> On Sept. 3, Tom Wood becomes the 10th administrator to leave since former City  Manager Donald McIntyre announced last year that he would retire July 1.  </P> <P> Wood, director of public works and transportation for the last two years, will  become deputy city manager of Anaheim. He said his job change had nothing to do  with McIntyre's departure or with the arrival of City Manager Philip Hawkey.  </P> <P> "It's an unbelievable opportunity, a real challenge to work in the position  I've been offered," said Wood, 38, a resident of Huntington Beach. "My  objective is to become a city manager someday. This was a chance that I really  couldn't turn down, as difficult as it is to leave a place like this."  </P> <P> He said he had been recruited by Anaheim. "Unfortunately, there are not too  many positions like that in Southern California," he said. "When they become  available, you've got to go for them."  </P> <P> Wood's annual salary will increase in Anaheim, from $85,800 to $98,000.  </P> <P> While working for Pasadena, Wood helped to create, among other things, a  recycling program, a citywide tree-planting project, and a program to encourage  the use of car pools and mass transit by city employees.  </P> <P> "He has made many significant contributions to the city, and we'll miss his  talents," Hawkey said.  </P> <P> A native of Hacienda Heights, Wood worked for the city of Long Beach for 13  years before coming to Pasadena.  </P> <P> Former Deputy City Manager Ed Aghjayan preceded Wood to Anaheim, taking a job  there three weeks ago as general manager for public utilities.  </P> <P> Others who have left the city recently include Police Chief James Robenson, who  retired because of illness; Assistant City Manager Judy Weiss, who went to work  for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission; housing administrator  Leslie Lambert, who took a job with the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment  Agency, and administrative services director Bob Edgerly, now the assistant  city manager of West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Also, personnel director Kermit Francis, now Santa Ana personnel director;  employment development director Deweleyne Henry, who went on medical leave;  communications director Christine Sanchez, who resigned in January, and arts  director Joyce Chambers Selber, who resigned in December.  </P></p>

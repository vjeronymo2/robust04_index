			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Gould clash in debate THE RIVAL candidates for the Labour leadership clashed last night in the first and, possibly, the only head-to-head confrontation before the electoral college ballots on July 18. Their performances in a Fabian Society debate eschewed acrimony and were held by many to have amounted to a draw. However, several rounds of applause for Mr John Smith's staunch avowals of Labour's first principles may just have given him a points victory over his rival, Mr Bryan Gould. The loudest accolade came for the shadow chancellor's dismissal of a suggestion that the party should appeal baldly to electors' self-interests. 'The philosophy of democratic socialism is about a moral view of life . . . if there is no morality in it it is not worth having,' he said. Mr Gould won acclaim too when he made clear that altruism was not enough and that Labour needed to find new ways to appeal to a new and wider electorate. Arguing that one path to victory was to defuse the concentration of power among vested interests, he cited the aphorism: 'The great advantage of socialism is it removes the need to be altruistic.' In the event, the clearest exposition of the differences between the two men came in their opening statements. Mr Smith spoke of building an opposition from the anti-Conservative majority. Promoting his plan for a Commission on Social Justice to examine tax and benefits, he argued: 'We face a new challenge of designing a strategy for social justice and economic opportunity that will benefit the minority, while gaining the votes of the majority that will have to pay for it.' Mr Gould offered a lightly veiled critique of his rival as a 'one last heave' candidate. The leadership needed someone with the experience to fight beyond Labour's heartlands who could offer 'distinctive and positive reasons why people should vote Labour.' That would involve a commitment to run the economy differently and challenge monetarist orthodoxy, he said. The differences between the two men in much of the question session that followed was mostly mood music. On Europe, Mr Gould rejected a purely 'monetarist' approach in the convergence towards economic and monetary union. Mr Smith, instead, stressed the need to discuss that question while progressing to the EMU goal. On party reforms, Mr Smith argued that there should be a role for MPs in a future leadership electoral college, whereas his opponent said a one-member, one-vote system would lessen union unease. Both agreed on the need for constitutional reform, especially devolution and a consideration of electoral reform. Mr Gould put greater emphasis on the need to promote full employment before a redistributive tax policy, whereas Mr Smith suggested that such a goal, although desirable, was no substitute for a clearly argued case for redistribution.</p>

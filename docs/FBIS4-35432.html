			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Counselor </F> Ma'mun al-Hudaybi by Muhammad Raghib; place and date not given]    [Text] [Raghib] In an interview with DER SPIEGEL, President  Husni Mubarak accused the Brotherhood of being an illegal  organization involved in most terrorist activities. How does  the Brotherhood respond to this accusation?    [Al-Hudaybi] President Mubarak himself, in a recent visit to  Europe, told the French newspaper LE MONDE that the Muslim  Brotherhood is a moderate group that shuns terror and expresses  its views through peaceful means. Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi, less than a month ago, also said that the Brotherhood  shuns violence and terror and believes in peaceful means.  Therefore, I do not know why there has been such a change of  heart.    [Raghib] How do you explain this reversal of attitude toward  your group. Which interpretation do you think is correct?    [Al-Hudaybi] For the past 25 years, our record has been  clean. Every investigation into acts of violence committed  during this period came to the inevitable conclusion that the  Muslim Brotherhood is not involved in violence or linked with  terror in any way.    Furthermore, we have taken part in the People's Assembly  elections in 1984 and 1987. We had a respectable number of  deputies in the Assembly. We participated in parliamentary life  in a serious way. No one ever accused us of breaking the law or  deviating from the constitution.    We also have members in the current municipal councils who  have never violated the law. Some of our members have been  elected to boards of prestigious professional associations and  performed services that have been greatly commended. Their  conduct and unionist work fell within the constitutional, legal,  and legitimate boundaries and evoked nothing but praise. No one  accused them of committing any act of violence. Their actions  speak louder than words.    [Raghib] Recent incidents in the Bar Association sparked off  accusations that the Brotherhood is using the Association for  illegal purposes. Pro-government writers have repeatedly made  this claim. How do you respond to such an accusation?    [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is opposed to violence. I am  not well-informed about Bar Association events because I have  been sick lately. But allow me to say, for starters, that the  authority that is entitled to make such accusations is the  Public Prosecution Office, which has not said anything so far.  The accusations that were made came from the Interior Ministry,  an authority which, in our opinion, is not entitled to issue  charges.    The whole controversy and the attendant speculations and  accusations could have been avoided had the coroner's report on  the causes of death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani been  published. The issue is not whether Madani belonged or did not  belong to terrorist organizations, but whether he was tortured  or not.    [Raghib] The Brotherhood issued a statement last Thursday  denying that it calls for sedition. What did the statement aim  to achieve, and why was it issued at this very moment?    [Al-Hudaybi] We issued this statement to refute the  accusations leveled upon us. We aimed to answer all those who  took the opportunity to defame and assail the Brotherhood.    The Brotherhood has taken part in a lot of political and  social events in Egypt and other countries. We did our bit  during the October 1992 earthquake. Many of our members offered  professional care to the victims. This was a peaceful effort, a  work of charity. On the external level, we have helped out in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and other areas.    [Raghib] You know and we know that the Muslim Brotherhood's  activities have so far been banned. Are there any other  channels that the Brotherhood is using to carry out its  political and social activities?    [Al-Hudaybi] No. There are no illegal channels for either  political or social activities. All of our activities are  carried out in public. All the Brotherhood members are known to  the state's official departments. There is no reason why we  should work in secret. All of our statements and activities are  done in public within the framework of the constitution and law.    [Raghib] The Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of  violence since its establishment in 1928. Some reports indicate  that the cornerstone of the Brotherhood's old military  organization is that it supports current terrorist actions with  the aim of changing the regime. Is this true?    [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is neither involved nor has  anything to do with the current events. We have no members who  act outside the Brotherhood's framework. As for the  Brotherhood's history since its establishment, its policies  before the revolution were directed against the Jews and  colonialists. The Brotherhood had its excuses for that. But now  times have changed and the situation is different. The reports  that the remnants of the military organization are working to  overthrow the regime are baseless. They are all rumors  propagated by our enemies who know that they are false.  Therefore, I decline to elaborate on the issue.    [Raghib] What about the Salsabil Computer Company's case  which was blamed on a secret organization of the Brotherhood.  Is not that true?    [Al-Hudaybi] It was not really an accusation incriminating  the Brotherhood. Had it been true, none of the defendants would  have been released from the prison. Therefore, we do not  consider it as an incriminating factor or an accusation. The  Brotherhood has no links whatsoever with this company.    [Raghib] What about the Muslim Brotherhood's ties with its  counterparts in Arab and foreign countries?    [Al-Hudaybi] Our relations with the Muslim Brotherhood  abroad  are far from being secret. We attend seminars and conferences  held by the Brotherhood in any Arab or foreign country. We  attend these meetings by invitation. We discuss the status of  the Brotherhood in each country and we assess everything that  concerns the Islamic countries. But in Egypt we are not allowed  to hold such seminars or conferences or to invite any  representative of the Brotherhood from abroad.    [Raghib] Who currently finances the Brotherhood?    [Al-Hudaybi] Any able member of the Brotherhood can donate  according to his limit, but the public donations are published  in the press. These donations are deposited in the banks'  accounts and are inspected by the Central Auditing Agency. This  is the situation. The Brotherhood has no specific financial  sources from either inside or outside.    [Raghib] You certainly want to take part in the national  dialogue and the regime is refusing to allow this. What is the  solution?    [Al-Hudaybi] I have nothing to say on this subject. The  issue of national dialogue has become effaced and is not listed  on our agenda. We are not thinking of taking part in this  dialogue when it is held.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Chugai warns on drug price cuts Chugai Pharmaceutical, the Japanese ethical drug maker, lifted pre-tax profits 35 per cent in the six months to June but expects that government-imposed price cuts will limit its full-year growth to only 2.8 per cent. Profits reached Y8.6bn (USDollars 86.87m) halfway, aided by efforts to reduce operating costs as well as by a 5.1 per cent rise in sales to Y76.9bn. For all of 1994, the company is forecasting taxable profits of Y17.5bn on revenues ahead 4.3 per cent to Y158bn. In April, the Japanese health ministry, concerned at the escalating costs of treating an ageing society, told manufacturers to cut prices of prescription drugs by an average 6.6 per cent. This was the latest in a series of such reductions, which have hampered earnings growth in the industry. Prescription drugs account for more than 80 per cent of Chugai's sales. The dividend for the year is to be maintained at Y9 per share although the company is adjusting the interim payment to Y4.50 from Y3.75 to equalise the two halves. Interim net earnings were Y15.42 compared with Y11.89, and the full-year forecast is Y29.62 against Y28.52. Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese audio-video equipment maker, is aiming to merge its two US entertainment units, Carolco Pictures and Live Entertainment, around October, a Pioneer spokesman said, AP-DJ reports.</p>

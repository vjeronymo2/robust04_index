			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(G)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There was one objection to using the new forms since the respondent felt FmHA already has an identity of interest statement in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The purpose of the new forms is twofold; one to require all borrowers to disclose all identities of interest and the other to identify ``paper companies.'' The identity of interest statement itself has been changed to also include other related parties. The forms also provide notification to all affected parties of the penalty for falsifying the documents. FmHA feels these forms are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(H)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One respondent objected to having to report a discount or rebate when the original line item costs were based on the discounted amount. Another person offered the rationale that rebates and discounts are incentives to buy ``right'' and to pay bills on time and that FmHA is attempting to remove these incentives. One respondent requested clarification of the next to last sentence in this section. The general objection was voiced about reducing profit to agree with the reduction in line item costs of construction. One person felt that contractors would use the pretext of obtaining a rebate or discount in order to not contribute additional funds to cover the increase in line item costs. One respondent supported this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After due consideration, FmHA has decided that this section more appropriately pertains to multiple advance loans where payments are made by FmHA and the amount of any discounts or rebates will be deducted before invoices are paid. If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds will be returned to the supervised bank account. Therefore, this section has been amended to delete reference to discounts and rebates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(I)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The reference to the HUD regulatory language apparently has caused some confusion since it was merely referenced. One respondent wanted to know if the general contractor has to hammer nails in order to be performing work. Another respondent felt that subcontracting out all or nearly all of the work is a typical and accepted practice. One respondent suggested that this provision be waived if it can be demonstrated that it is to the benefit of the property. One person questioned whether this provision will pertain to everyone or just in those cases where an identity of interest exists; if it pertains to everyone, then this section should be taken from the cost certification portion of the regulation. One respondent requested that we provide a definition of ``actual construction.'' Two respondents requested that a distinction be made between work on new construction and work on a rehabilitation. One respondent agreed with this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To eliminate confusion, the reference to the HUD regulation has been removed from this section. OIG audits have found repeatedly that persons who identified themselves as the construction contractor were not qualified to build the project or, for some reason, did not build the project. They, instead, subcontracted out all or most of the construction and still took a full builder's profit. FmHA adamantly opposes the payment of profit to anyone who does not perform the full range of duties of a general contractor. This section does not prohibit a contractor from subcontracting out any or all of the work as long as that contractor does not receive a builder's profit. The Agency has no objection to the contractor being paid for services rendered. FmHA does not foresee any situation where waiver of this provision will benefit the property. This section pertains only to identity of interest borrowers and will remain in this location. For purposes of clarification, we are defining ``actual construction'' to mean ``work'' as defined in A.I.A. documents: ``*&blank;*&blank;* labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.'' Irrespective of whether the project is new construction or rehabilitation, the general contractor should not expect to receive a builder's profit if he/she has not performed the full ranges of responsibilities of a general contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Nike loses Olympic race Nike International, the US sporting clothes and footwear group, yesterday lost a race to have a ban on the sale and marketing of its clothing in Spain lifted before the start of the Olympic Games in Barcelona on Saturday, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Spain's constitutional court rejected a second appeal by Nike in favour of claims by a Catalan company that it owns the Nike trademark in Spain. The decision sets the stage for a potentially embarrassing inaugural ceremony as it means the Spanish claimant could ask police to stop the US athletic team, sponsored by Nike, entering the Olympic stadium wearing the Nike (US) logo.</p>

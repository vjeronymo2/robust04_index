			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices In general the market remained on the quiet side this week, which is not unusual for the time of year, reports Man Producten. Buyers of black pepper were very scarce. On the other hand the selling pressure from most producing countries disappeared and prices more or less stabilised at about USDollars 2,400 a tonne for spot black, faq. White pepper prices tended firmer, however, reaching about Dollars 3550 a tonne, cif, for December/January shipment. Buying interest for second and third quarter 1995 deliveries made whites more expensive. As China and Sarawak can not sell large quantities until the new crop starts to arrive in July all white pepper demand has to be covered in Indonesia where stocks are already unusually low.</p>

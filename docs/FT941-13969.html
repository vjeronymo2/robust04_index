			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Volvo gets back to nuts and bolts - The new chairman of Sweden's car maker talks to Hugh Carnegy It is hard to imagine a greater contrast to Pehr Gyllenhammar than Bert-Olof Svanholm. Volvo's newly installed chairman, elected this week to lead Sweden's top manufacturer following the fiasco of the failed merger with Renault, is a physically compact engineer, virtually unknown outside industrial circles who is most animated when talking about the nuts and bolts of making a company function efficiently. This, clearly, is a very different character from Mr Gyllenhammar, the suave lawyer who in 22 years at the top of Volvo gave the company enviable international cachet and became one of the best-known and most-admired men in Sweden. Mr Svanholm, head of the Nordic operation of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, considers his words carefully when asked what kind of leadership he will bring to Volvo. 'My interest is not so much the national/global aspect of business as perhaps Mr Gyllenhammar has shown. I am very much a team player, working with the people, working with management, trying together with my colleagues on the board to achieve company improvements in all areas,' he says. 'We are all aware that the car industry is one of the most competitive businesses. Therefore a lot of attention will have to be paid not only to the structural measures and the alliance with Renault, but to a very great extent on cost improvements inside the company, from the balance sheet point of view down to factory efficiency.' Mr Svanholm quickly uses the three letters BMT - meaning 'before my time' - to avoid direct comment on the dramatic events that led to his appointment. But there is a clear message that he intends to do things differently and ensure there is no repeat of the drama when shareholders harbouring long-term resentments over Mr Gyllenhammar's autocratic rule over Volvo finally revolted by rejecting his plan to merge with Renault. First, Mr Svanholm will not work full time, or have any executive role, at Volvo, as Mr Gyllenhammar did. 'It is important that Volvo now gets a division between the management and the board,' he says. Second, he sees a closer role for shareholders in plotting the company's course. 'If things are going to be moved in a thorough way in a company it is of course crucial that communication is floating freely through the system - within the company, from the company to the board, from the board to shareholders.' If the choice of Mr Svanholm was initially a surprise, these attitudes explain his attraction to the cabal of Swedish institutional shareholders who precipitated the downfall of Mr Gyllenhammar and who chose him as the successor. His lack of a public profile or any reputation for glory seeking, combined with a workman-like record in an engineering blue-chip as solid as ABB make him a safe pair of hands. The big question is whether he will prove sufficiently well-equipped to lead a company which faces severe long-term industrial challenges and which carries the unusual but unavoidable burden of the high expectations of the wider Swedish public. What most Swedes want to see is Volvo firmly committed to an independent future making cars. Mr Svanholm has been understandably reticent about talking publicly about strategy until he and the new board, together with Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, and his management team, have worked out in detail what the direction should be. Top of the list is what to do about the three-year old alliance with Renault now the merger plan is scrapped. The whole structure of the relationship, from cross-shareholdings to joint purchasing arrangements, is under review. Volvo must also decide how many of its interests outside the core truck and car operations - which run from aero engines, through food and drinks to pharmaceuticals - it wants or can afford to retain. At this stage, Mr Svanholm gives little clue as to what his preferred outcome is. But there is a clear indication of what his regime may bring in one important area of substance - organisational structures within Volvo. His conversation becomes liveliest when talking about the projects he has presided over at ABB to improve productivity and cost cutting. He proudly points out that the so-called T50 project has in three years cut throughput times at ABB Sweden by 47 per cent. He vigorously defends as 'very close to my heart' efforts made by Mr Gyllenhammar to introduce more worker-friendly production techniques at Volvo. 'We are at a stage of paradigm change where we are leaving the functional thinking behind and moving into process-oriented, flow-oriented organisation, utilising the whole person - not just his arms and legs - and thereby getting fantastic productivity improvement.' Sweden, with its history of close co-operation between management and trade unions, is well placed to achieve these changes, Mr Svanholm says. He talks of 'taking out the wording of blue and white collar workers' to achieve a 'new Swedish model'. 'If I can contribute some of those ideas into Volvo, I will be happy,' he says.</p>

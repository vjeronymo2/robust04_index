			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item by Stevan Cordas] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 28 (TANJUG) -- Diplomats in Belgrade  are sceptical on Monday of the chance of Bosnian Moslems and  Croats reaching agreement at their talks in Washington to form a  union and then a confederation with neighbouring Croatia,  feeling that any idea imposed from outside is rather difficult  of concretisation. The United States, on the other hand, is  confident that the plan is ideal and that it has finally hit  upon a simple solution for Bosnia.    The latest analyses made in Zagreb, however, seem to  indicate  that the U.S. solution is far from being simple. Zagreb's  acceeding in the U.S. plan is being seen as a Croatian effort to  get out from under U.N. pressure. Furthermore, diplomats in  Belgrade point out, any solution devised at the expense of a  third side -- in this case, Bosnian Serbs -- is bound to fail.    This view is shared by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic, who believes that the U.S. plan is acceptable only if  it has no ulterior motive other than lasting peace in Bosnia.    The Washington talks are interesting also from another  aspect  -- that of the United States' former support for Bosnian  Moslems. Washington's idea to unite the Moslems and Croats  denotes its reluctance to permit the creation of an Islamic  state in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Any future U.S. support for  the Moslems must be regarded only in the context of their  unification with the Croats, it is being heard in Belgrade.    In any case, one thing is clear -- both the Moslems and the  Croats have an interest at this time in falling in with the U.S.  plan. However, during the two years of war, the two sides have  signed and then ignored a host of different agreements, always  running true to form of saying one thing, doing another and  plotting a third.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SECOND CONCERT AT LA JOLLA SUMMERFEST '90  </P> <P> SummerFest Artistic Director Heiichiro Ohyama proved again Sunday that inspired  cronyism produces the strongest chamber music performances.  </P> <P> At the second public concert in SummerFest '90 in Sherwood Auditorium at the  San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art here, Ohyama, again surrounded by a  distinguished group of gifted, high-achieving and musically affectionate  cronies, put together a sensible -- if hardly provocative -- program consisting  of Mozart's Piano Trio in G, K. 564, Ravel's Introduction and Allegro and  Dvorak's Piano quartet in E-flat, Opus 87.  </P> <P> Because of the character of the pieces, the evening moved steadily from  Mozartean containment to Dvorakian climax.  </P> <P> The Quartet, played passionately by a tight ensemble of obviously close  colleagues, made all its dramatic points in a sometimes overwrought reading,  one that might have been more effective at lower dynamic levels -- the  acoustics in Sherwood Hall are clear enough to project even the most  understated musical rhetoric, after all.  </P> <P> Still, with such serious artists as pianist David Golub, violinist Gyorgy Pauk,  violist Toby Hoffman and cellist Gary Hoffmancqb, to ask for a lesser  commitment is practically insulting. If this piece emerged almost embarrassing  in its emotional stridency, what was needed in the first place was restraint on  the part of the composer.  </P> <P> Restraint without wimpiness marked the buoyant and articulate performance of  the famous Ravel piece accomplished by harpist Deborah Hoffman, assisted by  violinists Julie Rosenfeld and Cho-Liang Lin, flutist Carol Wincenc,  clarinetist David Peck and Hoffman's brothers, violist Toby and cellist Gary.  </P> <P> The second evening of the fifth SummerFest series began with an elegant but  well-spoken account of the Mozart Trio, a reading special in its balance of  forward thrust and relaxed lyricism, played by violinist Pauk, cellist Ronald  Leonard and pianist Emanuel Ax. It was a reminder that the finest chamber  performances combine personal response with selfless execution. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

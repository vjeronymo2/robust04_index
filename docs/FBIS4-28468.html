			<p>BFN     [Text] The research participants council [RPC] (chaired by  Kyoto University Professor Zentaro Kitagawa) of the Agency for  Cultural Affairs [ACA] has been studying whether "reverse  engineering (RE)" -- which means companies analyzing and  extracting ideas from software developed by other companies to  utilize such data for the development of their own software --  should be included as one of the rights protected by the  Copyright Act. In its report published on 30 May, the RPC  explained that "we have not come up with concrete proposals on  the revision of the act so far." Although the RPC has been  studying the possibility of conditional approval of RE, it  shelved the decision to revise the law because the U.S.  Government showed "grave concern." Domestic manufacturers, such  as Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation, are opposed to  postponement of the decision because they have been urging for  the approval of RE because "RE is indispensable for the  development of compatible products."    The RPC, a private advisory body to the ACA director  general,  has been studying the propriety of the use of RE in computer  software development since last July. RE generally means  analyzing the structure of software developed by other companies  and extracting technical or design ideas to utilize them for  development of one's own software. To produce duplicates of  other companies' products through RE is against the law.  However, there is no regulation about extraction of ideas in  the Copyright Act.    Fujitsu and other domestic manufacturers say "RE is  indispensable in developing products marketable worldwide." The  RPC has been collecting various views mainly in favor of  permitting RE because this is already quite commonly used as a  measure to develop products.    However, IBM, Microsoft, and Apple Computer Inc. voiced  opposition at a hearing for U.S. companies concerned late last  year. Likewise, the Office of the United States Trade  Representative (USTR) and the Department of Commerce showed  "grave concern." Thus, there has been a delay in the RPC's work  schedule.    Four basic views, ranging from all-out support to all-out  opposition, as well as their reasons, are all included in the  RPC report. The council decided to postpone revision of the  law, explaining: "Further discussion on the Copyright Act is  required. It will be appropriate to wait for court rulings on  legal interpretation for the time being, and resume the  discussion in line with the development of the situation."  Thus, the council has winded up its discussion.    The RPC also discussed the following: 1) The legal status of  the duplication of computer programs for private use in the  Copyright Act, and 2) what actions should be taken against the  production and sales of devices for bypassing the  copy-protection function, which enable easy duplication of  programs.    With regard to duplication for private use, the RPC affirmed  the need for regulations, and decided to start preparations to  impose rules. However, since this is an issue common to other  digital products, such as multimedia software, the council has  merely decided to "hear the opinions of the parties concerned,  and urgently discuss this issue on another occasion."    Concerning the production and sales of copy-protection  bypass  devices, most council members said legal regulation is  necessary. However, the council did not reach a clear-cut  conclusion, saying "hearings should be held for parties  concerned."</p>

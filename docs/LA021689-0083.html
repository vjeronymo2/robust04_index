			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FONDA, HAYDEN SEPARATE; CAREER CONFLICTS ARE CITED  </P> <P> Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden, among America's most celebrated, controversial and  uncommon couples, have separated.  </P> <P> The two said Wednesday they are parting on a trial basis after a 15-year  marriage, a pairing of trench-war politics and global show business. A  spokesman said the two consider the decision a private matter and neither  wanted to comment further. The trial separation did not involve court filings,  the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Hayden, 49, Democratic assemblyman from Santa Monica, for weeks has confided in  friends that he is deep in self reevaluation -- both in his personal life and  in his political career. Coincidentally, the news of the separation comes just  a day after a new statewide poll showed him leading other Democrats for the the  newly created office of state insurance commissioner.  </P> <P> Fonda, 51, Academy Award winning actress and doyenne of the modern video  exercise craze, has recently returned to California from location in Mexico and  is finishing post-production work on a film, "Old Gringo," based on the novel  by Carlos Fuentes.  </P> <P> The decision was announced by Steven Rivers, a long-time confidant of Hayden  and currently Fonda's publicist.  </P> <P> Friends said the split was the result of increasingly divergent paths, Fonda  pushing her film and exercise business and Hayden searching to widen his  political career after six years in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Hayden recites an old political joke on the point: "If Jane and I have an  evening at home alone together, it is a scheduling mistake by the staff."  </P> <P> One long-time friend of the couple said, "I think it's been leading up to this  for some time. The difficulty is, No. 1, Jane has made a very strong commitment  to her career and there was this huge separation. They have been trying very  hard to keep it together, but Jane went off to Mexico and Canada, and Tom was  left here on his own. He's going through a mid-life crisis over his career,  what he's doing and all that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glamour and Purpose  </P> <P> The Fonda-Hayden relationship has been a novel one through the years. Fonda  brought home glamour, position and money; Hayden contributed politics and a  sense of civic purpose.  </P> <P> The two labored to bring Hollywood's young cadre of actors and actresses -- the  so-called Brat Pack -- out of an often self-indulgent world and interest them  in politics. They were most successful in 1986, when they organized a bus  caravan of young celebrities that traveled the state on behalf of Proposition  65, Hayden's successful clean water initiative.  </P> <P> Grubstaked with her money, the two built a 100,000-member political  organization, Campaign California, formerly the Campaign for Economic  Democracy. This began after Hayden lost a Democratic primary campaign for the  U.S. Senate in 1976.  </P> <P> Their annual Easter retreat brought together precinct walkers, political  journalists, old and bruised veterans of the anti-war movement and some of the  biggest names in cinema. They would gather and sing old tunes like "Puff the  Magic Dragon." Hayden led religious services on Easter Sunday. Fonda always  dressed as the Easter bunny. With the separation, this year's retreat was  canceled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Common Touches  </P> <P> Now millionaires many times over, there has always been a sense of the  common-person about this pair. They drive ordinary station wagons, she a  Chrysler and he a faded Volvo. Their home in Santa Monica is decidedly upscale,  but for a family whose annual income has been estimated in the double-digit  millions, it would have to be called modest. They own a rustic but breathtaking  mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara, just a few ridges south of Ronald  Reagan's.  </P> <P> Known as just Tom and Jane, they fell in love in 1971 after meeting on stage at  an anti-war rally. In his recent memoirs, "Reunion," Hayden recalled sitting on  the floor of Fonda's home, then in Laurel Canyon, and showing slides about the  Vietnam war.  </P> <P> At the time, Hayden had come West after a long and sometimes violent series of  struggles in the civil rights and then anti-war movements. Fonda, daughter of  actor Henry Fonda, was a budding -- and, by her later admission, naive --  anti-war activist with a ho-hum resume as a Hollywood sex kitten.  </P> <P> "Jane was starting to cry. I kept flipping slides of grotesque young Saigon  women, talking about the . . . operations performed to turn them into  round-eyed, round-bodied, Westernized women, transforming them body and soul  into creatures of our culture. Suddenly I understood why she was weeping: I was  talking about the image of superficial sexiness she once promoted and was now  trying to shake. I looked at her in a new way. Maybe I could love someone like  this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wartime Images  </P> <P> America found some of the images of the twosome hard to forget: Fonda posing  cheerfully with the North Vietnamese in Hanoi during the war, Hayden the angry  defendant in the notorious trial of the "Chicago Seven," resulting from the  police-demonstrator clashes at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.  </P> <P> Even to this day, protest sometimes surfaces where the two go.  </P> <P> Sidney Galanty, a political consultant and producer of Fonda's workout videos,  said the relationship had become one of support but not dependence before the  split.  </P> <P> "When there was political work to be done, Jane did political work. And when  there was Hollywood movie work to be done, Tom was there for Jane," he said.  "One did not neglect the other. Tom has never been known as Mrs. Jane Fonda  except by people who have been aggressively angry at Tom. She was very good at  helping to raise funds and bringing people into Tom's political life that  weren't there before. But Tom is able now to galvanize a lot of people on his  own."  </P> <P> Political associates of Hayden and friends of Fonda say that regardless of the  separation, each still has a bright future. Fonda will have two films released  this year, "Old Gringo," and a love story with Robert De Niro called "Stanley  and Iris." A new workout tape is being filmed next month for release later.  </P> <P> Hayden, meanwhile, is said by an associate to see the latest Field Poll results  as vindication -- at long last -- that he has gained acceptability enough for a  run for statewide office. The job of insurance commissioner was created by  voters last year, and while Hayden has not announced for the position, the poll  showed him the favorite of 50% of the Democrats. The next closest potential  challenger was Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn at 26%.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Alan Citron in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

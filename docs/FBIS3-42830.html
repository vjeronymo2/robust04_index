			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Sydoruk, Engineer, Kiev] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  1. Interesting Geography </H5>   A map can be a wonderful thing. Different color intensities  can be used to show the depths of seas, while different colors  can be used to display the geographical disposition of various  nationalities. But we lack one map! One that would depict the  economic balance sheet of the various areas of Ukraine, i.e.,  which areas are operating at a profit and which are a drain on  the Ukrainian economy. The Crimean peninsula clearly falls into  the latter category.  <H5>  2. A Cause of Discord </H5>   It is only natural that for a person who is conscious of  being a Ukrainian the Crimean question does not exist. What  exists is the universally accepted principle of inviolability of  borders. But the peculiar nature of our northern neighbor does  not allow her to concentrate on her own problems and  decrepitude, which she regards as trivial, but to fixate with  maniacal persistence on Sevastopil, "The City of Russian Glory!"  But this is just one of a number of fixations. For example, what  about Port Arthur? St. Gotthard ("The Zenith of Russian Fame!")  and, finally, Auzterlitz ("the village of Russian humiliation")?    To get things in perspective let us briefly recapitulate  some  facts on Crimea without recourse to boring statistics.    Crimea is a former Soviet health resort with tremendous  recreational resources, numerous sanatoria and state-owned  dachas for which the major and minor members of the Moscow  nomenklatura have developed such a strong sense of longing.  Nevermind the largely deplorable service--by international  standards, of course--which could satisfy only a Soviet hick,  and the huge investments that would be required for upkeep and  improvements.    Agriculture in Crimea has some promise, provided enough  water  is supplied by the Dnieper, despite having been ruined by the  collective farm mentality that still pervades all of the  post-communist territories. Its enough to mention the recent  destruction of unique vineyards there because of the predominant  culture of inebriation to give a feeling of what we mean.    Retirees accounted for a higher percentage of the Crimean  population than elsewhere in the former USSR, reaching 61  percent in Sevastopil alone.    And, finally, Crimea has the Tatar Question and one of the  most popular fleets in the world, existing solely for the  purpose of lining the pockets of corrupt admirals and  businessmen.  <H5>  3. The Homeless Fleet </H5>   For many years the Black Sea Fleet served as "powerful  protector of the peaceful Soviet people against the treacherous  intrusions of world imperialism" at the southern frontiers of  the former superstate. It allegedly served a similar function in  the Mediterranean Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean--wherever world  imperialism posed a threat. The fact that Turkey and NATO could  block the Bosphorus and the Dardenelles and bottle up the fleet  went unmentioned. After all, the coddled sons of highly-placed  bureaucrats and admirals couldn't risk their delicate organisms  in the Arctic Ocean or the northern reaches of the Pacific, but  still they had to mark time somewhere. And then the superstate  fell apart, imaginary treacherous imperialistic intrusions  disappeared, and all that was left to protect was the status quo  with all of its perks, economic benefits, advantages and rich  rewards. The orphan fleet was left with two fathers who compete  for the "right" to take care of it just to look good, while not  assuming any serious responsibilities. All the Yaltas,  Massandras, St. Andrew's standards and Russian vouchers will  change nothing. The fleet will age, turn to rust, disintegrate  and the sailors will go home. The officers will make out somehow  with other occupations and, besides, Russia still has many  fleets with job openings.  <H5>  4. Nothing New Under the Sun </H5>   Having shed a tear for the sad fate of the Black Sea Fleet,  let's look at some appropriate precedents as English jurists are  wont to do.    After Salazar's death the first thing the Portuguese  parliament did was get rid of their colonial burden to stop  Portugal's financial exsanguination. Mozambique and Angola were  set free to swim or sink.    Another example. Puerto Rico has been an autonomous  territory  of the US since 1917 and its politicians have tried on numerous  occasions to gain statehood, but have always encountered  congressional opposition. In distinction to Hawaii, statehood  for Puerto Rico could derail the American national budget.  Nevertheless, the island remains effectively under American  economic control thanks to tourism.  <H5>  5. Status Quo </H5>   As part of Ukraine Crimea gets water, electricity, and food,  along with financing of the fleet and the retirements of vast  number of military retirees. Still, the Ukrainian status is  unacceptable to them. There is longing for the good old days of  unlimited privileges, a time when the Ukrainian "Banderites"  knew their place, all these feelings compounded by geriatric  hostility to change. Maybe, just maybe, there are guilty  feelings for taking over the empty houses of deported Tatars  with their gardens and flower fields. What if the Tatars come  and say "Give it back!"? The empire would never have even  tolerated such a possibility.  <H5>  6. Necrophilia </H5>   Present-day Russia--where you can no longer tell who is a  genuine ethnic Russian (Russkiy) and who merely a non-Russian  resident of Russia (Rossiyanin)--is shocked to have her  stiffling embrace repelled in the name of self-determination.  But she still loves her prodigal son--Crimea. This tender  example of Oedipus complex comes up against economic realities.  Yes, Russia is big (so far), but it also has big problems and  does it need yet another enclave? And if the Kuban region  settled by ethnic Ukrainians decamps from Russia, Russia--or  what's left of it--will be even farther away from Crimea.    Ukraine could stand to gain financially from the Crimean  situation. In addition to oil prices, which for Ukraine exceed  the so-called world prices, Ukraine could charge Crimea for  water from the Dnieper at the going rate of some four billion  dollars, as well as for transits right across its territory to  Crimea. Failure to pay will make more water available for  Ukraine, improve the ecologic situation in the Dnieper basin,  and take care of dearth of water in Southern Ukraine. The health  resorts will continue to thrive on people with convertible  currencies, so any referendum to remove the Crimean appendix may  not be such a bad idea!  <H5>  7. A New Hong Kong </H5>   The Russian writer Aksenov raised hopes of a horn-of-plenty  with his fictional work The Island of Crimea, which is easy  enough to do with Homo Sovieticus.    But, in fundamental terms, there is only one solid basis for  self-determination in the world, and that is the will of the  indigenous population. In a conglomerate country you are up  against a situation where the spiders at the center of the web  order everyone else around. In Crimea you simply cannot ignore  an Islamic (Tatar) factor, jihads, and so forth. Yet the allure  of foreign investments and the creation of another Hong Kong is  quite appealing as an easy solution to a rather unsettling  reality.    How are the pensioners going to be supported? From rental  fees for Sevatopil if anybody wants to rent the port? Ukraine  would be better off keeping its compact fleet elsewhere. What  about water? Energy? Food supplies? But those will be the  problems of an independent Crimea and not Ukraine and, of  course, we can assume that the separatists have anticipated and  provided for these facts of life.    A final thought. The waters surrounding Hong Kong have been  become so polluted as to render them unfit for swimming; just  something else to think about.    To date, the Ukrainian community has been remarkably passive  in all this and it voice disproportionately low-keyed in this  international sing-song. The work of such organizations as  "Crimea with Ukraine" and the regional centers of political  parties--which have been rendered largely meaningless by the  passage of the Crimean constitution--are, nevertheless, slowly  permeating into the Ukrainian consciousness. Ukrainian passivity  is to a large extent due to an information blockade posed by  absence of Ukrainian schools and exclusion of the Ukrainian  language from the mass media and community organizations. In the  face of this, the persistent efforts of the Tatars are worthy of  admiration.  <H5>  8. Two Suitors and a Girl </H5>   Christ often spoke in parables, which might offer a  convenient vehicle to address the Crimean issue.    Once upon a time there was once a clever girl who encouraged  two suitors, counting on getting gifts and attention from both  of them. Things got heated between the rivals, but the wiser one  came to his senses, realized what the score was, and took off.  The girl panicked and attempted to lock-in on the remaining  suitor, who came to think that she might not be such a treasure  after all if no one else would have her. The upshot is that her  intrigues risk making her lonely for life.    This brings to mind a Russian anecdote where a husband  holding his wife out of a tenth-floor window tells her how lucky  she is [in Russian]: My grandfather stabbed his wife, my dad  shot his, and I'm letting you go free!    This has obviously been an anecdotal and a light-humored  look  at the Crimean question, but every bit of humor has a particle  of truth in it...</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gerhard Bitzan report: "PKK Offers Dialogue"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- "Unnoticed by the world public, Turkey  deployed 50,000 soldiers at the border with Iraq to be able to  fight against the Kurds on the other side of the border, too.  Everything suggests that they will stay there permanently."  This has been claimed by the European spokesman of the  Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK), Kani Yilmaz, in an  interview with DIE PRESSE. Yilmaz is currently in Vienna to  hold talks with Social Democratic politicians. The ERNK is a  political umbrella organization of the radical Workers Party of  Kurdistan (PKK). Yilmaz repeated the offer submitted by PKK  leader Ocalan to the government in Ankara to end the fighting  and seek a political solution. "We do not want any more  bloodshed. We want a public discussion of the rights of the  Kurds in Turkey." The Turkish Government has not yet replied.  "It continues to pursue the old policy aimed at ignoring our  existence."    Asked about earlier demands for an independent state, Yilmaz  stated that the Kurds do not insist on a separatist solution by  all means. "It would also be possible for us to achieve freedom  within the existing borders."    Referring to the attacks on tourist centers, Yilmaz pointed  out: "Tourism is a source of foreign exchange for the military.  We call on the tourist not to support this policy with their  trips." These attacks are being carried out by individual  persons, by supporters, Yilmaz claimed.</p>

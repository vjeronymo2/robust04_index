			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aziz Filho] </F>   [Excerpts] Workers Party [PT] presidential candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva has adopted a more radical style against  neo-liberalism. In Rio de Janeiro on 5 May, he promised that if  elected, he will create a "strong government" to intervene in  the economy, not to nationalize it, but to control the market  and the strategic sectors and to fight tax evasion.    Lula plans to review the privatizations conducted during the  administrations of former President Fernando Collor and  President Itamar Franco, to change the concession system for  radio and television stations, and to create a state-owned  educational television network of very high quality. Lula said  the constitutional reform failed because "no one was able to  make lazy congressmen vote."    Addressing Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc. workers at the  Brazilian Press Association, Lula said he wants "a strong  government, not a weak and fragile one. He wants a government  capable of intervening in the social and economic areas." He  criticized the current administration for "not having the  courage to fight the financial system, the oligopolies, and the  cement cartel." Lula said a strong government would fight tax  evasion, expand and reorient the domestic market, and seek  social justice. [passage omitted]    Lula tried to calm entrepreneurs' fears about the socialist  profile of his party. He pointed out that the government  program approved by his party members does not force him to  declare a moratorium on the foreign debt, but to maintain  suspension of payments as a weapon to be used depending on the  creditors reaction to the negotiations he plans to conduct. He  gave examples of how the government can intervene in the  economy: by stimulating the establishment of leather industries,  clothes manufacture, toys, and school materials in small urban  nuclei, "thus creating a bond between the citizen and his native  region and preventing the poor in the northeastern region from  moving to the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo shantytowns where  they become totally destitute and miserable."</p>

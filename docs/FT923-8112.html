			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool prices are staying fairly steady in terms of Australian cents. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator drifted fractionally down 5 cents to 530 during the first two selling days this week. The Australian dollar has however registered a sharp change from its normal close alignment with the US dollar, at about 75 cents, the rate moved this week to 71 cents. The US dollar is itself weak, and buyers almost everywhere find wool definitely cheaper for currency reasons. Holidays remain an important factor keeping the market dull, apart from price softness connected with currency volatility.</p>

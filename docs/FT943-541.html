			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF sees higher growth in industrial nations Forecasts for growth in the industrialised world were yesterday revised upwards for the first time this decade by the International Monetary Fund, which declared that the recession and the slow growth of the early 1990s were over. Describing the upwards revisions as a 'happy event', Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's research department, told a news conference that the prospects for the world economy were brighter than at any point in the past three to four years. The IMF expects the economies of the industrialised nations will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and next compared with its previous forecasts, published five months ago, of 2.4 per cent for 1994 and 2.6 per cent for 1995. According to its latest World Economic Outlook, published last night ahead of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, global output is expected to expand by 3.1 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 1995, or close to the trend rate of growth of the past two decades. After revising upwards its estimate of last year's world trade growth to 4 per cent from 2.4 per cent, the IMF expects continued strong expansion in the years ahead. It expects world trade will grow by about 7 per cent this year and just under 6 per cent in 1995 and therefore at a faster rate than the average 5 per cent annual growth of the past 20 years. Mr Mussa said the recovery in the industrial world was accompanied by encouraging signs of growth in Africa and a continued strong performance in Asia and some Latin American countries. Growth in the developing countries as a group is expected to be twice as strong as in the industrial countries this year and next. Although problems exist, notably in the former Soviet countries, activity is beginning to pick up in central and eastern Europe while recovery in the Middle East is expected in 1995. Mr Mussa said unemployment now seemed to have passed its peak in continental Europe and was 'on the downslope' some months earlier than expected in April. Mr Mussa also praised this month's increase in UK bank base rates to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent as a 'highly desirable initial step to contain future growth of inflationary pressure'. He said Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was right to give priority to controlling public expenditure before considering tax cuts. IMF World Economic Outlook, Page 7</p>

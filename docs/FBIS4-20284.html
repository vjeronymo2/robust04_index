			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Decision" by the "Liberation Unionist Forces of North </F> Epirus"--date not given]    [Excerpt] Thirty Albanians, who have already been  "selected" and are under constant surveillance until the hour of  "crisis," will be executed if Tirana realizes its plan to hold  mock trials to condemn Greek minority members without  justification.    This decision has been made by the Guerrilla Command, which  fights for the union of North Epirus with the rest of Greece.  This difficult decision was made after taking into  consideration the fact that the Command knows very well that no  one arrested is in any way responsible, since those who carried  out the mission returned to their base safely.

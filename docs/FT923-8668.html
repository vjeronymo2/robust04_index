			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / US team eager to conclude Nafta US, CANADIAN and Mexican negotiators at the weekend were still winding up discussions on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). American negotiators are racing to complete the pact before next week's Republican party convention. For President George Bush, the ideal time to reach agreement would be a weekday, presenting him with the opportunity of appearing on the evening news to claim a foreign and economic policy victory. Instead of seeming passive while the US economy stutters, he could emerge at his party's convention as something of a visionary. Nafta is designed to liberalise trade largely by eliminating tariff barriers over a 15-year period for a range of US, Mexican and Canadian goods and services. However, reports indicate that Mexican officials have become stubborn about sharing government procurement contracts in the state-owned oil sector with Canadian and US companies. The energy trade negotiations have been limited by protective Mexican laws and Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, has said the pact should offer opportunities for companies servicing the oil industry. Despite many unresolved issues, the negotiations have broken new ground on environmental issues. One provision sets up a Nafta arbitration panel for environmental disputes; this panel would take precedence over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade dispute settlement mechanism, which has been faulted for ignoring environmental considerations. The provision was in response to lobbying from many environmental groups which opposed the pact, fearing it would increase environmental problems along the US-Mexican border where some 2,000 maquiladoras - foreign-owned Mexican manufacturing and assembly plants - have sprung up since 1965. Nafta also creates a customs area for both external as well as internal purposes. It is expected not only to boost trade within the continent but to link Mexico's young, cheap labour with US and Canadian innovation and technology.</p>

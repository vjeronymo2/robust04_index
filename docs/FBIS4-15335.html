			<p>BFN     [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev today received a  delegation headed by 'Ali Abdol 'Alizadeh, governor-general of  East Azerbaijan.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Akif Tevekguloglu] After  achieving independence, Azerbaijan had the opportunity to expand  economic, political, and cultural ties with many countries.  Relations between Azerbaijan and Iran--which are closely related  historically, religiously, and linguistically--have entered a  new stage. However, it must be noted that not all the  opportunities are being used to develop the brotherly and  friendly ties between Azerbaijan and Iran.    In expressing these views during the talks with the guests,  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev also noted that there are no  more obstacles before the Azerbaijani people to develop ties  with Iran, and the border settlements and cities in both  countries should play a major role in this task.    [Aliyev] Azerbaijani lands bordering on Iran should play an  important role if the ties between Azerbaijan and Iran are to be  improved and expanded. Both the Azerbaijani and Iranian border  regions are important. Undoubtedly, Iran's territory is large  and it has large provinces in the border regions. Azerbaijan's  territory is small compared to Iran and most of it borders with  Iran. However, the border regions both on the Azerbaijani and  Iranian side are playing a major role in the development of ties  between us. That is, they occupy an important place.    In this regard, East Azerbaijan, the general-governor of  which is my friend Abdol 'Alizadeh, and hence the city of  Tabriz, occupy an important place in this. When I was still in  Nakhichevan and you were in Tabriz, we had the same opinion, and  in developing and broadening the ties between Nakhichevan and  with Iran, particularly through Eastern Azerbaijan and Tabriz,  we were pursuing the aim of developing the ties between Iran and  Azerbaijan in general.    [Tevekguloglu] Speaking on behalf of his delegation, 'Ali  Abdol 'Alizadeh thanked President Geydar Aliyev for the  reception. He noted that we deeply feel the profound suffering  experienced by Azerbaijan and we believe that you are capable of  extracting the people from the existing grave situation. The  Iranians are impatiently waiting for your visit. They would be  extremely pleased to see you in Tehran and Tabriz.    The guests then proposed that Baku and Tabriz be formally  declared sister cities.    Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev gladly accepted this  proposal.    Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan  Supreme  Soviet; State Adviser Vafa Gulizade; and Iranian Ambassador to  Iran 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian were present at the meeting. [end  recording]    Chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Rasul Guliyev  today received the visiting Iranian delegation headed by  Governor-General 'Ali Abdol 'Alizadeh.    The chairman of the Supreme Soviet briefed the guests on the  Azerbaijani president's position on the socio-political  situation in the Republic, on exceedingly serious problems in  our Republic arising from Armenia's aggression, and on the need  to establish peace in the region and condemn the aggressor.    Rasul Guliyev noted that the Azerbaijani president is giving  great importance to the future development of  Azerbaijani-Iranian ties and pointed out the urgency of using  all possible means to develop ties between our peoples, who are  closely tied to one another with historical, religious, and  cultural roots.    He also highly assessed Iran's selfless assistance to the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which has been placed under a  blockade by Armenia, and the assistance provided to the refugees  by the neighboring country.    Mr. Abdol 'Alizadeh expressed his views on Iran's positions  on the Armenian aggression and on future development of ties  between the two countries.    A number of other problems of mutual interest were also  discussed during the meeting.    Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian and  other officials participated in the meeting.    The delegation of Iran's East Azerbaijan Province was also  received today by the Deputy Chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme  Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov. Representatives of Azerbaijani  ministries, governmental departments, and firms participated in  the meeting.    Afiaddin Dzhalilov noted that important documents on further  developing the ties between the two countries were signed during  Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's visit to Baku some months  ago. Such visits have a positive effect on the implementation  of the signed agreements.    Mr. Abdol 'Alizadeh, the governor-general of Iran's East  Azerbaijan Province, said that he was pleased with the  development of the ties between the two countries. He noted  that these ties are now entering a new stage and that Iran will  take important steps in this direction.    The Iranian border delegation visited the martyrs mausoleum  to honor the memory of those martyred for Azerbaijan's  independence and territorial integrity.</p>

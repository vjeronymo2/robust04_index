			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / South African unions embrace pragmatism: But the new approach is not necessarily permanent, writes Mark Suzman from the Cosatu congress On the surface things have never looked better for South Africa's labour movement. After years of an apartheid regime overtly hostile to unions, an openly sympathetic government is now in power. Furthermore, trade union membership has started to rise again after contracting over the past few years, and, at 37.2 per cent of the workforce, is the highest in the developing world. But rather than the celebrations that were expected, the national congress last week of the 1.3m-strong Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's most powerful labour federation, proved to be an occasion for heated discussion and soul-searching as the movement sought to redefine its role. To respectful but unenthusiastic applause, in the opening address President Nelson Mandela praised Cosatu's role in the anti-apartheid struggle, but called on workers to think of the country's 5m unemployed rather than looking just to their own relatively privileged position. 'Without us tightening our belts it will be difficult to get our economy to grow,' he warned. The speech served as a reminder of the challenges faced by the labour movement in the new era. Despite the fact that Cosatu's formal political allies, the African National Congress and South African Communist party, dominate the ruling government of national unity, tensions between the labour movement and administration have risen considerably over a wave of strikes by Cosatu affiliates. Although the ANC remains broadly supportive of labour's demands, its greatest concern is fostering economic growth and job creation. To that end it wants to dampen labour militancy to encourage foreign investment. However continued labour militancy combined with the country's relatively high wages for a developing country - South African workers earn comparable salaries to workers in successful Asian economies such as South Korea and Taiwan, almost double the pay-rate in Brazil and nearly four times that in India - serve as a continued deterrent to prospective investors. The ANC has also clashed with Cosatu on industrial restructuring, and union members reacted with anger to an announcement some two weeks ago that the government was cutting tariffs on car imports by an effective 20 per cent. They charged that the decision undermined workers' bargaining position in negotiations in the strike in the motor industry, forcing them into a premature settlement. Underlying these disputes is Cosatu's fear that the new regime may start to adopt an anti-union attitude. Mr Enoch Godongwana, secretary general of the National Union of Motorworkers of South Africa, argues that in Africa political leaders have a 'history of betrayal' towards organised labour after taking power, and Cosatu is determined that the same thing should not happen in South Africa. Part of the movement's difficulties stem from the very closeness of its ties to the new government. According to a report commissioned by the National Labour and Economic Development Institute, 80 top union officials have left the movement in the past year, most of them to join the administration. So much of the leadership is unproven and lacks the authority to control more radical shopfloor leaders. Several of the recent strikes continued well after union negotiators were willing to settle when they proved unable to rein in their activist membership. In implicit acknowledgement of this, the main outcome of the conference was a decision to concentrate on what Mr John Gomomo, Cosatu president, calls a 'back to basics' policy, focusing on new recruitment, consolidating local affiliates and addressing work-related grievances. But on the all-important political issue, the congress overwhelmingly voted down a proposal to end its partnership with the ANC and form a left-of-centre Workers party, instead electing 'to strengthen the tripartite alliance'. However, the federation was careful to link these resolutions to a strong appeal for the institutionalisation of collective bargaining at a national level via the soon-to-be-established National Economic Development and Labour Council. This is a tripartite body that will contain representatives from business, government and labour. So far, therefore, Cosatu seems to be indicating its support for consolidating and expanding the 'golden triangle' of business, government and labour that has beennurtured over the past two years by outgoing finance minister Mr Derek Keys. 'The thread that goes through the congress is that workers must be involved in all strategic decision-making, on the shop floor, in management and in government,' said Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu general secretary who was re-elected unopposed. But, the organisation warned, the tripartite alliance was 'not permanent and shall from time to time be reviewed as conditions dictate.'</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Aer Lingus to lose almost one in three jobs ALMOST ONE in every three jobs is to go at Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline, as part of a radical restructuring plan revealed to the company's trade unions yesterday. The recovery plan is intended to return the company to profitability by 1995. Some 1,280 redundancies are being sought from the airline's 5,500 staff, plus a further 250 redundancies at TEAM Aer Lingus, a Dublin-based aircraft maintenance subsidiary. No other redundancies have been mentioned from the 13,000 employed worldwide by the group and its subsidiaries, as a major sell-off of up to two thirds of the group's non-core businesses - including its Copthorne Hotel group in the UK - is to be carried out. The black hole in the company's finances appears to be worse than hitherto assumed, with losses estimated at IPounds 116m (Pounds 113.7m) for the current year alone, although IPounds 65m of these relate to exceptional items, mainly due to a write-down of the group's investment in GPA. Losses in the air transport division are forecast to be IPounds 64m this year. Ms Joan Carmichael, the secretary of a joint trade union council at the airline, said yesterday she was 'devastated' at the scale of the planned redundancies, and that 'it only appears to be the tip of the iceberg'.</p>

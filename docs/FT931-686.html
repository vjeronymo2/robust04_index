			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: ECGD The increased export credit cover and lower premiums promised in the Budget brought qualified approval from industry. Although the Export Credits Guarantee Department's average premiums have been cut, affordable cover will not necessarily be available for markets of particular interest to exporters such as China. But it does look as if the regime has become more relaxed. The broader fear is that this may ultimately lead to a rerun of the large losses that plagued ECGD in the 1980s and from which it is only just recovering. ECGD's obligation to provide medium-term project cover forces it to take on large single risks for which no reinsurance cover exists. Like other national export credit agencies it suffers from a concentration of risks. By contrast, commercial companies automatically reinsure. There is an opportunity here for the EC. It could establish a European export credit reinsurance market which would help put national agencies on a sounder footing. The stock objection - that one country's taxpayers would simply end up covering losses incurred by another's exporters - is short-sighted. Assuming a degree of critical mass, such a market would set a benchmark for premiums which would make it hard for national agencies to undercut each other. The unfair competition which British exporters claim to have faced from low-premium countries like France would disappear. Decisions to extend cover might become more disciplined. Unfortunately the chances of such a radical approach look slim. The UK government's reluctance to extend its own top-up reinsurance facility for the privatised part of ECGD suggests it has little appreciation of the reinsurance issue. As long as that remains true, exporters should expect the export credit tap to be turned off again once the losses start to mount.</p>

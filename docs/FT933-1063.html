			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Olivetti optimistic as deficit widens OLIVETTI, the Italian computers group, remained deeply in loss for the first half of this year. However, it claimed yesterday that the outlook for 1993 as a whole had improved due to greater competitiveness and a slight let-up in downward pressure on operating margins. Although net group losses at L168.1bn (Dollars 105.7m) were considerably higher than the L93.4bn lost in first half of 1992, Mr Corrado Passera, joint managing director, said the figures were broadly similar. Mr Passera pointed out that the 1992 deficit been partly masked by L170bn of accruals carried over from 1991. According to Mr Passera, the first-half loss represented a small but significant upturn from the depressed figures in the second half of last year. For the whole of 1992, Olivetti reported a net loss of L649.9bn. Industry analysts expect the group to lose between L400bn and L450bn in 1993, while Olivetti itself predicts a return to break-even by December 1994. Sales for the six months rose by 5.4 per cent to L3,949bn, with most of the increase coming in 'a number of competitive European and US markets', Olivetti said. However, turnover has been boosted by last year's sharp devaluation of the lira, which has swelled the value of foreign sales in lira terms. Mr Passera said that although the devaluation had ostensibly helped competitiveness, the overall effect had been mildly negative because of appreciably higher prices for imported components. Earnings had also been affected by the unexpectedly steep fall in domestic demand because of the recession. Mr Passera said that the information technology industry remained under pressure because of overcapacity and competition. However, although margins had continued to fall after precipitous declines in 1991 and 1992, 'they are no longer dropping at the same speed', he added. Olivetti said that its share of the European personal computer market rose to 6.2 per cent in June from 4.9 per cent at the same time last year, while shipments increased by more than 50 per cent. There was also a rise in sales of printers, notably of bubble-jet models. The group's financial position improved. Net borrowings dropped to L741bn at the end of June from L961bn last December, due partly to this year's L903bn rights issue.</p>

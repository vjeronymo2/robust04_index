			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- To seriously implement  the State Council's relevant decisions on further reforming the  foreign exchange management system, the Bank of China recently  held an urgent telephone conference of leading cadres at and  above the department [chu 5710] level and called on all branch  offices to adopt necessary and effective measures to ensure  reform of the foreign exchange management system proceeded  smoothly.    Wang Xuebing [3769 7185 0393], the new president of the Bank  of China, said during the conference: The Bank of China has  always been a specialized foreign exchange bank. Under the new  system, it remains the state-designated foreign exchange bank.  To do a serious and good job in reforming the foreign exchange  management system is a glorious and yet arduous task assigned to  the Bank of China by the state. Everyone in the bank must do  the job well and with a great sense of social responsibility.    Wang Xuebing demanded: The leading cadres of all branch  offices should attach a great importance to reform of the  foreign exchange management system. Number one leaders should  personally take a hand in organizing the implementation of  reform measures. Attention should be given to ensuring that  every level is performing its duties and regards the reform of  the foreign exchange management system as the task of prime  importance in 1994. At the same time, all branch offices should  immediately organize serious operational training for relevant  personnel in consideration of their actual business.    Wang Xuebing particularly emphasized: During the initial  period of the new foreign exchange system, some supportive  procedures and relevant rules and regulations will be either  formulated or revised gradually. During this period, all branch  offices at the different levels should pay special attention to  strengthening internal management, preventing irregularities,  and ensuring the safety of bank funds. In the meantime, since  the new examination, approval and other business procedures  still need further improvement step by step, it is even more  necessary for all banking offices to pay attention to service  attitude, quality and efficiency, and to strive to provide  enthusiastic, accurate, and fast service, to be patient and  meticulous in seeking the understanding and support of clients,  and to ensure the new foreign exchange system proceeds smoothly.    Speakers at the telephone conference included Zhu Xiaohua,  vice president of the Bank of China; and Wang Qiren, new  chairman of the bank's board of directors.</p>

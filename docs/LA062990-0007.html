			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUDGET WOULD TRIGGER LAYOFFS OF 269  </P> <P> A feuding, frustrated Los Angeles Board of Education on Thursday ground out a  precariously balanced, tentative budget that triggers 269 layoffs and hinges in  part on improving student attendance.  </P> <P> Most of the layoffs, part of an overall work force reduction that took about  1,000 jobs, are among the lower-paying, so-called "classified" jobs --  including clerical and other office workers, custodians, maintenance workers  and cafeteria staff. Many of those jobs are held by blacks, Latinos and other  minorities.  </P> <P> "This has been the hardest thing I've ever done since I've been in public  office," Board President Jackie Goldberg said as the board approved its  preliminary 1990-91 spending package on a 6-1 vote.  </P> <P> Golberg noted that up to $120 million more will have to be made by the time a  final budget is adopted in late August if the governor's proposals to ease the  state's own financial problems are approved.  </P> <P> In finishing their chore of slicing $220 million -- more than 5% -- from a  tentative budget of just under $4 billion, the board chopped another $8 million  from individual school budgets. The amount each school will lose, along with  whether school community councils can help decide how to spend what is left,  will be decided later.  </P> <P> The board saved $6.8 million by requiring all non-teaching employees who work  11 or 12 months of the year to work five days less next year, resulting in pay  cuts of about 2%. The total pay loss will be as high as 15% for some of those  employees who were also affected in earlier rounds of budget-cutting.  </P> <P> The board took another $9.8 million from the already hard-hit district  administrative offices. Robert Booker, the district's chief business and  financial officer, said he believes that amount can be raised by having the  schools do a more aggressive job of improving student attendance. The state  pays districts based on how many students show up for class, so those with low  attendance rates lose money.  </P> <P> There will be an incentive plan to encourage schools to redouble attendance  efforts despite shrinking staff and other resources. If attendance can be  boosted, Booker told dubious board members, it is unlikely that more jobs will  be lost.  </P> <P> Board member Rita Walters was infuriated by a vote of a majority of board  members to set aside $500,000 to keep six principals from being replaced by  administrators with more seniority who will be demoted to save money. Of those  principals scheduled to be bumped, only those who will head up campuses that  are moving to school-based management will be spared. Under school-based  management, most decisions are made by groups at the school instead of district  headquarters.  </P> <P> "There is no fairness here!" burst out Walters, who felt the funds should have  gone toward saving the jobs of those workers "who, come Sunday (the start of  the fiscal year), are out on the street." Walters, who cast the only vote  against the budget, accused her colleagues of making policies that are  anti-black. Walters is the only black member of the board.  </P> <P> But it was a vote to add 21 more schools to the list of those getting  increasingly scarce integration funds that sparked the sharpest clash of the  long, tense day.  </P> <P> The schools are the latest in the increasingly minority district to reach a  point at which 70% of their students are Latino, black, Asian or other  non-Anglos, making them available for special funds to ease the harms of  segregation.  </P> <P> Walters objected that these schools, many of them in more affluent, suburban  neighborhoods, would take money away from inner-city "children who need it  most."  </P> <P> "I'm frankly sick of your making a racial issue out of everything," exclaimed  San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein, who said many of the 21  schools have large numbers of inner-city children bused in from crowded schools  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "People who don't know anything should keep their mouths shut," Walters shot  back.  </P> <P> In earlier rounds of budget cutting, the board saved nearly $1 million by  freezing the pay of its top 111 administrators, took $8 million in lottery  funds away from schools and increased some class sizes. It also eliminated the  district's staff of school physicians and sliced deeply into custodial,  maintenance and other services, including teacher training.  </P> <P> And in chopping $43 million and 634 jobs from district administration, the  board set in motion the bumping actions in which those in offices whose jobs  are cut are sent back to the schools, displacing principals and others with  less seniority.  </P> <P> The board allowed the layoffs to proceed after a last-ditch attempt to save  them met with a lukewarm reception. A coalition of black leaders and educators  on Monday called on all employees to donate 4% of their paychecks next year to  the district. But on Thursday just three employee groups stepped forward.  </P> <P> Two groups of administrators offered to make the donation if everyone else did,  and the union that represents about 5,000 office and technical workers said it  would consider doing so to save the 100 jobs lost in its own group.  </P></p>

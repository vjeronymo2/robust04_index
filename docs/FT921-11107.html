			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / BAe seeks orders from RAF for air combat missile BRITISH AEROSPACE, which is struggling for new contracts to sustain its guided weapons business, is trying to persuade the Ministry of Defence to buy an aircraft missile that has so far been developed as an export-only product. It hopes to take advantage of cost-cutting measures in the defence budget that have prevented the RAF from upgrading its Tornado F3 air-defence fighters to take the latest US Amraam (advanced medium-range air-to-air missile) weapons. Fitting Amraam would have required changes to the aircraft's radar system. BAe submitted an unsolicited bid on Friday to equip Tornado F3s instead with the Active Sky Flash, which it has been developing jointly with French defence electronics group Thomson-CSF. The RAF fighters at present carry an earlier version of the Sky Flash, which is developed from the US Sparrow missile. The new 'fire-and-forget' weapon will have an active radar seeker which allows the aircraft to make its getaway immediately after firing. BAe says development of the Active Sky Flash is three-quarters completed. The weapon, with a range of about 25 miles, would be cheaper than the Amraam or the French Mica missile and would be available within three years, it said. The company is awaiting a government decision on a contract for a close-range missile expected to be worth some Pounds 750m. BAe's advanced short-range air-to-air missile (Asraam), in which it is collaborating with Hughes of the US, is competing against an Anglo-French weapon proposed by GEC and Matra and an upgrade of the US Sidewinder.</p>

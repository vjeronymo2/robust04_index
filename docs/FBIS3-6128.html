The article says:    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed undying  ideological and theoretical exploits for human history of  thought by propounding great idea and theories with his rare  intelligence and scientific penetration.    It is the highest glory of the Korean people to have  acclaimed the great thinker and theoretician possessed of  extraordinary ideological and theoretical intelligence  unparalleled in the world.    The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as  saying:    "Comrade Kim Chong-il is exalting the chuche idea of our  party as the great guiding idea of the era of independence by  conducting ideological and theoretical activities with his  unusual pursuit and energy."    The article continues:    What is important in the idea and theories of Comrade Kim  Chong-il is that they are run through with uniqueness and  contemporariness. He makes all his ideological and theoretical  pursuits and thinking with innovative views and creative stand  on the basis of the requirements of the time which is changing  and developing.    The intelligence of the dear leader in making ideological  and  theoretical analysis and explanation in conformity with the time  and reality finds an expression in that he reviews the history  of the revolutionary ideas of the working class from the  viewpoint of the times and raises and evolves ideas and theories  in a unique way.    Notably, he expounded from a new angle that the  revolutionary  idea of the great Comrade Kim Il-song is composed of the  man-centred philosophical world outlook, the revolutionary  theory centred on the popular masses and the method of mass  leadership. This is, indeed, a unique discovery.    When the imperialists were vociferating about the "end of  socialism", the dear leader clearly indicated the strategy and  tactics to frustrate the anti-socialist moves, defend the  socialist cause and carry it through to accomplishment. This is  an incomparable exploit he has performed for mankind.    As long as there is the idea and theories of the dear leader  characteristic of creation and innovation, the Korean people  will advance along the road of victory and accomplish the cause  of socialism without any turns and twists, no matter how the  situation and the circumstances and conditions of the revolution  may change.    An important characteristic of Comrade Kim Chong-il's idea  and theories is that they are run through with most profound  pursuit and analysis, rich and diverse contents and are strongly  expressive of clairvoyant ideological and theoretical  intelligence and scientific foresight.    The capacity of pursuit and analysis of Comrade Kim Chong-il  is really extraordinary and distinguished. Deeply penetrating  thinking, pursuit of discovering new truth by comparing,  analysing, reasoning and combining problems and the perfection  and plainness of easy-to-understand logics -- these are the  ideological and theoretical gifts of the dear leader.    He gives many clear-cut ideological and theoretical answers  with rich and deep knowledge about the work of the party and  people's power, the work of working people's organisations and  defence building, industry and agriculture, construction and  other domains, philosophy, political economy, history,  literature and all other spheres.    He has extraordinary intelligence and far-sightness looking  farther ahead than any other and indicating the road of victory.    He looks forward to a distant future from the present-day  situation and the trend of the developing revolution, count ten  and a hundred out of one practical fact and set forth a correct  idea and theory.    The rare clairvoyance of the dear leader is always accurate  and most correct because it is based on a scientific penetration  relying upon the aspirations of the popular masses and the law  governing social development.    Comrade Kim Chong-il is not only possessed of gifted  ideological and theoretical intelligence and quality but also  has conducted tireless ideological and theoretical activities.    His rare intelligence and energetic ideological and  theoretical activities have brought a great reality,  demonstrating an invincible vitality in the accomplishment of  the cause of socialism.    Korea has been able to successfully build socialism centred  on the popular masses, going through rough storms of the  revolution because the dear leader comprehensively systematized  the chuche idea and developed it in depth in conformity with the  developing reality and glorified it as the great guiding idea of  the era of independence and has armed the people firmly with it.</p>

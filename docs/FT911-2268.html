			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Letter: Chocolate link Sir, If I understand Anthony Harris correctly ('Lesson from the indexed decade', April 29) - which for an ordinary mortal is by no means easy - he likes plain chocolate and dislikes index-linked bonds. I bought Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 1992 at Pounds 94 in 1987. Today they stand at nearly Pounds 128, a potential tax-free gain of 36 per cent. The 2 1/2 per cent 2001 I bought in 1988 shows a (tax-free) gain of about 25 per cent. No other stock (or share) has done as well for me. By the way, I like both milk and plain chocolate. Perhaps that is why I do not follow what Mr Harris is on about. EG Gobert, 3 Beechwood Drive, Marlow, Bucks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sources in Washington believe that U.S. Secretary  of State Christopher's willingness to mediate between Israel and  Syria practically ends the previous modus operandi for  negotiations in Washington between December 1991 and the Hebron  massacre [in February 1994].    An Israeli source in Washington has said that, in the peace  package offered to Syria, Israel did not promise a full  withdrawal, nor did it offer a withdrawal from Majdal Shams  first. The terms the Syrians used in their reaction to the  Israeli proposal contained more concrete terms than in the past  regarding the definition of peace and normalization. The  Syrians have gone from using general terms such as  demilitarization to using numbers, according to the source.</p>

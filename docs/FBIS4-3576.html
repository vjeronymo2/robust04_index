			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Pingjun: "Marriages Threatened by Rise in Divorce </F> Rate"]    [Text] The love which is shared in over 95 percent of  Beijing marriages is being endangered by domestic violence and  rising divorce rates.    Divorce rates hit an estimated 19 percent last year.    And one in five husbands beat up their wives, according to  the Beijing Society of Research on Marriage and Family.    However, home is where the heart is and more than 90 percent  of married couples said they were basically happy with each  other.    The city-wide survey of more than 2,100 families also  revealed that by and large Chinese husbands take the lead when  it comes to sex and leave the household chores to their wives.    Divorce rates in Beijing have climbed from 15.2 percent in  1990.    They went up to 16.5 percent in 1991, 17.7 percent in 1992  and about 19 percent in 1993, according to the society.    Violence in the home wasn't just limited to the male of the  species. Over 15 percent of wives beat up their husbands,  according to the survey, which was led by Li Yinhe of the  Sociology Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.    But women's leader, Shang Languo, said that male victims of  domestic violence could not be compared with battered wives.    "For the women it may be self defence. The wife has to fight  back when being attacked by her husband," said Shang, deputy  director of the Women's Rights Protection Department. "And then  there's the question of physical differences, women are usually  smaller than men, battered husbands will probably suffer less  than abused wives," said domestic violence expert Shang, who  works under the auspices of Beijing's Women's Federation.    The survey revealed that 1 percent of husbands beat their  wives very often.    Most of the violence was reported in the homes of  ill-educated, working class, young couples, according to Li  Yinhe.    Beijingers generally regard men and women as equals in the  home, the survey said.    More than 80 percent of spouses believe they enjoy equal  relations with their mates.    And when it comes to sex inequality, it is women who rule  the  roost, with almost 10 percent of husbands reporting domineering  wives.    The husbands still take the lead in bed, only 3.2 percent of  wives initiate sex, the survey found.    And actions speak louder than words, perhaps, for 88 percent  of respondents said it was acceptable for female mates to ask  for sex.    Wives who take charge or have a say in sex are generally  from  the younger generation born after 1950.    But, despite all the marital problems revealed by the  survey,  Li said that most modern marriages in the city are good.    Spouses from 92 percent of homes are thoughtful and  understanding towards each other, said Li, a permanent director  at the family research society.</p>

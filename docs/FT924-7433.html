			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Japanese search for clues to life with Clinton: The generation change at the top of US politics is unsettling Tokyo FOR THE PAST week a team of 20 top officials from Japan's Ministry of Finance has been hard at work in Washington seeking clues about what a Clinton presidency could mean for Japan. Although the answer will remain unclear for months, Japanese concerns are already crystallising. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the leader of one of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's factions remarked: 'There must be change. This was the first post cold war election in the US. One of the main theme's was a desire for change.' Professor Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at the University of Tokyo identified the common Japanese concern: that change will be in the direction of toughness. He said: 'The Clinton team will be tough, they will be tough on themselves demanding more from the US economy but tough on us as well.' What is unsettling for Japan is not just that there will be a shift from Republican to Democrat in the White House. Even more significant for many Japanese is the change of generations at the top of US politics. The 46-year old Mr Clinton has no memory of Japan as a vulnerable, war ravaged, nation which became a bulwark of American anti-communist policy in Asia. He knows Japan only as a strong economy. Since the mid-1950s the two elements of the relationship have balanced one another. The strategic, political relationship was designed to contain communism in Asia. The strength of that alliance soothed the economic and commercial tensions which have accompanied the growth of Japan's trade surplus and its economic power. Trade disputes were never allowed to jeopardise the basic anti-communist alliance. Mr Clinton will find the balance between the strategic and economic aspects of the relationship fundamentally unsettled. Japan's growing trade surplus did not play a large role in the US presidential campaign. But trade tensions are unlikely to subside, especially if the US economic recovery continues to be weak. According to a senior US diplomat in Tokyo: 'A new administration will almost certainly have to have another go at the trade issue. We have learned the only thing that works is long hard pressure.' Not only do many Japanese expect Mr Clinton to press for further measures to open the Japanese market. They also believe trade politics will become more complicated. An agreement between the US and Europe on farm trade would quickly swing the spotlight on to Japan's willingness to open up its rice market. The US commitment to the North American Free Trade Agreement has alarmed many Japanese exporters. China may also become a divisive issue with Japan. Mr Michael Armacost, US Ambassador to Tokyo says 'China could be a testing ground for a US policy of tying aid to human and civil rights.' If the US did impose restrictions on aid and trade with China, it might not look kindly upon Japan's increasingly close trade ties with China. The Japanese Emperor's recent visit to China, preceded by a stream of Japanese politicians and business leaders, was a subtle but significant signal of a more independent Japanese policy. Japan may be prepared to maintain this independence. Senior Tokyo trade officials say there is little sense in talking of human rights without fostering China's economic development. Mr Mitsuzuka suggests human rights are more important in a multiracial society such as the US than in ethnically homogenous societies such as China and Japan. Approaches to Russia may also become more divisive if the US insists that Japan carries more of the aid burden. The US in the past three years has committed Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.2bn) to the former Soviet Union. About 65 per cent has been disbursed. Japan has committed Dollars 2.7bn most of it in the form of trade credits to Japanese companies. Most has not been disbursed. The funds which have been disbursed have gone to the Russian Far East which hosts 3 per cent of the Russian population and 80 per cent of its raw materials. Japan insists it cannot offer more aid until the dispute with Russia over the four Northern Territory islands is settled. There is no prospect of a rupture. According to Mr Yukio Sato, director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' North American bureau, the US still defines Japan's foreign policy choices: 'Some people say we could go back to Asia if relations with the US turned sour. But no Asian nation would welcome a Japan which had a bad relationship with the US.' But Professor Robert Scalapino, an Asian expert at the University of California, warns that the two countries must put their relationship on a new basis. To stick to old policies was impossible in the light of the current changes. It was time for the US to adopt fresh Asian policies. Even the most imaginative innovator would be hard pressed to come up with something as potent as the cold war to bind the two together. Pragmatism and practicality rather than strategic vision are more likely to characterise the relationship in the Clinton years. As Mr Mitsuzuka puts it with resigned realism: 'Even if we are divorced we can still live under the same roof.'</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: The Government Inspector - Greenwich Theatre A crooked red revolve topped by onion domes and flanked by the paraphernalia of country life, including a barely visible stuffed ram, provides the setting for this classic of the Russian stage in a rambustious new translation by Ronald Eyre. The ram is among equals, for Gogol's satire is about the stuffed sheep of local government; and here they are, in their Anglicised incarnations, with goatees and cheek puffs, quivering moustaches and great bristling beards to signify the rank, age and dignity of petty officialdom. The Englishness of Matthew Francis' production extends beyond the characterisation of this grubby local squirarchy to the character of the comedy in which they are involved. For all their hypocrisy and corruption, they are drawn with an affection for the stereotypes they represent. Arthur Cox's apoplectic judge and Patrick O'Connell's mayor are awful, but we feel safe with them; while Michael Burrell's timid, balaclava-clad schools superintendent would pass muster for a Shakespearean mechanical, and Frank Moorey's bulbous charity commissioner is a dead ringer for Mr Bumble the beadle, from Oliver. They are comic enough in the early whirlwind of conniving and kowtowing but the play tries to push them further than their constitutions permit them to go. When their stupidity has been revealed, and the mayor steps forward to implicate his audience, there is no frisson of recognition, no fidgeting in seats, because there is none of the cruelty that the satire demands. Even the incursion of the wronged populace, in a nightmarish apparition to the opportunistic Khlestakov, fails to make the leap. The result is to pull the sting from the tale, leaving an empty space where the phony inspector has been, and making the announcement of the real inspector's arrival - by a state servant in gleaming Czarist gold  - a mere textual formality. Matthew Francis' production lives through the performances of Timothy Spall and Bob Goody as Khlestakov and his servant Osip, a beaky scrimbleshanks of misdirected loyalty. Spall, particularly, is on cracking form as a little Lord Fauntleroy gone to seed who stamps a chubby foot and crinkles a piggy snout as he fights to rescue his dignity from a greasy strand of hair, the relic of some foppish haircut, which is forever flopping forward over his face. The spectacle of Khlestakov succumbing to his host's hospitality is a moment of inspired farce from an actor of vibrant originality. He does so with a physical abandon that leaves him flapping drunkenly on the floor like a great bloated cockroach helplessly stranded on its back, while the assembled worthies look on in appalled admiration. For this scene alone I would cross London.</p>

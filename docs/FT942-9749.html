			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow moves in line with bonds for third day Wall Street For the third consecutive day, US share prices moved in step with the bond market yesterday, rising across the board after Treasury prices had rallied on news of an unexpected decline in producer price inflation, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.80 up at 3,652.84 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.26 at 443.75, while the Nasdaq composite put on 2.61 at 719.61. New York SE volume was 272.8m shares. Every day so far this week, the stock market has taken its lead from bonds, yesterday being no exception. After Wednesday's fall, equities rose from the opening as investors were cheered by a big rally in the Treasury market. The benchmark 30-year bond climbed by more than a point, lowering its yield to under 7.5 per cent, after the government announced an unexpected 0.1 per cent decline in the producer prices index during April. Analysts had been expecting last month's PPI to register a rise of 0.2 per cent. Bond prices were also buoyed by a 0.8 per cent fall in April retail sales. Although share prices later followed bonds down from their early highs, the drop in long-term interest rates and the good news on inflation ensured that stocks remained firmly in positive territory throughout the day. There was even some hope that the inflation figures would persuade the Federal Reserve that when it next tightens monetary policy, it should raise interest rates by only 25 basis points, and not by the 50 basis points that most economists are forecasting. Philip Morris jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 1/2 in volume of 5.5m shares amid renewed speculation that it would soon split its tobacco and food businesses. Allied Signal advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 in busy trading after the company said it had signed an agreement to purchase the Textron group's Lycoming Turbine Engine division for Dollars 375m in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. The news lifted Textron Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 as traders forecast that the company would use some of the proceeds from the sale to buy back stock. Margaretten Financial rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 24 5/8 in volume of 3.2m shares on news that the home mortgage banking company is to be acquired by Chemical Banking for Dollars 330m in cash. Chemical firmed early on but ended unchanged at Dollars 34 3/8 . Gap Stores rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 1/4 on reporting a 53 per cent first-quarter profits increase to Dollars 63.5m. Another retailer, Land's End, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 1/8 on disappointing earnings. Canada Investors, rocked by the recent bond-driven rollercoaster ride, continued to cling to the sidelines and Toronto closed mixed after light trading. The TSE 300 index slipped 5.7 to 4,162.5 and falls led rises by 419 to 321 after volume of 52.9m shares valued at CDollars 509.4m. But eight of the 14 sub-indices finished higher, led by transportation, up 1.9 per cent. The conglomerates group had the day's biggest fall, 2.0 per cent.</p>

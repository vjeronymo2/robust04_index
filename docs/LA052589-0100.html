			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Chicago Sun-Times has dropped a gossip columnist who reported a rumor  involving television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. Columnist Ann Gerber's  column was discontinued over "basic differences" with Kenneth Towers, vice  president and executive editor, "involving the journalistic standards used in  producing her column," the newspaper said Tuesday night. Gerber's "On the Town"  column was run on a free-lance basis. This month she reported a rumor that  Winfrey had returned home unexpectedly and caught her boyfriend in a tryst with  her hairdresser. Winfrey issued a strongly worded denial on her nationally  syndicated show. Gerber reportedly said in a subsequent television interview  that she had no confirmation for the rumor but ran the item because it was  being talked about. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

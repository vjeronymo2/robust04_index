			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by Keiji Urakami] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- A multilateral trade body  that will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) is expected to exercise more enforcing power as a  policeman to crack down on global protectionism.    The World Trade Organization (WTO) will be formed next  January at the earliest as a new multilateral trade framework in  place of the 46-year-old GATT. The WTO was adopted Friday [15  April] by more than 120 GATT countries during their Marrakech  ministerial conference.    When dispute settlement efforts between two countries go out  of control, the WTO will step in, seeking a solution basically  on the basis of consensus, the same dispute settlement mechanism  as employed under GATT.    But procedures used by the WTO provide stronger and clearer  rules for a wide range of trade areas that will newly include  services and intellectual property rights in line with the  just-signed final accord of the Uruguay Round of the  multilateral trade talks.    The biggest difference with the system under GATT is that  the  WTO rules will be enforced by a judicial mechanism that will no  longer allow countries to block findings against them.    Under the so-called "negative consensus system," findings  prepared by a dispute settlement panel will be automatically  formalized unless there is a unanimous consensus to reject them,  meaning that only a single vote in favor of a finding is needed  for the WTO to adopt it.    The new mechanism is designed to answer increasing  frustrations by trading countries about the GATT system in which  one member can deny a panel recommendation.    Under the new system, countries which fail to comply with  panel recommendations will face trade sanctions under strict  time limits.    The new trade framework's strong spirit against global  protectionism is well reflected in part of the Marrakech  Declaration that confirmed a "determination to resist  protectionist pressures of all kinds."    The United States has officially supported the new dispute  settlement mechanism under the WTO, with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor recently saying, "the new system...  will work and it will work fast."    But countries like Japan, which has often come under the  threat of trade sanctions, want the mechanism to work as a  deterrent against Washington's inclination to resort to  unilateral and retaliatory trade measures such as the recently  reinstated "Super 301" trade clause.    Ministers from Malaysia, India, Thailand and other countries  joined Japan's stance in ministerial speeches made during the  four- day Marrakech conference that began Tuesday.    Ministers from the countries blasted a growing unilateral  approach among superpowers as a tool to settle trade rows,  describing the stance as destabilizing the world trade order.    A barrage of such criticism was made in an apparent  reference  to Washington, which has appeared to be threatening to use  retaliatory weapons in its intellectual property trade with  Asian countries.    Although supporting the overall mechanism under the WTO,  Kantor said action under Washington's domestic trade provisions  such as Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act would not be affected  by the WTO rules.</p>

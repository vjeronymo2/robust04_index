			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Japan (52): Man who burst the bubble - Profile / Yasushi Mieno Few individuals have played a more central role in the industrialised world's harsh transition from the boom years of the 1980s to the sluggish 1990s than the outgoing governor of Japan's central bank, Yasushi Mieno. Mr Mieno's five-year term, which expires on December 16, has been perhaps the most challenging of any in the 120-year history of the Bank of Japan. His tenure began at the tail-end of the extraordinary explosion in Japanese asset prices that came to be called the 'Bubble Era'. It ends as the country emerges from its longest post-war recession, a recession induced by a monetary policy designed to burst the bubble. That policy, over which Mr Mieno presided, earned him the opprobrium of many in Japanese business and politics, but they marked an important stage in the bank's development in gaining for itself greater freedom over its actions, not just from the iron grip of the ministry of finance, but from the demands of international economic policy. Mr Mieno's curriculum vitae suggests a life as the model central banker. His working life has been spent at the Bank of Japan, including a stint in New York, and a period managing one of the bank's regional branches. It culminated in his elevation to the governorship in 1989. But behind the usual central banker's stony countenance and tortuous syntax, lies a more complex and colourful character. Born in 1924, Mr Mieno moved to Manchuria at an early age when his father was transferred to the Manchuria Railroad Corporation. When his family returned to Japan during the war, the young son worked as a soap, butter and clothing trader to support them. He won a place at the prestigious Tokyo University and, armed with a law degree, joined the Bank of Japan in 1947. His ascent was steady - 42 years through all the bank's main departments. His inheritance on assuming the governorship in 1989 could hardly have been more troubled. The economy was overheating, asset prices were soaring and Mr Mieno immediately applied the brakes. Within weeks of his taking office the BoJ raised interest rates by half a percentage point, a move that provoked a damaging row with the ministry of finance over the direction of monetary policy. The new governor was anxious to correct what many in the bank perceived to be the errors of his predecessor in loosening policy too far. The MoF, concerned about the fallout in the financial markets, resisted Mr Mieno's pressure for an immediate interest rate increase, but gave way, sanctioning two further increases in rates over the next eight months. The effects were startling. The Nikkei 225 Index, which had ballooned to a peak of nearly 39,000 the month Mr Mieno took office, dropped like a stone, falling by more than 60 per cent in the next four years. Land prices in Tokyo fell by two-thirds in the same period. While Mr Mieno may have been delighted at the dramatic success of his bubble-bursting policy, the damage done to the real economy was also unprecedented. Output entered a four-year recession that is only just ending, the worst in the nation's postwar history. Though the monetary siege was lifted relatively quickly, with rapid cuts in interest rates beginning in 1991, the economy and financial markets continued to plunge and criticism of Mr Mieno increased. Despite the loosening of policy - the official discount rate was cut to a record low last September - the economy only began a painfully slow recovery this year, an upturn that remains weak and uncertain. Yet, Mr Mieno maintains the harsh medicine was vital to restoring Japan's long-term prospects and is unapologetic. Despite the pain inflicted on the country, his term of office saw the stature of the bank, vis-a-vis its more senior partner, the ministry of finance, rise sharply, as it grew in independence. More important, Mr Mieno's term of office has represented a fundamental shift in the priorities of Japanese economic policy. Japan's emergence in the 1970s and 1980s as the world's second economic power brought with it at home the perception of global economic responsibilities that many policy-makers felt had to be fulfilled. Most notably, many Japanese politicians and bureaucrats believed that the country's principal responsibility was to operate its economic policies within a framework of international co-operation. This view reached its apotheosis with the Louvre and Plaza accords of the mid-1980s, when Japanese policy makers bowed to the demands of the US Treasury and Federal Reserve and agreed to establish a domestic policy framework consistent with the needs of the dollar. In consequence, Japanese monetary policy shifted back and forth in line with the gyrations of the US currency. Mr Mieno represents a very different school of thought that argues that, while international monetary co-operation is desirable, it should remain secondary to domestic monetary considerations. If it is in the best interests of the Japanese economy to cut interest rates, then cut rates. But under Mr Mieno they have not been cut to meet broader global demands based on exchange rate movements and trade flows. The consequences of this view were most powerfully on display this year, when Mr Mieno refused to cut Japanese interest rates to prevent the yen rising against the dollar. He repeatedly argued that Japanese monetary policy was sufficiently relaxed for Japanese domestic considerations - a further cut in interest rates was not in Japan's own interests. That view, which also says that, in the longer run, when countries follow policies that are first in their own interests they benefit the world economy, now holds sway not just in Japanese economic policy, but in many countries. It owes much to the economic philosophy of Mr Mieno.</p>

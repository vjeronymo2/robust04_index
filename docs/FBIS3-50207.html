			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 19 January (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime  Minister Peter Boross today assessed his talks with leaders of  the biggest parliamentary parties and the chairman of the  National Democratic Federation (NDSZ) over the past three days.  Meeting with a small group of reporters, Boross recalled the  promise he made just after the elections: That he would consult  with the political parties which have appropriate political  weight.    Giving the reasons for his meeting with the NDSZ chairman,  Boross said that although Imre Pozsgay voiced opposition in the  parliamentary debate over the foundation of the new cabinet, he  kept the country's stability in view and thus accepted the new  prime minister and the program of his cabinet. Boross said he  had not intended to hold discussions with every party  represented in Parliament, but, if need be, he would consider  their opinions.    The prime minister informed his negotiating partners that  early last week, in the Prague summit between the Visegrad four  and U.S. President Bill Clinton, he mentioned Hungary's  difficulties with regard to the UN embargo on Yugoslavia. He  said the embargo had so far caused an almost unbearable damage  of $1.3 billion to Hungary. The prime minister stressed that  although Hungary would continue to observe the embargo, those  concerned should in any case take steps to counterbalance its  losses. It was emphasized in the talks that Hungary was pinning  great hopes upon the conference on East European economies which  was announced by President Clinton.    The various sides discussed how soon before the elections  Parliament should suspend its operation. The prime minister  said he feels that Parliament should operate until mid-April.  Although there is no deadline for passing any law, parliament  needs to approve about 10 important bills, including those on  land, police, and the export-import bank, he said.    Boross confirmed that the government will submit a media  bill  to Parliament on February 7 at the latest. After that, the  government will be prepared to coordinate with all parliamentary  parties. He stressed that he would not propose any personnel  changes in the management of Hungarian Radio and Television  before the elections. The prime minister rejected opposition  party leaders' recommendation that the government should not  pass resolutions with long-term effects before the elections.  "The cabinet is functioning without restraining itself because  it has a full mandate. Nevertheless, we consider it our duty to  inform the major parliamentary parties on long-term economic  commitments," Boross said.    The prime minister said he would inform the president of the  republic in a letter about proposals for the date of the  elections. "Under the Constitution, it falls upon the president  to decide on the date," Boross said.</p>

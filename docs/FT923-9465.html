			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Utd Distillers extends Greek distribution deal J BOUTARI, the largest Greek wine producer, is extending a successful joint venture agreement in marketing and distribution with United Distillers, the British spirits company. Under a new agreement with a 20-year duration, the companies each hold a 50 per cent stake in United Distillers Boutari, the joint venture. UDB was set up in 1989 under a three-year agreement by which Boutari distributed the British company's products in Greece. UDB's sales rose from Dr2.6bn (Dollars 14m) in 1989 to Dr8.9bn in 1991, reflecting rapid growth in consumption of imported spirits, partly at the expense of traditional Greek wines and aperitifs. Pre-tax profits rose from Dr408m to Dr1.6bn over the same period. Under the new agreement, UDB will market both Boutari wines and United Distillers products through the Boutari network in mainland Greece and the Aegean islands. United Distillers is to provide Boutari with a cash injection, reportedly amounting to Dr7bn, out of its share of UDB's future earnings.</p>

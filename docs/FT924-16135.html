			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Danes seek additions to treaty MR Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, last night advanced his ideas for introducing a legally binding supplement to the Maastricht treaty to help overcome the Danish electorate's objections. Mr Schluter wound up two hours of talks with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, with both sides voicing satisfaction at the outcome. Mr Major said the talks had come up with ideas to make acceptable those parts of the treaty shown to have caused concern. Denmark is trying to come to a new understanding over the Maastricht document. Mr Schluter, accompanied by Mr Offe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, earlier said he saw much 'common ground' between Denmark and the rest of the Community in his request for more openness and less bureaucracy in EC decision-making. Denmark is putting forward proposals for additions to the treaty in a white paper to be published on or around October 12. Denmark will put the Maastricht treaty, with the additional supplements, to the electorate in a second referendum next year.</p>

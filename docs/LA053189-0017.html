			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: 7 DWARF PERSONALITIES SHARE WRITING DUTIES  </P> <P> Sometimes I am seized by this terrible fear that anything I write will either  hurt somebody, offend somebody or, worse yet, bore somebody. As Joan Didion  said, "Writers are always selling somebody out." I know it's true, but I can't  decide which is worse -- mean-o-phobia or yawn-o-phobia.  </P> <P> The problem is compounded by the fact that I am a multiple personality. At last  count, astute reader-therapists have identified at least seven distinct  characters in my columns -- Jokey, Nasty, Softy, Lefty, Righty, Sunny and Joan  Didiony.  </P> <P> It gets so confusing that I've thought of joining a selves-help group.  Compounding the problem is the fact that each personality has her own  supporters. Take this letter that recently arrived for one of the seven faces  of me.  </P> <P> Dear Alice: I am a big fan of yours. Please don't lose your edge. I have two  words of advice for you: get cruel.  </P> <P>  -- MARK  </P> <P> I answered him as best I could:  </P> <P> Dear Mark: Thanks for your kind letter. Get cruel, huh? OK, drop dead.  </P> <P>  -- ALICE  </P> <P> Occasionally, some readers will fall for Sunny and then get mad when Sunny  turns blue and begins to beget Nasty. Recently, I got two letters attacking me  for making fun of two notoriously unsacred bulls. How dare I laugh at Donald  ("the nicest person I ever met") Trump, one reader complained. Another reader  went even further:  </P> <P> Dear Alice: I can't believe what you said about Richard Nixon. If you don't  have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  </P> <P>  -- TRISHA  </P> <P> Well, pinch me, but am I the first person to crack a Nixon joke? The truth is  this: No, I don't have anything nice to say about Richard M. Nixon. And I will  defend to the death my right not to say it.  </P> <P> Some people tell me they like only my "serious" columns. Others like me only  when I'm politically correct/left. One woman came up to me on the street and  said, "I saw you on TV and you said something that didn't sound liberal and I  was wondering what was with you."  </P> <P> "Oh, it must have been the editing," I said. "You know how these TV shows just  want a sound bite. They must've cut out the part where I said, 'Let's  expropriate all private property. . . .' "  </P> <P> All this factionalism is making it hard for me to work. I start out the same  way every morning. While I'm putting on my baggy pants and T-shirt, I imagine  I'm a samurai putting on my warrior clothes. Or maybe a priest laying out my  vestments.  </P> <P> Then, as I'm eating my Shredded Wheat and banana and drinking my coffee, I  imagine that I'm bowing and praying for courage before the god or gods of my  choice.  </P> <P> I face my word processor like a gladiator. I'm off to do battle.  </P> <P> Someone in the crowd yells, "Nasty!"  </P> <P> Someone else yells, "Sunny!"  </P> <P> (No one says a word about Cher.)  </P> <P> A guy in left field screams, "Social responsibility!"  </P> <P> My friend Judy pleads, "Don't quote me!"  </P> <P> And I tell myself that I have made a solemn, sacred covenant with the readers.  I will try to the utmost of my ability not to bore you, and you will try to the  utmost of your ability to get to the end of my column.  </P> <P> And when we get to the end, we never know who we will find there. Today, it  appears to be Lady Liberty, the self that treasures freedom. Not just that I am  free to be you and me but that people everywhere just gotta be free. From  columnists to communists, from Berkeley to Beijing.  </P> <P> So today we salute Richard Nixon, the man who brought democracy to China. I say  this knowing that I'm selling out several of my selves. But there's plenty more  where they come from.  </P></p>

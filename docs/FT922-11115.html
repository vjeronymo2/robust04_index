			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Phones with a view to profit from vision: A range of videophones is being launched on to business and household markets. Michiyo Nakamoto examines their prospects When the phone rings do you tend to be slouched in your seat, or leaning back with your feet on the desk? Are you a round-the-clock businessman who regularly keeps in touch with contacts while soaking in the bathtub? If so, you may want to rethink your telecommunications habits. The next phone you buy could be a videophone, capable of sending colour pictures of you, bath bubbles and all, down the wire. In the US, Japan, Britain, France and other leading industrialised countries, companies are introducing a range of videophones to offices and homes, from high-priced machines connected to personal computers to affordable models for home use. AT&amp;T, the American telecommunications giant, is launching a Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 850) videophone for homes next month in the US. Matra, the French maker of telephone sets, has been selling videophones in France since last autumn, while Hitachi recently launched several models in Japan. In the UK, GEC-Marconi is licensing its technology to BT and Amstrad, which plan to bring out a range of videophones later this year. BT, in collaboration with IBM, the US computer group, has developed an electronic card to enable IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers to be turned into videophones. The cards, which are inserted into the computers, will be launched early next year. 'A whole new era of visual communications is here,' says Mr Mike Zeaman, of AT&amp;T Consumer Products in the US. He claims the videophone will open up numerous possibilities for new uses of the phone at home and in the office. Deaf people, for example, will be able to communicate by telephone for the first time. The practical benefits to businesses are enormous, says Mr Tony Fish, marketing engineer at GEC-Marconi Electronics. He believes the videophone will help companies save on travelling costs and time by making it easier to take decisions over the phone. 'There is a lot of research evidence that shows people will not make decisions over the phone,' he says. They prefer to have face-to-face contact. It will also be far easier to communicate information that requires visual description - graphics in a brochure, new company logos - over the phone. Although there are obvious benefits to visual communication, the development of videophones was originally held back by the technology. A number of phones capable of sending images has appeared on and off the market since AT&amp;T introduced its first Picturephone in 1964, but the problems of transmitting visual information down a phone line meant that early Picturephones could send only still, black and white pictures. However, companies including AT&amp;T in the US and GEC-Marconi in the UK, which have been working on the technology for many years, are now able to send between two and 10 colour picture frames a second down a regular phone line to produce moving colour images at the other end. The result is colour video in slow motion, reminiscent of the TV broadcasts of the first astronauts on the moon. But manufacturers believe the image quality will be acceptable to most consumers if the price is kept reasonably low. BT plans to sell its residential unit, made by GEC-Marconi, for Pounds 399. Another breakthrough is the recent adoption of an international standard for digital videophones. This allows digital videophones of different makes to communicate. The absence of an internationally agreed standard meant that a BT videophone, for example, could not talk to an AT&amp;T model. Manufacturers expect the adoption of the standard to spur demand among businesses, just as the agreement of an international standard for faxes in 1984 triggered widespread demand among corporations for fax machines. Another sign that the industrialised world is ready for videotelephones, say manufacturers, is the growing use in corporations of videoconferencing - an expensive and larger scale system of visual communications. 'Our experience with videoconferencing shows us that people really take to it,' says Mr Jim Barron, public relations manager for visual services at BT. People have become accustomed to being videoed so they are less shy in front of the camera and more aware of its benefits. Last year, says Mr Barron, BT doubled its turnover from videoconferencing sales. Since the videophone enables groups of people to talk to each other, it is also a much more flexible communication tool than the conventional telephone. Yet, in spite of the advantages, Mr Goldman expects the market for videophones to grow slowly over the next few years, because it will take time to build up an installed base of users. For home use, one big obstacle is the lack of compatibility of different manufacturers' products. Unlike digital videophones, residential machines are based on an analogue system, for which no international standard has been agreed. Analogue videophones made by different manufacturers, therefore, cannot speak to each other. So far there are no moves to establish such a standard for analogue phones. Manufacturers, such as GEC-Marconi, are hoping that dominance in the marketplace will establish their own system as the de facto standard. Image quality will also deter some people. Although the latest videophones can send and receive moving colour pictures, only a limited amount of information can be transmitted through regular phone lines, so the picture quality is far below that of television. But the greatest deterrent could still be consumer resistance. For all the people who are thrilled by the idea of seeing friends and relatives on the phone, there will be many who dread going on show each time the phone rings. Few people will relish the thought of a face-to-face confrontation with telemarketers. And many will be concerned that it will not be as easy to tell a casual lie - about not coming in to work, for example - over the phone. To overcome the problem of privacy, BT has included a special button, which the receiver of a call has to press to open the camera lens. So if the phone rings while you are taking a bath, you can answer without fear of exposure. Whether or not such a precaution is enough to placate the sceptics, the manufacturers are convinced that the market is set to take off. In Japan, Hitachi has sold more than 100 units at a price of Y950,000 (Dollars 7,140) each since announcing its videophone early last year. Frost &amp; Sullivan, a market research company, forecasts that the worldwide market for visual communications will be in the region of Dollars 3bn a year by 1995. 'It is often pointed out that 60 per cent of a message is communicated through non-verbal cues,' says BT's Mr Barron. 'That is what makes us think videotelephony is going to be very, very big.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VIDEOPHONE: THE NEXT STEP IN COMMUNICATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- European market for videoconferencing          1990     Dollars 65.44m   estimate          1995    Dollars 296.00m*  forecast US market for videoconferencing          1990       Dollars 894m          1995      Dollars 8.3bn   forecast Number of installed videoconferencing units in US          1990              4,660          1995            161,199   forecast  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Frost &amp; Sullivan              * includes audioconferencing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Wellcome announces share issue timetable WELLCOME GROUP, the British pharmaceutical company, will publish on June 4 the prospectus for its planned share issue. The issue, expected to be the largest by any privately-owned British company, will be launched in mid-July. The timetable was agreed late last week by the board of Wellcome Group. There had been suggestions the issue would be delayed until September, but managers are anxious that preparations for the launch should not distract them from running the business. Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of Wellcome Group, was given permission last month by the Charity Commission to sell up to 417m shares, reducing its holding in the company to as little as 25 per cent. The issue could raise more than Pounds 4bn. The prospectus is likely to highlight the strength of Wellcome's research and the encouraging prospects for its two top-selling anti-virus drugs, Zovirax, which is used to treat herpes, and Retrovir, the Aids treatment. Wellcome executives are in the final stages of negotiation with two or possibly three groups to set up co-marketing agreements for over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription products. In particular, Wellcome is anxious to develop the OTC market for Zovirax when its patents begin to expire in the mid-1990s.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK upturn continues despite fall in March production British manufacturing output dropped slightly in March after two months of strong growth, surprising economists who had expected a rise in production, and highlighting the uneven nature of the UK recovery. But in spite of this monthly dip, official figures for the first three months of 1994 showed that British business recorded its largest rise in manufacturing output for five years, indicating that economic recovery continues. Output in March was 0.5 per cent lower than February, seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office showed yesterday. This compares with rises of 0.4 per cent in February and nearly 1.5 per cent in January, and was markedly lower than market expectations of a monthly gain of about 0.3 per cent for March. The main reason for the fall was the failure of the food, drink, tobacco and engineering sectors to sustain their production surges recorded in the first two months of the year. But monthly production figures are volatile, and officials insisted that the quarterly figures provide a better guide to the trend. These showed that manufacturing output rose by 1.4 per cent during the first three months compared with the final quarter of last year - the fastest growth since March 1989 during the economic boom. Last night, Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, suggested that Britain's economic recovery was becoming 'more robust and broadly-based' than the consumption-led growth that had characterised the past two years. 'There are now hopeful signs that, as tax increases act to moderate the growth of consumer spending, the company sector - which has enjoyed rising profitability and an increasing financial surplus - will now increase its investment spending,' he told the annual dinner of British factors and discounters. Britain's trade should also 'begin to benefit from the emerging recovery on the continent', he added. Mr George's upbeat analysis was yesterday echoed in two new business studies, which showed companies across the country reporting increased business activity. The latest regional survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a consultancy, said businesses in all UK regions have booked increased orders over the past four months - again for the first time since 1989. An opinion survey by the Institute of Directors shows that 70 per cent of directors during March and April reported increased volumes of business, up from 61 per cent during the previous two months. But as a sign of the uneven pace of recovery, directors have become less optimistic about the prospects for the UK economy, mainly because of concern about UK political instability. Nearly a quarter blamed this for falling confidence - while only 9 per cent cited April's taxes. Brussels puts UK behind on growth, Page 3 Details, Page 10</p>

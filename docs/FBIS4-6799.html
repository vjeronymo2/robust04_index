			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "NATO's Insufficient Action"] </F>   [Text] NATO has again adopted a tough stand on the Serbs.  Last Sunday, two NATO F-18 fighters bombed Serb positions  besieging Gorazde in response to a request by UN peacekeepers.  The action was repeated the following day. As a matter of  fact, the Serbs who claimed that 15 soldiers and several  civilians were killed, did not suffer many casualties.    The Serbs' reaction to the bombings was immediate and strong  although their operation was not a large-scale one. They also  immediately suspended contacts with the UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Force in Bosnia]. Serb leader Radovan Karadzic even  canceled a meeting with a U.S. peace emissary scheduled for  Monday.    In return, NATO threatened to immediately launch a  larger-scale air strike if the Serbs retaliated. As Serb forces  continued to bomb Gorazde, NATO launched the bombing operation.  Long before the first strike was launched, NATO had asked the  Serbs to stop the siege of Gorazde declared by the United  Nations as a "safe haven." Apparently, the UN had asked NATO to  carry out its threat as the Serbs failed to end the siege.    As a matter of fact, NATO's bombing operation had by then  become controversial. The United States, for example, stated  that the bombings were necessary to pressure the Serbs. "If the  Serbs remain obstinate, they will face further strikes," said  Bill Clinton. A similar threat also came from the UN secretary  general. On the other hand, China as a permanent member of the  UN Security Council expressed concern over the strikes. "We  only support the peaceful settlement of all international  conflicts," said a spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.    Regardless of any controversy, the strikes dealt a serious  blow to the Serbs. The Serbs knew very well that NATO had often  been hesitant in taking tough action and capitalized on it.  They layed siege and bombed Gorazde, where at least 52 Bosnian  civilians were killed and hundreds wounded seriously, and this  is just one of their blatant violations.    On the other hand, NATO's bombing operation did not do much  to improve the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although the UN  has been "maintaining security" there for over a year, the  Bosnian Muslims as well as Croats are still in danger. The  Serbs, who have a better knowledge of the terrain and who are  better armed, have easily deceived the UN peacekeepers. As we  all know, hundreds of thousands of Bosnians have been killed by  Serb miliatiamen in the increasingly absurd [preceding word in  English] Balkan crisis.    If the UN is serious about overcoming the Bosnian conflict,  they should not just take sporadic action. There must be a  comprehensive settlement and a preliminary step will be to  strictly disarm the Serbs. Without serious action, there will  be no way of expecting the Serbs to sit at the negotiating table  and draft a common peace plan. Unfortunately, the United  Nations or NATO has yet to do this.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source at the Ministry of  Defense of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has made the  following statement to the Yemeni News Agency, Aden:    The forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa resumed  this morning, Saturday [11 June], their desperate attempts to  advance toward the Governorate of Aden from different fronts.  Artillery and missile attacks continued on the residential  quarters in the approaches to Aden. A number of aircraft  attempted to strike Aden refinery but our air defenses  intercepted them. The air raid of the hostile forces failed to  achieve their objective.    All this is taking place in spite of the so-called new  initiative put forward by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih through his  representative at the United Nations in which he claimed his  wish for a cease-fire. This indicates that the ruling military  regime in Sanaa is continuing its political and media game to  deceive the Arab and international public opinion while at the  same time it is continuing its desperate attempts to storm Aden.  This is a dream in the mind of that regime under its head who  is arrogant and blood-thirsty. This objective is impossible to  achieve. The Armed Forces of the DRY supported by thousands of  our people who have enlisted in their ranks have taken the  responsibility of defending the DRY and its sovereignty, and  will never allow the new invading aggressors to continue  inflicting their folly and recklessness against the lives and  possessions of our people. Defeat is awaiting the aggressors  and victory is near, God willing.</p>

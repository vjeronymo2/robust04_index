			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Squalls around the ship of state: Resignations, strikes and the budget deficit threaten Germany Clearly Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's seemingly immortal foreign minister, thought it was a good moment to give an intimation of his mortality. His decision to resign next month, on the 18th anniversary of his appointment, was designed to cause the minimum possible disruption to his own political party, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, and to German foreign policy in general. There are no elections in the German political calendar for 18 months - an extraordinary breathing space for that country. Two state elections have just taken place, albeit with indications of voter fatigue and a disturbing protest vote for the far right, against the main political parties. As for foreign policy, Mr Genscher expressed his confidence that the guidelines had been firmly set by his own fair hand. 'The commitment of our foreign policy to Europe is irreversible,' he told his colleagues in the presidium of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). 'We set our European convictions against any new nationalism. We set the value of our constitution and a policy of international responsibility against any power politics. And we know that things cannot go well for long in western Europe if things go badly in eastern Europe.' He leaves behind a Germany committed on the one hand to European political and monetary union, through the Maastricht Treaty, and on the other to maximum openness towards eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Whatever Mr Genscher may have thought, however, the timing of his departure could scarcely look more disruptive from an international point of view. His letter to Chancellor Kohl was published on the very day that Germany was plunging into the first all-out public sector strike for 18 years; the popularity of the coalition has suddenly slid to a new low; the finances of the government are overstretched and the business community is miserable; and the rest of the western industrialised world is banging on the table in Washington and calling for Bonn to put its house in order for fear of a worse international recession. Not only that, but a second government minister - Mrs Gerda Hasselfeldt, the minister of health - quit on the same day, apparently overwhelmed by the cares of office, and tainted by a spy scandal affecting her closest adviser. Yet Mr Kohl, like Mr Genscher, appears unperturbed. As far as he is concerned, it is government as usual. He does not intend a serious cabinet reshuffle, nor to change his budgetary plans, nor to improve his pay offer to the public sector unions; and he is not going to tell the German Bundesbank to change its interest rate policy. Is he oblivious, and the cataclysm is about to engulf him? Or is he a wise old statesman steering a steady course through a little choppy water? There is no doubt that the departure of Mr Genscher removes a mine of experience, a man who has known every leading statesman in east and west for almost two decades, who has followed every turn of European Community policy, and who has successfully related foreign policy to the German in the street. The latest opinion poll in Der Spiegel magazine gave him a positive rating of 77 per cent - more than any other active politician, and far more than Mr Kohl himself, with 54 per cent. The same poll shows the popularity of the coalition sliding - Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) are down to 37 per cent, although Mr Genscher's FDP is steady on 10 per cent. Another poll yesterday by the Forsa institute, a market research group, marked the CDU, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, down to only 33 per cent, with the opposition Social Democrats moving up to 41 per cent. Against that background, the government cannot but suffer from the loss of its most popular member. It also seems likely that the FDP will suffer, even if Mr Genscher continues to play a role in internal affairs. The FDP has survived as the kingmaker, the swing party between the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, largely thanks to the acute political instincts of the foreign minister. The three party members who remain in the cabinet - Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, his successor, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the justice minister - cannot match his cunning. And yet the departure of Mr Genscher is not all negative. Indeed many of Germany's partners, and Mr Genscher's political rivals, not least in the German foreign ministry, will see it as a positive relief. A western diplomat in Bonn, asked last year whether German foreign policy was becoming overbearing, remarked: 'It is not German policy which is overbearing. It is Hans-Dietrich Genscher.' Although Mr Genscher may believe he has left clear guidelines for the conduct of German foreign policy, the country's search for a post-Cold War identity has only just begun. Since unification, the foreign minister has seemed increasingly out of touch with the real political power in Bonn, which has resided in the Chancellor's office. Mr Kohl has been the key policymaker on the European Community, and he is also the key figure in relations with the US. Thus Mr Kohl may have good reason to welcome the resignation, creating as it does a useful vacuum in which a somewhat more sensitive foreign policy in style can be drafted, if not fundamentally different in substance. With the resignation just four weeks ago of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg as defence minister, it means that both key external relations jobs are now in the hands of the new political generation. What is more baffling is why the chancellor should be also so apparently unperturbed on the economic front. For there he is boxed in with problems on every side. The public sector strike, however disruptive or short-lived it may prove, is a symptom of something more profound: the unwillingness of the ordinary west German worker daunting cost of unification. At the same time, Mr Kohl's partners in the Group of Seven industrialised nations, to whom he will play host at the Munich world economic summit in July, insist that he is already trying to finance too much through borrowing, forcing up German interest rates, and thus threatening the recovery prospects of the rest of western Europe and the international economy. It is a moot point, and an acutely sensitive one. On the one hand it is clear that the cost of capital transfers, both public and private, from west to east, is causing a haemorrhage from the once resilient western economy, without as yet showing any real sign of an increase in eastern productive capacity. Total federal government transfers to the east for 1992 are estimated by Germany's leading economic institutes at DM150bn (Pounds 51.5bn). But the large expenditure has so far failed 'to spark the expected powerful, self-supporting recovery process'. Mr Kohl and his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, are in a bind. On the one hand they have promised to limit federal expenditure increases to 2.5 per cent a year over the next four years. Yet expenditure on transfers to eastern Germany is forecast to rise by 17 per cent in 1992 over 1991. That means an overall budget growth rate of 5 per cent, which in turn implies that federal spending in western Germany must actually fall by a real 4 per cent this year to meet the 2.5 per cent target. The German government rejects US calculations that its budget deficit amounts to as much as 6 per cent of its GDP, insisting that even when borrowing for the railways and telecommunications is included it will not exceed 4.5 per cent. Mr Waigel has promised a budget austerity drive 'as hard as nails' in the coming months. He says no new spending will be approved without corresponding cuts elsewhere in the budget. But the real question is whether a coalition government can agree on absolute spending cuts in the current political climate. An attempt last year to cut subsidies by DM10bn failed, although tinkering with tax allowances helped meet some of the bill. The real question is how quickly the eastern German economy can pick up, thus reducing the need for transfers to subsidise jobs, pay unemployment benefit, and keep major loss-making employers in business. Although the collapse of the eastern economy may have ended last year, this year's forecast of 10 per cent growth is regarded by economists as more of a technical correction than a real recovery. If eastern Germany does not achieve self-sustaining growth in the next two years, Mr Waigel will have to keep stepping up transfers - precisely the danger which the other G7 governments fear. Despite the large deficit, Mr Kohl has promised no cuts in social spending, and no increase in taxes. And now he is facing a furious public sector workforce striking to squeeze more from his empty purse. It is not just the workers who have failed to understand the true cost of unification. Local authorities in the public sector are proving equally spendthrift, according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank. He has accused them of pushing up their spending by no less than 9 per cent last year 'as if nothing had happened. Yet another adventure-pool, yet another museum, yet another town-twinning partnership in Scotland or Portugal, and yet more official tourism: all this is carrying on regardless.' The truth is that the full cost of unification has still not hit ordinary Germans, and yet they are already up in arms at the expense. The drift of voters to extreme rightwing parties, like the Republicans and the Deutsche Volksunion, is a protest not only at rising immigration, but also at the squeeze on their living standards. It should not be exaggerated (the Republicans have pushed up their support from 2 to 5 per cent in the latest polls), but nor can Chancellor Kohl afford to ignore it. In his announcement yesterday of his resignation, Mr Genscher declared that the very fact of his voluntary departure was proof of 'the good working capacity of our democratic structures'. It showed the 'understanding of democracy of those who carry responsibility in our highest offices of state'. Two weeks before, a very senior government official expressed a contrary view. He quoted Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, once Germany's commissioner in Brussels, now warden of St Anthony's College, Oxford, on the contrast between British and German democracy. British democracy, he said, was strong because it had shown it could survive times of economic depression as well as economic growth. The question still hanging over German democracy, the senior official said, was that it had yet to prove it could survive the bad times as well as the good.</p>

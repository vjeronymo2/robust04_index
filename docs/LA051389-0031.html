			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE MUSLIMS PROTEST 'SEX HABITS' BOOK  </P> <P> About 2,500 Chinese Muslims chanting "Punish China's Rushdie!" marched through  Beijing on Friday demanding that two editors be imprisoned for publishing a  book that purportedly describes the sexual habits of Muslims.  </P> <P> "These men must be jailed," said Li Jing, a Uighur Turk from the Central  Academy of Nationalities and a leader of the protest. "If they disappeared from  the face of the earth, we would be happy."  </P> <P> The protest came a day after Iranian President Ali Khamenei told a news  conference in Beijing that Iran still demands the execution of British author  Salman Rushie, who is accused of blaspheming the Islamic religion in his book,  "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> The Chinese book in question is called "Sex Habits," a compilation of essays on  the sexual tastes of people around the world.  </P> <P> The section on Islam says that the purpose of a Muslim's pilgrimage to Mecca is  to engage in bestiality. It said the domes and towers of Muslim mosques  symbolize human sex organs.  </P> <P> In an unusually early report by Chinese standards, Beijing's afternoon  newspaper, the Beijing Evening News, reported the demonstration. It also said  the book had been banned in Beijing "because it has hurt the unity of China's  minorities."  </P> <P> The demonstration, which included students from eight school and 13 minority  groups, twisted through the streets of Beijing's Muslim quarter to the Niujie  Mosque, Bejing's oldest.  </P> <P> Mullahs at the temple set out tea for the marchers and police directed traffic  out of their path. The demonstration was the first in more than three weeks of  student protests in Beijing to be given official approval. Earlier protests  have called for a free press and democracy.  </P> <P> The book's editors, apparently teachers from Shanxi province, wrote under pen  names.  </P> <P> The book has sold rapidly since it was published by the Shanghai Cultural  Publishing Co. in March. Sources said that in early May, the Shanghai city  government stopped a second printing of the book, which had already sold 50,000  copies.  </P> <P> City officials also are trying to recall the book, offering three times its  official price of 94 cents, but to no avail, they said.  </P> <P> "The black market price has already hit 50 yuan ($13.50)," said one Chinese  journalist.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The president of the Republic, Cyprien  Ntaryamira, this morning opened the proceedings of the National  Security Council, which will examine solutions to end the crisis  prevailing since 21 October. The president first recalled the  mission of the National Security Council then spoke on the  prevailing insecurity.    [Begin Ntaryamira recording] [passage omitted] Even though  the authorized services have not yet given figures on the death  toll following the tragic events, there are estimates of about  100,000 deaths. There are indications of a decline in the  economic and social sectors. The worst thing is that the  situation does not seem to be stabilizing. After the killings  in Kamenge and Tangara, our country wakes up daily to witness  heaps of corpses, destroyed or burned houses in some areas of  Bujumbura, and more particularly in Nyakabiga, Cibitoke, Kinama,  and Musage.    A climate of suspicion has returned to some boarding  schools,  notably at Cibitoke, Bururi, Kayanza, and in northeastern and  eastern parts of the country. There is still a fear of an  external attack.    In the western and central parts of the country, local  leaders report people are receiving training in weapons  handling, while the specter of the Party for the Liberation of  the Hutu People haunts some people. All the inhabitants of this  country, both nationals and foreigners, need peace and stability  in order to restore mutual trust and to live together once  again. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong The Hang Seng index fell 31 per cent between its peak in January and its low for the year on Wednesday. That fall seems to discount a lot of bad news, some of which may not actually materialise. The market is assuming that the US will renew China's most-favoured nation status. Its bigger local worry has been the property market. Since the government started trying to increase the supply of residential property by increasing land sales and easing planning restrictions, prices have fallen some 5 to 10 per cent. The commercial property market still looks expensive. But in both cases there is still a good chance of a soft landing. Hong Kong property tends to be in structurally short supply. Although Unisys has decided to pull back from the territory on the grounds that rents are too expensive, most companies seriously interested in trading with China regard a Hong Kong presence as essential, and there is a continuing dearth of prime quality office space. Moreover, Hong Kong's currency peg to the US means monetary policy is likely to remain loose for local conditions, even if real interest rates have become slightly less negative. The stock market's bounce yesterday suggests that Hong Kong equities have become at least a trading buy, especially since there are signs of constructive talks resuming on the airport project. Consensus forecasts for earnings growth approaching 20 per cent this year put the market on a prospective p/e of less than 12 times. And for Japanese buyers starting with a strong Yen the market must look doubly cheap.</p>

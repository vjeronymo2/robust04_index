			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Fishing blockade disrupts Plymouth A BLOCKADE of Plymouth Sound by about 150 fishing boats protesting against cheap fish imports and government policy on preserving stocks was called off last night after disrupting the port throughout the day. The protest ended after threats of legal action from Associated British Ports, which owns the Devon harbour and 21 other ports. ABP had said it was 'prepared to take whatever legal action is necessary to keep the port open for our business and our customers'. A car ferry had to be diverted to Poole and Royal Navy operations were disrupted, although the naval base said this was minimal. The protest, following a blockade on Monday at the Port of Tees and Hartlepool, was joined by boats ranging from crabbers to trawlers which sailed overnight from other south-western ports to form the blockade at dawn. Some of the boats fired distress flares across the harbour. The blockade prevented the Brittany Ferries' Quiberon, sailing from Roscoff, France, from docking in the morning and it was diverted to Poole, Dorset. Passengers for the return sailing to Roscoff had to drive or be bussed to Poole. Another car ferry, the 23,000 tonne Bretagne, sailing from Santander, Spain, was due to dock at 6pm but Brittany Ferries decided not to divert it in light of the expected lifting of the blockade. Mr Richard Banks, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, yesterday co-ordinated the blockade from a trawler. The action was a rebuff to the fisheries minister, Mr David Curry. In the Commons on Thursday he called on the fishermen to abandon such protests. Mr Mike Townsend, chairman of the Cornish Fish Producers' Association, whose members joined yesterday's protest, said: 'It is perfect fishing weather and quite a sacrifice not to be fishing, but feelings are so strong that they have no alternative.' He said British fishermen were being asked to tie up their boats in the name of conservation when they only caught about 12 per cent of the stocks of white fish. 'They are being asked to make a big sacrifice for no benefit,' he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian president's press </F> secretary, under "Politics" rubric: "`Preserving Existing  Elements of Civil Peace Is Main Aim of Agreement of Political  Forces,' Russian Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov Believes"]    [Text] "Preserving the existing elements of civil peace is  the main aim of the Agreement of Political Forces," Vyacheslav  Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, believes. It  is that task which is the main aim behind the draft document "On  Securing Civil Accord" which Russian President Boris Yeltsin  gave to State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin last Thursday.  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko also received a  copy of the draft, so all Federal Assembly deputies will be  familiarized with it. The document is seven-and-a-half pages  long. It contains sections on the economic, political,  spiritual, moral, and cultural life of society, on nationalities  and regional policy, and, lastly, on the terms for the  fulfillment of the agreement and on the sides' liability for the  violation of these terms. It would evidently be inadvisable and  even harmful to envisage tough punitive measures. There is no  prosecutorial tone in the draft. It is proposed to set up  conciliation commissions to deal with contentious issues; these  are to operate openly and submit their opinions and, if  necessary, their censure of anyone's actions to public verdict.  It is still hard to talk about a firm date for the signing of  the agreement. The president would like to start the signing  procedure in late April and has set a provisional date of 28  April. With a whole series of provisos he has also set the  number of possible signatures at around 25, so that more and  more political forces can subscribe to the agreement as they  "mature."    People who think that Boris Yeltsin's political temperament  is exhausted are mistaken. That note was struck in the  assumption that he will only take part in the 1996 presidential  elections as a voter. The president will not leave the helm  unless he is sure he is giving it into safe hands. It cannot be  ruled out that a sufficiently large proportion of the population  will ask Yeltsin to run. Needless to say it will be the  president himself who will make the decision, but in the  meantime I would not be as hasty as some of our media in tossing  this subject into our heated political life. This will only  agitate society. A moratorium on political passions would be  more useful. The agreement must play that role.</p>

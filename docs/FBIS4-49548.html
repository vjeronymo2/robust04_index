			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The Supreme People's  Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate separately  submitted two bills to the seventh meeting of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC], which opened  here today, asking it to examine the Draft Law of the People's  Republic of China on Judges and the Draft Law of the People's  Republic of China on Prosecutors.    In the bill he submitted and in the explanation he made to  the NPC Standing Committee today, Ren Jianxin, president of the  Supreme People's Court, said: The purpose of enacting a law on  judges is to meet the requirements for improving the socialist  legal system and accelerating the building of a socialist market  economic structure, to establish a socialist judicial system  with Chinese characteristics, and to administer judges on a  scientific and legal basis so as to ensure and upgrade the  quality of judges and to guarantee that judges exercise their  trial functions according to law.    On the drafting of the law on judges, Ren Jianxin said: The  Supreme People's Court began drafting the law in 1986, and at  the end of 1988 the NPC Standing Committee listed the law in its  legislative plan. In the past few years, the Supreme People's  Court has conducted extensive investigations and studies, summed  upexperiences in administering judges since the founding of New  China, collected data on the relevant judicial systems of  foreign countries and of Taiwan and the Hong Kong and Macao  regions, and has sent delegations to study the judicial systems  in a number of countries. In drafting the law, the Supreme  People's Court took the Constitution as the foundation, carried  out the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee on building a  scientific administrative system that suits the characteristics  of various units and an effective and encouraging mechanism,  proceeded from the actual condition in China, took into account  the future and the current situation, and also studied the  useful experiences of other countries, in a bid to draw up a  socialist law on judges with Chinese characteristics.    Ren Jianxin said: In China judges are judicial personnel who  specifically exercise the trial function of the state. They are  state functionaries as well as professional people. However,  over the past 40 years, no law has been enacted that reflects  the dual characteristics of judges, and they have always been  administered as administrative personnel. Therefore, it is very  important to enact a law that clearly defines the  qualifications, responsibilities, rights and obligations,  selection and appointment, training, evaluation, and  administration of judges, and rewards and punishment for judges,  so as to create a system by which judges will be administered on  a scientific and legal basis.    Ren Jianxin also made explanations on establishing a system  on qualifications of judges, a system on ranks of judges, on  establishing a judges committee, and establishing a system of  insurance for judges.    In the bill he submitted, and in his explanations to the NPC  Standing Committee regarding the draft law on prosecutors, Zhang  Siqing, chief procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,  said: The purpose of enacting a law on prosecutors is to  administer prosecutors on a scientific and legal basis, improve  the quality of prosecutors, and ensure that people's  procuratorates independently exercise their functions according  to law. Zhang Siqing said: For a long time people's  procuratorates' law-supervising function has been affected to a  certain degree because of the lack of a complete law for  administering prosecutors. Also, there has been a lack of  necessary legal guarantees for prosecutors to exercise their  powers and functions. Therefore, it is necessary to establish,  through legislation, an administrative system compatible with  the nature of procuratorial organs and the characteristics of  their work, such as a system governing the qualifications of  prosecutors, a system for evaluating prosecutors, and a system  governing their ranks, wages, insurance, and benefits, so as to  improve administration of prosecutors on a scientific basis.    He said: Enacting a law on prosecutors is necessary for  ensuring and improving the quality of prosecutors. As  prosecutors are state judicial personnel exercising the function  of supervising the law of the country, they must be proficient  politically and professionally. Therefore, it is necessary,  through legislation, to make strict stipulations governing the  qualifications, selection, evaluation, and training of  prosecutors, so as to facilitate the building of a contingent of  prosecutors who are fair and honest, and who carry out their  legal duties according to law. At the same time, the enactment  of a law on prosecutors is necessary to ensure that prosecutors  exercise their functions according to law; it is also needed to  standardize and restrict prosecutors' act of exercising their  duties.    Zhang Siqing also explained the duties of prosecutors, the  system on qualifications of prosecutors, and the system  governing the ranks of prosecutors.</p>

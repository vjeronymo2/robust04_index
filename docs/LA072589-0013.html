			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEL BLANC  </P> <P> Laughter is a return to childhood. We forget those who take us there.  </P> <P> Today I learned of Mel Blanc's death and remembered how for four years I was  chauffeuring him from his home in Pacific Palisades to the Hanna Barbera  Studios for some dubbing.  </P> <P> As we drove down Sunset, I told Mel, weakened by emphysema and forced to  breathe with the aid of a portable oxygen machine, how much I had loved Bugs  Bunny and Daffy Duck as a boy, but how I had always got Elmer Fudd confused  with Porky Pig.  </P> <P> We stopped for a traffic light. Mel removed the nostril clip from his oxygen  tube and turning, began reciting the litany of voices we love him for -- Bugs,  Daffy, Tweety, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, Road Runner, the Flintstones and many  others.  </P> <P> Inside an idling Rolls-Royce in the next lane, two elegant ladies gaped at the  elderly man going through his vocal imitations and the appreciative driver  laughing as he listened.  </P> <P> That's why it saddened me to learn, "Th-th-at-'s all, folks."  </P> <P> STEWART LINDH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

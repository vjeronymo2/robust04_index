			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW STEPS FOR DANCING WATERS;  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN SHOW AT HOTEL IS NOW PURE DISNEY  </P> <P> The lights dim, the music swells, and the booming voice of an announcer washes  over hundreds of people assembled before a pool of water in a corner of the  Disneyland Hotel grounds.  </P> <P> Mark Rubin's eyes are on the water, not the people, as he listens for the  opening strains of the theme music from "Steamboat Willie," the 1928 cartoon  that introduced Mickey Mouse to America. Hands dancing across a beat-up-looking  control box, Rubin pushes the buttons and pulls the levers that bring 16  fountains to life, their spray bouncing up and down to match the tooting of the  steamboat music.  </P> <P> "It's like being an entertainer," said Rubin, who has "played" the Dancing  Waters for 10 years. "I take a lot of pride in the show."  </P> <P> The popular free show has been performed nearly every night, weather  permitting, since the production opened 19 years ago. But this summer, the  waters are dancing to a new beat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disney Bought It Back  </P> <P> Familiar tunes from Broadway, classical composers and the pop music world have  been left behind for a new show featuring all-Disney music and characters. The  change came 18 months after the Walt Disney Co. bought the Disneyland Hotel,  which had been owned by the Wrather Corp., according to Tony Peluso, director  of entertainment for Disney properties.  </P> <P> The new show, officials said, has been enthusiastically received by the summer  crowds, particularly children, who crowd to the edge of the water show and  extend their small arms to try to touch the mist from the fountains.  </P> <P> "Oooh, that's pretty," declared a towheaded toddler sitting on his father's  shoulders as the show began.  </P> <P> Joanne Rogers, a visitor from Oklahoma who had seen the old Dancing Waters  show, said she prefers the new version. "I like the characters and it seems  like they put in more fountains."  </P> <P> The 17-minute show traces the history of Disney productions through music and a  narration, moving from cartoons to movies to television. Though "The Mickey  Mouse Club" theme song draws the largest sing-along response from the audience,  Dancing Waters creator Michael A. Berkus said the music from the movie  "Fantasia" is the most challenging for the show's operators.  </P> <P> "The swaying of the fountains is very difficult to do," said Berkus, who  learned to "play" the waters at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. "There's an  art to playing it. It has to be taught."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only 6 'Conductors'  </P> <P> In fact, just six people have played the waters at the hotel since 1970, Berkus  added, and the operators are often asked if they are musicians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Needs to Stay Ahead  </P> <P> "I'm not a musician," Rubin said, "but if I were, I'd have to be an offbeat  musician because I have to be about a half-second ahead of the beat."  </P> <P> The show's operators work at stage left, where control panels for the  fountains, spotlights and a fiber-optic wall are located. Behind the  control-panel area is a small room that houses the music on reel-to-reel tape  and other maintenance equipment.  </P> <P> The Dancing Waters show area was designed by Berkus, and includes a  semicircular pool measuring 80 by 40 feet in front of the 16 water jets housed  in a separate shallow pool. The fountains are backlighted by spotlights that  can create water colors from baby blue to fire engine red. Behind the water is  a wall of fiber-optic panels that flash to the beat of the music; Disney  cartoon characters that light up during the show are perched atop the wall.  </P> <P> In designing the show, Berkus said he envisions himself as a conductor and each  fountain as a musical instrument. "My goal is to make people believe they are  seeing music," he said.  </P> <P> For instance, he translated the lyrical music of "Fantasia" into graceful  fountains that arch and wave, while a gunshot in the Davy Crockett theme song  is punctuated with one burst from a single fountain that shoots water 40 feet  into the air. The "Electrical Parade" music features the light board, its  panels flashing patterns of red, green, pink and blue.  </P> <P> The Dancing Waters show shut down for about two weeks to prepare for the new  production. The operators rehearsed six hours a day for eight days to music  blaring from a boom box sitting on the cement staging area.  </P> <P> Berkus is delighted to explain the machinery behind Dancing Waters, much of  which is far from new. The control panel for the fountains was built in Germany  in 1948, and part of the fountain area has been powered by a $6 motor from an  Erector set since 1970, he said.  </P> <P> "I've always believed that if it works, don't fix it," said Berkus, who also  owns an Anaheim market firm but has a car with license plates reading "H20  SHOW."  </P> <P> The original show cost about $500,000 to build and design, and Disney poured  another $120,000 into the new production, Berkus said.  </P> <P> Although the fiber-optic wall and lighting system are semi-automated, Berkus is  reluctant to turn the fountains over to a computer.  </P> <P> "For one thing, how would we know when to automate when the show changes in  subtle ways all the time?" Berkus mused. "At what point would we decide it was  perfect?"  </P> <P> The Dancing Waters operators agree.  </P> <P> "We're always learning," Dave Hill said. "This way, we can still try something  new, so the show gets better with age."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TURNING A NEW PAGE IN HISTORY;  </P> <P> PREJUDICE AND HARDSHIP BURIED THE WORKS OF EARLY BLACK AUTHORS FOR YEARS. BUT  NOW, RESEARCHERS ARE REDISCOVERING THE BOOKS AND THE TRUTHS THEY TOLD.  </P> <P> Like marathoners forced to wear weighted shoes, black American novelists during  slavery and for decades after faced seemingly impossible odds on the road to  publication.  </P> <P> As slaves, black people were forbidden by law to read and write. Some slave  writers not only had to escape their masters but flee the country as well. Even  those who were befriended by sympathetic white Americans often had to tone down  their views of racism in order to get published. And long after slavery ended,  many black novelists could find no publishers other than themselves.  </P> <P> Still, they wrote. The early novels by blacks were steeped in realism born out  of their enslavement, and, later, by the tyranny of low-level jobs, lynchings,  segregation and discrimination. But through the years, these windows into the  soul of black America remained largely closed, relegated to literary  backwaters.  </P> <P> Now, university researchers increasingly are sifting through these novels and  in the process have uncovered a trove of revelations about black life in  America and race relations over the years. The search also makes an important  link between the early black writers and those who came later.  </P> <P> Here on the elegant, tree-shaded campus of the University of Mississippi, where  much of the racial history is steeped in anger and hate, a project is unfolding  with the goal of cataloguing and collecting a copy of every novel published by  a black American author since the first one in 1853, William Wells Brown's  "Clotel." In all, some 2,000 titles will form the collection.  </P> <P> The effort, a daunting one, is similar to those at other universities, where  collections are under way for periodical literature and for fiction covering  shorter periods of time. In addition, collectors at private organizations  increasingly are seeking out books written by blacks.  </P> <P> Experts say the collections parallel a growing dissatisfaction with educators'  lists of "great literature," which often exclude books written by blacks and  other minorities and those by women.  </P> <P> For black people the efforts bear particular significance. They carry the hopes  of building black pride in literature, combatting white prejudice in publishing  and chipping away at the huge rock of illiteracy -- a problem exacerbated by  dropout rates that hover around 50% in some predominantly black schools.  </P> <P> "Maybe they (black students) didn't want to read 'Silas Marner,' but they would  want to read 'Clotel,' said Casper Jordan, an adjunct professor at Clark  Atlanta University's school of library and information studies.  </P> <P> The collectors say their discoveries of early black novels will help tear down  the stereotype that black people historically have had only an "oral tradition"  of story-telling, not a written one. And the stories, they say, often provide  insightful looks into ordinary black life, broadening everyone's understanding  of the black experience in America and inspiring black people as well.  </P> <P> "Black people have a history in this discipline, and we want to know what it  is," said Maryemma Graham, the director of the Ole Miss project who currently  teaches English and African-American literature at Northeastern University in  Boston.  </P> <P> So far, said Graham, her project has collected 1,500 of the known 2,000 novels  by blacks, including 60 written before 1940. Graham, likening the search to  following "a detective's trail" through attics, basements, churches, libraries  and minds, said the novels are collected and catalogued here in many forms,  including photocopies, hard copies and microfilm.  </P> <P> There are always new trails for book detectives to explore. As an example, the  first novel by a black American woman (and the first by a black published in  this country) was published in 1859 but was lost for years until researchers  from Yale University drew attention to it in 1982 -- "Our Nig or, Sketches from  the Life of a Free Black" by Harriet E. Wilson.  </P> <P> Parts of her life paralleled the travails of the book's heroine, Frado, an  indentured servant to a brutal white family in 19th-Century Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Why did this work remain obscure for so long?  </P> <P> Henry Louis Gates Jr., now a Duke University professor who, while at Yale, led  the rediscovery team, speculated that one possibility was that Wilson  confronted Northern racism, thus alienating Northerners.  </P> <P> Gates, in his introduction to a Random House reprinting of the book, also cited  as a possibility the book's "unabashed representation of an interracial  marriage, a liaison from which the novel's protagonist was an offspring." He  went on to say that interracial marriage "was not a popular subject for  representation in either anti-slavery or pro-slavery novels." Through the  years, many novels by blacks were published in limited quantities, often by  "vanity presses," sometimes circulated only among friends and church members.  And say scholars, many black writers were exploited, much in the same way as  black musicians who were cheated out of profits by record companies.  </P> <P> Here, at the project's command center, Barbara Hunt, project co-director,  leaned over an open file drawer, thumbing through book copies, noting that many  of the early books centered on the devastating conditions during slavery. Such  literature, she said, "doesn't show too much in the way of optimism,"  dispelling the notion of benign slavery.  </P> <P> First among these is "Clotel," subtitled "The President's Daughter" because it  represents the persistent assertion that Thomas Jefferson fathered children by  a black woman. Brown, an escaped slave who made his way from Kentucky to  Cleveland, then Buffalo, N.Y., where his house was an Underground Railroad  station, wrote the book in the British Isles, and it was published in London.  At the time he could not return to America, lest he risk re-enslavement.  </P> <P> In the genre of the "tragic mulatto," as is "Our Nig," the novel details the  sad, hard life of Clotel, born of a slave master and a slave, and in the  process, provides graphic details of slave life.  </P> <P> At an auction where Clotel's mother is sold, Brown notes that among the  bidders, the "laughing, joking, swearing, smoking, spitting and talking kept up  a continual hum," while a "slave girl stood with tearful eyes, looking  alternately at her mother and sister and toward the young man whom she hoped  would become her purchaser."  </P> <P> Brown, who himself was as fair-skinned as a white man, portrayed the conflicts  between light-skinned blacks and darker ones, having one slave character say of  another: "She tink she white when she cum here, wid dat long har ob hers."  </P> <P> Connecting the evils of slavery and the sexual fears of white women, Brown  wrote: "What social virtues are possible in a society of which injustice is a  primary characteristic -- in a society which is divided into two classes,  masters and slaves? Every married woman at the South looks upon her husband as  unfaithful, and regards every Negro woman as a rival."  </P> <P> Researchers note that many students are familiar with the works of later black  authors like Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Alice Walker and James Baldwin. But  they are almost certain to know very little about Brown and other earlier  authors, or about the depth of black talent, and despair, represented in their  works.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Mayme Clayton, executive director of the Western States Black  Research Center, recalled that years ago many blacks did not have access to  black books, even in school, because many schools refused to buy them. Clayton  said she began collecting books by blacks at age 13 and loves the old ones  because "you will not know where you're going unless you know where you've  been."  </P> <P> The books, she said, prove that "black people were not as ignorant as white  people made people believe."  </P> <P> Indeed, even as a child, Frances E.W. Harper was acclaimed for her literary  skills and developed an international reputation as a poet, lecturer and  abolitionist. Her novel, "Iola Leroy," published in 1892, was one of the early  post-Reconstruction literary efforts to combat contemporary white fiction  depicting a romantic South where all slaves were happy and the slaveholders  kind.  </P> <P> In "Iola Leroy," Robert Johnson, a former slave who, during the Civil War,  rises to the rank of lieutenant in a black regiment, responds to a white  captain's statement about "ungrateful" blacks. Writes Harper: ' "Captain,' said  Robert, with a tone of bitterness in his voice, 'what had we to be grateful  for? For ages of poverty, ignorance, and slavery? I think if anybody should be  grateful, it is the people who have enslaved us and lived off our labor for  generations. . . .' "  </P> <P> In addition, several scholars noted that the collection of little known black  authors will show the range of writing styles and subject matter that always  have existed among black novelists.  </P> <P> Many white people "don't believe black writers can write about universal themes  -- like beauty and truth," said Jordan, the Clark Atlanta University professor.  But many of the neglected novels undermine that prejudice.  </P> <P> For example, Zora Neal Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God," published in  1937, explores the rich fabric of everyday life among rural black people and  uses equally rich language to do it. Of sundown she writes: "The sun was gone,  but he had left his footprints in the sky." A well-proportioned woman looks  "like she had grapefruits in her hip pockets," and a good cook "switches a mean  fanny round in a kitchen" and during a riveting moment, "nobody moved, nobody  spoke, nobody even thought to swallow spit. . . ."  </P> <P> Ronald Walters, a professor of political science at Howard University who is  active in efforts to break down barriers to publication of black writers, said:  "Black people have always had a world view that was expressed in their  writings," but whites "accepted the things they thought were flattering and  rejected those things they thought were threatening." Thus, he said, they were  "able to maintain stereotypes" of blacks.  </P> <P> Paul Laurence Dunbar, a turn-of-the-century black poet and author, complained  bitterly of being forced to write in black dialect because publishers demanded  it. After writing three novels with white characters in white settings in an  attempt to become a mainstream writer, Dunbar's final novel -- "The Sport of  the Gods," published in 1902 -- portrayed a black family that moves north, only  to find it unbearable. Despair and disillusion pervade the book. A short  exchange in it between a black man called Sadness and a white reporter named  Skaggsy demonstrates Dunbar's feeling about having to write dialect.  </P> <P> Skaggsy: "I tell you, Sadness . . . dancing is the poetry of motion."  </P> <P> Sadness: "Yes . . . and dancing in rag-time is the dialect poetry."  </P> <P> Ralph Bogardus, professor of American studies at the University of Alabama, is  organizing a summer institute to teach Alabama teachers more about black  literature. When whites read black books, he said, they "share feelings and  thoughts with" black people, thus "broadening their experience."  </P> <P> Researchers who uncover little known black books envision using them in classes  not only to educate white people about the achievements and experiences of  black writers but also to instill pride and interest among black people.  </P> <P> At Santa Monica College, Gail Davis Culp, who teaches African-American  literature, said that she has seen a dramatic surge in interest in black  heritage among black students who have read "Clotel."  </P> <P> She said the book has inspired discussions of "the psychological implications  of being a mulatto," and that students have taken on roles of the book's  characters and made videotapes of scenes. "For the first time they're  recognizing that they do have a (literary) history and that that history  started long before Richard Wright."  </P> <P> Wright's first book, "Uncle Tom's Children: Four Novellas," was published in  1938. "Native Son," Wright's best known work -- in which Bigger Thomas  personifies black rage, declaring: "I killed for what I am" -- was published  two years later.  </P> <P> While many of the novels freeze history in place, others surprise with their  timelessness.  </P> <P> For example, in "The Marrow of Tradition," published in 1901, Charles W.  Chesnutt, could have been voicing the frustration of black people today when he  wrote a passage in which one black man was arrested on suspicion of murder and  another, who felt the accusing stares of white people, complained that "the  entire race is condemned on general principles." And Dunbar's "Sport of the  Gods" shows that current-day black people are not the first to find  disillusionment in the North.  </P> <P> Amid the increasing effort to collect and publicize black novels, there is  likely to be an increased debate over whether they are "good literature."  </P> <P> Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the American Assn. of University  Professors, said that in the nation's 3,500 colleges and universities "some  would say there is a list of the great books, (but) others say there are  reasons to teach different books."  </P> <P> Different, great, historical, Graham wants them all if they are black. The time  is right, she said, likening her desire to spread black literature to the  freedom movement in Eastern Europe. "People are crying for more democracy, more  representation," she said. "There is a role in our society for these texts."  </P> <P> Staff researcher Edith Stanley contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EXCERPTS FROM BOOKS BY BLACK AUTHORS  </P> <P> "CLOTEL," by William Wells Brown, published 1853:  </P> <P> This was a Virginia slave-auction, at which the bones, sinews, blood, and  nerves of a young girl of eighteen were sold for $500; her moral character for  $200; her superior intellect for $100; the benefits supposed to accrue from her  having been sprinkled and immersed, together with a warranty of her devoted  Christianity, for $300; her ability to make a good prayer for $200; and her  chastity for $700 more. This, too, in a city thronged with churches, whose tall  spires look like so many signals pointing to heaven, but whose ministers preach  that slavery is a God-ordained institution!  </P> <P> "OUR NIG or, SKETCHES FROM THE LIFE OF A FREE BLACK," by Harriet E. Wilson,  published 1859:  </P> <P> "If I do, I get whipped;" sobbed the child. "They won't believe what I say. Oh,  I wish I had my mother back; then I should not be kicked and whipped so. Who  made me so?"  </P> <P> "God;" answered James.  </P> <P> "Did God make you?"  </P> <P> "Yes."  </P> <P> "Who made Aunt Abby?"  </P> <P> "God."  </P> <P> "Did the same God that made her make me?"  </P> <P> "Yes."  </P> <P> "Well, then I don't like him."  </P> <P> "Why not?"  </P> <P> "Because he made her white, and me black. Why didn't he make us both white?"  </P> <P> "IOLA LEROY," by Frances E. W. Harper, published 1892:  </P> <P> Miss Leroy, out of the race must come its own thinkers and writers. Authors  belonging to the white race have written good racial books, for which I am  deeply grateful, but it seems to be almost impossible for a white man to put  himself completely in our place. No man can feel the iron which enters another  man's soul.  </P> <P> "THE SPORT OF THE GODS," By Paul Laurence Dunbar, published 1902:  </P> <P> The subtle, insidious wine of New York will begin to intoxicate him. Then, if  he be wise, he will go away, any place -- yes, he will even go over to Jersey.  But if he be a fool, he will stay and stay on until the town becomes all in all  to him; until the very streets are his chums and certain buildings and corners  his best friends. Then he is hopeless, and to live elsewhere would be death.  The Bowery will be his romance, Broadway his lyric, and the Park his pastoral,  the river and the glory of it all his epic, and he will look down pityingly on  all the rest of humanity.  </P> <P> "THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD," by Zora Neale Hurston, published 1937:  </P> <P> The spirit of the marriage left the bedroom and took to living in the parlor.  It was there to shake hands whenever company came to visit, but it never went  back inside the bedroom again. So she put something in there to represent the  spirit like a Virgin Mary image in a church. The bed was no longer a  daisy-field for her and Joe to play in. It was a place where she went and laid  down when she was sleepy and tired.  </P></p>

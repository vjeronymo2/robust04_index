			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Books: The voice of moderation - The legacy of a great 16th century thinker ERASMUS THE REFORMER by AG Dickens and Whitney RD Jones Methuen Pounds 25, 367 pages Illegitimate, orphaned in adolescence, abandoned into an institution by his guardians - the auguries were not good. Yet Erasmus of Rotterdam became one of the greatest thinkers and scholars of his age, with profound influence on Europe in the early 16th century and beyond. Through the turbulence of religious divide and war, his was a voice of moderation and reason heard - and sometimes hearkened to - across the continent. The Emperor Charles V made him a member of his council; his works were read not just in the Germanic and Spanish heartlands of the Habsburg empire and France, Italy and England but also in the further flung corners of Europe like Hungary and Poland. He corresponded with reformer and traditionalist alike across the great swathe of European intellectual thought. Yet within a few years of his death his works were placed on the Papal Index of banned books. Erasmus laid the egg which Martin Luther hatched, it was said, and he was seen as dangerously subversive. The strands and legacy of this subversion are ably explored by Professor AG Dickens and Dr Whitney RD Jones in a new study of Erasmus' philosophy and theology. To Martin Luther in 1519, Erasmus set out one of the fundamentals underlying his approach to the quarrels of a bitterly divided continent: 'I think we get further by courtesy and moderation than by clamour. That was how Christ brought the world under his sway . . . Things which are of such wide acceptance that they cannot be torn out of men's minds all at once should be met with argument, close-reasoned forcible argument rather than bare assertion.' Toleration remained the hallmark of his thinking, but there was no precursor here of a multi-faith society in which all beliefs are accorded equal respect. 'Let them burn, by all means, those who fight the teaching of the articles of the faith or something of equal authority by the consensus of the church,' he was to write as the schisms grew. But the condemnation was tempered; heresy merited burning at the stake only if it was 'linked with sedition or any other crime which the laws punish by death.' His aim was to avoid schism and to maintain the polity. It was, he argued, important to understand how few things were basic to a true faith and how false scholarship had perverted the essentials and been used in the pursuit of power at the expense of peace. Above all, he believed, war had to be avoided; those who advocated it, be they popes or kings, were guilty of the worst of sins. Universal government, he maintained, was no answer to the imperative of peace; it could merely lead to a bigger tyranny than was possible in a world of fragmented states. In the 16th century, these sentiments were seen as highly seditious. The wonder is that Erasmus himself survived, respected till the end; it was only after his death that his works were banned. He may have been a critic of much of the prevailing order, but he gauged the limits to which criticism could be taken. Vigorous refutation awaited those who, seeing in him an ally, sought to interpret his writings beyond those limits. How much of a legacy has he left? For Professor Dickens and Dr Jones, the influence of Erasmus is profound. He would, they suggest, have been in the vanguard of today's ecumenical movement. And his influence in shaping the thinking of those around him and who came after him meant he helped to shape the world we live in. There is much that is recognisably 'modern' in his outlook, in contrast with others, such as Martin Luther, who had such a big influence on Europe's development. Though steeped in the ruling currents of the time, he frequently rose brilliantly above them. His understanding, his insistence on distinguishing between substance and form and examining basic principles, and above all his humanity illuminate a world in which rival certainties battled for supremacy. The world today is as divided, though driven by doubt rather than certainty. The Erasmian approach, as we stumble our way through, has as much validity now as then. Dispatches / Cape Town Selective amnesia heals the wounds Pieter-Dirk Uys says that former terrorists and old fascists are now comrades-in-arms 'What did you do in the struggle? The battle for freedom? The apartheid years? Does anyone remember?' There is an old Afrikaner ailment that seems to have reached epidemic proportions here in this most southern African land of rising hope. It is called Raubenheimer's disease. It was first noticed after the Boer war, when the British empire was nearly forced to its knees by the Boer guerrillas in the mist. This type of warfare was then exported to various skirmishes, from Afghanistan to Bosnia, with great success, while the British introduced the civilised world to their new concept: the concentration camp. After the Boer war, and while there was still great hatred and grumbling against the British, the Afrikaner found himself, by 1910, in a newly-formed union, blue-printed by the parliament in London and symbolised by the new South African flag: a compromise between those of the Cape Colony (Union flag) and the two ex-Boer republics (not the Union flag). The effect of this was to trap the Afrikaner in the centre of an orange, white and blue banner until the stroke of midnight before April 27 1994. Raubenheimer's disease was then spotted for the first time in a small dusty dorp on the wide plains of the Karoo, where Farmer Raubenheimer, having just lost his farm to fire and his family to famine, suddenly started speaking English and singing 'God Save the Queen'. He seemed to have forgotten completely the reason for the pain of his past. This - some people said - merciful amnesia made it possible for him to live side by side with his bloody enemy in peace. He even married again - a younger English girl - and they had three sons and called them after various recent British kings. Some of his bitter neighbours, however, swore that Farmer Raubenheimer had, in fact, lost his marbles. It is said that since then all Afrikaners have been born with a trace of Raubenheimer's disease. In decent company it was merely whispered that these strange bearded and braided volk knew how to adapt and not to die. 'Damn pragmatic' and 'bloody unbalanced' were more often used to explain the strange ways by which Afrikaners turned the other cheek and then whipped round, guns ablazing. We Afrikaners have always been great artists in absorbing - no, call it stealing. We would take something from another people, maybe a Dutch language, and unrecognisably beat it up to become Afrikaans. Or we would take a democratic Westminster system of government and bleed it dry of its truth. We even legitimised an inbred sense of racial madness, gave it an official Afrikaans name (that the English spelt apart-hate), wove it into our statute books 'democratically' and ended up in the smelly corner of the world's classroom with a skunk's tail pinned to our backs. But no more. Chalk has become cheese. The bad old days are gone. Mandela rules OK] Now, shockingly, it has become the time to be not anti but pro. One is proud of being a South African. Political satirists are jumping off roofs. Nostalgia-wracked anti-apartheid activists are ignoring the complexity of Bosnia and those political prisoners in Northern Ireland and are being treated for withdrawal symptoms. The black-and-white issues of Afrikanerdom's experiment in separate development have vanished. Like that flesh-eating streptococcus, Raubenheimer's disease has struck again. Here in this brand new South Africa it is impossible to find anyone more or less white and relatively sane who will admit to having supported apartheid. It is the same elsewhere, of course. In East Germany, after the Berlin Wall came down, there were suddenly no communists to be found, just as there had been no Nazis in Germany in 1945 (nor even, particularly, in Austria, Holland or France). No one recalls voting Margaret Thatcher into power all those years ago when British democracy still had a ring of authenticity to it. Some Afrikaners who swore bloody revenge on a democratically-elected, non-racial, non-sexist government are now swapping fond stories of election-day braais (barbecues) with their new non-white neighbours. Beers in hand, former terrorists and old fascists are comrades in arms; a cloudburst over a squatter camp is no longer the result of bad nationalist politics - only of bad weather. Amnesties and amnesias seem to go together. There are now more free men on the street (and in parliament) with blood on their hands than in the prisons. Politically-motivated crimes, ranging from mass murder to messy murder, have a cut-off date - if you blasted your enemies away before the cut-off, you are fine. During our past - until April 27 1994 - South African democracy was too good to share with just anyone. As a result, the world hated us. Now we are more of a democracy than Britain. Good news is no news and at the moment nearly everything here is good news, give or take a couple of killings that last year would have been called a political massacre; now it is just the criminal element. Everyone in government is united by salary and perks, from the old regime to the new extreme, from Chief Buthelezi to Winnie Mandela, the Black Evita, appointed not as minister of child welfare, which she had rehearsed for, but as deputy minister of culture. ('Culture?' she said. 'That's a funny post.' Please do not send her a biography of Madame Mao.) The world is still fascinated with South Africa, though no longer confronted by the nightly Munch-scream of black South Africa on the news; no longer turfing the Outspan orange into the toilet; no longer wearing the 'Free Mandela' T-shirt and feeling good for being so good. What now fascinates the world is this relatively well-educated, relatively civilised, relatively relatively pleasant group of white Christians (and Jews) who took the most beautiful country in the world and utterly and completely screwed it up - and nearly got away with it. And then turned round with a smile at the edge of the cliff and handed their only parachute to the former enemy. I thought I started with a question. Perhaps I had the answer. I really cannot remember. Call it Raubenheimer's disease. Pieter-Dirk Uys is a South African satirist</p>

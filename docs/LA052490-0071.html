			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSAICIN: THE INCENDIARY INGREDIENT IN HOT PEPPERS  </P> <P> What makes a hot pepper hot?  </P> <P> The incendiary ingredient, called capsaicin, is a powerful organic chemical  that torches the tongue and irritates nerve endings in the mouth and nose.  </P> <P> Capsaicin is highly concentrated in a pepper's central membrane, which holds  the seeds. Despite a burning taste, hot peppers can help cool the body by  fostering perspiration.  </P> <P> The family of capsicum peppers is usually divided into sweet (bell) and hot  (such as cayenne, chili or Tabasco). These are not to be confused with black or  white pepper, which are condiments obtained from the dried fruits of East  Indian vine plants. The peppers are close relatives of the eggplant, Irish  potato and tomato. Archeologists have found evidence of capsicum pepper seeds  at Tehuacan, Mexico, dated before 5000 B.C.  </P> <P> Although hot peppers can reduce even the most avid pepper enthusiast to a  wheezing, eye-watering mess, they generally cause no harm to the stomach,  according to Arnold G. Levy, a Silver Spring, Md., gastroenterologist.  </P> <P> The exceptions are red chili peppers and spicy Indian curry. Curry powder is  prepared from turmeric and other spices such as coriander, cumin and cayenne  pepper. "We have scientifically documented that these two foods can cause  gastritis, but we don't know why," says Levy.  </P> <P> Some experts speculate that capsaicin stimulates production of acid in the  stomach and therefore causes indigestion. Of course, too much of anything can  be harmful. Capsaicin is a chemical irritant to the body in extremely high  doses, says Antone R. Opekun, a physician's assistant at Baylor College of  Medicine.  </P> <P> Whether hot peppers are whole or ground up in sauces, Americans enjoy their  piquancy. From 1984 to 1988, Americans consumed about 155 million pounds of hot  spices, which include hot peppers, according to the American Spice Trade Assn.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHEL AFLAQ; FOUNDER OF IRAQ'S RULING PARTY  </P> <P> Michel Aflaq, 79, the founder and leader of Iraq's ruling Baath party. With the  late Salah Bitar, Aflaq founded the party in 1947 as a secular party advocating  Arab unity and non-communist socialism. Aflaq was in and out of jail in the  early 1950s as the party struggled for influence in Syria. It took control  there in 1963 in a bloody coup. Factional fighting forced Aflaq to go  underground in 1966 and flee to Syria. However, the party seized power the same  year in Iraq, and Aflaq was appointed secretary general. He worked out of  Beirut but moved to Baghdad after civil war in Lebanon broke out in 1975. The  Iraqi Baath party is now a bitter rival of the Syrian party. In Paris on Friday  after heart surgery.  </P></p>

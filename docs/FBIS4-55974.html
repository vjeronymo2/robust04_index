			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "W.Z." from Krakow: "BBWR Is Getting Closer To a </F> Party Formula; 300 Million Zlotys For Everybody Still on Agenda"]    [Text]A two-day program conference of the Non-Party  Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] has ended in Krakow. BBWR's  leadership announced a transformation of the group into a  political party. The final decision will be made at a congress  of the organization which will be held in the fall.    BBWR's First Program Conference was supposed to work out a  concept of political and economic changes in the country but in  practice, it showed dilemmas that the entire group is facing  with the upcoming elections for the post of president of the  Republic of Poland. That BBWR's concept is different from that  of the President's Office, is best demonstrated by the fact that  practically nobody from among high ranking Belvedere  officials took part in the substantive debate. When asked  about BBWR's candidates in the upcoming presidential elections,  Professor Zbigniew Religa replied laconically: As long as  Lech Walesa does not make a decision to run, there is nobody we  could support. But if our economic concepts are substantially  different from the president's program principles, then we will  propose our own candidate. A program for Poland -- which was  debated during the Krakow session -- covers, among others, a  draft of a new constitution based on a  presidential-parliamentary system of power, speeding up of  self-governmental reforms, enfranchisement of citizens in the  form of a complete and popular privatization, defining the  state's position on foreign capital taking into account the  interests of national economy, as well as devoting higher  amounts of money to the education system and civic  education.    Professor Jerzy Eysymontt, chief of the BBWR Parliamentary  Club, was asked by NOWA EUROPA about whether economic slogans  declared during the election campaign proclaiming 300 million  zlotys for each citizen, are still valid. His response was:  We are in favor of a popular enfranchisement, and  everything that leads to a complete privatization of the economy  will be supported by us, and that is why we still think that the  300 million zlotys which we proposed in the election campaign,  is a slogan under which important parts of the national wealth  should be transferred over to citizens.</p>

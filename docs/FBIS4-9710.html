			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the last vote count at the closing of  this edition, the Institutionalist Encounter Movement  [Movimiento Institucionalista Encuentrista] (MIE), of the  so-called ruling faction headed by Oscar Codas, won the National  Encounter [EN] internal elections on 27 March. The Progressive  Convergence Front [Frente de Convergencia Progresista, FCP]  headed by Deputy Luis A. Mauro came in second, the New Society  [NS] faction headed by Carlos Martini came in third, and the  Democratic Alliance [AD] faction headed by Basilio Nikiphoroff  came in last.    Seventy-two percent of voting tables had been counted by  midnight. The partial results continued to show who the clear  winner of the EN internal elections held nationwide on 27 March  was. The vote count gave the MIE 52.6 percent of the votes,  followed by the FCP with 22.5 percent, the NS with 10.6 percent;  and the AD with 8.7 percent.    In a relatively calm atmosphere, other than some charges of  irregularities in the voter registration lists, the EN elected  the members of the party board, the coordinating board,  grass-roots delegates, and district coordinators. With the MIE's  victory, the ruling EN faction reasserted its hegemony both in  the capital and the country's interior by a wide margin over its  opponents. For its part, the FCP, headed by Deputy Luis Alberto  Mauro, came in second before the NS headed by Febrerista  Revolutionary Party [PRF] leader Carlos Martini.    Contrary to the atmosphere that prevailed during the last  part of the election campaign (marked by strong accusations  among the movements), no conflicts took place on 27 March beyond  the usual complaints about the voters lists.    With an electorate that concentrates 68 percent of its  potential in the metropolitan area, the leaders of the several  factions that ran for election on 27 March agreed in pointing  out that from now on the EN's main challenge is to gain time.    It must be pointed out that the participation rate in the  elections ranged from 35 to 40 percent. Attendance was more  enthusiastic in the metropolitan area than in the interior,  where the greatest absentee rates where registered.</p>

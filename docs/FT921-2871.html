			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Battle of the budgets NEVER BEFORE have voters in a general election been given a choice between two budgets. That this is so is partly an accident of timing. But it is also a credit to the Labour Party which offers a choice that is clear, but far from dramatic. Since Labour's draft Budget is a political document, deception is to be expected, as was the case in the Budget itself. The shadow Red Book argues, for example, that the recession was caused by the government's policies, but fails to note that the proximate cause was ERM membership, a policy framework for lowering inflation to which the Labour Party is also committed. The draft also calls for immediate implementation of a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme. But it fails to recognise the modest nature of the stimulus. A Labour government, too, would have to wait and hope for a recovery. Even on the 'fiscal principle that the Government should only borrow for investment', Labour merely talks a good game. The prospective fiscal deficit would be quite as large under Labour as under the Conservatives and, taken as a whole, that deficit will probably exceed investment. Moreover, the increased spending now envisaged is not for investment, except on the most elastic definition. Labour's puritanical bite is less bad than its bark. Once enquiring voters have waded through the quagmire of disinformation, however, they reach the dry land of genuine differences. Personal allowances Labour tax-raising proposals include abolition of the national insurance ceiling and a new 50 per cent income tax band, starting at gross earnings of Pounds 40,000, but increases in the basic and 40 per cent tax rate are ruled out for the next parliament. The two changes, taken together, are supposed to raise Pounds 2.87bn in the first year and Pounds 4.84bn in the second. Labour also 'saves' the Conservatives proposed 20 per cent reduced rate band, worth Pounds 1.77bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 2.32bn in 1993-94. The money is to be spent on a 10 per cent increase in personal allowances (costing Pounds 920m and Pounds 1.17bn in the first two years, respectively), abolition of the 2 per cent national insurance entrance fee (costing Pounds 720m and Pounds 1.07bn), an increase in child benefit to Pounds 9.95 (costing Pounds 315m and Pounds 750m) and increased state retirement pensions (costing Pounds 1.05bn and Pounds 2.56bn). After already announced changes in national insurance treatment of benefits in kind, a proposed tax exemption for employer assisted childcare, abolition of the incentive to opt out of the state earnings related pensions and retention of stamp duty on share transactions, Pounds 1.89bn and Pounds 3.51bn are left for increased public spending in the two years. Pensioner households Labour's proposals are more redistributive than those of the government. According to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, below a household disposable income of Pounds 399 a week the number of gainers would exceed losers. Most pensioner households would gain. So would most parents, whether single or couples. Incentives at the margin for the relatively well paid would be worse, but no more so than prior to 1988. Labour's proposals also involve more public spending. In 1993-94, for example, the difference would be Pounds 6.8bn. The sum may seem huge, but Labour's budget would raise the share of public spending in GDP merely from 43 to 44 per cent. Here then is the choice: monetary rectitude and fiscal profligacy in the blue corner and fiscal profligacy and monetary rectitude in the red one; a 'medium term financial strategy' in the blue corner and a 'strategic framework for finance and industry' in the red one; public spending kept down to 43 per cent of GDP in the blue corner and public spending up to 44 per cent of GDP in the red one; a reduced rate band of 20 per cent in the blue corner and higher fiscal allowances in the red one; lower taxes on the well off in the blue corner and higher spending on pensioners, parents, health and education in the red one. A fight is, indeed, on. But it is between products carefully positioned on either side of the the middle of the market place.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT TO DEATH AFTER RAMMING CAR  </P> <P> An Agoura man was shot to death after he used his vehicle to force another auto  off a road during a late-night chase through Agoura, the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department reported Saturday.  </P> <P> Jerry Bello, 37, was killed Friday night when he approached the vehicle of  Thomas J. Barr, 47, of Agoura Hills after forcing it off the road in the 29900  block of Agoura Road, Deputy Van Mosley said.  </P> <P> Mosley said the incident occurred about 11:20 p.m. after Barr, "in fear of his  life . . . drove to various parts of Agoura" with Bello in pursuit.  </P> <P> Bello eventually rammed Barr's vehicle, forcing it off the road, Mosley said.  When Bello approached Barr's auto, Barr shot Bello, who died at the scene,  Mosley said.  </P> <P> A restraining order had been issued against Bello earlier this year requiring  him to stay away from Barr, Mosley said. Mosley said he could not elaborate on  the dispute between the men.  </P> <P> "The circumstances surrounding this whole thing are part of the investigation,"  he said.  </P> <P> Mosley said Barr was not arrested pending completion of the investigation and  presentation of the facts to the district attorney's office.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- Estonian Interior Minister  Heiki Arike yesterday approved the working plan of the Paldiski  coordination commission. The plan maps out action before the  start of dismantling of the nuclear reactors and foresees  establishment of an emergency regime in the town for the time  the reactors are opened and nuclear fuel is being removed.    The dismantling probably begins after April 10.    Arike told BNS the leaders of the coordination commission  "maintain continuous contact with the Russian side." He said a  joint meeting will in the near future take place in Moscow to  once more go over the action during the dismantling of the  reactors.    "The Estonian and the Russian commissions will in a sense  fuse during the dismantling, because it calls for prompt  exchange of information and joint action," the interior minister  told BNS.    Estonia is responsible for security measures during the  operation. Arike said the police, the rescue services and the  border guards will be involved.    "If additional forces are needed in the area, they will be  brought in from all over Estonia, not only Tallinn," the  interior minister said.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP BIBLE STORIES  </P> <P> The convoluted non-thinking of Kris Parker and Steve Hochman is amazing.  Hochman's idea is that Parker's lyrics send "a powerful black pride message."  </P> <P> Those lyrics are based on Parker's nonsensical notion that the Bible supports  him. Hell, the Bible supports anything; it all depends on the interpreter.  Remember, Hitler was a Christian, and so was Jim Jones.  </P> <P> JAY McKEE  </P> <P> Toluca Lake  </P></p>

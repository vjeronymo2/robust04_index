			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / European real interest rates rising THE BURDEN of record levels of personal indebtedness and high real interest rates has weighed heavily on both US and UK consumers over the year. In the US there are signs that the gloom is beginning to lift: confidence about the future turned up in December. But UK consumers remain pessimistic. One reason for the recent falls in UK consumer confidence is the persistently high level of UK real interest rates. While short-term real interest rates in the US fell sharply in 1991, UK real interest rates remain at least as high as in 1990. As a result, the gap between US and UK real interest rates is now wider than at any time in the past two decades. It is not possible precisely to measure the current level of real interest rates. The real rate over the next year is equal to the current nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation over the same period. The higher inflation is, the smaller will be the real value of the principal that must be repaid, and thus the cheaper is the expected real cost of borrowing at current nominal rates. The difficulty is how to measure the inflation rate that borrowers expect in the future. Up to 1990, the chart uses annual averages of three-month nominal interest rates minus the actual inflation rate over the following year as a proxy for expected inflation. For 1991 and the latest figure, it uses OECD inflation estimates. The chart has two striking features: the general rise of real interest rates in the 1980s compared to the previous decade for all the six largest industrialised countries; and the amount of variation in short rates across countries at any one time, and for each country from year to year. Over periods of a decade or more, the level of real interest rates is not determined by the rate of growth of money but instead by the supply and demand for investment funds. In part the trend rise in real interest rates reflects the fall in the supply of private savings in the 1980s and the growth of first the US and now the German fiscal deficits; but studies have shown that the effect of government dis-saving on world real interest rates is much exaggerated. Probably more important was the rise in the demand for capital in the 1980s as profit rates rose. Yet monetary policy does have a decisive impact on the level of real interest rates in the short-run, perhaps up to four years. For example, the sharp rise in real rates between 1978 and 1981 reflects a general tightening of monetary policy. The divergence in real rates over the past year is caused by the different directions of monetary policy between Europe, and the US and Japan. US short-term interest rates have halved since 1990, while inflation is expected to remain low, reducing the real rate to below 1 per cent. Japanese real rates have fallen for the same reason. The recent rise in German interest rates has pushed real European rates in the opposite direction. German real rates have stabilised because inflation is also expected to rise. But inflation is expected to fall in the UK, France and Italy. Consequently, the recent rise in French and Italian interest rates, and the expectation of a UK rise, have forced up real rates in all these countries, to the dismay of their recession-weary consumers.

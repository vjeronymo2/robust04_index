			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: IBM treasurer to retire early IBM has announced that Mr Robert Ripp, the company treasurer, has opted for early retirement and will leave the company at the end of October. Mr Ripp's departure is the latest of several senior management changes at IBM following the appointment of Mr Louis Gerstner as chairman and chief executive in April. Last month, IBM appointed Mr Jerome York, formerly of Chrysler, as its new chief financial officer. Mr Ripp had previously been seen as a likely candidate for that position. After 29 years at IBM, Mr Ripp plans to 'pursue several entrepreneurial business opportunities,' the company said. His successor at IBM has yet to be identified. 'We do not have a successor ready to name,' an IBM spokesman said. The search for a new treasurer is expected to include potential candidates within IBM as well as outsiders. 'Bob Ripp played a key role in IBM's restructuring efforts over the last several years. He also has provided innovative treasury leadership, and recently managed the issuance of the company's first-ever preferred stock offering as part of a nearly Dollars 3bn IBM corporate financing package,' said Mr Gerstner, commenting on Mr Ripp's retirement and praising his long service to the company.</p>

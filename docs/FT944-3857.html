			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Clinton plans welfare meeting President Bill Clinton, racing to get ahead of Congressional Republicans, will convene a closed White House meeting of governors and mayors early next month to develop plans for addressing the nation's 'broken welfare system'. Mr Clinton said the current welfare system 'is a bad deal for the taxpayers who pay the bills and for the families who are trapped in it'. Welfare reform is considered one issue Republicans and Democrats can tackle together. After meeting Mr Clinton, Governor Howard Dean, a Vermont Democrat who heads the governors' association, said: 'There's real potential for some good bipartisan co-operation on welfare reform.' Mr Clinton has been talking about welfare reform since his presidential campaign, but the money has not been found to pay for job retraining and education programmes which the Administration wanted. Higher priority was given to health insurance reform. After 17 months of internal debate, the Administration finally introduced a welfare proposal, but it came too late this year for Congressional action. House Republicans are expected to propose abolition of over 100 federal social programmes providing cash, food programmes, job training, child care, foster homes and other services. The Dollars 60bn of programme funds would be cut 20 per cent and the remainder handed over to the states to finance their own programmes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said on Monday that the North Korean nuclear issue  would be referred to the UN Security Council if Pyongyang did  not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to  inspect its nuclear facilities by Feb. 21, when the IAEA Board  of Governors is to meet.    IAEA Director General Hans Blix would tell the Board of  Governors meeting the continuity of safeguards at North Korean  nuclear facilities is not maintained in that case, Han told in  his briefing session on foreign affairs for opposition  Democratic Party [DP] leaders, including chairman Yi Ki-taek, on  that morning.    Should North Korea receive IAEA inspections and resume  inter-Korean dialogue for a new round of high-level talks with  the United States, Seoul and Washington would promote a thorough  and broad dialogue with Pyongyang for complete solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Han said.    Commenting on the Patriot missile deployment issue, the  foreign minister said negotiations are under way with the United  States on whether the antimissile missiles should be deployed in  South Korea and when they should be deployed, if need be, in  order not to provoke North Korea, saying, "This is a very  sensitive point of time in the effort to solve the North Korean  nuclear issue."    The U.S. Government is positively studying a plan to deploy  Patriot batteries in South Korea at the recommendation of U.S.  Forces Korea commander Gen. Gary luck, but Seoul has asked  Washington to see to it that the U.S. press will be prudent in  reporting about the plan in view of the influence on the  on-going North Korea-IAEA negotiations and because the plan is  still under negotations between Seoul and Washington.    Minister Han said negotiations are under way with Tokyo and  Beijing on the schedules of President Kim Yong-sam's visits of  the two countries in march, adding that his visit to Russia  within the year is also being seriously studied.    To prepare for the new world trade order under the world  trade organization to be established in 1995, Han said, the  government will strengthen trade diplomacy and actively  participate in the new round of multilateral negotiations on  environment and labor.</p>

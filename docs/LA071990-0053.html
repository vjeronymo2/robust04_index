			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAUGHTER OF BRANDO MAY FACE CHARGE  </P> <P> Actor Marlon Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, faces a criminal charge in the French  territory of Tahiti in the shooting death of her boyfriend in Los Angeles, the  dead man's father said Wednesday.  </P> <P> But the charge could be little more than a legal formality, observers in Tahiti  said.  </P> <P> Brando's son, Christian, 32, faces murder charges in Los Angeles for allegedly  fatally wounding Cheyenne's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, 26, at the actor's Santa  Monica Mountains estate on May 16.  </P> <P> Drollet's father, Jacques Drollet, said he filed a charge -- the equivalent of  filing a complaint in this country -- in Papeete, Tahiti, on July 2 against  Christian Brando for the purpose of allowing French authorities to question  anyone in Tahiti who might have been present and involved in his son's killing.  </P> <P> Drollet, an influential political figure in Tahiti, said Cheyenne Brando, 20,  was charged Wednesday, but he said he did not know the specific charge.  </P> <P> Reuters news service reported that Cheyenne Brando was charged with complicity  to murder Dag Drollet -- a charge tantamount to being an accomplice and  carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment upon conviction.  </P> <P> However, the examining magistrate in the case, Max Gatti, refused to confirm  that any charges had been brought.  </P> <P> Drollet said Gatti questioned Cheyenne Brando for four hours on Tuesday. She is  not in custody, but has been forbidden to leave the island, Drollet said.  </P> <P> While not confirming that Cheyenne Brando had been charged, Gatti said charging  a person can be a mere formality under French law. In fact, a person suspected  of a crime may ask to be charged in order to be able to have an attorney  present at any questioning.  </P> <P> Gatti said he plans to give information from his investigation to authorities  in Los Angeles, and that it is possible that Cheyenne Brando could be tried in  Tahiti independent of her half-brother's trial in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Cheyenne Brando gave birth to a son by Dag Drollet on June 30, shortly after  arriving in Tahiti from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Christian Brando has told police he shot Drollet accidentally during a struggle  after he angrily accused Drollet of "slapping Cheyenne around." Homicide  investigators said there was no sign of a struggle at the shooting scene.  </P> <P> Detectives said Marlon Brando told them that his daughter had suffered  "psychological problems" following a serious traffic accident and had made  numerous unfounded allegations in the past against family members.  </P> <P> Christian Brando's preliminary hearing to determine whether he will stand trial  for murder in Drollet's killing will begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior  Court.  </P></p>

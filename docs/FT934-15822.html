			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ASH shares fall 23% on profits warning SHARES IN Automated Sec-urity (Holdings), the international electronic security systems company, plunged by nearly 23 per cent after the group issued a profits warning yesterday. In a related development, de Zoete &amp; Bevan, ASH's joint stockbroker for 10 years, resigned in a row over the group's enhanced scrip dividend. ASH had rejected its advice that it should revise the terms of the dividend after the profits warning. The share price fall was initially much steeper because of a mistake in the Stock Exchange announcement at 11.44am. Losses against discontinued operations were shown as Pounds 32m instead of Pounds 2m. Before a correction was announced at 12.05pm, the shares hit a low of 90p. They recovered to close at 102p, down 30p from Thursday's close. The group warned that its pre-tax profit for the nine months to September 30, which will be announced next week, would be Pounds 9m after charging losses for discontinued operations of about Pounds 2m and an additional Pounds 1m for further reorganisation costs. The results for the full year would be 'significantly below market expectations,' it said. One analyst said: 'The company has a history of disappointing, and a history of poor share price performance in front of disappointment. I've pretty much washed my hands of it'. Mr Tom Buffet, chairman, said the market had been expecting full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m to Pounds 18m. In July the group reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.13m on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 74.3m. Mr Buffet said the Pounds 2m reflected the cost of closing the fire systems division whose main business is contract fire alarms. The Pounds 1m costs were incurred in finalising the reorganisation. He described California, where one of the group's main businesses is based, as 'a very deeply hit market.' In late afternoon, the group issued a further trading statement noting that 'the market for alarm verification systems continues to develop.' The group, which claims to be a world leader in this sector through its TVX and Sonitrol technology, cited an announcement from the Los Angeles Police Department that 'verified alarms such as those provided by ASH will receive higher priority than normal unverified alarm systems.' Mr Buffet said earlier that 60 per cent of the group's shareholders were based in the US.</p>

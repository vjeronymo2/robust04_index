			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Alexey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] New Delhi June 16 TASS -- India is looking into the  possibility of buying a batch of Russian SU-30 fighter planes.  A high-ranking delegation from India's military department,  headed by Air Force Vice-Marshal Krishnaswami, has already  departed for Russia, ITAR-TASS learned from a reliable source.    The Indian delegation intends to visit the Irkutsk aviation  factory, which produces the SU-30 planes, and to hold several  meetings with leaders in Russia's defence industry. Indian  pilots will take the fighter out for a test flight, after which  the contract negotiations will enter their final phase.    According to ITAR-TASS sources, Russia is ready to give  India  enough credits to buy 20 SU-30 fighters and to purchase a  production license for the planes. India plans to manufacture  them at the aviation factories in Nasik (Maharashtra State).  This order should help India take advantage of the production  capabilities it built up for the MiG-27 Soviet fighters-bombers,  whose production license will soon run out.    Indian specialists stress that the Russian SU-30, equipped  with all the latest technology, is as good as the American F-18  and the European "Tornado", and is superior to the F-16 and the  French "Mirage-2000".    The Russian fighter has powerful weapons: a 30-mm gun and  ten  rockets of various kinds. It is also equipped with the  capability to refuel in mid-flight, which widens its ability to  search out and destroy air and land targets.</p>

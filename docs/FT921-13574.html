			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Cementia sees 'similar' half CEMENTIA, the Swiss sub-holding company in the Lafarge Coppee cement group, expects net income in the second half of last year to be 'similar' to the SFr38.1m (Dollars 27m) reported in the first half. That would indicate a slight improvement on the SFr72m in net income recorded in 1990. 'This is a considerable achievement in view of performances of other companies in our sector,' Mr Ernst Schneider, who became chairman on January 1, said in a letter to shareholders. The growth was achieved as a result of restructuring in the US and strong performances in the Indian Ocean area and in Austria and Kenya. Due to bleak market conditions in Ontario, Lafarge Corp of the US, in which Cementia has had an 11 per cent holding since a restructuring of Lafarge interests in North America last June, will suffer a full year loss. However, due to a positive result in the second half, it will make a contribution to Cementia's profits. Von Roll, the Swiss steel and engineering group in which Proventus, the Swedish investment house, bought a 22.8 per cent stake last month, said on Friday in a preliminary statement that it suffered a loss in 1991. Von Roll warned last summer that it expected a sharp drop this year in consolidated net income from the SFr58m earned in 1990. It said that its reverse was due to the severe recession in the Swiss building industry as well as a marked downturn among all steel products and problems in its Isola wire subsidiary. It did not give a specific figure for the loss but said consolidated sales dropped 6.7 per cent to SFr2.3bn. New orders tumbled 13.7 per cent to SFr2.3bn. Group first-quarter sales at Landis &amp; Gyr rose 15 per cent and order intake remained strong, Mr Willy Kissling, chief executive, said at the Swiss building and energy controls and telecoms equipment group's annual press conference. However, the directors expected that growth in turnover and profits would be somewhat lower than the very high levels achieved last year.</p>

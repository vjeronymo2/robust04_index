Federal support must be requested annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A notice which announced this grant cycle was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 3, 1993 at 58 FR 58703, and proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference. No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. Therefore, the percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed, except that a technical correction has been made in the definition for ``high rate.'' The final minimum percentages are shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990&hyph;91, 1991&hyph;92 or 1992&hyph;93 who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Public health nurse graduates can be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If additional programmatic information is needed, please contact:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ms. Donna English,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Division of Nursing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bureau of Health Professions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Resources and Services Administration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parklawn Building, Room 9&hyph;36,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5600 Fishers Lane,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rockville, Maryland 20857,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Telephone: (301) 443&hyph;5763 FAX: (301) 443&hyph;8586. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program, Grants for Professional Nurse Traineeships, is listed at 93.358 in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

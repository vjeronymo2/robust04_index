			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. M. Kats, R. M. Dlubovskiy, L. M. Kutovaya, </F> and I. V. Makarenko, Physics SRI at Odessa State University;  UDC677.494.675:677.027.622]    [Abstract] A partial list of some of the uses of ionite  fibers includes treatment of drinking water, leaching of  valuable components from effluents, removal of pollutants from  air and gases, and treating electroplating effluents. However,  the published data on ionite fibers is not systematized and  often has a qualified character. This is especially true in the  case of treating drinking water, where several heavy metal ions  may be present simultaneously. In the present work the  quantitative characteristics of the adsorption of copper ions  from aqueous solutions on VION KN-1 (sodium form) chemosorption  fiber, and the sorption capacity of the fiber under both static  and dynamic conditions were determined in the case of aqueous  solutions containing also mixtures of copper, lead and  manganese.

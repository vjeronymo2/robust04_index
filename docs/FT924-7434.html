			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Fears grow of credit crunch for small companies JAPAN'S Industry ministry is becoming increasingly concerned that the country's small and medium-sized companies may be suffering a credit crunch as hard-pressed banks cut their lending. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister for International Trade and Industry ,speaking after a meeting yesterday with the leaders of four small business associations, said he would ask the banks 'to carefully consider that they need not refrain from lending money.' He was responding to growing criticism from small businesses that banks are increasingly reluctant to lend to small companies because they are trying to reduce their mounting bad loans. Small companies with less than 100 employees account for about 56 per cent of employment in Japan. They are far more dependent on bank lending than large companies. Figures published last week showed that small companies accounted for most of the sharp increase in corporate bankruptcies over the past year. Senior Bank of Japan officials said that government funds to provide small business finance would probably be increased to prevent a private sector credit crunch. The small business leaders pressed Mr Watanabe for early implementation of the supplementary budget needed to enact the Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.9bn) emergency package announced in August. The sluggish state of the Japanese economy was confirmed by figures from industry and retailing. Steel production in October was 8.1 per cent below last year, according to the Japan Iron and Steel Federation. Sales at 27 department stores in the Tokyo area fell last month, for the eighth month in a row, by 4.9 per cent to Y233bn. Wholesale prices fell 0.4 per cent in October from the previous month.</p>

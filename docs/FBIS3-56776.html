			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The family of Zviad Gamsakhurdia has agreed to a  post mortem examination of the body of the Georgian  ex-president, who committed suicide on the night from December  31 to January 1 in Western Georgia. The examination must be  held with international observers, Interfax learnt from sources  in the Georgian Prosecutor General's Office.    A Georgian Security Ministry spokesman has told Interfax  that  the arrival in the republic of international experts and members  of the Gamsakhurdia family is possible shortly.    Zviadists who control the village of Djikhashkari in western  Georgia where Gamsakhurdia is presumably buried are not so far  allowing representatives of the present authorities or  journalists to the village.    The village is guarded, Interfax was told, by a large group  of Zviadists who are armed with tanks, artillery pieces and  rocket launchers.    As it has become known to Interfax from unofficial sources,  representatives of the Georgian authorities are negotiating the  issue with Zviadists. The talks have provided no results yet  because the authorities demand the extradition of Gamsakhurdia's  body and Zviadists' disarmament.</p>

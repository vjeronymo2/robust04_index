			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Fininvest sells supermarkets Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group owned by out-going premier Silvio Berlusconi, is to announce today the L950bn (Pounds 375m) sale of part of its retailing interests to a consortium of the Benetton clothing group and Luxottica, the spectacles producer. The deal involves hiving off the Euromercato supermarkets from Fininvest's stores and retailing division which are grouped under the umbrella of the Standa chain of stores. The division has a total turnover of L5,200bn. The sale of Euromercato will cut turnover by L1,200bn. The sale was indirectly confirmed last night by Mr Giancarlo Foscale, head of the Standa group and a cousin of Mr Berlusconi who told Ansa, the Italian national news agency: 'I can't say to whom we will sell Euromercato as there are talks with Benetton and Luxottica; but the COOP could also come in even though this is less likely since behind them were other partners including Rinascente (the Fiat group).' The sell-off marks an important stage in the reorganisation of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest under the management of Mr Franco Tato. But it also signals the rapidly expanding ambitions in the retail field of the Benetton family and Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of Luxottica. Only two months ago they broke into this field, teaming up with Switzerland's Movenpick, to pay L2,100bn for the GS-Autogrill group being privatised by IRI, the state holding company. The cash proceeds from Euromercato will be used to reduce Fininvest's overall debt burden which last year totalled L3,920bn on a turnover of L11,552bn.</p>

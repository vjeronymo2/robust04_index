			<p>BFN     [Text] The contact group this evening held talks with  Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic, Presidency member Ejup  Ganic, and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. The contact group  arrived in Sarajevo at around 2100, following talks with the  aggressor Serb side in Pale. Members of the contact group  comprising representatives of the United States, Russia, the  European Union, Germany, Great Britain, and the United Nations  will be staying in our country over the next two days.    Following the talks at the Presidency, U.S. President  Clinton's special envoy Charles Redman said: We conducted  exhaustive and serious talks this evening, and we heard the  views of all the participants. Our job now is to study all  these ideas and choose those that we will present to our  governments and ministers, who will be meeting next week.    Let us now hear what Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President  Alija Izetbegovic said after the talks with the contact group  for Bosnia-Herzegovina:    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We [word indistinct] told the  contact group that, in our opinion, the prospects for peace have  become more remote compared to the situation of 20 days ago. We  believe that the behavior of UN officials--especially Mr.  Akashi--has ruined the chances of a speedy restoration of peace  that was (?in the offing). In fact, we have noticed that UN  officials-- certain officials and especially Mr. Akashi--do not  honor UN decisions, and the Serb side does not heed them because  they do not respect their own resolutions.    That was obvious in the case of Sarajevo, and especially  [passage indistinct] where heavy artillery is still within a 20  km range. Especially, (?you know about) the incident today, an  absurd incident when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helped  chetnik tanks cross the Sarajevo exclusion zone to a new  position in order to be able to attack us tomorrow in [word  indistinct]. As you know, that was the reason why we demanded  Mr. Akashi's resignation, because our government can no longer  cooperate with him after all these major mistakes that, let me  repeat, we believe have ruined the realistic chances of a speedy  restoration of peace.    Of course, we stressed once again to the working  group--whose  efforts we respect because they have come with the best  intentions to do what they can here--we repeated that the  conditions for peace are very simple: the preservation of a  sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, the preservation of its  external borders and the return of the occupied areas. We want  peace to be restored, and we are therefore open to negotiations  under the conditions I have just stated. We do not deny the  possibility to restore peace, and we are in favor of it.

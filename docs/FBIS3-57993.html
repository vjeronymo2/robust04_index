			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Hakala: "Appeal of Western Defense </F> Alliance Has Diminished; Over a Fourth of Finns Would Lay  Emphasis on Defense Funding"]    [Text] Basing our national defense on the support of the  Western powers seems to have somewhat lost its appeal over the  past year. Support for nonalignment has correspondingly  increased a bit.    Less than a third of all Finns, 29 percent, think that  allying ourselves with the Western powers in time of war is the  best national defense alternative. The figure produced by the  latest opinion poll is 6 percentage points fewer than the one  obtained in a similar poll a year ago.    Support for nonalignment has correspondingly increased  slightly. The number of Finns who support an increase in  appropriations for defense has also clearly increased: 27  percent want to increase appropriations for the Army. Just last  spring, only 14 percent of the respondents were in favor of  raising them.    Finns now view increasing appropriations for it with as much  enthusiasm as they did during the peak of the economic boom in  the final years of the past decade.    The National Defense Information Planning Board commissioned  the Finnish Gallup Company to conduct the opinion poll in the  latter half of October. Participating in the poll were 1,053  Finns over age 15, who were interviewed in person. A similar  poll is conducted twice a year.    Planning Board chief secretary Pertti Alanen thinks that the  drop in support for alliance with the West is statistically "of  slight significance." On the other hand, support for full  alliance with the Western defense system, with bases located and  Western troops stationed in Finland, has increased during the  past year. The 2-percentage-point difference may, of course, be  just a statistical error.    How Finns react to cooperation with Russia in time of war  was  not polled before. But now, 2 percent of them feel it is the  best solution, while 49 percent think it is the worst model.    Thirty-one percent of the poll respondents would interfere  with Aland's demilitarized status. This was the first time the  issue was raised and the respondents were residents of mainland  Finland; Aland residents were not included in the poll sampling.    It was argued that there was a need for changing the  situation by, among other things, eliminating exemptions--that  is, a desire to get Aland residents into the Army and the  necessity of defending Aland.    Thirty-six percent of the respondents felt that a change in  Aland's status is necessary, and 32 percent thought it would be  needlessly difficult to define that position. The men, in  particular, wanted changes. Nearly half of the women under age  35 would leave Aland in peace.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Best Soltion for Defense(distribution of opinions in percentages)            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1992                     |1993                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No military alliances    |36                       |39                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cooperation with the Wes-|35                       |29                       |  |t in time of war         |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Joining a Western milita-|9                        |11                       |  |ry alliance, troops and  |                         |                         |  |bases in Finland         |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cooperation with Russia  |--                       |2                        |  |in time of war           |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Defense alliance with Sw-|11                       |11                       |  |eden                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Something else or cannot |9                        |8                        |  |say                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

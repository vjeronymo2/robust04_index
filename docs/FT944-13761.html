			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: UDO UDO Holdings, the supplier of drawing office equipment and reprographic services, attributed a 32 per cent rise in annual profits to its cost-cutting programme and emphasis on high margin products. In the year to July 31, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 4.91m despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 48.5m to Pounds 47m. Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said the improvement reflected savings achieved by a redundancy programme and renewed emphasis on higher margin products, especially in the colour imaging services. Earnings per share rose by 32 per cent to 11.85p (8.99p), and the proposed final dividend of 5.78p makes a total of 8p (7.2p), up 11 per cent.</p>

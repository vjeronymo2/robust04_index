			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Rail strike threat Signalling staff employed by Railtrack, the body which runs the infrastructure of the British railway system, are threatening a strike for this Wednesday. RMT, the union which represents the staff involved in the pay dispute, said further talks were due to be held today. However, union officials said much of the goodwill built up in recent talks had been squandered. The signalling staff voted for 24-hour strikes on June 15 and June 22.</p>

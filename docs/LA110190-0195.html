			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS;  </P> <P> FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> A HEAVYWEIGHT;  </P> <P> THE 1980 FILM CLASSIC 'RAGING BULL' WILL BE FEATURED SUNDAY AT THE OJAI  PLAYHOUSE.  </P> <P> At two hours and eight minutes, the Academy Award-winning film "Raging Bull"  lasts nearly two hours and one minute longer than last week's championship  heavyweight boxing match.  </P> <P> Not only that, the fight scenes in the movie are better.  </P> <P> The 1980 hit starring Robert De Niro will be the Sunday attraction at the Ojai  Playhouse, courtesy of the Ojai Film Society. "Raging Bull" is the story of  real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, whose personal life was often more painful than  his professional one.  </P> <P> Last month the film was selected as one of the 1990 additions to the National  Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Each year since 1988, 25 films that  are considered culturally, historically or aesthetically significant have been  chosen for the list.  </P> <P> "Raging Bull" was also selected by many movie experts as one of the Top 10  movies of the 1980s and was voted the No. 1 movie of the 1980s in an American  Film magazine poll of 54 critics.  </P> <P> "It's an American classic," said Film Society head Hal Janover, who called the  movie's director, Martin Scorsese, "one of the best filmmakers we have." He  also lauded the "great performances by De Niro and Joe Pesci."  </P> <P> De Niro and editor Thelma Schoonmaker won Oscars for their work in "Raging  Bull" and Scorsese and the movie itself were nominated for two others.  </P> <P> The movie will begin at 4:30 p.m. The theater is at 145 E. Ojai Ave.  </P> <P> Ventura College's Community Services Department will be showing "Greatness of  Spain" Nov. 8 as the second presentation in the Travel Film Series. The film  will be shown in the Ventura College Theater at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $3  general admission and $2.50 seniors for the early presentation, and $3.50 and  $3 for the evening show. Ventura College is at 4667 Telegraph Road.  </P> <P> If Spain is a little too exotic, maybe Catalina Island will do the trick. On  Nov. 4 the Albinger Archeological Museum in Ventura will show the 20-minute  video "Catalina: A Treasure from the Past," narrated by actor Peter Graves.  </P> <P> The video offers a look at archeological finds made on the island, and quite a  bit of information is provided on the island's history -- including customs and  lifestyles of the Native American inhabitants before the arrival of the  Spanish. Show time is 1 p.m. The museum is at 113 E. Main St. LEO SMITH  </P></p>

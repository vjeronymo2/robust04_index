			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trizec negotiating CDollars 600m injection of equity in shake-up Trizec, the biggest property unit in Toronto's Edper-Hees group, is negotiating a CDollars 600m (USDollars 438m) equity infusion which would form the basis of a revised recapitalisation. Trizec, which is controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, is restructuring its debt. It was affected by the collapse in North American property values that began in 1990, and its debt totals nearly CDollars 2bn at the corporate level, plus a further CDollars 3bn due in five years in the operating subsidiaries. The Calgary-based group, one of North America's fastest growing development companies, last week won an Alberta court order delaying enforcement proceedings by senior and junior debenture holders until March 31. Trizec said that this would give it time to complete negotiations for the third-party cash infusion. Last August, Trizec proposed a recapitalisation to handle debt maturing in five years. Debt holders would have ended up with 49 per cent of the equity of the reorganised company and the Bronfmans would have lost control. Last January, the senior debt holders presented a counter-proposal but an agreement was not possible, Trizec said in a statement. It then tried to raise new equity and 'several sophisticated investors' began due-diligence proceedings. In the past week, Trizec said, the plan for a third-party infusion of CDollars 600m was tabled, partly to buy senior debentures and partly to strengthen the company's equity base. It asked the senior debenture holders for extra time to finalise negotiations, but they refused and accelerated payment of all debentures under the March 19 1994 trust deed. Trizec said Saturday's court delay 'will provide the time needed to complete the talks'. The plan would require a vote by all debt holders and shareholders and court approval. The group retains about 80 office buildings and shopping centres totalling 54m square feet of commercial space (77 per cent in the US and 23 per cent in Canada). It recently sold its chain of nursing homes. In the year ending October 31 last, the loss was CDollars 312m, including CDollars 287m in write-downs and losses on undeveloped properties and cash flow remain insufficient to service debt. Its holding in a sister company, Bramalea, was written off in 1992.</p>

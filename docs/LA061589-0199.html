			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> In an article in The Times on June 6, the Associated Press incorrectly reported  that Nicaragua supported the military crackdown in Beijing. Nicaragua's  official newspaper Barricada cited Chinese leaders' claims that the attack  avoided chaos and greater bloodshed, but the newspaper did not express support.  On June 9, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua "cannot applaud the violence  in Asian countries such as China or against the Palestinian or South African  people."  </P></p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Keeping the lid on pay rises: The public sector is unlikely to rebel over a freeze on wages Will the public sector lead a revolt against the UK government's economic strategy? Four days after the announcement from Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, that public sector pay bills would be frozen next year, and four days before unions meet at TUC headquarters to plan their resistance, the answer is: probably not. Nearly a quarter of British workers are employed in the public sector, but attitudes towards it remain ambivalent - a mixture of admiration for the health and emergency services and disdain for much of central and local government. The planned pay bill freeze did not provoke an immediate wave of revulsion similar to last year's pit closure plan. But neither did tabloid newspapers strongly support the government's plan to pay wage increases only for those workers who improve productivity. The editorial in The Sun newspaper asked: 'How can a nurse be more productive . . . Carry two bedpans at once?' The public sector unions, representing more than 70 per cent of the 5.5m public sector workers, are also in uncertain mood. Privately, some union officials doubt a TUC co-ordinated campaign would have much effect, and fear that 'demagogic public sector union leaders outbidding each other in bellicosity will let the government off the hook', as one senior official put it. Sceptical, too, about industrial action is the Labour head of personnel in one inner-London borough: 'Legal restrictions make it difficult for the activists to set things alight these days. And are people really going to take to the streets for social workers on Pounds 22,000 a year who, like virtually all our employees, still have excellent job security?' Nonetheless, there are low-paid parts of the public sector which attract public support. The Fire Brigades Union will be doing its best to embarrass the government, despite the fact that its own privileged pay formula looks certain to be reinstated next year after this year's pay curbs. Many activists in the all-embracing new public services union, Unison, will also want to show off the union's muscle. But by allowing for pay rises based on improvements in efficiency, the government is defusing much potential discontent. Many public sector workers, probably even most, will get rises of some kind, in the order of 1-3 per cent. From the government's point of view the pay bill freeze has the double advantage of capping the single largest item of public expenditure - the public sector pay bill is Pounds 87.3bn for 1994-95 - while hastening the transformation of bargaining from national to local level. One public sector manager said yesterday that it would provide just the 'leverage' that he needs to make pay bargaining more flexible after the 'straitjacket' of the national 1.5 per cent limit this year. These benefits would seem justification enough for the freeze without claiming, as some ministers are doing, that in a 'post-inflationary' era the annual pay rise is dead. This claim is premature: not only is inflation expected to be back over 3 per cent next year but the private sector is less of a model than it might seem. Manufacturing industry is witnessing a sharp reduction in unit labour costs as output picks up. But for those who have kept their jobs (in a sector which has shed about 17 per cent of its workers in the past three years) earnings are rising at 5 per cent a year, nearly three times the rate of inflation. Pay freezes in the private sector have been more common in the latest recession than the early 1980s. But according to the Confederation of British Industry, only 12 per cent of companies had freezes last year. Also, the revival of interest in pay deals of longer than one year has been modest, as in past periods of relatively steady inflation, according to pay analysts. What might be changing is that a greater divergence between pay rises in the public and private sectors is now possible partly because of high unemployment. A widening gap would allow the government to squeeze public sector pay not just for the sake of its own balance sheet, but also to send a clear signal of restraint to the private sector. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, claims the current 1.5 per cent limit on public sector wages has helped to cut 1 percentage point off private sector pay this year. Over the past 15 years, pay rises in the two sectors have oscillated around each other. The private sector usually pulls ahead in economic upswings with the public sector clawing back in downturns or just before elections. Average pay in the public sector (Pounds 308 a week) in 1992 was slightly higher than in the private sector (Pounds 303 a week) but that is usually the case because the public sector has, proportionately, more white-collar and professional staff. Comparing similar jobs, such as middle managers, the private sector usually pays slightly better, except for women and the low-paid. Looking at annual pay increases since 1979, one finds the private sector has risen slightly faster than the public sector and is expected to open up a 6-7 percentage point gap as a result of public sector pay restrictions this year and next. That may have a negative effect on morale, and therefore on services, as several of the five independent public sector pay review bodies have argued in the past. But at a time of high unemployment it will not necessarily cause people to leave their jobs for the private sector, especially as many public sector jobs do not have a parallel in the private sector. The case for pay parity in the public sector is often countered by the argument that employees enjoy greater job security. That has been true through this recession, but could be ending as public sector managers offer big pay rises in exchange for changes in working practices and job cuts. The outcome could resemble the big increases in pay and job cuts experienced by the utilities privatisation. If the effect of privatisation is stripped out, the public sector can be seen still to employ nearly as many people as it did 15 years ago. But in the next two or three years, hundreds of thousands of jobs could go. Mr Eric Caines, former head of personnel at the NHS, believes nearly one-fifth of 950,000 jobs in the health service could be cut. One civil service manager pointed out that a recruitment freeze throughout the public sector for one year would mean 'losing' nearly 500,000 new jobs but would allow remaining staff a pay rise of well over 5 per cent. The fear of public sector managers is not so much that the unions will opt for jobs rather than pay rises but that the government will want to keep the proceeds of any savings. 'The Treasury will want to have its cake and eat it, too,' said one manager. For the time being, the government appears to have judged the mood of the country correctly, and is unlikely to face more than scattered local strikes. But, as one government economist put it: 'The Pounds 2.5bn we save now on public sector pay we could easily lose over the next two or three years from the increase in unemployment created by speeding up the public sector shake-out.' In which case, what looks like a good idea next year might not look so good for Mr Clarke and the government as the next election approaches.</p>

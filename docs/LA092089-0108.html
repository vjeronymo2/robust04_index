			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TUSTIN TO FIGHT PORN, SEIZE NEWS RACKS ON CITY LAND  </P> <P> Acting to curb the distribution of sexually explicit publications, the Tustin  City Council has moved to confiscate 35 news racks on city property.  </P> <P> The council decided unanimously Monday that the racks will be impounded if not  removed by their owners within in three days after receiving a notice from the  city.  </P> <P> Most news racks in the city are on private property and thus will not be  affected by the council's policy. Only a few of the news racks on city property  contain sexually explicit publications.  </P> <P> "We need to take swift action on this," said Councilman John Kelly, asking the  council to enforce a 1973 ordinance that bars obstructing city streets or  alleys. Kelly said the city has failed to enforce the ordinance in recent  years.  </P> <P> The council took the action in response to concerns over racks containing  adult-oriented publications. Council members said the appearance of the  publications on city property did not fit the image Tustin is trying to  project.  </P> <P> "I think each of us on the City Council is committed to preserving a wholesome,  positive life style," Councilman Richard B. Edgar said. "The challenge is to  preserve that life style."  </P> <P> But the council did not agree on what to do with any racks seized on public  property. Kelly urged the council to destroy them and the publications or send  the racks "back to wherever they came from," at the owners' expense.  </P> <P> But Edgar and Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey objected, with Hoesterey  suggesting that the city auction any seized racks.  </P> <P> "We don't know where all these newsstands came from," Hoesterey said. "I don't  want to have to mail them across the country or up to San Francisco."  </P> <P> The council had confiscated some racks containing sexually explicit  publications last month, when Councilman Earl J. Prescott spotted them on 1st  Street.  </P> <P> But City Atty. James G. Rourke had them returned after telling the council that  a Supreme Court decision prohibits the removal of news racks on the basis of  content.  </P> <P> Rourke said most of the racks on city property belong to The Times Orange  County Edition, the Orange County Register and the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.  He cautioned council members that the city would "not be well advised to start  picking up stands and carting them off."  </P> <P> A spokesman for The Times' circulation department said just three of the  paper's 66 news racks in Tustin would be affected by the council's action.  However, the paper has asked to meet with city officials to discuss the policy.  </P> <P> "While it will have little effect on circulation, the problem you get into is  that it sets a precedent," said Al Brewer, street sales manager for The Times.  "No matter if it is one rack or many, it is of the same importance."  </P> <P> Brewer said The Times will try to work with city officials to reach a  resolution that meets the needs of all parties.  </P> <P> Dick Wallace, general manager of the Orange County Register, said he did not  think the move would have much impact on the newspaper's circulation.  </P> <P> "Most of our racks are on private property, so we don't anticipate any  problems," Wallace said.  </P></p>

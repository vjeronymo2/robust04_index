			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (6): Uncertainty over expansion plans - Swift / A look at the cross-border financial message network For global custodians, there are few more vital matters than being able to settle securities transactions on behalf of clients safely and quickly. Without an efficient method of doing so, custodians face not only high costs, but the financial risks of settlement failure. The large US custodians might therefore have been expected to welcome a move by Swift, the Belgian-based cross-border financial message network, to provide a computer matching and reconciliation facility which can be used by all custodians and fund managers to track their transactions. It was not to be. Instead, SwiftAsset Reconciliation was criticised on its launch at Swift's Sibos payments conference in Boston last month for being an inappropriate venture. The idea of easy access to such a tool for all Swift's 4,000 customers did not please the largest custodians. Ms Vivian Eversole, executive vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank, argued that Swift, which is owned by 2,230 banks, should concentrate on its core service of delivering financial messages rather than producing 'value-added' products for market participants. The question of how it can avoid competing with its own shareholders has become crucial for Swift as it mounts an ambitious push into the securities market, broadening its roots as a means for banks to exchange payments, foreign exchange and money markets messages. There is a clear logic to Swift's securities ambitions. Swift itself estimates that the growth in global investment means that there will be 1bn securities messages exchanged annually by 1997. Yet members exchanged only 21m securities messages - a fifth of total traffic - during last year. Tony Kirby, Swift's director of securities markets, says that falling settlement times mean that it is increasingly difficult to exchange paper confirmations of trades. 'You have to be connected electronically, or you can imagine telexes and faxes blocking the world's financial arteries,' he says. This has given Swift an opportunity which it might have found harder to capitalise on two years ago. The network then had a reputation for over-spending, and being unresponsive to its users. Although it had admitted fund managers in 1992, it was still levying relatively high transaction charges. Since then, the network has undergone a substantial reform led by top management. Leonard Shrank, the chief executive recruited from Chase Manhattan two years ago, has engineered cuts in the entry fees and tariffs for use of the network because of reduced expenses and higher volumes. Mr Kirby says there is no conflict between Swift developing securities services and the interest of members such as large global custodians. He says that if the maximum number of participants is connected electronically and can exchange information 'it will reduce the risks for everybody'. Yet Swift now faces uncertainty over how it should develop its securities activities. Mr Kirby argues that it can play a pivotal role in lowering the automation costs of new operators. Some of this effect has already been seen in the relative enthusiasm of smaller fund managers for the network. 'The reason we are looking at added-value services is to attract newer participants. If the maximum number of parties is connected electronically, it will reduce the risks for everybody,' he says. It would also allow smaller fund managers and custodians to provide sophisticated services. Mr Kirby points to two advantages for fund managers in services such as SwiftAsset Reconciliation. First, he says it will improve the quality of information they receive on the their trades. This will 'enable them to alert their bank' if there is a problem rather than waiting to be informed. A second advantage, he says, is that 'it is crazy for a fund manager to use every type of proprietary system that a bank comes up with'. If they use systems which are standard across the whole industry, this means that they will be able 'to switch custodians fairly cleanly' if they wish. He combines this ambition with a clear statement that Swift does not want to 'replace the banks' proprietary systems'. Yet there is clearly a potential for conflict with custodians that provide high margin services for customers by gathering such information through their proprietary systems. The scope for conflict in securities activities is greater than in some of Swift's potential payment and foreign exchange services because banks wanted to act as an intermediary there. But plans such as centralised matching of securities trades by 1997 could threaten the existing role of custodians. In her Sibos speech, Ms Eversole argued that such value-added products were not an integral part of its strategy of attending to the needs of its most important customers - banks. Instead, she said Swift should be 'focused on building the information autobahn of the financial world'. Yet the distinction between Swift's different categories of customers is likely to become increasingly blurred. Its move to admit fund managers in 1992 may be followed shortly by a similar decision to allow limited access to big corporate users, further diversifying its customer base. Furthermore, as global custodianship consolidates further, it may be difficult for the few large banks that specialise in the activity to exert a controlling influence on Swift. Small banks may in contrast be happy to see it develop value-added services to lower the cost of entry for such activities. Mr Kirby says that Swift's managers 'respect the position of the large global custodians' but points out that Swift's board decided on the strategy. He says that Swift wants to 'work with global custodians to define exactly what we mean by value-added services' now the debate has surfaced. He argues that 'today's added-value service is tomorrow's commodity' in the fast-evolving world of custodianship. This means that Swift should be able to focus on activities which do not conflict with global custodian shareholders. This is likely to be one of its largest challenges in the future.</p>

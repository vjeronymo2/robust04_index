This yearning, which grows  more urgent by the day, is both legitimate and understandable.  After nearly three and a half decades of hopes raised and hopes  dashed it should not be surprising that Nigerians are weary and  worried. Having gone through several years in which their faith  in the national enterprise has been abused and affronted, our  people's impatience with the government and almost total  distrust of its functionaries can no longer be dismissed as mere  cynical.    At the birth of this nation 33 years ago, expectations were  high and the possibilities for greatness were almost limitless.  We appeared set for grand attainment to fulfill what the rest  of the world saw as our manifest destiny to lead the black race  into the mainstream of human civilization. But just as it  seemed as if our sun was rising, twilight came and we have been  groping ever since waiting for a new dawn. That we must  recommence our journey to greatness is clear enough. What is  not clear is the state of the vehicle with which to embark on  that journey. Therefore, even as we yearn fervently for a  speedy arrival at our destination, there is a need for us to  pause and ponder as to the shape of the vehicle in which we sit  to make our journey. Nigeria is today like a vehicle which has  been reduced to a cannibalized contraption. It is a vehicle  heavily buffeted by the elements and badly battered by its  users. No one undertakes a journey with such a contraption.  When confronted with such a situation, the sensible thing to do  is to commence in earnest extensive repair works having  established the causes and sources of the damage. This, in a  nutshell, is the assignment with which this administration is  now saddled.    Point of departure: In my maiden address to the nation on  Thursday, 18 November 1993, I did touch on some of the factors  that necessitated our positive intervention. In the course of  this address I shall elaborate on those factors as a way of  placing the specific measures adopted by the budget in proper  context. Firstly, it must be obvious by now that our country  has gone through one of the most difficult phases any nation has  ever had to go through. On the economic front, enormous  sacrifices were demanded from our people to undo the near total  damage done to the national economy in the days of careless  wastage. Nigerians readily made the required sacrifices only to  find out that their gesture was not matched with expected  results. All through the past decade or so the nation's  economic foundations had been badly shaken and our cherished  values almost totally subverted. In all these our people  sought and found solace in the expectation that a new political  order was in the making, which, when instituted would make the  economic misfortune more bearable and the required sacrifices  less harrowing. Our people gave all that it took to institute  that new order, believing in the wisdom of the sage which said:  Seek ye first the political kingdom and every other thing shall  be added unto it. For eight years our people sought the  political kingdom and conscientiously too. But just as the new  political dispensation began to take shape, it suffers a  horrendous blow. Months after that debacle our country is yet  to recover from the impact of that rude shock which took the  nation back to a point below zero level.    At the height of the crisis no aspect of society was spared  and no public institution escaped its destructive fallout. Our  country was drifting in a manner that not only threatened the  ship of state, but indeed, also the entire foundation of our  existence as a national entity. It was in the midst of this  dangerous drift that we found it necessary to step in to check  the incipient chaos and secure the integrity of Nigeria as an  indissoluble federation. We did so like other key players of the  political class who were involved in an elaborate game that  became a riotous event. We make no pretensions about capability  but, ironically, the military still remains the only institution  in the position to put an end to the drift towards the yawning  abyss of total collapse of the nation. Mission-minded, the  foregoing constitute the historical context of current efforts  [word indistinct] relevant and appropriate direction for  Nigeria's socioeconomy.    Our policy direction for 1994 must therefore aim at the  refashioning of the present ways of doing government business.  A pointer to this need was given in my maiden address to the  nation when I committed this administration to the necessity of  reform of the major agencies and institutions of state. The  problems which afflict our nation's institutions have brought  them into disrepute and caused our people to be disenchanted  with government. This administration has thus paneled a  high-powered commission of inquiry into the affairs of those  institutions that make or break government to demonstrate in  concrete ways the need to set out our home in order before we  begin to effectively use its resources for the enhancement of  the quality of life of our people.    It must be stated that this administration is not, by the  act  of instituting reform panels, out to embark on vendetta.  Rather, we believe that those reforms will form the basis for a  renewed phase in our institutions and government. Let me  emphasize that the reforms will be a continued exercise designed  to ensure greater sensitivity of government to our people's  desires, greater accountability, and transparency in government  and, above all, greater responsiveness by government.    This administration places a very high premium on the  genuine  wishes of our people. This must be so because the immediate  factor in our decision to intervene was the obvious drift in  government occasioned by the estrangement of those in government  from the governed. Previous administrations simply rejected and  neglected to recognize the drift towards disintegration of our  country due to their actions and inactions. Nigeria was close  to disintegration at the time the military intervened on 17  November 1993. It had become increasingly clear to us, and  indeed to most Nigerians, that the best way out for us was to  intervene to save the descent into anarchy.    This administration recognized at inception the  undercurrents  of the political crisis of our immediate past which was the  reason for the decision to institute a constitutional conference  to look into the multitude of problems which afflict us as a  nation. The idea of an all-Nigeria constitutional conference is  an idea whose time has come. This administration is committed  to ensuring that the proposed conference meets the expectation  of our people's collective yearnings for a more united Nigeria.    Furthermore, this administration has chosen through the  proposed conference to play the vanguard role in channeling the  energies of our people towards meaningful interaction in  planning the course for the future of our country. We do not  intend to abdicate this responsibility. Accordingly, the  government has decided and will soon enpanel a constitution  commission whose charge is to organize the proposed  constitutional conference. The conference in time will make  appropriate recommendations to the Provisional Ruling Council on  an accepted political framework and program which will lead to  the emergence of a democratic polity.    The apprehensions and reservations of a few of our  countrymen  and women about the proposed constitutional conference are fully  recognized and appreciated. But these should not detract from  the good intentions which form our original decision to convene  the conference. Government will not abdicate its responsibility  in providing the necessary and sufficient framework for a  fruitful conference. Government wishes to appeal to all our  people to be part of the genuine effort at fashioning a fair,  just, and equitable basis of our collective existence.    Fellow Nigerians, having found ourselves in the situation of  authority we have the responsibility to preserve our country  from collapse and at the same time to visibly pursue the course  of justice and fairness. It is also clear to us that this task  before the nation is to pinpoint the problems as objectively as  possible and to identify patriots who are prepared to sacrifice  their time and leisure to honor a total call to duty and finally  draw up a program of action. The general acceptance of the team  we have assembled both in the Provisional Ruling Council and the  Federal Executive Council strongly suggests that the action  taken to ensure that Nigeria existed for us to deliberate on its  future was based on sound judgment.    We are, however, not fooling ourselves into believing that  because we have been joined by trusted eminent leaders from all  sections and sectors of our nation, we have hereby solved the  problems of the twin legacies of our inheritance, namely, a  badly fractured polity and a dangerously weakened economy. We  believe, however, that by ensuring a national administration  composed of widely respected leaders charged with supervising  our national search for a meeting ground, our intention to serve  only as supervisors of this process remains genuine,  nationalistic, and patriotic. We recognize that ours is a  limited mandate. We also recognized that the process of  reconstituting our polity and our economy must be undertaken by  both the government and the governed.    The state of the economy: Fellow Nigerians, the economy  which  this administration inherited was once characterized by great  disabilities and great instabilities. On virtually all the  indices, the outlook was rather [words indistinct]. Economic  output, (?which) was measured by gross national product, has  been on a steady decline in the past few years. Owing to the  sluggish growth, employment has stagnated, while the phenomenal  growth in money supply, fuelled by expansionary fiscal policies  have had pressure on the oil sector. Interbank and lending  rates have risen to unprecedented levels, resulting in declines  in investment and production. All these have been worsened by  the collapse in the value of the naira, the attendant rapid  increase of service charges on external debts, and the worsening  of the balance of payments profile. In short, it can be said  that inadequate fiscal discipline complicated the already high  incidence of budget deficits, which in turn made efforts at  economic reforms more difficult to handle and led to a worsening  of social conditions.    Review of the 1993 budget: The federal budget of 1993 was  formulated to address and redress the declining economic  activities. One of its advertised objectives was to promote  accountability and transparency in the management of public  finance. The budget also aimed at enhancing public sector  activities and social programs, while eliminating market  distortions by giving freer reign to private enterprise. For  reasons which are not too difficult to discern, the 1993 budget  performed rather poorly, both in terms of attainment of set  objectives and fidelity to the overall strategy. The budget  deficit soared to 90 billion naira and this resulted in an  excessive growth in money supply. The economy experienced high  inflation, depreciation of the naira, and continued low capacity  utilization in the (?real) sector. The political crisis which  took up most of the second half of the year, only served to  further accentuate these already serious problems.    The 1994-1996 rolling plan: The three year rolling plan was  introduced to replace the five-year medium-term program as a  development strategy. The two objectives of the 1994-1996  rolling plan are to institute correct macroeconomics policies  and instill fiscal discipline in order to fashion a more  conducive environment for economic growth. It is this  imperative that provided the context for the 1994 federal budget.    Goal of the 1994 budget: The goals of the 1994 budget have  been set to reverse the negative trend of the recent past. These  goals are:    1. A balanced budget firmly anchored on fiscal discipline  and  abolition of deficit financing.    2. Identification and mobilization of new sources of  collective revenue.    3. Exchange rate stabilization and the reversal of the high  incidence of capital flight.    4. Rationalization of interest rates to stem the decline of  the rural sector.    5. Adoption of a comprehensive budgeting approach to bring  all projects into the process.    6. Reduction in the level of subsidies and subventions to  federal government-owned companies and parastatals, particularly  those slated for partial or full commercialization and outright  privatization.    7. Effective debt management strategies to reduce the debt  service burden on domestic commitments and obtain debt relief  from the external creditors.    8. Rehabilitation of social-economic infrastructure and  strengthening of the law and order apparatus to provide a  conducive environment for legitimate economic pursuits and  private initiative.    9. Increase in the capacity utilization of the industrial  sector and effective sourcing of local raw materials.    10. Promotion of growth linkages in the rural economy.    11. Promotion of employment opportunities to reduce the  current high level of unemployment, especially among the youth.    12. Policy fidelity and close monitoring of implementation  to  ensure the attainment of these objectives.    These goals, singularly and in concert, define an economic  framework for budget plans, and are, therefore, measures for  ensuring overall discipline in our recovery effort. This  administration will use these goals as a standard for measuring  the performance of sectors, institutions, and officials. This  administration wishes to serve notice that the monitoring and  review of strategic institutions of public policy, which we have  commenced, will continue to be intensified. This administration  will neither tolerate the subversion of its programs and  policies, nor will it allow its articulated goals and guidelines  to be casually discarded or treated as mere suggestions.    Revenue projection: In the 1993 budget, revenue projections  were premised on a continuing conservative outlook of oil price  behavior. Unfortunately, the price of oil during the year fell  below the projected level of $17.50 per barrel. This is why the  1994 revenue projection from crude oil sales is based on the  realistic price of $14 per barrel, calculated on an exchange  rate of 22 naira to a dollar. This translates into an estimated  revenue of 231.40 billion naira. Non-oil revenue is estimated  at 47.1 billion naira. The Federal Government's retained  revenue is estimated at 110.20 billion naira.    Expenditure estimates: The expenditure estimates for the  1994 budget are largely influenced by the need to achieve the  prime objective of a balanced budget. Therefore, government has  adopted a budgetary approach which will commit all government  expenditures to only available resources. Thus, the total  expenditure outlay is estimated at 110.20 billion naira.    In addition to the traditional ministerial allocations,  government will seek to provide funding for projects, will  multiply effects on our economy such as:    1. High-yield seed development program for improvement in  agriculture production.    2. Special incentives for small-scale industries involved a  production of basic needs.    3. Funding for research and development efforts.    4. Activation of support for the export processing zone.    5. The liquefied natural gas and other gas and oil related  projects.    6. Special assistance program for the educational sector.    7. Continuous support for the National Directorate of  Employment.    8. Enhanced security program in the urban centers and on  major highways.    9. Support for highway and city lightening program to meet  the Federal Ministry of Works [as heard].    10. Support for the mass transit program.    11. Rehabilitation of tertiary health institutions and  medical research centers.    States and local governement finances: From the cautious  approach adopted in the 1994 budget in regard to revenue from  oil sales, it has become more necessary than ever, for state  governments and local councils to further improve on their  internal revenue generating efforts. Also given the acute  concern for accountability and transparency which informed this  budget, the Federal Government expects strict financial  management at the other two levels of government and a visible  pursuit of probity in the conduct of the activities. Local  councils will continue to be funded directly from the federation  account. In addition, they will continue to receive the  mandatory 10 percent of state governments internally generated  revenue. The state governments are required to make quarterly  returns of all such transfers to the federal Ministry of Finance.    Foreign exchange rate: The achievement of the exchange rate  stability, which is one of the foremost objective of this  budget, requires the abolition of deficit financing, increasing  aggregate supply of foreign exchange through intensified export  promotion, encouragement of foreign investors, and the  strengthening of measures to mobilize non-oil exports proceeds.  While government remains committed to the policy of  deregulation and to safeguard the integrity of the market  forces, it is by now recognized that one of the fundamental  factors which have further complicated the national economic  crisis is the low exchange rate of the naira in relation to  other currencies. Government is of the firm belief that the new  economic direction of policy should be such as would create the  right environment for the strengthing of the naira.    Government is aware that its due share of foreign exchange  earnings by parastatals and government-owned companies, are not  fully credited to it. Measures have therefore been put in place  for effective tracking of foreign exchange earnings with a view  to correcting existing anomalies. Consequently, government has  decided that all foreign exchange earned by both private and  public sector exporters of goods and services will henceforth be  brought into the national foreign exchange account. For the  avoidance of doubt, the concession formally granted to private  exporters and parastatals to keep their foreign exchange  earnings outside the central bank is hereby abolished. Also, in  the light of our recent experience and in view of the need to  create a favorable atmosphere for economic revival, government  has decided that the exchange rate of the naira be fixed at 22  naira to a dollar. Government will actively monitor this  decision. Government expect that Nigerians will contribute  towards ensuring the sanctity of this rate against all odds.    Other measures that have been adopted in order to strengthen  the value of the naira include the following:    1. All imports are henceforth to be done on the basis of  letter of credit, that is LC, supported by import duty reforms,  IDR, and clear report of findings, CRF, except for imports that  cost $1,000 or less. Imports of open accounts, including bills  on collection, except on specific approval for the manufacturing  and agricultural sector are abolished. All importers are to  complete Form M. All imports of foreign exchange into Nigeria  must henceforth be through the Central Bank of Nigeria, which  shall guarantee free and unimpeded access to such forex for  imports of goods and services. For the avoidance of doubt, any  importer who has forex to use to import goods or services must  first of all have to declare such to the Central Bank of  Nigeria, complete the Form M, and establish the necessary letter  of credit based on the use of funds earlier lodged with the  Central Bank or designated banks. It would not be the basis for  operating the LC nor could it be repatriated subsequently.    Bureaux de change are henceforth agents of the Central Bank.  As such, they are to henceforth sell foreign exchange at the  rate prescribed by Central Bank plus a fixed commission.  Bureaux de change must therefore not sell forex to finance  imports, nor should they sell more than 2,500 or equivalent to  any one customer. Returns of transaction must be made to the  Central Bank every month.    6. [Number as heard] All parastals, corporations, companies,  voluntary organizations, and any agency whether foreign local,  government or private which earn or bring foreign exchange into  the country must report and lodge same with the Central Bank or  Central Bank designated banks and spend such only in accordance  with the prescribed guidelines but without any other impediment  or question by the authorities. In other words, those who earn  or bring in foreign exchange should be free to utilize it as  they deem fit within the guidelines to be prescribed. The  guideline should be gentle enough not to scare away prospective  depositors .    7. All companies, agencies, and individuals, bringing forex  into Nigeria must do so only through the Central Bank or  approved banks. Such foreign exchange deposits could be  withdrawn freely either in naira or foreign exchange with  interest at the prescribed rate. Depending on the formula that  the central bank could adopt for the sale of forex importers,  the commercial and commercial ad merchant bank should only act  as conduit for handling transactions on behalf of genuine  clients. In this regard, appointed banks should only charge  prescribed commission for their services.    9. [Number as heard] The minister of finance should bring to  the Federal Executive Council proposals and ways to improve  custom duty collection, including the possible use and  inspection agents and the redefinition of the role of the Custom  and Excise Department.    10. Henceforth high customs duty will be imposed on luxury  goods and such goods should not be funded from official sources.  A list of such items will be prepared by the Ministry of  Finance and cleared with the Federal Military Government. In  order to enhance their capacity, the Central Bank and the  Department of Customs and Excise will be revamped and  restructured to cope with the new challenges and added  responsibilities in the foregoing decision and the overall  efforts to revamp the national economy. This is to be without  prejudice to the proposed reorganization of the customs duty  collection system.    Finally, the Central Bank is to ensure strict supervision of  the designated bank so that the abuses witnessed in recent years  in the use of foreign exchange are eliminated and the erring  banks appropriately sanctioned. To give efforts to the  realization of all these economic measures an Economic  Intelligence Committee will be established to monitor the strict  implementation of all these policy measures.    Fiscal Policy Measures: Fellow Nigerians, the main thrust of  fiscal policy in 1994 is the adoption of coherent measures that  ensure expenditure discipline and revive revenue drive. To this  end, the minister of finance has been directed to evolve  workable measures for ensuring that all duties payable on  imports are fully captured into government coffers.  Concomitantly, a more vigorous effort will be made to curb  smuggling and reduce the leakage of collectible revenues. The  life of the present tariff regime is due to expire in 1994 and a  committee has been set up to review the current tariff structure  and come up with a comprehensive new structure in 1995.    Government has decided to introduce excise duties of some  products this year. Details of these will be given by the  honorable minister of finance in his budget breakdown. Suffice  it to say here that all importers of goods must brace up for the  payment of full duties as no new exemptions will be entertained  outside of those already provided for by law. This measure will  be applicable to all government agencies at all levels. Tax  policy in 1994 will aim at encouraging genuine entrepreneurs  while improving the enforcement of existing laws and the  machinery for tax collection. However, a new tax on consumption  known as value added tax, VAT, is to come into effect this year.  States are to benefit from the yield of this new tax up to 80  percent of total collection. Also, withholding tax on rents,  interests, dividends, among others, has been raised from 5  percent to 10 percent with effect from 1994.    Monetary and Credit Policy: Government has for some time  been concerned about developing an appropriate macroeconomic  package that will simultaneously address the issue of the low  value of the national currency. The steep rise in interest  rate, high commodity prices, and the ability of the productive  sector to source credit and perform adequately. [sentence as  heard] After due consideration of the report of the committee  raised to examine these issues, government decided to firm up  interest rate so as to save genuine economic activity.  Consequently, the Central Bank has been given the charge to  enforce strict compliance with the various existing regulations  and to ensure that banks and other institutions found violating  such rules are sanctioned appropriately. Specifically,  government has decided to peg interest rates as follows: Savings  and deposit rate is now fixed at between 12 and 15 percent;  lending rate is fixed at 21 percent, inclusive of all charges.  This means that 21 percent should represent the upper limit to  be charged on any loan inclusive of legal and other charges.    Fellow Nigerians, the unseeming manner in which critical  indices of our economic health has been grossly abused in the  past few years call for decisive and drastic measures. With the  existing interest rate regime, it has become clear that real  producers were being penalized while peddlers of paper money,  crafty manipulators, and idle speculators were milking the  economy dry. No responsible government would fold its arms and  watch such a negative trend continue unchecked. It is in our  determination to do something positive that these new measures  are being introduced and we sincerely hope that hard-working  Nigerians who are the ultimate beneficiaries of a saner interest  rate regime should rally around government in ensuring that  these measures are not sabotaged. Additionally, in its efforts  to ensure compliance with the new dispensation that the Central  Bank is mandated to go beyond routine [words indistinct] where  necessary and adopt active measures to bring transgressors to  book.    With regards to structural allocation of credit, government  has decided that in 1994 structural allocation of bank credits  should give priority to agricultural and industrial production.  Thus, the structural percentage distribution or commercial and  merchant bank credit in 1994 shall be 60 percent of all credit  to agricultural production and manufacturing enterprises, while  non-oil exports and others would be allocated 40 percent. The  ratio of rural lending to deposit, mobilize in the rural  communities would remain at 50 percent in view of the pressing  need to accelerate rural development.    Debt management: The management of the country's internal  and  external debt continues to present serious problems for  macroeconomic policy and the attainment of growth objectives.  In the attempt to reduce the level of debt stock, government  has adopted policy measures that will lead to outright  elimination of contracts not provided for in the budget. This  would be in keeping with one of the cardinal points of this  year's budget which is a vigorous curtailment of expenditure to  ensure a balanced budget.    With regards to the serving of domestic loans, the federal  Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria have been  charged with the assignment of designing a scheme which will  result in reduction in annual debt service in real terms.    On the external loan front, government will continue to  strive to reach an accommodation with Nigerian's creditors with  a view to ensuring more favorable terms. It is our hope that  the creditors will appreciate the particularly delicate phase  through which Nigeria is now passing and exercise restraints in  making impossible demands that can only serve to further worsen  the tenuous economic and political situation of these times.    The social sector: From the broad outline given so far in  this address, it should be obvious that the fiscal year of 1994  will be an intensely demanding period in terms of budgetary  discipline and adherence to enunciated goals and objectives.  Government recognizes that the past few years have been  especially harrowing for many Nigerians, particularly people in  the low- and middle-income groups and those engaged in genuinely  productive economic activities. It is government's intention  and determination to bring some long overdue relief to our  people in the area of public transportation, access to  affordable and qualitative education, health services, provision  of water and adequate food supply at reasonable prices.  Government is of the firm belief that such relief measures can  still be comfortably accommodated within the context of a  balanced budget. What is required is the adoption of the right  economies in the areas of checking public sector wastage,  ensuring a shift away from the current practice of using scare  public resources to subsidize the already affluent through  lopsided pricing of services, enforcing a tax drive that will  raise the revenue accrue into public coffers, glutting of sundry  leakages in the official economy, and capturing of all economic  activities into the formal sector. [sentence as heard]    We are under no illusion that this would be an easy task.  Indeed, carrying them out successfully will require a blend of  political will with which governments in Nigeria are not usually  associated. Yet, we are acutely aware of the desperate  situation in which we now find ourselves and have come to accept  that there is really no alternative to keeping faith with our  people than through sincerity and sufficient management of the  economy to enable it carry out the needed social services.  Consequently, 1994 will witness more vigorous activity on the  part of government in the provision of improvement of social  services, especially in the area of transportation and road  maintenance, schools management, public health, and other  related infrastructure. Our approach to the provision of social  services is derived from the philosophy of social sector  management which views those services not merely as items of  public expenditure but more importantly as investment in a  better organized society, and ultimately as imperatives for  future progress given their enormous multiply effect.    Drug enforcement: Drug trafficking has become a monumental  national embarrassment and a cancerous malaise which is a great  source of concern for this administration. Nigeria is not a  producer of drugs yet because of the indiscipline of some of our  people, and their general tendency to get rich quick, have  turned Nigeria into a notorious drug route. This attitude has  an unhealthy effect on the image of this country. This  administration therefore is determined to stamp out drug  trafficking in all its ramifications.    Categorically, government has decided to revamp and  reorganize the national Drug and Law Enforcement Agency to make  it more responsive to its responsibility. It is pertinent to  note that the recent seizure of drugs with a street value of  over $300 million within our shores lend credence to this our  renewed and vigorous efforts to fight the incidence of drug  trafficking. We appeal to the international community to  cooperate with us in this our current drive to stem the drug  trade from our shores and plead for the exchange of information  and technical assistance toward the attainment of this  objective. Henceforth, government will deal ruthlessly with  drug traffickers and their agents and will not tolerate the  damage drug trafficking and other antisocial behaviors done to  Nigeria's image.    Government is determined to ensure strictest obedience and  the enforcement of stiffest penalties on offenders and assert no  efforts will be spared to track down traffickers and their  agents.    Youth and sports: Government is committed to constructive  programs of youth development for nation building. In pursuit  of this noble goal, the Ministry of Education and Youth  Development as well as the National Sports Commission will  continue to develop appropriate youth programs to prepare our  young men and women for productive adult life. The future of  any nation depends on a well-articulated and effective youth  policy which can only be ignored at the nation's peril. This  administration is highly impressed by the immense contribution  of our youth in global competitions, particularly in the age  group football competitions. The recent victory of our Golden  Eaglets for the second time under 17th FIFA [Federation of  International Football Associations] soccer competition in  Japan, is an excellent example of the height which commitment  and patriotism can propel us as a people. I enjoyed the Super  Eagles who have qualified for the senior World Cup to emulate  the excellent example of their kid brothers.    The government on its part will do everything to ensure a  proper and result-oriented build-up to the prestigious global  competition tagged USA 94. Government will do everything  possible to make the requirements of FIFA to ensure Nigeria  hosting of the under 20 youth soccer competition scheduled for  next year. Apart from a domestic following which soccer enjoys  in our country, hosting the competition will enable us to  provide the world with strategic insight to our capabilities,  potentialities, and the state of the development of the game of  football in particular in Nigeria.    As we enter a year in which Nigeria will participate in many  global sporting competitions, government enjoins all organs  charged with the responsibility for sports development to show  commitment and a sense of purpose in their preparation so that  our flag can fly high to the glory of our beloved country.    The activities of those charge with the development of  sports  in the country, will henceforth be closely monitored.  Government can no longer watch with indifference when those  charged with the heavy burden of sports administration in the  country, dissipate so much energy in endless bickering thereby  making us the laughing stock in the international community.    The interphase of domestic policy and external demands: We  are now more aware of the relationship between the various  aspects of reform programs we have sought to implement and their  overall effect on the quality of life of our citizens. We know  that if we service debts, whose total legal character is yet to  be ascertained, with our 30 kobo of every externally accrued  naira and if the percentage devoted to servicing of our debts  continued to increase while the total income continued to  decrease, our people's welfare would also continue to be  mortgaged. We know that if we embarked on economic reform  projects that tie the hands of government and disable government  from putting in place programs that will shelter the most  vulnerable sector of our society from the negative effect of  these reforms, we are actively increasing the ranks of  disaffected who will demand other protection from these effects  or call for a change of the economic order and of government.    We know that we cannot embark on a ruinous debt service  regime, mount an economic reform program, and initiate difficult  changes of our political system all at the same time. While  investors' capitals seek new arenas opened by the ending of the  cold war, it is apparent that the Nigerian managers of our  economy would have to organize novel ways of undertaking reforms  without increasing the volume of conflicts within our social  order. The international community must also come to understand  the implications of these various programs that have shaped the  condition of life of our citizens. It is no longer enough to  insist on reforms whose pattern of effect has now been  catalogued country after country and yet for the international  community not to appreciate what are the likely outcomes of  changes that it advocates.    Nigeria, like other African countries similarly situated,  have implemented structural adjustments of their economies.  They are carrying the heavy burden that their debts place on  their shoulders and they are saddled with the effect of a  painful and conflict-ridden democratization of their policies.  These three projects are all sources of conflict that threaten  social order and peace. There must be a way of spacing them and  managing the conflicts they generate. This administration  believes that equal attention must now be devoted to the  management of peace within our societies. Peace can no longer be  assumed. New ways have to be devised for anticipating the  conflict effects inherent in policy reforms. New complicities  in approach have to be articulated. We know that in this task  Nigeria must continue to contribute its leadership in assisting  the international community in developing peaceful alternatives  to the pursuit of political objectives through wars. As the  curtain falls on the apartheid order of South Africa, a new day  for African dawns, calling for the birth of a new leadership.  This administration extends its invitation to the international  community to join it in its exploration of the current condition  of conflict situations that now limit our ability to march  forward.    Reinvigorating the executive branch: The various measures  outlined in this year's budget require renewed dedication on the  part of those whose business it is to implement government  policies. The existing structure of the executive branch cannot  serve the inherited statescraft crisis without fundamental  restructuring of legacies. The civil service which  traditionally has served as the implementing arm of the  executive branch has over the years lost momentum in part  because of the negative impact of previous reform measures.  Government views with concern the current decline in the output  of the civil service and is determined to do something about it.  Accordingly, government has decided to revisit the 1998 civil  service reform with a view to reviewing its underlying premises,  its execution, and implementation to date.    Significantly, however, there is a compelling and urgent  need  to enhance coordination as a management imperative in the  executive branch of government. In the recent past, the size of  the executive branch has grown so large as to be unwieldy.  Quite a handful of agencies have found accommodation in the  Presidency, whose scheduled responsibilities are duplications of  what regular federal government ministerial departments do. In  addition, the sheer size of the executive branch compounds the  input processing problems and inevitably leads to the burdening  of the chief executive by multiple actors, while the wearisome  implication for undue centralization of power. [sentence as  heard]    This administration cannot afford the pleasure, the luxury  of  operating the existing bureaucratic structures which under  conditions more conducive and more supportive was only efficient  in serving the personal interest of those entrusted with  authority. Government is concerned that the present organization  of work in the executive branch is administratively routine and  results in much activity and traffic, but without the result of  functional policy leadership. Government has therefore decided  on the restructuring of the executive branch to make it  functional in decisionmaking, decision execution, and decision  monitoring.    Fellow Nigerians, in surveying the sad record of our recent  past, it will be rather tempting to want to continually lament  what has indeed been a tragic study in missed opportunities. It  would be perfectly understandable if Nigerians now choose to  engage in an unending recrimination over what went wrong, to  point accusing fingers, or even to wallow in self-pity. Even  before things went so bad, the apportioning of blame had become  a growth industry in the society. Yet, even as we legitimately  vent our anger and express our disappointment at the cavalier  manner in which our lives have been mismanaged, we need to  reconcile ourselves to the fact that life must go on. The past  becomes an albatross only if we fail to learn from it and heed  its lessons. It is now time to seek a sober understanding of  what went wrong. We must now resume our search for unity and  prosperity firmly anchored on peace and justice. We must  collectively recommence the task of rebuilding our polity and  restructuring our economy.    The 1994 budget has been articulated as a modest beginning  in  this direction. It has been said that the true test of a  nation's progress is not how much it adds to the abundance of  those who already have too much, but how well it is able to  provide for those who have too little. The policies this  administration wishes to pursue in 1994 are aimed at providing  the right atmosphere for economic growth that goes hand in hand  with social compassion. This cannot but be so, given the  injuries of past years. Still, a lot will depend on all  Nigerians to be patriotic enough to seek to work within the set  guidelines and policies rather than seeking ever more  imaginative ways of sabotaging the budget, to support a  government in its effort to generate more revenue by ensuring  prompt and correct tax declaration and bringing their  income-earning activities into the official economy, to adhere  strictly to business ethics instead of indulging in arbitrary  increase in prices and lowering of the quality of their goods  under the guise of the regulation, to refrain from acts that  tend to smear the image of the country and which discourage the  much-needed inflow of genuine foreign investment, to ensure high  moral standard of discipline in the economic and other  activities, to imbibe a better work culture, especially in  rendering of public service, to rekindle faith in ourselves and  our ability to create a Nigerian economic miracle, to remain  continually vigilant in holding people in authority to set  standards, especially with regards to accountability and  transparency in government and, finally, to refrain from doing  anything that will further complicate the already testy  political situation so as to ensure the stability required for  economic recovery.    All these are demands that underscore the need for  discipline  in the conduct of private and public affairs. On our part, we  have committed government to initiate [word indistinct] see to  restore orderly existence through the resuscitation of the war  against indiscipline and corruption. We are determined to  prosecute this war to the best of our ability. To this end, let  me note that government had in the past decade invested  massively in the infrastructure of public discipline. The  appropriate agencies are hereby directed to speedily deploy what  was committed to public discipline by preceding administrations  for current purposes. The budget will attract criticism  normally, but it is important to appreciate the commitment of  this administration to brighten the prospect of our country,  improve economic management, and create a stable and conducive  political climate.    A lot needs to be done, but I have no doubt that together we  can build a better future for our great country. Please accept  in arrears my best wishes for a happy and prosperous new year.  Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria! Thank you and God  bless our country.</p>

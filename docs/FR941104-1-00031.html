			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence of Boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the petition, there have never been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precise historic boundaries for the St. Helena viticultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> district. However, the petitioner states that history does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an imprecise ``St. Helena District'' within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic structure of State winegrowing established by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first Board of State Viticultural Commissioners in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1880s. According to the petition, the State was divided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into districts, one being Napa, which included Napa, Solano,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Contra Costa Counties. Charles Krug was the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commissioner for the district in 1880. Napa County was then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided into administrative districts: Napa (City),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yountville, St. Helena, and Calistoga. According to the petition, these were not considered viticultural districts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time. The St. Helena District included the vineyards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Howell Mountain, most of Rutherford, and Larkmead. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is discussed in E.C. Priber's report to the Board in 1893.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even Chiles and Conn Valleys were included in the St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District, although Priber gave separate statistics for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the wineries and vineyardists in the Priber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report are listed in administrative districts, Priber's man  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the field, A. Warren Robinson, asked each where his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her operation was located, and the answer was given as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place, not necessarily a post office. Bernard Ehlers said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> he lived at Lodi Station. Mrs. Lillie Coit listed Larkmead.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the petitioner, such data make it possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make an attempt to draw historically accurate lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner states that a more accurate listing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural districts was given by Charles Krug in his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report of 1887. In it he traces the development of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> district in Napa County since 1881, by acreage, production,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and type of grape vines. Krug listed Yountville, Oakville,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rutherford, St. Helena, Spring Mountain, Howell Mountain,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calistoga and five others. Although he did not include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> map, the precision of his statistics indicates that he and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others had the limits of these districts in mind.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From the information discussed above, the petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has tried to plot the northern and southern boundaries of the St. Helena viticultural area. From a historical point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of view, the petitioner states that any one of three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landmarks could be used as the northern boundary of the St.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Helena viticultural area. These landmarks include Ritchie  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek, Bale Lane, and Big Tree Road. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioner feels that from a practical, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historical point of view, Bale Lane is the best choice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner states that the southern boundary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> St. Helena viticultural area was discussed at length during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the December 9, 1992, ATF public hearing held in Napa,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, concerning the northern boundary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rutherford viticultural area. From the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted at that hearing, it was determined that Zinfandel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Avenue, known locally as Zinfandel Lane, was the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> northern boundary for the Rutherford viticultural area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the petitioner states that Zinfandel Avenue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Zinfandel Lane) should also be used as the southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary of the adjacent St. Helena viticultural area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner states that the southeast boundary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the St. Helena appellation should include the Spring Valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area since this area was included in the St. Helena area on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1895 ``Official Map of the County of Napa.'' On this map,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the properties of George Mee and Antonio Rossi (Spring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley) were listed as being in the St. Helena district  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whereas Charles Scheggia, just to the south, listed himself  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as being in Rutherford.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

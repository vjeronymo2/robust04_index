			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trinity first beneficiary of relaxed float rules TRINITY HOLDINGS, the maker of Dennis fire trucks and buses which is coming to the market next month, will be the first beneficiary of a more relaxed Stock Exchange attitude towards flotations. That follows the failure of many new issues earlier this year to attract retail interest. The Stock Exchange has allowed a firm placement of 75 per cent of Trinity's shares, leaving only 25 per cent available for the public through stockbroker intermediaries. Baring Brothers, Trinity's advisers, expects to raise at least Pounds 30m. The flotation is expected to value Trinity at about Pounds 80m and leave the group virtually free of debt. With flotations of this size in the past the Stock Exchange has required that half the shares be made available through a public offering or an intermediary offering. Despite the extra expense of marketing a public offering, many of the companies that hurried to the market after the April general election failed to jolt private investors from what appeared to be a recession-induced investment strike. As a result underwriters were left with shares and a number of the new issues were labelled retail 'flops'. Trinity yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus in spite of continuing nervousness in the London market, and the last minute withdrawal of a proposed flotation of Woolcombers last week. In the prospectus the group forecast it would make operating profits of Pounds 8.5m in the year to January 1993. This compares with a profit of Pounds 5.58m on sales of Pounds 82.1m last year. Baring Brothers expects to price the issue early next week and will accept applications until noon on October 14. Trinity, like other UK based exporters, is likely to benefit from sterling's recent devaluation; some 33 per cent of its sales are exported.</p>

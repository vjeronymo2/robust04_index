			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'DONOR' STRAINS PROBABILITY TO THE EXTREME  </P> <P> For most folks, hospitals, whether they're in fiction or in fact, are  uncomfortable, unpleasant, generally scary places. Mid City General, the scene  of "Donor," a new CBS movie airing Sunday night at 9 on Channels 2 and 8, mixes  the worst of Robin Cook, Paddy Chayefsky and Stephen King.  </P> <P> Rotten place to visit, wouldn't want to die there.  </P> <P> "Donor" is one of those tricky conspiratorial thrillers, which, like most of  this genre, strains probability to its extreme, and especially in a big  hospital, where it's hard to keep secrets. Like if you were going to take gland  samples from this kid with progeria, the premature-senility disorder, then feed  them to young men to age them and kill them off and in the process come up with  an anti-aging pill that would be worth millions and millions and millions,  wouldn't somebody be suspicious?  </P> <P> Well, as far as we know, the only person who thinks something's amiss is young  Dr. Kris Lipton (played by Melissa Gilbert-Brinkman). Even as people are  getting slashed up with a razor, Kris' anxieties are pooh-poohed by handsome  Dr. Kesselman (Jack Scalia), surly Dr. Farrell (Wendy Hughes) and patriarchal  Dr. Martingale (Pernell Roberts).  </P> <P> (One, of course, is a secret agent for the Food &amp; Drug Administration --  and just in time.)  </P> <P> What starts out with a slick premise on a dark and stormy night in eerie Ward 7  West, eventually ends up with comic-book tussling in Operating Room 8.  </P> <P> Not bad business but best to take two aspirin and get plenty of rest. IRV  LETOFSKY  </P></p>

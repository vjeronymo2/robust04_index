			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Danes aim for lower deficit Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, promised yesterday a lower budget deficit in 1995. This follows criticism by leading economists and opposition parties that the government's expansionist fiscal policy, introduced to kick-start the economy out of recession, will get out of hand. The budget deficit rose from 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 4.4 per cent last year, in 1993, according to economy ministry figures. The deficit for 1994 is projected at 4.8 per cent. Inflation in Austria rose an annualised 3.1 per cent in January after rising 3.5 per cent in December. Inflation rose 4.1 per cent in January last year. Germany's gross monetary reserves fell DM500m to DM117.6bn in the week ended February 15, the Bundesbank said. Its foreign liabilities rose DM500m to DM23.8bn.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): Good impressions - The art market is picking up Judging by the auctions held at Sotheby's and Christie's in London this week, the market for expensive Impressionist and modern art is continuing its slow recovery. Demand disappeared almost entirely four years ago when speculators, mainly Japanese, were caught out by the recession, holding pictures that had often halved in value. Any improvement since has been fitful. At Christie's on Monday night, though, major paintings and sculptures sold for Pounds 15.1m, with 29 of the 41 lots finding buyers. More to the point, there was strong demand for the best works - in terms of value, the auction was 85 per cent sold. On Tuesday at Sotheby's, a solid but unsensational auction brought in Pounds 11.37m, with 46 of the 61 lots selling, 79 per cent by value. After many false dawns, what makes it more likely that the stronger demand will take hold this time is the character of the auctions: they were very different affairs from similar occasions five, or 10, years ago. Anyone cramming into the Great Rooms in King Street, St James's, or in Bond Street, was confronted with great banks of telephones manned by exquisite creatures, male and female, arrayed in smartest black. They were in contact with foreign buyers. And they were kept busy. At Christie's, 18 of the lots sold went via the telephone. Indeed, at one time, there were 16 telephones competing for the same painting. At Sotheby's, there were 71 telephone bids, far exceeding the activists in the room and proving that demand for expensive art is international, secret, and concentrated among private buyers. The packed audiences at both Sotheby's and Christie's were mainly spectators. London's largest dealer, Richard Green, left after just a few lots at Christie's. Dealers generally, with plenty of unsold stock and aware that they can hardly squeeze much profit from pictures sold publicly, sat on their hands. There were few bids from the floor. The second distinctive feature of the Christie's sale was the stronger demand for the earlier lots - the decorative works of the late 19th and early 20th centuries - than for the more challenging later works. This suggests new buyers, with new money, are coming in. These tyros start, invariably, by collecting accessible paintings to furnish their homes. Over time, some become serious collectors and want more creatively challenging art. The most expensive picture in the Christie's sale, a landscape by Klimt showing a garden sparkling with flowers, went to a buyer in the room - but she turned out to be a Christie's representative bidding for an anonymous client. Against minimal competition, she took the picture for Pounds 3.74m, at the bottom of the pre-sale estimate. Another major lot, a large, late, Miro, was actually below target. It sold for Pounds 1.32m, suggesting that Christie's had been successful in persuading sellers to keep their reserves low in what is still a selective buyers' market. But the Pounds 2.1m paid for a large Picasso, 'Tete de Femme', was above estimate. By chance, these two works offer a good insight into the state of the market: in 1990, the Miro sold at Christie's in New York for Dollars 7.15m (Pounds 3.6m) and the Picasso, part of the collection of movie director Billy Wilder, made Dollars 4.8m (Pounds 2.7m) in 1989. The vendors took losses this week, but at least they sold. Unless forced by the three great Ds - death, divorce and debt - few owners of major art works are likely to risk them on today's convalescent market. This accounts for the shortage of masterpieces on offer in London. It could also suggest that New York is finally taking over as the centre of the international art market: the modern art auctions there last month did not contain many great works but they brought in much more money than London. Sotheby's had no knock-out lot in Bond Street but the remnants from the great collection of Alfred Richet did well. All but one of the 20 lots were sold, for around Pounds 3m in total. In the main auction, a decorative Picasso watercolour of a gypsy girl from the Moulin Rouge burst its forecast at Pounds 1.8m. The lower prices, and the lower reserves, are attracting back the serious buyers of Impressionist and modern art who were frightened away by the price spiral of the late 1980s - which culminated in the summer of 1990 when a van Gogh sold for Dollars 82.5m. Together with the new rich, demand is stronger  -but only for the finest works, priced reasonably. Speculation is quite absent. We are back, in fact, to the art market of a decade or more ago, but with many new players.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDDIE READ HANDICAP AT DEL MAR;  </P> <P> FRANKEL DOUBLES HIS PLEASURE WHILE JOCKEY BLACK HAS NO FUN  </P> <P> For trainer Bobby Frankel, Sunday's Del Mar stakes doubleheader was a dream.  For jockey Corey Black, it was a nightmare.  </P> <P> Frankel swept the $275,250 Eddie Read Handicap with Saratoga Passage and the  $111,000 San Clemente Handicap with Darby's Daughter, two horses who are  finally realizing their full potential.  </P> <P> Black, on the other hand, had his hands full with the antics of the high-strung  Seattle Meteor in the San Clemente (she beat one horse) and the front-running  Halcyon Days in the Eddie Read.  </P> <P> The Read was actually a double feature unto itself. Halcyon Days, an Irish colt  who had won three consecutive races for trainer Eddie Gregson, was in a world  of his own through the first seven furlongs of the 1 1/8-mile turf event.  </P> <P> Breaking from the outside of the eight-horse field, Halcyon Days took off like  his tail was on fire. He led by five lengths at the first call, at least eight  at the half mile mark and perhaps even more than that at various points along  the backstretch.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back in the pack, the other seven jockeys made their plans for the  moment when Halcyon Days would run out of gas. Eddie Delahoussaye, aboard  Saratoga Passage, had the best view, from last place.  </P> <P> "You just have to ride your own race, even when it comes up like this one,"  said Delahoussaye, who was winning the Read for the fourth time.  </P> <P> "I decided to ignore Corey's horse and just wait."  </P> <P> And wait, and wait. Delahoussaye dawdled at the back until the field entered  the final turn. To that point, Quiet Boy had been running second under Alex  Solis, setting a more reasonable target for the stretch runners.  </P> <P> "I just pretended Alex was on the lead," said Gary Stevens, who rode eventual  runner-up Skip Out Front.  </P> <P> Halcyon Days was still playing hard to get as the field straightened into the  stretch. But then, with a furlong to run, it was open season on the exhausted  leader.  </P> <P> Stevens and Skip Out Front were first to burst out of the pack. Delahoussaye,  after threading his way between horses, came flying on the outside, then  Pasakos and Robbie Davis put in a run on the inside.  </P> <P> In the final 50 yards, the long-striding Saratoga Passage pulled clear to win  by 2 1/4 lengths. Skip Out Front, who had finished third and fourth in previous  runnings of the Read, was second by a half-length over Pasakos. Halcyon Days  finished fourth, beaten less than three lengths.  </P> <P> "He was his own worst enemy," said Black. "I tried everything to get him to  relax, keeping him on a loose rein."  </P> <P> The 20-year-old Black took a fair amount of ribbing for ride, especially from  his cubicle mate and mentor, Fernando Toro.  </P> <P> "What are you complaining about, jock?" said Toro, who finished sixth on Mister  Wonderful II. "You couldn't have had a better trip!"  </P> <P> Saratoga Passage, a 4-year-old Washington-bred son of Pirateer, is now two for  two on the turf and getting better with every start.  </P> <P> The gangly chestnut was the Washington Horse of the Year in 1987, when he  invaded Southern California to win the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita. His  owners, a group of Seattle racing fans and breeders that call themselves the  Saratoga I Stable, had their sights set on the 1988 Kentucky Derby.  </P> <P> But the progress of Saratoga Passage was halted by a lung infection in March of  1988, and then, when he tried to come back last summer, he suffered a broken  cannon bone.  </P> <P> Frankel took over the training of Saratoga Passage late last year and won with  him first time out in February. He placed in two Santa Anita stakes, finished  sixth to Blushing John in the Pimlico Special, then was well beaten in the  Californian on June 4 at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> "I should have put him on the turf a long time ago," said Frankel, who won past  Reads with No Turning, Wickerr (twice) and Al Mamoon.  </P> <P> "But maybe it's for the best. We haven't used him up and we've got a terrific  grass horse."  </P> <P> Saratoga Passage was timed in 1:49 and paid $12.80 as the fourth choice. Silver  Circus, the mild favorite, raced in fourth early and faded to last.  </P> <P> In the San Clemente Handicap, Darby's Daughter finally made good on her promise  of last season with a three-quarter-length victory over Sticky Wile.  </P> <P> Last year as a 2-year-old, the Texas-bred the daughter of Darby Creek Road was  among the best in the East. She won four of seven races, and even threw a scare  into Open Mind in the Demoiselle Stakes last November in New York, coming  within a neck of the upset.  </P> <P> At the time, Open Mind was fresh from her win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile  Fillies. Since then she has gone on to even greater glory, running her winning  streak to 10 races, including Saturday's Alabama Stakes at Saratoga.  </P> <P> Darby's Daughter, on the other hand, virtually disappeared this year.  </P> <P> At the end of 1988, owner James Cottrell sent her to Charlie Whittingham at  Santa Anita, but she never ran. A few months later the bay filly went over to  Frankel when his client, Edmund Gann of San Diego, bought her from Cottrell.  </P> <P> The San Clemente was Darby's Daughter's third start for Frankel after two  losses at Hollywood Park. Gann also had his California Oaks winner General  Charge in the race, and the entry went off the 7-2 third choice.  </P> <P> As expected, Tapping Tudor set the early pace, while Sticky Wile and A  Thrilling Moment stayed close. Gary Stevens had Darby's Daughter in fourth,  only a few lengths off the lead after a half-mile.  </P> <P> Approaching the far turn, Chris McCarron sent favored Reluctant Guest alongside  Darby's Daughter. Stevens could have been trapped behind the tiring leaders,  but suddenly Reluctant Guest dropped the bit and backed off.  </P> <P> "Chris had me cold," Stevens said later. "If his filly hadn't stopped, I'd have  had to wait to make my move."  </P> <P> While McCarron eased up on Reluctant Guest (she bled), Darby's Daughter spurted  through the final furlong to run down Sticky Wile. Bel Darling, at 24-1, popped  through heavy traffic to finish fast for third.  </P> <P> Darby's Daughter was clocked in 1:36 3/5 for the mile on firm turf, and the  entry returned $9. The $5 exacta was worth $184.  </P> <P> Frankel confirmed that Darby's Daughter would run next in the $150,000 Del Mar  Oaks on Aug. 27.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Sunday Silence had to miss a few days'  training because of a minor cough. As a result, he will probably be running in  the Sept. 24 Super Derby at Louisiana Downs instead of the Molson Challenge On  Sept. 10 at Woodbine. . . . After going down in consecutive races last Friday,  Fernando Valenzuela did not ride Sunday and will not ride today. He received a  gash on his head and is complaining of body sorenes. . . . Corey Black bounced  back after falling at the start of Sunday's fourth race to win the sixth on  Great Event for Del Mar president John Mabee. Great Event paid $98. . . . Del  Mar's business is booming, both on-track and off-track. Overall attendance is  up 4.4% and betting handle is up 10.6% over last year's figures. . . .  California-based Present Value continues to barnstorm across America. After  winning stakes in Detroit and Chicago, the Jerry Fanning-trained runner took  Sunday's $150,000 Canterbury Cup in Shakopee, Minn. Frank Olivares was aboard.  . . . While Jeff Lukas sent out Steinlen to win the Bernard Baruch Handicap on  Sunday at Saratoga, father Wayne Lukas was at Del Mar to enjoy the maiden win  of the 2-year-old Majestic Light filly Patches for W.T. Young. . . . Analyzing  Great Communicator's fourth-place finish in Saturday's Arlington Handicap,  jockey Ray Sibille was still positive about his chances in the Arlington  Million Sept. 3. "He ran good to the eighth pole and just did get beat for  third," Sibille said. "He got beat about five lengths, but he'll be dead fit  for the Million now."  </P></p>

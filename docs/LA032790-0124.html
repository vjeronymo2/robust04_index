			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> CITY'S HELP SOUGHT FOR DAMAGED HOMES  </P> <P> When Robert and Faye Knapp moved to Bel Air Circle in 1973, they thought they  had found their dream house. But when the walls, floors and back-yard patio of  their six-bedroom home began to crack, their dream turned into a homeowner's  nightmare.  </P> <P> Their sliding glass door won't open more than than two feet, and the floor of  their family room has sunk so low on one side that friends say crossing the  room is like walking up a hill.  </P> <P> Several of the Knapps' neighbors in the quiet cul-de-sac near McFadden Street  and Newland Avenue have also experienced structural damage ranging from tilting  floors and cracked foundations to doors that won't open.  </P> <P> Homeowners want the city to pay for damage to their homes, which they believe  was caused by unstable soil. A group of neighbors plan to go before the City  Council tonight to voice their concerns.  </P> <P> City Engineer Neal Thompson said the damage is occurring because the houses,  built in 1968, may have been constructed on soil containing peat -- plant  matter that absorbs water and causes the ground to contract and expand.  Thompson said this may have caused the homes to shift and settle.  </P> <P> "Extensive testing of the soil conditions were taken before the homes were  built and small amounts of peat were discovered, so the conditions were not  ideal," Thompson said. "Mounds of dirt were built over the entire tract to  compress the soil before the homes were constructed. Reports made at that time  indicated that the soil was strong enough to support more than a two-story  building."  </P> <P> The city is mainly concerned with damage to the street, sidewalk, curb and  gutter, said Don Vestal, director of community development. He said damage to  homes is the responsibility of the developer, Showcase Homes in Westminster.  William Krueger, president of the company, said he is looking into the matter  but refused further comment on the subject.  </P> <P> Residents want the city to install storm drains to improve drainage because  they say ground settling has resulted in pools of water that sit in the street.  They also want the city to repair structural damage to the homes and reinforce  foundations.  </P> <P> Resident Harland Slater said drainage problems cause water to flood "from the  middle of the street to the middle of my driveway." Neighbors have jokingly  referred to the area as "Slater Lake."  </P> <P> "We try to have a sense of humor about it," Slater said. "But the fact is, it's  a serious nuisance. We've had guests who have slipped and fell and come up to  our door sopping wet."  </P> <P> The city conducted soil tests last week to determine if there is still a peat  problem with the soil, but results are not yet available, Vestal said.  </P> <P> The city rebuilt the curb and gutter in the neighborhood in 1975 when similar  problems occurred. Vestal said installing a storm drain would cost about  $60,000 while replacing the curb and gutter would only cost a fraction of that.  GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (6): Gloom among UK's high tech entrepreneurs - Disillusion grows among Britain's new technology companies / In contrast to the US, early-stage funding for younger, high technology companies in the UK is in relative decline At first sight, the British Venture Capital Association's 1993 Report on Investment Activity is the best possible riposte to critics who accuse the industry of ignoring high technology in favour of safer fields such as services, retailing and low-tech manufacturing. Investment in technology and life sciences businesses - comprising the computer, electronics, medical and biotechnology sectors - leaped from Pounds 91m in 1992 to Pounds 268m last year. That represented an increase from 7.4 per cent to 21.4 per cent of all venture capital investment in the UK. And the inflow of funds is indeed welcomed by established high-tech companies wanting to expand as the recession ends. But most or all of the new money is going into later-stage expansion and management buy-ins and buy-outs. There is no sign of improvement in the area where funds are most desperately needed: investment in innovative new companies. The BVCA figures show that total start-up and early-stage investment fell from Pounds 82m in 1992 to Pounds 69m in 1993. 'Early-stage funding is in relative decline, as VC companies insist on larger deals to help cover their costs,' says Charles DesForges, UK-based president of TII, the European technology transfer network. 'If you look on this as a river, everyone is going down to the estuary to look for the fish that are already fat, and opportunities further upstream are being ignored.' The merger of Trinity Capital with Advent International, announced this month, has further reduced the ranks of those specialising in young high-tech companies. John Walker, co-founder of Trinity and now managing director of Advent International's European operations, says returns on his early-stage funds have been 'on the borderline' - 'our experience was telling us we needed larger deals.' It is easy to find high-tech entrepreneurs who are bitterly disillusioned with UK venture capitalists. One is Mike Fowler, a biology professor at Sheffield University, who wasted 18 months slogging round the UK-based venture capital funds, on behalf of his small university-based biotechnology company, Plant Sciences Ltd. 'In the UK, so much management time is spent trying to raise money that the business itself can disappear,' he says. 'The people we dealt with showed a total lack of vision and no understanding of risk, as applied to a start-up venture. They took so long to make up their minds that the company could have died in the process.' Fortunately, Plant Sciences survived the ordeal and is now flourishing - with US venture capital funding and a new name, Phytera. Fowler says that, after he got fed up with the search for British backers, it took him just three months to raise Dollars 13m through Commonwealth BioVentures of Massachusetts. 'The American attitude couldn't have been more different,' he says. 'We were dealing with people who had actually been through the process of starting companies themselves and who understood what we were trying to do.' So Fowler is still in Sheffield, running a research programme to develop plant-based pharmaceuticals. But he is now vice-president of scientific affairs for a fast-growing US-owned company - 'I'm very happy with the outcome from my personal point of view and that of my staff. The university came out of it well, too,' he says. 'I'm very unhappy from the point of view of UK Ltd that all our technology, the patents and know-how, are now American owned.' Carolyn Hayman, joint managing director of Korda &amp; Co, one of the handful of UK companies specialising in technology-based start-ups, sees little prospect of much more money flowing into early-stage venture funds. 'We're finding it incredibly difficult to raise money for our new fund (the Pounds 20m Korda European Technology Fund) - and if we're finding it hard, it must be well-nigh impossible for new entrants,' she says. A fundamental problem in the UK, she says, is that 'the playing field is so uneven. The tax regime is so favourable to pension funds - and you cannot expect pension funds, by their very nature, to invest in start-ups.' Faced with a shortage of institutional support, Hayman and others are paying more attention to wealthy individuals as a potential source of high-tech venture capital. 'In the US, a significant proportion of venture capital comes from individual investors - in complete contrast to Europe,' DesForges says. 'These 'business angels' are a relatively untapped source of capital here.' The trouble, according to DesForges, is that there is no mechanism for channelling investments from individuals to high-tech entrepreneurs, while providing the investors with an expert assessment of the would-be companies and the entrepreneurs with the managerial advice they need to run a business. DesForges has a solution in mind for the latter problem. 'The real issue is that the early-stage company needs management skills that it does not usually possess. We're thinking of a fund that would put interim managers into the business, to train and guide the owner during the early stages of growth. It would be a short-term mission and they would move on when the business was established.' That would not solve the funding problem, however. Perhaps the way to draw more individual investors into early-stage ventures would be to level the tax playing-field between pension funds and everyone else. The government could allow people to set up tax-free Individual Retirement Accounts, on the US model, which they could use to invest in start-up companies; at the same time, it might even help to make the initials IRA respectable.</p>

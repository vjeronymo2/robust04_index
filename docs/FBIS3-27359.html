Chen Bing, director of the Guangdong Federation of Trade  Unions, said that the local law is applicable to all workers, in  both regular and temporary employment, in enterprises of  different ownerships under the province's administration.    The law will put special emphasis on workers' interests, and  it states clearly for the first time that victims should get  compensation, instead of merely punishing those infringing  workers' interests, Chen said.    In the course of changes in the economic pattern, some  problems concerning the relations between labor and capital have  popped up -- basically problems concerning working time,  payment, safety and health care, insurance and welfare,  government officials said.    A random sample survey conducted by the provincial  federation  of trade unions among 1,500 workers indicates that 39 percent of  the workers enter factories without signing contracts, and the  payment in two-thirds of foreign-funded enterprises is lower  than the yearly local average pay.    The survey also shows that as many as 61 percent of  employees  work seven days a week, and 42 percent of them work ten hours or  more a day.</p>

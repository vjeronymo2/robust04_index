			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 28) TURAN -- "We welcome the stepped-up  activity of the CSCE Minsk Group and all the efforts you have  made in the past. We would like to see your work succeed", said  President Aliyev during his meeting with the CSCE Minsk Group  delegation headed by Mathias Mosberg.    According to Geydar Aliyev, Baku is striving for cease-fire  and is seeking ways to establish peace in the region and it is  in connection with this that the Chairman of the Milli Majlis,  Rasul Guliyev, is actively negotiating with Moscow.    "After the meeting with Rasul Guliyev, Russian Defense  Minister, Pavel Grachev, said that he will take measures to  cease hostilities on April 28 at midnight, but Armenia continues  to attack", said President Aliyev.    Azeri President mentioned that the peacemaking mission of  the  CSCE Minsk Group will lead to no effect without a cease-fire.  The leader of the delegation, Deputy Chairman of the Minsk  Group, Mathias Mosberg, agreed with this point of view.    "A cease-fire is the key element to the settlement of this  problem. The aim of our visit to the region is to achieve a  truce and we will make every effort to bring that about",  stressed Mosberg.    Today, the delegation is scheduled to visit the war zone and  then will return to Baku. After that the delegation again will  visit Khankendi [Stepanakert] and Yerevan.</p>

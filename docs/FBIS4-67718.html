			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interfax article under the "Medicine" rubric: "Ambulance </F> Service Has Begun Strike; Corpses Will Not Be Removed From the  Streets"]    [Text] Yesterday a portion of the workers of Moscow's  Ambulance Service began a strike. According to preliminary data,  10 riding teams of physicians at 8 ambulance service substations  began a strike. At the same time, in the words of strike leader  Leon Akopov, the strike included 10 substations of the 44 in  operation in Moscow.    The main reason for the ambulance workers' strike is a  disagreement between some of the workers and the Main Medical  Administration over reorganization of the service. The strikers  are also insisting that collective agreements be reached and are  demanding the removal of Nikolay Pirotskiy, chief physician of  Moscow's ambulance service.    The strike is occurring in the following form: A team will  respond to patient calls, but they will only complete half of  the medical chart for the patient. During the strike, ambulance  service workers will not remove corpses from Moscow's streets  either.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May.    Colombian sugar exports increased 27.7 percent in 1993 while  sugar production fell 0.33 percent. This drop meant that 1.833  million tons of sugar were produced in 1993 compared to 1.839  tons in 1992. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 7 May 94  p 3B)    As of 12 May, 125 kg of coffee will be sold at a price of  132,000 pesos, which constitutes a 10-percent increase over the  former price. The National Committee of Coffee-Growers agreed  on this price readjustment on 11 May. The increase obtained  will give the National Coffee Fund additional revenues of 70  billion pesos. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in  Spanish 1200 GMT 12 May 94)    The financial system continues to have liquidity problems.  The interbanking rate dropped to 35-percent annually. Savings  accounts are growing at an average rate of 44-percent. An  increase in imports has helped increase the current dollar  exchange price to 841 pesos. Interest rates are stable. The  inflation rate for the first trimester of 1994 has been around  12 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 May 94 p  2B)</p>

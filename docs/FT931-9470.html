			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Money Markets: French futures dive THE PROSPECTS for rate cuts in France dimmed in the eyes of many dealers yesterday as French franc futures fell sharply once again, writes James Blitz. A 50-basis point fall in the June French franc contract yesterday highlighted the extent to which dealers now think that French interest rates will remain high for some time to come. The June contract closed at 90.69, at which level it prices 3-month money at 9.31 per cent in the summer. That is a remarkably high level, considering that the annual rate of inflation is at about 2 per cent. Cash rates also reflected the bearish tone, with 3-month money rising to 12 3/8 per cent from 12 per cent on Thursday, and 6-month money up at 11 1/4 per cent from 11 per cent the previous day. The pressure in interest rate markets had little to do with the position of the French currency, which was more-or-less stable throughout the day. However, there has been speculation in France all week, most notably from Mr Raymond Barre, the former French prime minister, that another attack on the D-Mark/franc parity will take place around next month's parliamentary elections. Mr Barre said earlier this week that he did not believe another speculative attack would succeed. But Paris dealers were concerned yesterday that the Bank of France was finding it difficult to build up its foreign exchange reserves, following the huge intervention to support the franc before Christmas. One dealer suggested yesterday that the Bank had spent some FFr150bn worth of foreign currency supporting the franc last December. However, a reading of its latest weekly report led him to believe that, in the week ending February 4th, the Bank had only managed to recoup FFr10bn in foreign exchange. Sterling futures fell sharply yesterday morning as the pound dropped to a new historic low against the D-Mark in Asian trading. The March future was down 12 basis points to a low of 94.03 at one stage. But it later recovered to close at 94.17 after retail price inflation fell to an annualised 1.7 per cent against 2.6 per cent in December. In the cash market 3-month money closed  1/16 per cent softer at 6 1/8 per cent.</p>

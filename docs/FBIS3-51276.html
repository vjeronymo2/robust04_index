			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria with </F> local reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Narino  Government Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota--live]    [Text] [Gaviria] The finance minister represents the  Colombia of today and the country's process of modernization.  Colombia would like to again become a serious country, a  country that wishes to become internationalized, a country that  does not want populist politics but wants to modernize. The  minister became a terrorist target due to what he represents.  The idea is to intimidate all of those who would like to  modernize this country. The minister, therefore, represents a  threat to them, the guerrillas, who are incapable of convincing  the Colombian people with their laconic language, with their  message of violence and terrorism. Obviously, they oppose all  changes in this country; they do not want this country to feel  sure of itself or leave violence behind.    [Moderator] A question by Carlos Ruiz from Caracol while  Javier Cardenas of Super gets ready.    [Ruiz] Mr. President, the American community awaits your  statement regarding your candidacy to the post of OAS secretary  general. Will you accept the nomination that certain countries  have proposed?    [Gaviria] I still do not know if I will accept. It is public  knowledge that several countries, several governments, have  expressed interest that the Colombian president be nominated to  the post of OAS secretary general. I am listening to some of  the arguments and have spoken to numerous heads of state, and  the foreign minister has made consultations. When we estimate  that the time is right, we will make a decision, considering not  Cesar Gaviria's personal interests but the country's interests,  the nation's interests, and we will see whether the country is  interested in holding the seat of OAS secretary general. That  is why public opinion should realize that I would be  representing the country as a Colombian candidate and not simply  as my personnel aspiration.    [Moderator] The next question is by Javier Cardenas of Radio  Super while Carlos Ruiz of Caracol gets ready.    [Cardenas] Mr. President, what is your reply to the people  who say that you are negotiating the post of OAS secretary  general in exchange for allowing the installation of U.S.  military bases in Colombia?    [Gaviria] I believe those affirmations are ridiculous,  simply  ridiculous. I understand there can be people who may question  the presence of advisers or engineer personnel or people who are  helping to fight drug trafficking in Colombia, and I would be  willing to reply to such a question. The Colombian president  does not negotiate the country's position, however. The  president defends the country's sovereignty, defends the  country's interests, even though the president can understand  that in certain cases there can be legitimate doubts and  concerns. In other cases the president sees certain intentions  to protect drug-trafficking interests; unfortunately, in these  comments all sorts of opinions become intermingled. There are  the concerns of those who legitimately have concerns, worries,  and doubts, while there are some who may worry that the country  will continue its antidrug--trafficking struggle. Unfortunately,  many recent rumors are seemingly promoted by the latter.    [Moderator] Next question is by Antonio Jose Caballero of  RCN  while Sabina Hernandez from Toledar gets ready.    [Caballero] Mr. President, are you willing to reply to the  other part of the question? Public opinion is listening. Why  did the gentlemen come to Juanchaco Base? What are their  specific tasks? Why did U.S. airplanes overfly Barranquilla  yesterday while people complained--especially after they  overflew the airport?    [Gaviria] With pleasure. You have asked me two questions,  but I will reply with pleasure, because these are related  topics. In Colombia there is a U.S. military presence engaged  in civilian work, advisory work, maintenance work, training of  Colombian troops, and, on other occasions, their own training.  Colombia approved a law back in 1947. There are numerous  agreements, memorandums of understanding, and accords. These  U.S. military missions have taken place during every  administration. The specific case of Juanchaco is covered by a  memorandum of understanding signed by Defense Minister Rafael  Pardo and the U.S. ambassador for joint engineers corps  exercises. I would say that the building of a school and  hospital are subproducts of a joint engineer corps training.  The same goes for the building of river ports, such as the one  built in San Jose del Guaviare, another being built in Puerto  Lopez in El Meta Department, and others that are planned in  Magangue even though there is still an agreement that these are  tasks of an engineering corps nature, which are backed by an  agreement between both governments.    Regarding the overflights yesterday, those were duly  authorized flights that are part of the struggle against drug  traffickers. The Colombian Air Force has authorized them, which  is legal. The Civilian Aeronautics Directorate was duly  notified, and because these airplanes have radars, they report  to the control towers of the Colombian military base in  Barranquilla; therefore, as far as the president of the Republic  knows, everything had been agreed within the procedures. There  was no violation. These airplanes--which were authorized by the  Colombian Air Force--did not have to report to the control  tower, and the Colombian flights were not in danger.    That is the information the president has received from the  Director of Civilian Aeronautics, as well as from the defense  minister; nevertheless, the Civilian Aeronautics Directorate is  conducting an investigation and will release some information,  but the information I have received today from the commander of  the military forces, acting defense minister, as well as from  the director of Civilian Aeronautics totally coincides to what  happened, and, as far as we have been able to verify, those  flights involved no irregularity.    [Moderator] Sabina Hernandez from Todelar Radio poses a  question, and Azucena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast  prepares her question.    [Hernandez] Mr. President, after this morning's attack on  the  finance minister, it was reported that other cabinet members,  other government officials have been threatened. Isn't it  worrisome that we have these types of violent deeds and threats  against high-ranking government officials?    [Gaviria] Of course, of course it is; and the country must  know and always remember that in this country there are  guerrilla groups dedicated to terrorism, that the individuals  who perform public duties--not just the members of the  government but other types of public duties, such as journalism  and other activities, people linked to the private sector--must  take relatively important security precautions. The government  is taking many precautions but cannot fully guarantee anyone's  security.    As I already said, these are desperate actions by Colombian  guerrillas, aimed at trying to show that they still at least  have the terrorist force, even if their military force has been  undermined, and statistics clearly show this. They want to show  that even if the number of kidnappings in Colombia has been  reduced significantly, that the number of guerrillas in jail has  grown rapidly, that the number of soldiers killed in combat is  much less than the numbers of previous years, that even if we  have so many successes to show in the struggle against drug  traffic, against the guerrillas and against terrorism, they have  even more capacity for producing personal attacks such as the  one against the finance minister. [sentence as heard]    [Moderator] Azucena Lievano asks her question, and Diana  Mateus of the [word indistinct] Radio.    [Lievano] Mr. President, Rafael Santos' column in EL TIEMPO  says that he feels that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin is looking  for a seat for the president of the Republic with the nation's  resources and in the presidential plane, which is touring some  countries seeking votes for you at the OAS. What is your  response to this?    [Gaviria] I answered that question in part, but I think it  would be good to broaden the response.    This country, as part of its modernization process, must  also  modernize its international policy. Countries do not get  automatic positions at international organizations, rather,  through the support they get and by presenting their candidacies  as candidacies of the country. If the country continues to  adhere to the idea that the aspiration or possibilities of its  nationals to aspire to organizations of governments, such as  this one, we would simply never have access to the international  organizations. [sentence as heard]    The other individuals who have nominated themselves for this  office--and I have not--have the full support of their  governments. A foreign minister has been campaigning for several  years, and no one from his country has told him he is  undermining his country's interests or asked him why he does it.  The other one is a former foreign minister, and he did so in  the same manner and he has all the support of the Venezuelan  Foreign Ministry.    These are things that form part of the learning process the  country has to undergo to overcome its provincialism and to  understand that for a country it is important to get  international positions.    I believe this country should feel honored, because other  presidents and other governments believe their president can be  secretary of the organization of all the American states. What  the foreign minister is doing is being done for the country; she  is involved in a consultation process. She has also carried out  extensive processes to achieve progress in Colombia's  cooperation with Caribbean nations; that is a process to which  we have been committed for quite a while.    You have seen the president travel to Trinidad and Tobago;  you have seen the president travel to Jamaica. You have seen  how the country has tried to amend something that represented a  critical mistake in our international policy, meaning, turning  our back on the Caribbean. There are other Caribbean countries  on the continent--Venezuela, Canada, the United States,  Mexico--which have an active presence there.    Unfortunately, because we have always looked toward the  Andean mountains and never toward our seas and outside our  country, we had that attitude of ignoring and turning our back  on the Caribbean. We have now changed that attitude and are  looking toward the Caribbean; we are working in the Caribbean.    In my opinion, what the foreign minister is doing is useful  for the nation, and it has been done based on something that  benefits the country's interests rather than its president.    [Moderator] The following question is from Diana Matheus of  Radio Santa Fe. William Parra of CMI is next.    [Matheus] Mr. President, if your nomination to the post of  OAS secretary general is confirmed, aren't you afraid this might  provoke political confrontations, particularly with the Costa  Rican Government, whose president and foreign minister have  stated this might result if you accept this nomination to the  OAS post? Also, if you are not elected, will you play the fool,  as some presidential hopefuls have stated?    [Gaviria] First of all, I would like to make something  clear:  I have made no decision; you are asking a hypothetical question.  Second, the Costa Rican president and his foreign minister have  clearly stated that there could be no confrontation between the  two countries. It would be a friendly and normal dispute within  international relations. I believe the country would hurt  itself greatly if it were to think that the only way to be  present at an international organization would be by getting  unanimous votes. A country would do itself a disservice if it  were to believe that it cannot compete or that if it loses it is  a national tragedy. No. To be part of the community of nations  is to understand the rules of democracy. It is to understand  that one can participate, can present candidates, or can win or  lose.    I am not speaking about my personal case. I am talking about  any case or any candidate presented by Colombia. Colombia  cannot tie itself down to the anachronistic idea that if a  candidate is presented it is due to personal not national  interests and that a candidate cannot be presented unless there  is a certainty that he will win. If that certainty is not  there, what would the international community think? What kind  of an attitude is this? I think these are very big  misconceptions about a country's international policy.    A country that wants to have a presence in the international  scenario must be willing to face these contingencies. It must  present candidates, nominate its nationals, fight for them, and  abide by the rules of democracy. I am not talking about my  personal case. I must examine all factors, listen to  commentaries. I must read what the columnist wrote yesterday or  the comments made by distinguished presidential hopefuls.    You must be certain that I will assess them, but this does  not mean that the country should cling to such anachronistic  ideas, ideas that are very foreign to the country's interests.    I think that to refuse to have an international presence, to  fail to participate in international organizations, and to feel  that it is indecorous to compete is very bad for a country.    [Moderator] William Parra will ask the next question. Pablo  Mantino of Colprensa will prepare his question.    [Parra] Mr. President, there are certain analysts who are  saying that the attack on the finance minister is a way of  reminding the government of the guerrilla presence or a way of  pressuring the government into a dialogue. Your government has  favored the policy of repression. The doors to dialogue have  been closed for the time being. To what extent will your  government be willing to implement again the peace policy? To  what extent will we be on the verge of witnessing elections that  will again be violent, elections with attacks on the candidates,  not by drug traffickers this time but by guerrillas?    [Gaviria] The Colombian president--this president--has never  shut the door to political solutions. I believe in them, and I  think that they will bring peace to this country some time in  the future. The guerrillas can be certain of one thing,  however: The government's policy will not change as long as  there are terrorist attacks and bombs. On the contrary, this is  convincing us further of the need to insist on our policy of  strengthening intelligence and the public force, insisting on  creating counterinsurgency battalions and mobile brigades, and  strengthening our justice. This is all attacks like this  produce. Another thing they produce is the nation's  indignation, the people's rejection of guerrillas. I am certain  that there is not a single good citizen--good citizens are the  majority of the people in Colombia--in this country who does not  reject an attack like the one this morning. If the guerrillas  think they are going to change this nation through attacks, they  are very wrong. All they are doing is isolating themselves  further.    [Moderator] The following question is by Fabio Pantino,  followed by Maria Claudia Pena of LA PRENSA.    [Pantino] Mr. President, the Socialist Renewal Movement has  warned that the Antikidnapping Law is a legal stumbling block to  any agreement with the government. What can the government do  to dispel any apprehension by the Socialist Renewal Movement?    [Gaviria] My answer is that that is a discussion we must  hold  at the negotiating table with the Socialist Renewal Movement.  Sooner or later we will come to a point where we must hold a  discussion on that issue; we will have to find a solution at the  negotiating table. The position of the government, the  government negotiator, the peace adviser, and the government  minister is that-- as cited by the Congress of the  Republic--kidnapping will not be a [word indistinct]. We have  to hold discussions with the movement at the negotiating table,  and I would not like to draw conclusions on what the  negotiations would be like, nor am I at liberty to interpret the  movement's position. Nevertheless, the government's position  has been that one, and that position is supported by the  president of the Republic. The antikidnapping law cannot be set  aside during discussions with the Socialist Renewal Movement.    [Moderator] The following question is by Maria Claudia Pena  and will be followed by Hugo Barter from Univision.    [Pena] Mr. President, in case you do decide to run for the  post of OAS secretary general and in case you are elected, would  you be willing to resign as president?    [Gaviria] I would like to say that I have not thought about  that. Hypothetically, if I were to run and win, I would expect  the position to be compatible with the conclusion of my  presidential term. If I do decide to run, those within the OAS  organization in charge of making decisions will have to remember  that my presidential term ends on 7 August 1994. In this  respect, I would have to request congressional permission to  travel, and I am sure there would be no problems.    [Moderator] It is now Hugo Bartlet's turn, followed by Ana  Fernanda Valderrama from the "National" newscast.    [Bartlet] Mr. President, during this last stage of your  administration, what will be the objective--militarily  speaking--if at this time the guerrillas have become public  enemy number one concerning terrorism?    [Gaviria] We do not plan to change our policy toward the  guerrillas due to what took place. The guerrillas have been  conducting terrorism for a long time. Maybe they have not  conducted any terrorist attacks such as the one against Minister  Hommes for some time. Their activities within the urban area  were mostly restricted to explosions and some bus burnings.  This attack makes it more unusual, however, and places the  guerrillas in a more recalcitrant position than what they had  previously adopted. They have now resorted not only to  terrorist attacks but to selective attacks.    Somehow this will serve to remind the country how the  guerrillas really think. The guerrillas believe that the  process of more democracy and modernization can tolerate violent  acts. This attack gives us a picture of the real nature of the  Colombian guerrilla movement, how it thinks, how cruel it is,  how merciless it is, and how its back is completely turned to  what national reality really is. That is what it has shown us  today. This stresses that the policy we have followed so far is  the most appropriate.    [Moderator] Ana Fernanda Valderrama, followed by Fancisco  Celis of EL TIEMPO.    [Valderrama] Good afternoon, Mr. President. The Colombian  Government has not hesitated on numerous occasions to forward  protest notes to other countries due to abuses against  Colombians in other countries. Concerning Venezuela there have  been numerous reports of abuses along the border, however, and  abuses against Colombian prisoners in that country. There was a  report recently related to a helicopter that crashed in  Colombian territory. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin traveled to  Venezuela, and just when everyone was expecting a protest note  it never came. Why does the Colombian Government hesitate so  much when it comes to this case?    [Gaviria] Relations between Colombia and Venezuela are  excellent. President-elect Rafael Caldera has also said the  same thing. There will be more and more incidents as our  economic and political relations continue to grow. We cannot  respond to every incident through protest notes unless it is  absolutely necessary.    The Venezuelan authorities--their foreign minister, defense  minister, president, attorney general-- have all heard our  versions of the facts, our report. They have offered to  investigate them and have undertaken their own investigation.  We trust that those responsible will be punished if our version  of the facts turns out to be true, as I think it is. We have  the duty, however, of having a constructive relationship with a  nation whose relations are good, with whom we have a common  destiny, and we are not undermining our sovereignty or the  rights of Colombians by not sending a protest note every time  there is an incident.    We also have to remember that over there they also have  problems, that there are Colombian guerrillas who kidnap stock  breeders and Venezuelan citizens, that there are Colombians who  are linked to drug-trafficking networks and that they have been  extending their drug-trafficking activities to that country,  that there are Colombians who have links to the robbery of  vehicles.    What if Venezuela did the same thing to Colombia? That for  every incident or every kidnapping, or every such situation,  every stolen car, they sent a protest note? No. The two  nations cannot work this way. These are two sister nations that  have excellent relations. What we try to exhibit is if there is  comprehension and understanding in a relationship, things can be  talked out; they are discussed, analyzed; commitments are made.  If for every incident we sent a protest note, we would not be  helping the relationship between the two nations. Therefore,  the foreign minister--after talking to the defense minister, the  attorney general, the president of the Republic, and the  president-elect--decided that a protest note was unnecessary  and, thus, did not deliver it.    [Moderator] Francisco Veliz asks his question, and Jairo  Gomez of the "Seven O'clock Newscast" prepares his.    [Veliz] Mr. President, the country will receive important  revenue from the sale of the Bank of Colombia and the absorption  of the cellular telephone system. What will happen with those  funds? To what field will it be assigned?    [Gaviria] Concerning the funds from the Bank of Colombia,  there are resources that belong to the Guarantees Fund, which is  the institution that backs all the financial system in case of  problems, and there are resources that belong to the nation;  they are ordinary government resources that must be used in  public projects once they are integrated into the national  budget.    Concerning the resources of the cellular telephone system,  most of them are assigned to the social telephone system, but,  of course, the government and Congress together could designate  how they will be used.    Those are two processes that are using totally open  mechanisms and which, once completed, concerning the Bank of  Colombia, it will be sold after finding the best bidder.  Concerning the cellular telephone system, it will be given to  that enterprise that offers the most resources to the Colombian  state to help in the fulfillment of social objectives [words  indistinct].    [Moderator] Next question by Jairo Gomez of the "Seven  O'Clock Newscast," followed by (Giles Gastowait).    [Gomez] Mr. President, what makes you the best candidate for  the OAS secretary general, the support of the United States and  Canada?    [Gaviria] I am not the one who should say I am the best  candidate. I evaluate the expressions and opinions of other  countries and governments. Some of them are public; they come  from countries of South America, North America, and it is  obvious that to participate in the process, there will have to  be support from the Caribbean and Central America; otherwise it  would be very difficult to be OAS secretary general. I am  evaluating all of those opinions.    It has been the governments of certain friendly countries  that have issued certain opinions regarding the Colombian  president. I am not the person who should make that statement.  Certain foreign governments, through their spokesmen, have made  those statements.    I think the most common reason is that certain countries  want a former Latin American president for secretary general.  They have many reasons to believe the OAS must move in that  direction. There are others who have [one-second break in  reception] of the modernization processes in Colombia,  commitments with certain economic policies. There is something  I would like all those present here to remember: Look at  Colombia's voting record at the OAS or the United Nations or at  any other international organization. I ask you to judge  whether Colombia's international policy is independent.    If there is one thing this administration has done, it is to  implement an international policy that is completely  independent. The criticism we have received is generally due to  just that--the independence we have exhibited and the autonomy  of this nation. But also for that reason we have found the  support of countries that have attitudes that are quite  different. There have been many occasions when the U.S. State  Department did not agree with Brazil or Mexico on Latin American  problems or world issues, but that did not prevent them from  agreeing on this occasion.    We have a long tradition of independence in matters of  international policy. If the president of Colombia can find some  kind of support, it must be based on that record--its tradition  of having a very independent international policy. Therefore,  all those suspicions that have been emerging will not affect the  truth, the way Colombia votes at international organizations.  The way Colombia votes is the way the president of Colombia  thinks. Those little insinuations that have been made over the  past few days cannot undermine our international policy, because  our foreign policy is there and is evident in treaties,  decisions, public statements, and votes at international  organizations.    [Moderator] Guiles Casuay will ask a question. Cesar  Mauricio Velasquez will prepare for the last question.    [Casuay] Good afternoon, Mr. President. EL TIEMPO published  yesterday an article saying that the Presidency was worried  about the progress of the talks for the surrender of the Cali  Cartel bosses; is that true? How do you view the [words  indistinct]?    [Gaviria] We have our own views about the policy of turning  over to justice those who are linked with the cartels, the  cartels of Valle del Cauca, the Coast, or so many  drug-trafficking organizations existing in Colombia.    Each has its own responsibility. The prosecuting offices  have their own scope of responsibilities. They are clearly  prescribed in the Penal Code. The Penal Code establishes its  duties and responsibilities.    The government has other responsibilities, such as security  at jails, [words indistinct] decisions on how long should an  inmate stay in this or that jail. The government is very  committed to the policy of [word indistinct] justice.    It must be understood that for the government to give  certain  guarantees, people should confess their crimes; that must be  their cooperation with justice. Of course, the individual must  go to a high-security jail if it is a dangerous criminal.    On certain occasions we have had arguments with other  organizations, the Attorney General's Office, or the prosecuting  office. I am quite certain, however, that only by listening to  other points of view can we design a policy that will respond to  the country's interests. The guarantees that the government  could eventually give should only be given in exchange for an  effective cooperation that will serve to punish criminals,  dismantle the drug cartels, and maintain an active attitude in  the face of the drug-trafficking problem and a consistent policy  that is the only thing that can make us overcome this problem.    Unfortunately, if one ignores the problem or does like the  ostrich hiding its head, ignoring the problem or allowing  criminal organizations to grow in the face of our indifference  [words indistinct] Colombia in the past and its effects were  disastrous.    I believe it is much more positive to follow a policy of  being firm and clear, not ignoring drug-trafficking cartels,  facing and fighting them. The operations by our public force  and our justice are also positive. An essential part of this  policy is the [word indistinct] of the surrender policy. The  criminals, cornered by the action of the public force, will  surrender to authorities, confess their crimes, and undergo a  just trial. They will be given guarantees, and this will help  us dismantle the criminal drug- trafficking organizations.    [Moderator] Cesar Mauricio Velasquez will ask the last  question.    [Velasquez] Mr. President, certain politicians have said  they  cannot reach more than 170 municipalities in the country to  conduct their political campaign. Don't you think the event  that occurred this morning plus the fact that certain  territories are off limits to politicians and even the Armed  Forces are part of the pressure exerted by the guerrilla groups  to resume negotiations with your government and the next?    [Gaviria] I understand very well it is risky to participate  in politics in Colombia. I have experienced this and know what  kind of difficulties and risks politicians must face.  Fortunately, our political leaders defy those risks and  challenges, and they travel to the 170 municipalities and....  [pauses] They are not 170, there could be more, much more.    The guerrilla groups have some kind of presence, whatever it  may be, in 500 municipalities all over Colombia, practically  half of Colombia's municipalities. Our political leaders defy  that. They have always defied this, and they go there and take  risks and get elected, and the political groups that somehow  supported the guerrilla movement are noticeably rejected. They  practically have no political presence whatsoever, because the  people reject them.    Just as it has happened on so many occasions, I am sure the  political leaders of this nation will face those risks, defeat  violent groups, and let no one intimidate them despite the  evident acts of guerrilla violence. Mayors have been killed;  that is why we will resort to the Public Order Law to appoint  military mayors, because we cannot continue to play the  guerrilla groups' game. They kill mayors and society remains  defenseless and simply replaces them with other mayors so they  can kill them also, or so they can force the mayors to give in  to their demands. No!    The public order law certified by the Attorney General's  Office states clearly that mayors are being killed by guerrilla  groups. There is clear evidence in this concern. We will have  to resort to that instrument. We will use it in a Boyaca  Department municipality and in a Casanare Department  municipality.    We are determined to protect political leaders so that we  may  be able to state they face no risks. We hope.... [pauses] We  are sure that will be the case, meaning, our leaders will face  those risks. We will prove to the violent groups in our nation  that our democracy and those who represent it, with the peoples'  support, are more powerful then their dirty and violent weapons  and their message of violence and hate.</p>

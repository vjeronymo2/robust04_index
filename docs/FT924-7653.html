			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Britain trims its wise council: A UK agency respected abroad but forced to scrabble for profit by its own land THE British Council, the UK's cultural diplomacy outfit has long been portrayed as a bunch of ineffectual amateurs promoting decadent pursuits abroad. There is unlikely to be much of an outcry, therefore, over cuts in government spending announced in this week's autumn statement which threaten to curtail the council's activities. That will surprise many in eastern and central Europe, where the council is playing an important role in the transition from communism to capitalism. Amid all the gloom over the UK's diminishing role as a world power, there is a high regard for the old bulldog in the former countries of the Soviet bloc for which the British Council can take much of the credit. In Czechoslovakia, the council could operate throughout the communist period only as the cultural section of the British embassy. After the velvet revolution in 1989, the council expanded its activities, aided by resources provided by the Foreign Office for former Soviet bloc countries. 'There was a pent-up hunger for the sort of cultural contact with the west after years when such contacts were disapproved of,' says the UK ambassador, David Brighty. The council has moved out of the embassy and into offices in Prague which used to house the East German trade mission. These, refurbished and equipped with the latest technology, establish 'a public presence that flaunts itself, providing an excellent shop window for Britain', says Brighty. When Vaclav Havel, then President, opened the new centre in April, he recalled that in his childhood, his mother's twice-weekly nights out at British Council events in pre-communist days had been the highlights of her life. Milos Brunclik, now the Czechoslovak news agency man in Bratislava also has fond memories: 'I was at a British Council lecture in 1948 which broke up when a boy burst in to warn us that the secret police were parked outside,' he recalls. 'Most of those present slipped out of the back door to avoid harassment, but I escaped by linking arms with two formidable English women who worked for the council and walking out through the front door - the police assumed I was British.' In Czechoslovakia the council has seven resource centres in provincial cities to underpin the teaching of English in schools. These offer books, tapes, videos, teaching aids, information on examinations, courses and advice for teachers. Specialists are seconded from the UK to train the thousands of new English teachers who are needed, and to retrain Russian teachers whose skills are redundant. The council is also a channel for development aid from the Know-How Fund, a programme for developing the skills of budding capitalists and democrats. These range from bringing top managers over to study business in the UK, to training management trainers and support for local training organisations to develop sustainable management institutions in Czechoslovakia. But why should the people of this central European country, of which we in Britain famously know little, want anything to do with a second-rate fading offshore island? After all, there is little doubt over who is the regional power at the heart of Europe, as the flood of German tourists and businessmen crossing the Czech border attests. The answer appears to be that the Czechoslovaks are reluctant to become a mere appendage of their powerful neighbour. Bill Jefferson, the council's man on the ground, says there is much competition for further Council centres between mayors who offer prime sites at peppercorn rents to see the union jack flying in their towns as a visible rejoinder to the overweening power of the deutschemark. There is also an interest in British arts and culture which the council meets through the customary programme of cultural exchanges and visits - such as a much talked-about tour by the Royal National Theatre 18 months ago. Ironically, the tour was sponsored by a Japanese bank, Nomura. Council revenue from sponsorship has risen from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 5.5m since 1990. More than Pounds 40m, around 10 per cent of total income, comes from the fees charged for English language teaching. There are other sources of income which the council has become adept at tapping, such as contracts for development work from the World Bank and the EC. But the government grant and contracts for UK development aid provide the bulk of the income, and both are threatened. The impact of this week's direct cuts is insidious enough - withdrawal from some of the 90 countries where the council works must be on the cards, at a time when the break-up of the Soviet Union and the liberation of central and eastern Europe has created some 20 new countries, all needing encouragement through the transition to democracy. But there is also the slow-burning fuse of the government's market-testing programme. This requires the Foreign Office's Overseas Development Administration to put out to tender development work currently done under contract by the council. John Hanson, the council's new chief executive, is confident that it will win most of those contracts. But already the council has lost some to outside competitors. As Sir Martin Jacomb, the retired banker who chairs the British Council, puts it: 'The loss of a contract can mean losing critical mass in a country. And once you have had to withdraw from a country, you will be seen to have turned your back on it forever.' The example of Czechoslovakia is particularly apposite. After the communist coup, the restrictions on its operations might have led the council to cut its losses and write off this Soviet satellite. If that had been done, the contacts and influence which have made British aid and bridge-building so effective since the return of democracy would have been much harder to re-establish.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: WHEN CALORIES COUNT, MUNCH ON FRESH FRUIT  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I am trying to watch my calorie and sugar intake, so I regularly  munch on dried fruits, especially apples and bananas. But a friend has told me  that they are extremely high in calories.  </P> <P>  -- DOREEN, Arkadelphia, Ark.  </P> <P> DEAR DOREEN: Many dried fruits are higher in calories and sugar than fresh  fruit, so your friend is right. Most fresh fruit is a better choice when  watching calorie and sugar intake, and they can be a good source of fiber.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I bought a wooden bread box, it had an odor that penetrated  the bread. I bought some adhesive-backed plastic in a wood-type print and  completely covered the inside of the box with it.  </P> <P> I can now use the bread box and am not bothered by the pesky odor.  </P> <P>  -- MRS., M., San Fernando  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I am a busy working mother of two young sons, and dinner was  getting later and later because the baby wanted to be held and my older son  wanted my attention.  </P> <P> So, I found a way to spend time with them and prepare dinner too. I get an  activity -- coloring, cutting or pasting -- for my older son to do at the  kitchen table, and I put the baby in a front-pack infant carrier. Now I can  talk with my older son and carry the little one.  </P> <P>  -- LINDA, Omaha, Neb.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: This is a foolproof way to mix liquid and powder to ensure there  will be no lumps when the mixture is used as a thickener.  </P> <P> You will need a clean, empty jar with a tight-fitting lid. Pour the liquid  (water, milk or bouillon) into the container first then add the flour or  cornstarch and give it a thorough shaking to mix completely. Use it as a  thickener in soups, gravies or casseroles.  </P> <P>  -- LOIS, Ventura  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a problem getting candles to fit into the candle holders.  Please help.  </P> <P>  -- ANN  </P> <P> DEAR ANN: Try using the pleated paper cup linings found in a box of chocolate  candy. They are great for making the bottoms of those candles fit snugly. If  the candles are too large, shave off some of the excess wax until they fit into  the holder.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Since most of my furniture is wood, I have coasters on each  table. The coasters always would stick to the bottom of the glass and fall off  when the glass was raised.  </P> <P> So, I cut some leftover carpet samples into circles to fit the inside of the  coasters and glued them on. Now they don't stick to the glasses.  </P> <P>  -- GLORIA, South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I accidentally discovered that putting on a rubber glove becomes  an excellent way to open a difficult jar. It gives me the necessary traction to  twist off the top. Can't believe I didn't come across this solution sooner.  </P> <P>  -- ROSE, Milltown, N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Recycling has always been a problem around our house because of  the clutter. We seem to have aluminum cans everywhere.  </P> <P> One day when I was out garage-sale shopping, I ran across a plastic trash can.  I placed the can outside the garage door where it's become a handy  mini-recycling center for the household. It's easy, clean and handy to toss in  the trunk of the car when it's full.  </P> <P>  -- CINDY, Billings, Mont.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have more terry-cloth hand towels than I need for guests, so I  use the extras as napkins for my family. Each member has a different color.  </P> <P> They are a good size, wash easily and save on the paper napkins.  </P> <P>  -- ANN, Asheville, N.C.  </P></p>

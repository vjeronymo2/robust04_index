			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- The Russian president's  envoy for former Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin, described as "a  great political recklessness" possible violations of the  agreement signed in Zagreb yesterday on a ceasefire and  withdrawal of troops and weapons from the delimitating line in  Croatian areas under U.N. control.    Addressing on Thursday a news conference in Moscow, Churkin  gave his assessment of chances that the agreements reached  between Croatia and Serb Krajina will be observed.    The Russian diplomat described the latest document signed by  the warring factions as "a special case" in contrast to previous  agreements which had been frequently broken. This time, Churkin  stressed, "Russia, the United States, the European Union and  U.N. stand behind the parties to the agreement." Thus, "the  party daring to violate the accord would challenge not only the  other side in the conflict but also to these key members of the  world community," Russia's envoy noted.    Furthermore, the point at issue at the moment is an  all-round  agreement, "rather a complicated military-technical document on  disengagement of troops and weapons," which contains "quite  definite, if not ideal, provisions" about U.N. supervision over  its implementation, Churkin emphasised.    Commenting on the content of the agreement, the Russian  diplomat said it comprised not only the text of the document  itself, but also 35 detailed maps signed by the warring  factions. "There should not be any room for uncertainty as to  what the sides should do to fulfil the agreements," Churkin  pointed out.    Therefore, Churkin stressed, he is inclined to believe that  the agreement will be observed. However, he did not rule out  the possiblity of "certain roughness," especially at the most  difficult initial stage of troop disengagement."</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO EASILY POWERS ITS WAY PAST GOLDEN WEST  </P> <P> There's little doubt after Saturday's Mission Conference win over Golden West  College that El Camino College will dominate the rest of its opponents this  season.  </P> <P> The top-ranked Warriors (4-0, 3-0) seemed capable of anything in their 38-14  victory over Golden West (2-2, 2-1), a team they tied last year.  </P> <P> El Camino was so dominant that Coach John Featherstone put in his second-string  quarterback and defense in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Why not? with 14:50 left to play, the Warriors already had a 31-point lead.  Might as well give sophomore quarterback Frank Dolce a rest. He had already  completed 22 of 28 yards for 300 yards and 4 touchdowns.  </P> <P> With 8:20 left in the third quarter, El Camino scored on a five-play, 93-yard  drive. Running back Alfred Lowe scored on a two-yard touchdown run and Dolce  threw to Khevin Pratt for the two-point conversion to give the Warriors a 31-7  lead.  </P> <P> El Camino scored on its last touchdown early in the fourth quarter when Dolce  passed to David Blakes for a 29-yard pass.  </P> <P> Golden West scored on its second touchdown with less than a minute left to play  when third-string quarterback Ron Ramirez hit Robert Bedford for a nine-yard  pass.  </P> <P> "I thought our running game is what kept them off balance," Featherstone said.  "We ran so we could get our big plays through the air."  </P> <P> The Warriors were on a roll from the start. They scored on their first  possession, which came after Anthony Anetema intercepted a Rip Flippo pass down  the middle. Golden West drove 30 yards in four plays before turning the ball  over to the Warriors.  </P> <P> El Camino capped a five-play, 61-yard drive with a 16-yard screen pass from  Dolce to Al Savea for the first score of the game. Louis Perez' point-after  kick put the Warriors up 7-0.  </P> <P> Perez made a 27-yard field goal on the Warriors' next possession to make it  10-0. The Warriors got the ball when Ed Togia recovered Corey Dickson's fumble  during a punt return.  </P> <P> The Warriors marched 32 yards, including a three-yard touchdown run by Dolce  that was called back on a holding penalty.  </P> <P> El Camino scored a touchdown on its next possession, though. The Warriors drove  52 yards in eight plays and Perez' point-after kick made it 17-0. Dolce threw a  16-yard touchdown pass to Shannon Thompson for that score.  </P> <P> Golden West finally scored with 11:20 left in the half, thanks to an El Camino  fumble by Alfred Lowe on the Golden West 15-yard line.  </P> <P> Rustler defensive lineman Robert Erena recovered the ball and Flippo hit Patric  Reilly for a 15-yard touchdown pass on third-and-ten.  </P> <P> El Camino answered with another touchdown. It came after a nine-play, 78-yard  drive that was capped by Dolce's 25-yard pass to David Blakes. That gave the  Warriors a comfortable 23-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> The Warriors take their Mission Conference show to Chula Vista next week where  they face unranked Southwestern, a 28-0 loser to Rancho Santiago.  </P></p>

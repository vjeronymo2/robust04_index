			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> WPPSS Settlement Approved: Six years after the nation's largest municipal bond  default, U.S. District Judge William D. Browning of Tucson has approved  settlements to allow $750 million to be distributed to holders of Washington  Public Power Supply System bonds. Browning, who presided over the WPPSS  litigation, filed a 106-page opinion approving settlements reached in the past  year between Chemical Bank and defendants in the case. Chemical Bank is trustee  for the bondholders. In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds that it  had sold to finance construction of two nuclear power plants in Washington.  </P></p>

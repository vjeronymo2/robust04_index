			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to requests to Program Directors and Federal regulatory agencies, as stipulated in the authorizing legislation for the Program, section 1668 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, the following specific areas of risk assessment research have been identified as priorities for this year: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The bidirectional rates, mechanisms and impact of gene transfer between currently genetically transformable crop species and existing North American wild relatives of those crops including studies of methods of mitigation of potential gene exchange. Species specifically identified by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service include rye, oats, barley, sorghum and turfgrasses. Research could rely on reanalysis of published information and/or laboratory/filed studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The potential for recombination between plant viruses and plant-encoded nocapsid viral genes (e.g. replicase), especially for those viruses in supergroup B (carmovirus, tombusvirus, luteovirus, sobemovirus). Such studies should identify recombination potentials and, if demonstrated, define frequencies and effect on symptom expression. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The potential for plants to express nonviral genes using noncoding regulatory sequences (promoters, translational enhancers, termination sequences) derived from plant viruses that naturally infect the plants (e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus and Brassica supp.). The potential for changes in expression of introduced genes or other aspects of host physiology when the transgenic plant becomes infected with plant viruses, especially those from which the noncoding sequence was derived or related viruses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Changes in viral host ranges or the types of insects which can serve as viral vectors due to the use of transgenic plants expressing viral genes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The potential for nontarget effects of plant-defense compounds expressed in genetically modified plant-associated microorganisms (e.g., compounds in phyllosphere or rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria) or in plants (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Bacillus thuringiensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> delta endotoxin), especially in regard to persistence of the organisms and material in the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Identification of the minimal gene sequence(s) in an animal pathogen which could confer pathogencity on a nonpathogenic organism. Pathogenic organisms specially identified by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as being of interest are Marek's disease virus, laryngo tracheitis virus, bovine leukemia virus, eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, bovine diarrhea virus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Haemophilus somnus. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Individual investigators whose research projects are funded under the Program will be required to attend and present data on results of their research at an Annual Conference. Attendance costs at such a conference do not need to be included in the budgets of proposed research projects; such costs will be borne from funds previously awarded under the Program as part of a conference grant. Additionally, a final project report on research results will be required in a fixed protocol, electronic format, suitable for distribution by USDA on CD&hyph;ROM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicable Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Program is subject to the administrative provisions found in 7 CFR part 3415 (58 FR 65646, December 15, 1993), which set forth procedures to be followed when submitting grant proposals, rules governing the evaluation of proposals, the awarding of grants, and post-award administration of such grants.

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Drought looms over talks on Indian aid INDIA is to meet western donor nations in Paris today for a two-day meeting overshadowed by fears that the momentum of economic reform could be jeopardised by a worsening drought. India is seeking from the consortium of donor nations under the chairmanship of the World Bank Dollars 6.7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in aid pledges for 1992-93 - most of which would be dispersed over the medium term. It is also seeking Dollars 3bn in emergency balance of payments support for the coming year - of which Dollars 2.4bn is expected to come from the IMF and the World Bank. The meeting is seen as a guide to the mood among givers of aid  - in particular whether they push for tougher conditions on future assistance. The World Bank in its annual report on India's economy praised reforms over the last year but emphasised the need to maintain momentum. The government's fear is that reform could be set back by a bad monsoon  - exacerbating inflation and increasing food imports. Rainfall is forecast as likely to be well below normal, worsening the drought in central and western India. The World Bank says India will require a gross capital inflow - grants and loans - of Dollars 9.8bn in 1992-93 to finance its current account deficit and debt repayments.</p>

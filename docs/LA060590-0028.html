			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSIDER;  </P> <P> HIGH NOON IN HOUSTON? WHITE HOUSE FEARS CONFRONTATION;  </P> <P> SUMMIT ALLIES MAY FORCE SHOWDOWN WITH PRESIDENT BUSH OVER GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT.  </P> <P> The world economy usually leads the agenda when the leaders of the world's  seven largest industrial nations hold their annual summit. But when President  Bush and his six counterparts gather in Houston on July 9, U.S. strategists are  worried that the others will gang up on him over another issue -- the global  environment.  </P> <P> Leaders of Western European countries, Japan and Canada already have served  notice that they consider the environment the summit's most important topic and  plan to press for international initiatives on a host of issues, from global  warming to ocean pollution.  </P> <P> But the White House is firmly resisting any dramatic new moves, arguing that  there is still not enough evidence that these problems are genuine or that they  merit the massive spending that would be required to deal with them seriously.  </P> <P> The rigid U.S. stance comes on orders from White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu and Budget Director Richard G. Darman, who have drawn a similar line in  response to demands by domestic environmentalists that the Administration move  more aggressively on these issues.  </P> <P> The White House position has upset several other top Administration  policy-makers, who worry that Bush could be isolated at Houston and dealt an  embarrassing setback -- particularly on efforts to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions, which are thought to contribute to global warming.  </P> <P> Indeed, the President may have lost his last ally last week, when British Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher broke with the Administration's go-slow policies on  carbon dioxide emissions and agreed to join in global efforts to stabilize them  by 2005.  </P> <P> "The Europeans have been very specific on what they'd like to see the summit  accomplish," said one high-ranking U.S. official. "This isn't something that it  will be easy for the U.S. to brush aside. These folks regard the issue as  important, and they're unlikely to back off."  </P> <P> Besides Bush, the summit leaders are Britain's Thatcher, West German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, French President Francois  Mitterrand, Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti and Canadian Prime Minister Brian  Mulroney.  </P> <P> In addition to tackling environmental issues, the summiteers are also expected  to intensify the pressure to complete the current global trade-liberalization  talks and to consider new moves to help the Soviet Union and the emerging  democracies in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> But strategists concede that the biggest potential for a U.S. rift with its  allies is over the environment. "If the summit is to have any credibility on  this issue, then there has to be something more responsive than what Washington  is willing to back," a foreign official said.  </P> <P> If the Bush Administration is isolated at the Houston summit, it would mark the  first time in recent memory that the other industrial countries have dealt a  major setback to the United States on an initiative that U.S. leaders  vigorously opposed.  </P> <P> The summit leaders will take no votes and adopt no resolutions. But they can  mobilize the pressure of world opinion on the United States if they can show  that Bush alone resisted the sort of worldwide cooperation that is thought  necessary to combat some of the globe's environmental woes.  </P> <P> Highest on the European leaders' environmental priority list is a declaration  of support for the effort to head off global climate change by cracking down on  carbon-dioxide emissions, in preparation for signing an international protocol  in 1992.  </P> <P> Summit participants also hope to gain support for a new World Bank plan that  would set up a special lending pool to help poor countries tackle their  environmental problems.  </P> <P> And they want Washington to back the creation of an international fund designed  to help less-developed countries pay for altering their factories and equipment  so that they can phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which deplete  the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration has expressed opposition to each of these  proposals.  </P> <P> The President singled out the plan for immediate action to cope with global  climate change at a White House-sponsored international conference earlier this  year, saying the need had not yet been proved beyond doubt. The Treasury  Department recently refused to back the World Bank plan. And U.S. negotiators,  at a meeting in Geneva in mid-May, declined to join a new multilateral fund for  helping developing countries rid themselves of CFCs. Washington's share would  have been $25 million.  </P> <P> The Europeans will not be the only ones pressuring the Administration. U.S.  environmental groups have set up a summit-nations accountability project  designed to spotlight the Houston meeting and keep up the pressure for  more-sweeping change.  </P></p>

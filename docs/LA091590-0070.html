			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER CONVICTED IN MAN'S SHOOTING DEATH  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Friday found a 19-year-old Arleta woman guilty  of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder for driving a car  used in a drive-by shooting in which a man was killed and his girlfriend  injured.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated nearly three days before finding Karen Argott guilty in  the death of Odilon Gonzalez, 23, of Pacoima and the attempted shooting of his  girlfriend, Irma Ortega, 21, of Van Nuys, on Jan. 13.  </P> <P> The jury also convicted Argott of a felony charge of shooting into an occupied  vehicle.  </P> <P> Eleven to 16 shots were fired at Gonzalez and Ortega as they drove west on  Oxnard Street near Van Nuys Boulevard, police said. Ortega was cut by flying  glass but escaped serious injury when Gonzalez pushed her to the floor of the  car, police said.  </P> <P> Gonzalez, who previously had been identified by authorities as Odilon  Navarette, was shot in the back, both arms and head, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Shellie Samuels, who prosecuted the case.  </P> <P> An arrest warrant was issued for Walter Oswaldo Barillas, 23, of Sepulveda, who  prosecutors allege fired the shots at Argott's behest. Barillas remains at  large, Samuels said.  </P> <P> Samuels said Argott asked Barillas to shoot at the couple in retaliation for an  earlier incident in which her windshield was broken by bottles outside a  birthday party for Ortega's sister. Samuels said Ortega did not take part in  the bottle-throwing.  </P> <P> "It's an unusual drive-by-shooting where it's not the shooter who had the  motives. It's the driver," Samuels said. "But I think she was as culpable as  the shooter in the case. The driver had the motive and the driver went and got  the shooter and brought him to the scene."  </P> <P> Argott's defense attorney, Ralph Peretz, contended that there was no proof that  his client was driving the car.  </P></p>

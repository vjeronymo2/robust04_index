[Begin recording of DPRK Ambassador Chu Chang-chun in  Korean]  We have already informed our friendly nations that we would  regard any economic sanctions against us as a declaration of  war. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will win, win,  and win over in its fight against the economic sanctions sought  by the United States.

We will win at the end even if economic sanctions  are imposed.]    In this way, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun explained North  Korea's stand that it will remain unperturbed even if economic  sanctions are imposed against the DPRK.

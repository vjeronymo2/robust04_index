			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDERSTANDING THE PRESSURES ON APPRAISERS  </P> <P> This letter is in response to Robert Bruss' response to "Don't Accept Appraisal  That You Don't Like" (Aug. 20). It is true that a borrower can request an  additional appraisal. But that is where the truth ends.  </P> <P> Appraisers are not instructed to appraise conservatively. It is just the  opposite. Appraisers are under tremendous pressure to meet sales prices and  owners' expectations.  </P> <P> This presure is put on appraisers by loan brokers, real estate brokers and  agents, and loan agents. To an independent fee appraiser, the threat is: "If  you don't bring the value in, you won't get any more work." To a staff  appraiser, the threat is: "Don't rock the boat, don't make waves, bring the  value in, we are here to make loans."  </P> <P> Bruss does not appear to understand what an appraisal is or the restraints put  on the appraiser by the different government and quasi-government agencies.  </P> <P> An appraisal is an opinion of value. Appraisers are required to adhere to  extensive rules and parameters set by these agencies. Most conventional lenders  require that closed sale comparables are used to base the value on. This means  that appraisers are using historical data, not current escrows, to base their  opinion on.  </P> <P> In a rapidly appreciating real estate market, it is often difficult to support  sales prices using these closed sales. These rules are not set by the  appraisers. These rules were developed to protect the banks and savings and  loans. Finally, if you have a complaint, complain to the Federal Home Loan Bank  Board, FNMA FHMLC or to your congressperson. We are tired of hearing your  whining.  </P> <P> KENNETH B.

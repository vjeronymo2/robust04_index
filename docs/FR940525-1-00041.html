The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section II.D of this appendix A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Recourse  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset a bank has transferred that is in excess of the bank's pro rata share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from: (a) a default of principal or interest or (b) any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> direct credit substitute  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> is the assumption, in form or in substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the bank's pro rata share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues a financial standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities, or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection to the third party owners of the assets being serviced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the bank's exposure to be converted into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount typically is the full face value of the direct credit substitute. However, for direct credit substitutes carried on the balance sheet that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute which is itself being assigned to one of the four broad risk weight categories. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the bank's exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the bank's balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For risk-based capital purposes, nonstandard representations or warranties that a bank may extend in transferring assets (including the transfer of servicing rights) or assume in other transactions (including the acquisition of loan servicing rights) are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard representations and warranties,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights are acquired. Standard representations and warranties are also generally accompanied by contractual provisions that provide for the return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> servicer cash advance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> is an arrangement under which the servicer of a loan advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan. A servicer cash advance does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if: (a) the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement for the amount of the advance or (b) for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> D. *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for an off-balance sheet item to be incorporated into a bank's risk-weighted assets, the on-balance sheet  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> credit equivalent amount  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of the item must first be determined. Once the credit equivalent amount is determined, this amount is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The method for determining the credit equivalent amount of an interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract is set forth in section II.E.1 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount is determined by multiplying the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> full amount of the bank's exposure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> under the item by the applicable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> credit conversion factor  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in sections II.B.6 and II.D.1 of this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the bank's exposure that must be converted to a credit equivalent amount is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with the item which is itself being assigned to one of the four risk weight categories. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the bank's exposure that must be converted to a credit equivalent amount may be the same as or greater than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of financial standby letters of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of the customer's loan or debt instrument that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the full amount of the bank's exposure under an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount and then incorporated in risk-weighted assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital charge. However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction (including a transaction reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) is limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the bank if this amount is less than the full effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other claim that is supported by the bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

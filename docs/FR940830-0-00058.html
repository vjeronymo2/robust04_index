			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437l) (``the Act''), as amended by section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (the ``1987 Act'') and Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (``NAHA''), established the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP), which was designed to govern the modernization needs of PHAs and IHAs that own and operate 250 or more public or Indian housing units. PHAs and IHAs that own and operate fewer than 250 public or Indian housing units are governed by the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The reader should note that, hereafter, for ease of discussion, the preamble to this final rule uses the terms ``public housing'' to refer to both public and Indian housing, and ``HAs'' or ``housing agency,'' to refer to both PHAs and IHAs, unless otherwise stated. In addition, the term ``development'' is used to refer to ``low-income projects,'' as defined at section 3(b)(l) of the Act.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department promulgated regulations for the CGP and CIAP at 24 CFR parts 905 and 968, and these regulations have governed the modernization of public and Indian housing assisted under the Act. On February 14, 1992, the Department published the final rule for the CGP at 57 FR 5514. The February 14, 1992 rule amended the CIAP at 24 CFR part 968, subpart B, to limit its applicability to HAs that own or operate fewer than 500 public housing units (fewer than 250 units beginning in Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 1993); added a new subpart C to part 968, which sets forth the new CGP for HAs that own or operate a total of 500 or more public housing units (250 or more units beginning in FFY 1993); and revised both the CIAP and CGP programs for purposes of implementing various technical and substantive program amendments contained in sections 509 (b) through (f) of the NAHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 15, 1993, the Department published an interim rule for CIAP at 58 FR 13916 for HAs with less than 250 units in FFY 1993 and minor technical corrections for CGP. The CIAP interim rule was published in response to public comment requesting both streamlining and simplification and was also based on experience gained through program operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 8, 1994, the Department published a proposed CGP rule for comment at 59 FR 10876 (hereinafter referred to as the ``proposed rule''). The proposed rule requested comments on HUD's efforts to simplify and expedite the CGP planning and funding process for HAs that own or operate 250 or more public or Indian housing units. HUD also requested comments on other aspects affecting the operation of the CGP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD received 35 comments in response to the proposed rule for CGP. Comments were received from 23 PHAs, 5 IHAs, one individual and 6 interest groups including Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (PHADA), National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA), National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC), Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN), and Pacific Southwest Region Development and Modernization Coordinators (PSRDMC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments were overwhelmingly positive and were supportive of HUD's efforts to simplify and expedite the CGP. Commenters were pleased that HUD had minimized the regulation and provided HAs with more flexibility. The aspects of this rule which generated the most comment were the proposed full fungibility of work items over a five-year period and eligible costs, especially management improvements and administrative costs. This summary will outline the comments with HUD's response in the regulation order. Comments on the public housing regulation (Part 968) and Indian housing regulation (Part 905) have been combined except where there are differences in the provisions for public and Indian housing. Miscellaneous comments and responses will follow the comments on the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

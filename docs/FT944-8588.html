			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Yeltsin backs reform and austerity budget President Boris Yeltsin yesterday expressed strong support for economic reform in Russia and for the first time publicly endorsed the austere 1995 draft budget, which is seen by many economists as a prelude to a full stabilisation plan but which ran into fierce parliamentary opposition earlier this week. 'Our financial policy is determined by the draft budget - it is tough, but it is necessary in our conditions,' he said. However, Mr Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, fighting for his political life after allegations of corruption in the military, later launched an emotional attack on the 1995 budget, saying its proposed spending cuts put the army 'under threat'. 'For the sake of the country's security think about this budget. Ask yourself - do we need an army? If so, it is a sin to keep it in poverty and half-starved,' he told the Duma, the lower house of parliament. Mr Yeltsin's continuing adherence to economic reform had appeared in doubt after a recent ministerial reshuffle which had promoted both conservatives and reformers in roughly equal measure. But Mr Yeltsin said the new cabinet members would strengthen reform, highlighting the contribution of its two leading proponents. Mr Yeltsin described Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the new economics minister, as a 'top-class professional with a market outlook' and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the former privatisation chief who was appointed first deputy prime minister, as a man who would not take a 'single step away from reforms'. But Mr Yeltsin acknowledged the trauma that economic reform was producing in Russia. 'If they say that for an individual moving house is equal to a fire, then for a country reforms are like a typhoon,' he said. Mr Grachev said military funding was running at about half the Rbs37.7bn (Pounds 7.3bn) planned for the full year. He said the cash shortages had resulted in 2,600 young Russian officers leaving the army this year. Russia could attract more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 36bn) of foreign investment in its energy sector if the country's legal and tax regimes were more flexible, US and Russian experts told an industry conference in Moscow this week. Feasibility studies for several giant development projects have already been conducted by foreign companies but many will never be realised unless there is a more predictable and stable investment climate, western executives said.</p>

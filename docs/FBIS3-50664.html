			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luis Ixablanque de Leon] </F>   [Text] Willy Zapata, president of the Bank of Guatemala  (Banguat), has announced that the country finally signed a new  economic stabilization agreement with the IMF.    "Days ago we sent a message to this international  organization in which Guatemala agrees to sign a shadow  agreement [acuerdo sombra] (AS) that will enter into force on 1  January 1994," he pointed out.    Zapata added that we are now only awaiting a faxed reply  from  IMF officials, expected to arrive in the next few days. This is  imminent because it is part of agreements we reached in our most  recent negotiations, he noted.    The official explained that the AS calls on the country to  increase fiscal revenues by two percentage points through 0.5  trimestral increases. "The goal is to increase the current 8  percent tax collection [captacion de impuestos] rate to 10  percent," Zapata said.    The Central Bank president added that the agreement also  calls for an increase in the bank's net internal assets by 490  million quetzals, as established by next year's monetary policy  approved by the proper authorities this month.    "Another commitment by Guatemala is to keep inflation from  going over 8.5 percent and to increase monetary reserves by $40  million in 1994," Zapata pointed out.    IMF staff who visited the country in early November had  initially proposed a monetary reserve increase of $160 million  in 1994.    Complying with this requirement, however, would have  prompted  Banguat to issue more money without backing in order to acquire  the respective foreign currency.    This would make it more difficult to decrease interest rates  for open market operations to neutralize [esterilizar] the  liquidity that is generated. As a result, it would be virtually  impossible to reduce the current rate [tasa activa] of the  financial system, now approximately 32 percent.  <H5>  Signing Opens Doors </H5>   Zapata added that the signing of this agreement makes it  easier for Guatemala to obtain funds from other countries, such  as the Advisory Group [Grupo Consultivo -- GC], which is  comprised of nations from Latin America, Europe, and Asia.    "The World Bank has called a meeting, probably in Paris on 3  March, in which Guatemala must present to the GC its package of  projects for raising funds to implement these measures," he  added.    The World Bank organizes activities like this to help a  country that is initiating an agreement with the IMF, Zapata  pointed out.    The bank president emphasized that "one of the best examples  is El Salvador, which obtained donations [donaciones] totaling  $60 million and a three-year term. We hope to obtain at least a  similar figure, but our success will depend on the number of  projects we present."  <H5>  More Dollars for Guatemala </H5>   He added that the signing of the AS allows the World Bank to  disburse $25 million, which is the second installment of a $120  million loan agreed upon in late 1992.    The first installment ($48 million) was disbursed to  Guatemala in 1992, but the second installment was frozen because  of the country's failure to comply with goals agreed upon with  the IMF, mainly because of the May political crisis.    "Another credit available to Guatemala would be that of the  Inter-American Development Bank for $132 million, and we hope  that the first installment of $60 million will be disbursed in  early 1994," Zapata said.    He added that "the only thing needed to receive this credit  is congressional approval, as this would increase the country's  foreign debt."  <H5>  Certification of Good Conduct </H5>   The AS has the same terms as the Stand by Precaution USS  [preceding four words published in italics and in English]  agreement signed by Guatemala in late 1992. The difference is  that this one included a precautionary [precautorio] loan of  $160 million that the signatory country may use should it face  balance of payment problems.    But Guatemala never used this money. it did fail to meet the  established goals mainly because of the May political crisis.    Finance Minister Richard Aitkenhead and the Bank of  Guatemala  president traveled to IMF headquarters in the second half of  September to start talks that would lead to the signing of a new  agreement with that international organization.    Finally, the country signed an AS -- which does not require  congressional approval because it does not involve loans -- but  according to Zapata there are plans for Guatemala to sign  another standby agreement during the last trimester of 1994.    "That is our goal because a stand by agreement creates more  international trust than an AS. The government program calls  for the administration to work with a standby agreement during  its second year in office," Zapata finally said.</p>

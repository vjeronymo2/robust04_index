			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices up in wake of UN move over Libya OIL PRICES moved up yesterday following news on Tuesday night that the United Nations would impose sanctions on Libya. While this does not include an oil embargo, Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi, was quoted in an Italian magazine yesterday saying he would stop the flow of oil to any country that participated in sanctions. Libya supplies about 1m barrels of oil a day to the west with the bulk delivered to European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. But analysts remain sceptical that Libya would cut off oil deliveries since they provide one of the country's few sources of hard currency revenue. The price for North Sea Brent crude oil for May delivery rose 30 cents yesterday to Dollars 18.35 a barrel after moving up 15 cents late on Tuesday. The price had remained stuck at the Dollars 17.90 level during the previous two weeks as output cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries managed to arrest the decline in price but were not enough to push the market higher. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith Barney's energy desk in London, said the market had been nervous for some time and the Libyan news was enough to give prices a bit of a boost. Last week traders were anxious over talks between Iraq and the UN about a deal to sell some Iraqi oil which they feared would depress prices. But the discussions broke up over the weekend with no conclusion. Opec yesterday vigorously attacked proposals by western countries for a new carbon tax, charging that oil is already over-taxed and additional increases will slow development of the organisation's member states, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. At an an oil price seminar here, an Opec representative warned that a carbon tax could reduce demand for Opec oil by 27 per cent by the year 2010. He referred to the European Commission's carbon tax proposal which would rise from Dollars 1 a barrel in 1993 to a peak of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil equivalent by the year 2000. 'It is indeed ironic that developing countries, which have contributed minimally to the problem of the environment, should have to bear the burden of a fresh tax on their main export commodity,' the representative said.</p>

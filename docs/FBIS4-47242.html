			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AZERTADZH correspondent's report: "Curbing Inflation Is the </F> Main Goal"]    [Text] Baku, 17 June--The increase in the minimum wage and  the price of bread and energy specified by the edict of the  president of Azerbaijan on measures pertaining to the social  protection of the populace and the financial stabilization of  the economy will not signify a sharp spurt in inflation and a  decline in the living standard. This was stated at a news  conference held yesterday by Vakhid Akhundov, state counselor of  the republic for economic policy.    V. Akhundov termed the present increase in the price of  bread  and energy extremely necessary. According to him, this will make  it possible not only to reduce their intensive exportation from  the republic--that had been stimulated by the unjustifiably low  prices of these products--but also to evoke a more solicitous  attitude toward them. In addition, the increase in the price of  bread will make it possible to reduce government subsidies by  almost one-third and also to eliminate the strain that has  occurred recently in the provision of the society with bread  products. The increase in the cost of oil, on the other hand, on  which the oil workers have long been insisting, will permit a  recovery of the financial state of the oil-producing sector,  which is the basis of the economy of the whole country and the  main source of its currency receipts.    As the state counselor announced, the funds derived from the  price increase will be spent on sums of compensation for the  needy strata of the populace, which are already being paid.    Answering journalists' questions, he observed that the  measures specified by the presidential edict pertaining,  specifically, to a tightening in the republic of credit policy  would make it possible to avoid another spurt in inflation,  which usually accompanies a price hike. The current turmoil  here, expressed in the uncontrolled issue of credit unsupported  by real monetary resources, had become a factor of the growth of  inflation, a deterioration in the financial state of the  country, and a steep decline in the living standard of society.  As V. Akhundov reported, as of the present time the republic's  banks have issued 20-30 million manat over and above available  resources. The cancellation of interbranch turnover (MFO) and  the introduction of a system of correspondent accounts  signifying control of credit resources on the part of the  National Bank will make it possible to eliminate this negative  phenomenon. According to the state counselor, this was the main  condition set for Azerbaijan by the IMF, the World Bank, and  other international financial organizations.    The recuperation of finances will be aided also by a  tightening of control of the repayment of loans, an end to the  funding of facilities of incomplete construction, except for  those nearing completion, and the sale of some of these  facilities to private investors. As V. Akhundov maintained, the  precise fulfillment of these and other measures specified by the  edict will have made it possible by the end of the year to have  considerably reduced inflation, whose level currently  constitutes 30 percent a month.</p>

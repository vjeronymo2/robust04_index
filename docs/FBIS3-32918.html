			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 14 Feb (DPA) -- Costa Rican President  Rafael Angel Calderon said today that his government is still  standing firmly behind Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus' candidacy  for the OAS secretary generalship.    He concurrently warned that Washington may eventually exert  pressure on the small countries that support Costa Rica's top  diplomat. "My government will not withdraw or change Niehaus'  candidacy under any circumstance," added Calderon, recalling  that he had rejected a request from Mexico that he seek the  position.    Calderon said he has not received any information to the  effect that the United States, which supports Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria, is exerting pressure on small countries  to force them to withdraw their support for Niehaus, a  52-year-old expert in international relations. "If pressure was  exerted we would denounce it and all the countries on the  continent would regret it," Calderon said.    The president made these remarks in response to questions  concerning reports of an alleged weakening of Niehaus' candidacy  in light of the emergence of Gaviria, whose nomination is not  official as yet. Meanwhile, Fernando Naranjo, a ranking  spokesman for the social democratic National Liberation Party  (PLN), who has been mentioned as the next foreign minister,  spoke today in favor of Niehaus' nomination.    Local newspapers have suggested over the past few days that  support for the Costa Rican foreign minister is deteriorating.  Within the framework of these rumors, several names were  mentioned, including that of Oscar Arias, a former president and  Nobel Peace Prize winner; Sonia Picado, a judge at the  Inter-American Human Rights Court; Gonzalo Facio, the Costa  Rican ambassador to Washington; and former Foreign Minister  Rodrigo Madrigal as possible alternatives for Costa Rica in the  event of Niehaus' withdrawal.    Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres said shortly  before the 6 February elections that his government would  support the current foreign minister.    Meanwhile, President Calderon announced that Niehaus today  initiated a tour of Caribbean nations to confirm the support  offered to him by 13 nations in that region. The foreign  minister claims to have 23 votes, five more than are needed to  win the position in the first round, which is scheduled for 27  March. Niehaus asserts that he is the leader of a Central  American candidacy and believes that it would only be fair for  this area to have an OAS secretary general because thus far all  of the secretaries have been from large South American  countries. The principle of rotation must be observed, he  recently asserted during an interview granted to DPA.</p>

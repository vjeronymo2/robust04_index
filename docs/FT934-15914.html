			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Forestry loses its charms after twelve month rally - The reappraisal Look back a year and few sectors of European industry can have performed as well as Nordic forestry. Look back over the last few weeks, when shares in most of the region's pulp and paper groups have been drifting, and the picture is rather different. The sharp rise is explained by two factors: Swedish and Finnish forestry groups, because they are such big exporters, were major beneficiaries of the effective devaluation of their currencies last autumn. There was also a strong feeling that the pulp and paper market, which had been ravaged by severe overcapacity and world recession, would finally show a decisive turn for the better this year. Disappointment has set in because, for all the Nordic forest industry's new found competitiveness, it has become clear that the hoped-for market upturn has not materialised. Pulp prices have drifted downwards since May, and now languish at just under Dollars 400 a tonne, while the only paper grade to show any sign of price recovery is newsprint. Even so, by midweek the Finnish forest index was up 93.9 per cent over the last twelve months and 65.2 per cent this year. Sweden's forestry sector was up 86.1 per cent on a 12-month view, but just 13.9 per cent in 1993, a considerable underperformance on the overall market this year. Norske Skog, Norway's biggest pulp and paper group, had seen its share price more than double over the last year. The reason Finnish forestry groups have generally performed better than their Swedish counterparts is that they have more domestically-based production, a higher proportion of exports, and a greater emphasis on value-added products. The Finnish group, Metsa-Serla, which has proved to be the region's star forestry performer with a tripling of its B shares over the last year, is a case in point: it has very little production outside Finland, and has concentrated on more stable market sectors such as tissues and corrugated board. Currency devaluations are not the only reason for the Nordic forestry sector revival. Extensive rationalisation, lower wood prices and falling interest rates have also helped the industry weather the market downturn. The region's groups should be able to return to profit in 1993. Sweden's Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, managed a SKr30m pre-tax profit for the first half, but it had to rely on financial operations to offset a sharp fall in operating income. MoDo of Sweden and the Finnish group, Kymmene, look unlikely to return to the black, however, and their shares have performed less well than those of their counterparts. MoDo, which has forecast a second half loss on top of its first half SKr353m deficit, has been hit by the performance of operations in France, a hard currency country. Kymmene is Europe's leading producer of fine paper, where prices are particularly depressed, and around half of its paper production is based abroad, mainly in hard currency countries. Few commentators are expecting market conditions to improve decisively in the next few months. The earliest a stronger pulp price is anticipated is the second quarter of next year, when inventory levels should be lower. The new competitiveness of the Nordic producers is, nevertheless, allowing them to boost capacity utilisation, and lower interest rates are helping to reduce their debt burdens. Mr Denis Christie, paper and packaging analyst at James Capel in London, expects the sector's share price weakness to persist over the next three to six months, with disappointing statements about the market outlook accompanying forthcoming results. However, he is much more positive on a nine to 12 month view, because of the impact which declining interest rates should have on demand in the all-important European market.</p>

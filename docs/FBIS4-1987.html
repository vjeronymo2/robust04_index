			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 4 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian  Province, which has taken the lead in the development of a land  use right market in China, is now taking measures to standardize  land price control.    The first plot of state-owned land was leased out in the  province in 1988.    By the end of last year, the province had leased out 454  plots -- 635 hectares -- in cities and towns, and had received  5.4 billion yuan from the leases.    In small towns and market places in the province, about 60  hectares of land were also leased, raising 200 million yuan.    In addition, Fujian has approved opening up 101 square  kilometers with total investment 2.65 billion U.S. dollars.    For the development, the province set land price standards  for leasing land in cities and towns.    Some 53 counties and cities in the province have by now set  up land price appraisal committees.    The province also set up 13 land price appraisal centers and  two specialized land asset markets.    The Fuzhou specialized land asset market has completed  appraisal of 60 specific land prices; the funds reached 1.3  billion yuan.    Ye Wenjian, director of Fujian Provincial Land  Administration, said that Fujian will perfect the system for  setting standards for land prices and enhance supervision and  control of land prices.    He said that the provincial government will also formulate  regulations to supervise and manage land-price agencies so as to  promote normal exchanges in the land market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad (PAKISTAN PRESS AGENCY) -- Sindh Chief  Minister Syed Abdullah Shah has said that cases filed against  Altaf Hussain, leader of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM], or  any of its members will not be withdrawn, and the country's  politics will be rid of criminal elements. He said that India,  with the help of its agents, is creating an atmosphere of fear  and terror through the shooting incidents in Karachi and  Hyderabad when Pakistan is engaged in drawing the whole world's  attention to the Kashmir issue. However, I would like to make  it clear that the Pakistan People's Party government under the  leadership of Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto is committed to  eliminating all types of terrorism. The chief minister said  this while addressing the people on the situation in Karachi on  television on the evening of 3 May. He said that 22 people,  including a woman and a child, have been killed so far in the  disturbances during the last four days. More than one and a  half dozen policemen and more than 150 innocent citizens have  also been injured and 70 vehicles have been burned.    The chief minister said that all this is being done with the  intention to cripple Pakistan's industry by making it  economically and industrially weak and to weaken Pakistan's  stand on Kashmir. India is carrying out daily propaganda over  Zee TV that human rights are beng violated in Sindh. MQM leader  Altaf Hussain has also joined this propaganda. Leading a lavish  life in London, he made statements saying that his eyes are  shedding tears of blood over the recent incidents in Karachi.  The chief minister said that this is a conspiracy not to divide  Sindh but Pakistan. He said that cases against Altaf Hussain  were filed by his own allies, meaning, the previous government,  and the operation in Sindh was also launched during the same  period, which brought relief and peace to the people of Karachi.  However, conspiracies were hatched to attack the Army men.    The chief minister said that these persons are harming their  own people. We had offered them the opportunity to join the  government in the interest of the province and the country.  Responsible persons in the MQM leadership who want to join us  in the development of Karachi are being held hostage by  terrorist elements in the leadership. I am obliged to  financially assist the families whose members have been killed  by the terrorists. Owners whose buses and vehicles were burned  or properties destroyed or damaged should submit their claims.  They will be compensated. I call upon the people not to allow  the society being held hostage in the hands of criminal  elements. In the conclusion, the chief minister said that he  shares the grief of those who lost relatives in the incidents  and added that in no case, the criminals will be condoned.</p>

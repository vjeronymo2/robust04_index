			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Farmers query EU 'mad cow' decision Tenant farmers and land-owners are seeking urgent clarification of new European rules on British beef exports, fearing they may affect far more herds than intended and damage the market for land. The restrictions, imposed by European agriculture ministers last month to counter bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad cow disease', say beef carcasses may be exported only if they come from farms free of the disease for six years. Mr Marshall Taylor, chairman of the Tenant Farmers' Association, said that because they applied to holdings rather than herds, the rules were likely to hit more than the 52 per cent of dairy herds that had suffered from BSE. He accused the government of returning from Brussels with 'a major banana skin'. The Ministry of Agriculture said last night that it accepted that there were anomalies in the rules. 'We intend to seek changes in the wording to take account of the effect on the sale or hire of land,' it said. The restriction on farms rather than herds revives the question of whether the disease can be transmitted to one animal from another, or from a substance left on land used by diseased cattle. BSE is thought to have been caused by infected animal protein in cattle feed. The use of such protein was banned in 1988 and the incidence of the disease is declining. But the European Commission's scientific veterinary committee, which drew up the restrictions, refused to rule out other possible causes. It said the question of transmission from cow to calf or one animal to another was 'not settled'. Mr Taylor, a tenant farmer who has had about 15 BSE cases in his 150-strong Somerset dairy herd, said the rules suggested a BSE-free herd could be blighted by grazing on land shared with a contaminated herd, or grazed by such a herd in the past. Undiseased herds grazing on common land could be affected by the rules if a BSE-affected herd also uses the land. Landlords might let only to tenants with a BSE-free herd, or demand compensation from departing tenants for blighting farms with an affected herd. 'It may become quite an issue for landlords and affect the rental value of the property.' The Country Landowners' Association also said it was concerned by the rules. British Airways is to stop carrying live animals for slaughter after protests from customers concerned about the livestock, the airline announced yesterday. The ban is to start immediately. BA said it would continue to carry pets and animals being moved for purposes other than slaughter.</p>

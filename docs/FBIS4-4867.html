			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesia's foreign debt -- which has already  reached $90 billion, or about 180 trillion rupiah -- should be  given serious attention because it is nearing $100 billion.  Speaking at a seminar on the national economic situation in  Jakarta, Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister for economy,  finance, and development supervision, warned that when the  foreign debt exceeds this level, it will have a psychological  impact in the form of decreasing confidence by donor nations in  giving additional loans to Indonesia.    According to the minister, the government has set a ceiling  for commercial loans. The private sector is expected to manage  their loans in accordance with the government ceiling, set in  1991. The ceiling is about 10 trillion rupiah for five years.  Because the level of soft loans and export credits is still  within normal limits, the government is optimistic that it can  continue to meet its debt servicing obligations on time.</p>

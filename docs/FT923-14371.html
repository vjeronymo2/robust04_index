			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: JAL considers cutting routes JAPAN Airlines (JAL) is studying the possibility of eliminating some of its less-profitable international routes, a company spokesman said yesterday, AP-DJ reports. The spokesman said two weekly flights between Tokyo and Copenhagen and one weekly flight between Tokyo and New Delhi may be cut. Sluggish economic growth and heavy investment badly hit the airline, the country's largest. The pre-tax loss was Y6.04bn (Dollars 48.5m)for the fiscal year ending on March 31 - the first loss since the former national flag carrier went private in 1987. Last month, the company said it was reviewing its routes, investment and personnel to counter a sharp drop in its ability to compete. Some 400 jobs will be eliminated and the management team will be restructured in an effort to return to profitability.</p>

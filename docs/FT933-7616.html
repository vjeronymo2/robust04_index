			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television Between 7.00 and 8.10 BBC1 will be screening more live coverage of the World Athletics Championships in Stuttgart. If Britain has any success it is likely to be achieved disproportionately by black athletes because Britain's team contains far more than the five per cent that black people represent in the general population. So should the government seek out the reasons why, on the assumption that white people are being disproportionately unsuccessful? Surely not. The billing for All Black tells us 'Worried by the disproportionate numbers of African-Caribbeans diagnosed as schizophrenic, the government has announced a programme to seek out the reasons and root out any racism'. Are we seriously supposed to believe that there is some form of racist diagnosis going on which disproportionately attributes schizophrenia to West Indians but not to Indians? Surely not (8.00 BBC2). In the BBC Proms (7.30 Radio 3) the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra plays Mendelssohn's overture Ruy Blas, Sibelius' 6th symphony, and Rachmaninov's first piano concerto.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SANTA BARBARA,' TWO LATINO STARS TOP DAYTIME EMMY LIST;  </P> <P> AWARDS: JOAN RIVERS REBOUNDS FROM FOX DEBACLE TO TAKE BEST TALK SHOW HOST  HONORS. SUSAN LUCCI OF 'ALL MY CHILDREN' WAS A LOSER FOR THE 11TH YEAR IN A  ROW.  </P> <P> NBC's "Santa Barbara" was named best drama series for the third year in a row  and two of its Latino stars also walked off with awards Thursday at the 17th  annual Daytime Emmy Awards.  </P> <P> "Sally Jessy Raphael" won the Emmy as best talk show and PBS' "Reading Rainbow"  was honored as best children's series in ceremonies held at the Marriott  Marquis Hotel in New York City and broadcast nationally on ABC.  </P> <P> Joan Rivers, whose late-night talk show flopped on Fox Broadcasting three years  ago, was chosen daytime's best talk show host, even though her syndicated  series, "The Joan Rivers Show," was not nominated.  </P> <P> "I always had a fantasy about winning one of these," Rivers said in her  acceptance speech.  </P> <P> While handing out thank yous to her staff, she began to cry. "Two years ago, I  couldn't get a job and my income dropped," she said. Then, alluding to her late  husband, Edgar Rosenberg, who committed suicide in August, 1987, she said,  "This is really for him. He was with me at the beginning."  </P> <P> "Jeopardy!" was named best game show, and its host, Alex Trebek, shared the  Emmy for best host with Bob Barker of "The Price Is Right." Trebek had won last  year; Barker won in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> A tie also was voted in the category of best animated program. ABC's "The New  Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," which won last year, shared this year's award  with another Saturday morning series on ABC, "Beetlejuice."  </P> <P> Besides the Emmy for best daytime soap opera, "Santa Barbara" also picked up  awards for A Martinez as best actor, Henry Darrow as best supporting actor,  directing and lighting direction. The NBC serial had won six Emmys last year.  </P> <P> Kim Zimmer, who plays Reva Shayne Lewis on "Guiding Light," was named best  actress in a daytime drama. Among the actresses she beat out was Susan Lucci of  "All My Children," who has now been nominated for 11 consecutive years without  winning. One of Lucci's co-stars, Julia Barr, won as best supporting actress.  </P> <P> Overall, CBS won 12 Daytime Emmys and PBS captured 11 -- seven for "Sesame  Street." Syndicated programs garnered 10, NBC got 9, ABC received 8 and the  Disney Channel got 1.  </P> <P> The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1989 and March 5, 1990,  were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts  &amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts &amp;  Sciences.  </P> <P> Awards for prime-time programming will be presented Sept. 16.  </P> <P> Here is the full list of winners, including those handed out in nontelevised  ceremonies last Saturday.  </P> <P> Drama Series: "Santa Barbara," NBC.  </P> <P> Game/Audience Participation Show: "Jeopardy!," syn.  </P> <P> Children's Series: "Reading Rainbow," PBS.  </P> <P> Children's Special: "CBS Schoolbreak Special: A Matter of Conscience," CBS.  </P> <P> Animated Program: "Beetlejuice," ABC; "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,"  ABC.  </P> <P> Talk/Service Show: "Sally Jessy Raphael," syn.  </P> <P> Actress, Drama Series: Kim Zimmer (Reva Shayne Lewis), "Guiding Light," CBS.  </P> <P> Actor, Drama Series: A Martinez (Cruz Castillo), "Santa Barbara," NBC.  </P> <P> Supporting Actress, Drama Series: Julia Barr (Brooke English), "All My  Children," ABC.  </P> <P> Supporting Actor, Drama Series: Henry Darrow (Rafael Castillo), "Santa  Barbara," NBC.  </P> <P> Juvenile Female, Drama Series: Cady McClain (Dixie Martin), "All My Children,"  ABC.  </P> <P> Juvenile Male, Drama Series: Andrew Kavovit (Paul Stenbeck), "As the World  Turns," CBS.  </P> <P> Game Show Host: Alex Trebek, "Jeopardy!" syn.; Bob Barker, "The Price Is  Right," CBS.  </P> <P> Talk/Service Show Host: Joan Rivers, "The Joan Rivers Show," syn.  </P> <P> Writing, Drama Series: Pamela K.

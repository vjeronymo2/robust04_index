			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (4): Moulding a management culture - The UK's privatisation process puts it at the forefront of changes in the industry: FT writers look at aspects of the new structure IN THE run-up to its privatisation last month, National Power, the largest electricity company in the UK, issued its managers with a little blue book. 'Transforming National Power' was a hymn of praise to change. It was written by a management consultant who had been appointed as the personal adviser on new working practices to Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive. 'Lean', 'flexible', 'open', 'entrepreneurial' and 'commercial' are the buzzwords running through the booklet. 'Committee Rule was the old philosophy,' it enthuses. 'Now the ability to take individual management decisions must become accepted behaviour - in fact, people who respond quickly and effectively without going through the hierarchy will be encouraged.' It would be easy to poke fun at the often over-simplied homilies which make up much of its 65 pages. Yet the message it contains would come as a shock to most managers in many of the state-owned, monopoly-protected utilities which still characterise much of the electricity industry worldwide. Changing the management culture was one of the most important tasks that National Power's top executives set themselves in preparation for privatisation. Mr Baker and his immediate lieutenants have been stung by frequent taunts, not least from the City, that National Power was slower moving and more bureaucratic than PowerGen, its smaller rival. If that were not bad enough, the lessons of previous privatisations, such as those of British Gas and British Telecom, spoke volumes about the difficulties facing utilities in adjusting to the cold wind of the private sector. Each of the company's 35 power stations has been turned into a profit centre, with the station manager held clearly responsible for financial performance. A sharper system of financial reporting links power station and head office. And ramming the message home is a new performance pay scheme which can determine up to 30 per cent of a manager's salary. Such initiatives will inevitably take time to work through. Meanwhile, National Power has articulated a range of other strategies for improving its performance in the private sector. Top of the agenda is cost cutting. National Power has already shed about 1,000 jobs, reducing its workforce to just over 15,000. That leaves its stated target of losing another 4,000 jobs over the next five years, although industry observers will not be surprised if that target is exceeded. Two thirds of the job losses are likely to come from power station closures, with the rest from more efficient working across the company. In the past year, National Power has shut five of its coal-fired stations, contributing just over 1,000MW towards its stated goal of closing 3,000MW of capacity by the middle of the decade - a target which the prospectus warns might be exceeded. Not only does closure help cut costs; it is also central to National Power's fuel strategy. The company wants to reduce its dependence on fuel from British Coal, switching instead to gas, because gas-fired stations using combined cycle technology are quicker to build, cheaper to run and more environmentally friendly. The other plank in National Power's fuel strategy is an increase in coal imports, which are typically cheaper than supplies from British Coal. Overall, Mr Baker plans to cut National Power's fuel bill by about Pounds 250m, or 10 per cent, within about five years. But National Power is bound to remain heavily dependent in the medium term on British Coal, which will supply National Power with about 43.6m tonnes of coal this year. Indeed, National Power's directors were only prepared to commit themselves in the privatisation prospectus to 'a progressive dividend policy' until 1993, the expiry date for the coal contract and the other arrangements nailed in place by the government to give the industry stability in its early years in the private sector. After 1993, the prospectus warned, 'National Power will be operating in a more competitive market, and revenues will be sensitive to the balance between demand and available capacity and to other market conditions.'</p>

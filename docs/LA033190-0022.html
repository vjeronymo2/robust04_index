			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS OVER LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> Soviet tanks and helicopters in Vilnius. KGB troops closing the Lithuanian  border.  </P> <P> Soviets expelling foreign diplomats and reporters. All of this in a country  that the United States has recognized as independent for more than 50 years. So  I ask: What "peace dividend"? What "new" Soviet Union? What "new" world order?  It seems obvious to anyone who will face the facts that the Soviet Union still  only understands force, repression and submission.  </P> <P> NEIL SIEGEL  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POINDEXTER JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATIONS;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: THE JUDGE CAUTIONED THEM NOT TO CONSIDER THE "POLITICAL DISPUTES"  THAT CHARACTERIZED MUCH OF THE SCANDAL.  </P> <P> The jurors who heard the case against John M. Poindexter began deliberations  today after the judge cautioned them not to consider the "political disputes"  that characterized much of the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold Greene gave members of the jury a lengthy  description of the law and their duties, then sent them into the jury room  shortly after noon.  </P> <P> The judge said he would not sequester the panel and ordered deliberations to  continue daily, from 9:45 a.m. to 5 p.m., until a verdict was reached.  </P> <P> "It's not your function," Greene said, to judge the intense "political  disputes" that characterized so many aspects of the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> The judge told jurors not to consider "who was right and who was wrong between  Congress and the White House," whether President Ronald Reagan was correct or  wrong in his staunch support of the rebel Nicaraguan Contras, or whether his  arms deals with Iran constituted "a wise or unwise policy."  </P> <P> "That's not for judges and jurors to decide," Greene said. Those issues are  reserved solely for America's elected representatives, the judge said, and  ultimately the people who elect them.  </P> <P> Greene also told the jury that it is not a proper defense to decide that  Poindexter acted on direct or indirect instructions from Reagan to violate the  law.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Greene said, Reagan denied during videotaped testimony that he  ever authorized any aides to break the law -- and Poindexter also maintained  that he always obeyed the law.  </P> <P> Poindexter did not take the stand to defend himself. The judge cautioned the  jurors that Poindexter exercised his "absolute right" and they could draw no  inference of guilt from the fact.  </P> <P> Poindexter, 53, the last of the original Iran-Contra defendants, is the highest  Reagan Administration official to stand trial in the scandal.  </P> <P> The retired Navy rear admiral is accused of five felonies involving obstruction  of Congress, conspiracy and the destruction of official government documents.  </P> <P> If convicted on all five counts, Poindexter faces up to 25 years in prison and  $1.25 million in fines. But no other Iran-Contra figure who has pleaded guilty  or has been convicted by a jury has been sentenced to a day behind bars.  </P> <P> As the judge gave his instructions to the jury, Poindexter appeared as cool and  calm as he has since jury selection began on March 5.  </P> <P> The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Greene told its members to  select a "foreperson" and to communicate with the court only by notes signed by  the group's leader.  </P></p>

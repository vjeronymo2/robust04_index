			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TV ANCHOR SETS STING FOR COLORFUL PROMOTER IN PORNOGRAPHY TALE  </P> <P> In an industry that uses cardboard scenery and camera angles to turn diminutive  actors into legendary tough guys, Gil Cabot may be the ultimate illusionist.  </P> <P> For two decades, the colorful promoter has used a variety of entertainment  industry gimmicks to snare clients. But police and others say Cabot, once  depicted in a flashy brochure as "Supermanager" in tights and a cape, is really  a sophisticated con man.  </P> <P> "All he has ever done is preyed upon people for his own good," said San  Fernando Superior Court Judge Robert D. Fratianne, who sent Cabot to prison in  1982.  </P> <P> Now, however, the man described in one investigator's report as "an Artful  Dodger" has himself been flimflammed by a 28-year-old newswoman from Moline,  Ill. Jann Carl turned the tables last year when Cabot allegedly offered to  arrange for the destruction of sexually explicit pictures of her for $30,000.  </P> <P> Confident that no pictures existed, the KTLA-TV anchorwoman pretended to be  frightened of exposure in a series of taped telephone conversations with Cabot  that led to his arrest June 20 on charges of attempted extortion and  conspiracy. He is free on bail while awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior  Court.  </P> <P> Carl played her part so well that Cabot's attorney, Rowan K. Klein, said his  client was entrapped by the slender, blonde newswoman. "She sniffed. She cried  on the phone," Klein said.  </P> <P> "Maybe Mr. Cabot underestimated me," Carl said.  </P> <P> "A guy like me can't win," said the 43-year-old, mustachioed promoter. "It's OK  for the FBI to lie and manipulate" by having an agent pose as Carl's fiance  during the alleged extortion drama. "But when I lie and manipulate, it's  wrong."  </P> <P> Despite his anger toward Carl, Cabot said he registered a script last year with  the Writers Guild called "Film at 11," about a distressed anchorwoman named  Fran.  </P> <P> His involvement with Carl is the latest episode in a career that led from the  recording industry in Tampa, Fla., to Sunset Boulevard. There, police said,  Cabot preyed upon celebrities -- he posed as KABC-TV anchorwoman Tawny Little's  husband and used actress Jaclyn Smith's name to obtain appliances and a car.  </P> <P> However, research into his past shows that he is not just a Hollywood predator.  He has worked, with no success, at selling real-life stories to television. And  an actress on a once well-known television situation comedy, who requested  anonymity, said he "did as many good things as bad things" for her.  </P> <P> His downfall, according to some people who knew him over the years, was his  desire to be more than another businessman selling small film projects around  Hollywood. These people say he wanted to be a star himself.  </P> <P> Some of Cabot's former clients say they were lured by glossy promotions, one of  which depicted Cabot as the "Supermanager." Trade publications reported him  winging from coast to coast, signing film deals. Only later, say his critics,  did they come to believe that Cabot was more duper than super.  </P> <P> "We project what we know can be," Cabot said.  </P> <P> True to that code, Cabot's version of his life unfolds like a film script of a  hard-driving, bankable executive with projects swirling on several continents  at once.  </P> <P> He greets a visitor to his Topanga Canyon home dressed in a white robe. He has  thick hair with streaks of gray and seems almost frail, despite his 6-foot  height. His manner is urgent and intense.  </P> <P> He recalls his beginnings at 15 as host of a Tampa television dance show called  "Gil Cabot's Campus Corner." Then, he says, came a career as the producer of  million-selling records. Now the man who billed himself as a "star behind a  star" says he is looking for projects for East German figure skater Katarina  Witt, who he maintains wants to do movies with American muscle men such as  Sylvester Stallone.  </P> <P> But Cabot's claims often collapse when the curtain is pulled back.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Acquainted, Friend Says  </P> <P> Jirina Ribbens, a friend of Witt's in New York, said that when she asked Witt  about Cabot, "she didn't even know who I was talking about."  </P> <P> Telephone inquiries to libraries, newspapers and television stations in Tampa  failed to turn up any evidence of a television dance show featuring Cabot.  </P> <P> Even the successful apparently are not immune to his charms. Anchorwoman Little  said he tried to talk her into letting him represent her. "He's a heck of an  actor," she said.  </P> <P> He was later arrested when he posed as Little's husband to buy $800 worth of  suits at Bullock's, police said. The charge became part of the 1982 grand theft  case against Cabot, police said. He was placed on probation but violated it,  resulting in a two-year prison sentence at the California Correctional  Institution in Tehachapi, police said.  </P> <P> Cabot later used Jaclyn Smith's name without permission to coax appliances out  of Whirlpool Corp. and a car out of Chrysler Corp. for a charity ranch, police  say. The charity is called CHARM. Cabot said his goal is to set up a retreat  for victims of child abuse. So far, however, there is no land for the ranch,  and police say Cabot's mother is driving the Chrysler. Authorities are expected  to launch an investigation of CHARM.  </P> <P> Cabot denies using Smith's name in a promotion.  </P> <P> "He's the best con artist I have ever personally seen at work," said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Phil Rabichow, who prosecuted Cabot in 1982.  </P> <P> Police say his techniques are legendary. A client who pressed for an  explanation of nearly $8,000 in expenditures of his money received a telegram  from a Cabot associate saying that Cabot had been in a plane crash "while  supervising the filming of opening sequences for his new ABC television  series," according to a source close to the investigation of the Carl case.  Cabot was the only survivor and was in the hospital, the telegram said. "I  trust you will continue to exercise patience and understanding," the note  concluded.  </P> <P> Authorities say there is no evidence of such a plane crash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pop Record Produced  </P> <P> But there is substance to some of Cabot's contentions. For instance, he was  involved in the distribution of a pop music record called "Love (Can Make You  Happy)," by a group called Mercy in 1969.  </P> <P> Jack Sigler, the one-time Tampa high school student who wrote the song, said  the record was put out on Cabot's tiny Sundi label but that Cabot did not  produce it, as he claimed. Further, he said, Cabot later formed a band with his  wife and called it Mercy, sparking a 3-year-long lawsuit over rights to the  name.  </P> <P> But what confounds some of his critics is that he has been able to deliver on  other occasions. An author who was trying to market an AIDS book was impressed  with Cabot's ability to place him on a morning talk show in Los Angeles, even  before the book was in stores.  </P> <P> "Gil Cabot has never given me a reason to doubt him," said Jenny Sherman,  Cabot's partner in a company that markets television movies of the week. So  far, none has been produced.  </P> <P> Cabot said he makes ends meet by living off the royalties of his recordings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planned Talk Show  </P> <P> Cabot wanted to use Carl as host for an interview show to be called "Up Close  and Personal," for which he said he had lined up Whirlpool as a sponsor (which  Whirlpool denies). But he said he was shown a videotape that was making the  rounds of bachelor parties in Los Angeles. The star performer appeared to be  Jann Carl, fresh out of a hot tub, cavorting in front of hidden cameras, Cabot  said.  </P> <P> "I saw the jaw and I saw the mole," he recalled. "I hit my machine with my fist  and threw" the videotape.  </P> <P> Cabot was angry, he said, because he knew his project was doomed. Nobody would  want an interviewer who had starred in a stag film, even unknowingly.  </P> <P> He said he discussed with Carl ways to get rid of the tape and of pictures that  were taken from it for publication in a magazine, only as a favor to a  distressed woman.  </P> <P> Carl, however, was not thankful. "This is the first time in my life someone has  committed such a severe wrong against me personally. It's my nature to stand  firm."  </P> <P> The daughter of a farm-equipment executive, Carl decided on journalism as a  career at Moline Senior High School. But when she went for advice to the  University of Missouri, a teacher discouraged her.  </P> <P> "That made me so mad that I knew that was what I wanted to do," she said. "I  was determined at that point."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Iron Will  </P> <P> According to friends, that attitude is typical of a woman who presents a  deceptively innocent face to the world. She excuses herself when she says  "damn," chooses restaurants for their onion rings, and counts as her favorite  actors Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart. Behind all this, these people say,  is an iron will.  </P> <P> At age 23, she became a street reporter for WLS-TV in Chicago, one of the  nation's most competitive news towns. A year later, she was wooed away by  KABC-TV in Los Angeles, where she went to work on "Eye on L.A.," the fast-paced  "infotainment" show that specializes in stories about haunted houses and  bikini-clad bathers.  </P> <P> "We joked that we would eventually do haunted bikinis," Carl said.  </P> <P> She took the anchor chair next to Hal Fishman at KTLA two years later.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, a man calling himself Terry called her news director, Jeff  Wald, about the sexually explicit video. Over the next few weeks, there was a  series of calls that led from Terry to a man identified as Christopher Wright  to Gil Cabot. When tapes of all three were played in court, witnesses said they  sounded alike.  </P> <P> Carl said she never considered quietly paying off, just to ensure her privacy  and safeguard her career from scandal. She never thought about telling the  caller to lay off.  </P> <P> "I knew he would go on to someone else," Carl said. "The next woman may not  have a supportive boss, and she might pay it. It would be my fault."  </P> <P> She decided to feign fear of exposure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Need Your Help'  </P> <P> "I'm frightened," she said in one tape-recorded conversation. "Gil, I really  need your help."  </P> <P> The plot was complex and carefully woven, police said. Cabot's undoing,  according to authorities, was his choice of a victim. He assumed "anyone in the  business would have a Rolodex of partners," said one officer.  </P> <P> But Carl said she was confident that no tapes could exist. She had been  involved in one relationship for the past seven years, to television sales  representative David Sears, whom she recently married.  </P> <P> Cabot and his attorney, Maurice J. Attie, were arrested after a meeting June 10  with Carl and an undercover FBI agent. The payment from Carl was discussed  during that session, according to a tape played at Cabot's preliminary hearing  two weeks ago. Charges against Attie were dismissed after Los Angeles Municipal  Judge Karl W. Jaeger concluded that there was not enough evidence that Attie  knew what was going on.  </P> <P> Rowan K. Klein, Cabot's attorney during the hearing, maintained that Carl  entrapped Cabot. "Supposedly nothing my client said was true," he said. "Yet  Miss Carl took it upon herself to call him and plead to get these pictures  back."  </P> <P> Carl was never in fear, he said. "That's one of the reasons there is no crime  in this case."  </P> <P> Ironically, even his critics praise Cabot as a dynamic man with a pot always  boiling with ideas.  </P> <P> "He was bright and intuitive in ad campaigns," said Dick Hieronymus, a record  producer who worked with Cabot. "Had he stuck to promotion and been honest," he  would have been a success.  </P> <P> "The real problem is he wanted to be a superstar."  </P> <P> OTHER TARGETS  </P> <P> TAWNEY LITTLE: Cabot wanted her to work with him. "He's a heck of an actor,"  she said.  </P> <P> JACLYN SMITH: Used her name without permission to coax companies to donate  appliances and a car to his charity.  </P> <P> KATARINA WITT: Says he represents her in the United States. A friend said she  doesn't know him.  </P></p>

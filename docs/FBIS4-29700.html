			<p>BFN     [Text] The government and the communist-led National  Democratic Front (NDF) have agreed to hold the next round of  peace talks in Europe instead of Vietnam.    "The NDF delegation and the (government) panel agreed to  hold  the next round of talks in the Benelux within the third quarter  of this year," Howard Dee, chief government negotiator, said in  a statement. He did not say where in the three Benelux  territories -- Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg -- the  meeting will take place.    Neither did Dee say why Vietnam was dropped as venue but  said  the panels thanked Hanoi for earlier agreeing to host the talks.    Vietnam had earlier declined a request by the NDF to act as  third-party mediator in the peace talks.    The government and the NDF simultaneously released to media  yesterday the 10 point agreement they signed during the 10 to 14  June meeting in Breukelen, near Amsterdam.    The document showed that while the issues were discussed,  they were not resolved.    The first seven points are NDF's requests and objections  which the rebels said are "goodwill measures" to be voluntarily  undertaken and are not to be taken as preconditions to the talks.    The joint statement signed for government by Dee and for the  NDF by Vice Chair Luis Jalandoni said:    -- The NDF pressed the government to "stop its policy" of  treating and prosecuting political offenders as common  criminals. But the government insisted there are no political  prisoners.    -- The Dee panel will convey to the president the NDF's  request for the immediate release of political prisoners. The  NDF will provide a list but stressed it does not mean they are  members of the movement.    -- The NDF endorsed claims for indemnification of victims  of human rights violations during the Marcos regime for at least  30 percent of the money to be recovered from the Swiss bank  deposits of the late strongman.    -- The NDF warned the government against violating the  joint declaration signed in The Hague during exploratory talks  in September 1992, if it will enter into peace talks with  communist breakaway factions.    The government panel said it is its own prerogative and does  not consider it a violation at all.    -- The NDF vigorously objected to the two amnesty  proclamations of Mr. Ramos, saying it "impinges upon the  organizational integrity" of the NDF. The government said  another amnesty proclamation can be issued after the peace  talks. Proclamations 347 and 348 were for those who have  already surfaced, it said.    -- The NDF also objected to Executive Order 125 as an  imposition on the rebels of the Constitution. The government  refuted this, saying the order merely provides adherence to  constitutional processes.    The only two points of agreement were the holding of the  next  round and the issuance of safety and immunity guarantees for  negotiators, staffers, consultants and security detail during  the talks.    The panels set an eight-point agenda for the next meeting,  including the review of confidence-building measures, the  date-and venue of the formal talks, and sequencing of the formal  agenda to be tackled prior to the talks by reciprocal committees.</p>

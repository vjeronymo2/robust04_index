(2)"]    [Excerpts]  <H5>  Prosecutors Are Estimating State Losses </H5>   Last spring, not only the employees of the State Inspection  Department, but also the police and the Prosecutor's Office  became interested in the Kaunas association "Selma" and its  formerly convicted president Vladas Laurinavicius. The latter  took care not only of the arming of Lithuanian soldiers but also  of the welfare of Russian servicemen in Kaliningrad Oblast  [reference to the construction of military housing]. [passage  omitted]    Having received 615.77 million rubles [R] in cash from the  National Defense Ministry, the "Selma" association deposited  only R41.054 million into its current bank account. The  remaining cash, as the inspectors from the State Inspection  Department have established, were used for other purposes.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Minister Will Not Tolerate Illegal Actions </H5>   Current Lithuanian Defense Minister L. Linkevicius maintains  that he has known "Selma" president V. Laurinavicius since the  time he belonged to the Seimas [parliament] Foreign Affairs  Committee. The active and business-like person from Kaunas made  a good impression not only on L. Linkevicius. It was clear from  conversations with V. Laurinavicius that he had good contacts  not only with Kaliningrad, but also with Russia's ruling  circles. Minister L. Linkevicius cannot account for the  activities of the former Defense Ministry leadership, its  decisions, and the mysterious links with the criminal world.  The minister did not know, however, that V. Laurinavicius had  been convicted. "We must make clear today which actions were  legal and which were illegal. However, we must assess this from  the viewpoint of benefit to the state. No illegal actions will  be tolerated in the future," promised Minister L. Linkevicius.</p>

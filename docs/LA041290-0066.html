			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> No Art Conference in Cincinnati: Reacting to a controversy in Cincinnati over  an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, the College Art Assn. has  discontinued discussions regarding the possibility of holding the CAA annual  conference there in 1995. A letter to city leaders from CAA President Ruth  Weisberg said that the "apparently officially sanctioned censorship" of the  show and the indictment of Dennis Barrie, director of Cincinnati's Contemporary  Art Museum, makes the city "an inappropriate milieu" because these actions are  incompatible with the organization's advocacy of freedom of expression.

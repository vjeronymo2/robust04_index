			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: The Young Lady says 'Yes]' - The 'most exhilarating thing to happen to Irish theatre in recent years' WHEN DENIS Johnston's first play was turned down by the Abbey in the 1920's, he did some rewriting and changed the title to The Old Lady Says 'No]'. The joke was not lost on Dubliners. Lady Gregory, the old lady in question, was the Abbey. And to her mind an expressionist play like Johnston's was simply not Irish: it didn't have what she called 'PQ' - namely peasant quality. There is a recognisable truth behind this. In a sense even O'Casey is PQ transferred to the slums of Dublin. The formula produced masterpieces, like The Playboy and O' Casey's own early works. It also provided Ireland with a truly national theatre 60 years before Britain had one. But that does not alter the fact that it was a formula; and formulas may be creative initially but in the long term they stifle creativity. At the beginning of this year the Old Lady's place was taken by a Young Lady who is not likely to let herself be stifled. Garry Hynes is at 38 the most exhilarating thing to happen to the Irish theatre in recent years. A tiny woman with a will of iron, she is capable of dragging the Abbey into the 1990s, if anyone is. Her road to success was an unlikely one. Together with some contemporaries from University College, Galway, she founded the Druid Theatre in that city in 1975. They started in a school hall and then moved into a room behind a hotel. And it worked. 'My whole life in the theatre has been defined by a sense of place,' she has said 'and I cannot separate the act of theatre from the community in which it is performed.' The Druid developed a personal style of production, combining freshness and an agreeable roughness. Its greatest triumph was The Playboy, but it has also championed writers like Tom Murphy and Eugene McCabe. Garry Hynes then demonstrated that the Druid style could succeed outside her home city. Since 1986 she has been doing one production a year at the Abbey  -its current hit, The Shaughraun, is her work. She has also directed The Man Of Mode and The Look Of The Nightingale for the RSC, and her Royal Court production of Murphy's A Whistle In The Dark won the Time Out London Award for Direction in 1988. To discover the magnitude of the task facing her I spoke to Eintan O'Toole, critic of the Irish Times, whom Ms Hynes has brought in as Literary Advisor. He told me that the theatre had gone through a period of crisis since March 1985, when Joe Dowling resigned as Artistic Director. Some productions from the Dowling era were artistic and commercial failures, and the board of directors decided to play a more active role in day-to-day management. As a result, no Artistic Director was prepared to stay; there were five in a period of five years. The last, Noel Pearson, did much to get the theatre on its feet again, but his film work (he produced My Left Foot and The Field) took up an increasing proportion of his time. One result of the uncertainty was that the Abbey lost any sense of its role as an Irish National Theatre. 'The Abbey has tended to function on an Irish idea of genius,' O'Toole told me. 'There are geniuses out there who produce extraordinary work. This arrives on your desk and everybody says: Great, let's do it.' Astonishingly, this passive policy has to an extent worked; the geniuses have turned up. But, in the absence of a logical commissioning policy, many areas of Irish life remained uncovered. Garry Hynes, speaking of the community the Abbey should be addressing, defined it as 'a set of concentric circles moving out to the immediate context of Dublin itself, to the island as a whole - and in that I include the North - to the scattered Irish communities of Britain, the US and indeed the European Community.' This is a highly ambitious programme, probably realisable only in an ideal world. The initial list of productions is not wholly convincing: The Plough and The Stars, opening in the main theatre on May 7, is probably unavoidable with 1991 being the 75th anniversary of the Easter Rising: there is also a production in the smaller hall, the Peacock, of Tom Murphy's Rising play The Patriot Game, originally commissioned for BBC television but not produced. It opens on May 14. Dermot Bolder's The Lament For Arthur C1eary, already seen in the Peacock, is a first grappling with the themes of the new urban Ireland and the emigrant; but it is hard to see Hedda Gabler (June 25) as anything but a vehicle for Fiona Shaw. But it would be churlish to criticise Ms Hynes on such small evidence: we'll have a better idea of her stewardship this time next year. In the area of production, however, we shall soon be able to assess her impact. She is directing The Plough And The Stars, and everyone is looking for the qualities she has shown in the past: freshness of vision and the ability to create powerful theatrical images. Her work is marked by a sense of starting from scratch. Everything she does is a new beginning. And when you stand in the Abbey foyer, in the somewhat forbidding shadow of the portraits of the great figures from the past, you realise how important a new beginning is. Actors have to be persuaded to clear their minds of what FJ McCormick or Barry Fitzgerald or Cyril Cusack did and read the classical texts as though they had been written yesterday. The great bureaucratic establishment of the Abbey has to shake off its inertia. Garry Hynes, new Artistic Director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / GRE issues writ against Coopers &amp; Lybrand GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the composite insurance company, is suing Coopers &amp; Lybrand, its former auditors. Mr James Morley, finance director of GRE, said yesterday that the company had issued a writ last week against Coopers &amp; Lybrand in relation to their audit and other services in 1986, 1987 and 1988. The writ does not make clear the specific charge against Coopers &amp; Lybrand but Mr Morley said the move related to the commercial mortgage lending operations of Guardian Assurance, its wholly-owned subsidiary. In its last financial statement for the six months to June 30 1992, GRE reported that investment income fell from Pounds 142m to Pounds 133m because of property write-downs. In 1991 GRE dropped Coopers &amp; Lybrand in favour of Price Waterhouse as its accountants, citing the need for a single auditor for its worldwide operations. Mr Morley said that at the time it had considered a number of auditors for the job, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A spokesman for Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that the company had received a draft writ. He expressed surprise at the move, given that in its 1990 Report and Accounts, GRE said: 'The Board is greatly appreciative of the services the Company has received from Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte over many years.' The spokesman said on the basis of the draft writ, Coopers would vigorously contest any claim.</p>

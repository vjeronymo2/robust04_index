			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong first half at Banco Santander Banco Santander, the Spanish banking group which last April paid just over Dollars 2bn to acquire Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), posted strong first-half results yesterday to secure it as Spain's leading bank. Santander raised its consolidated net profits by 8.2 per cent to Pta51bn (Dollars 389m) in spite of what Mr Emilio Botn, the chairman, termed 'a difficult economic environment characterised by limited credit demand, a high level of competition and the negative impact of the sharp drop in the stock and bond markets'. The first-half results, which are likely to form the highwater mark for the Spanish banks at the half-year stage, compared with a 14 per cent consolidated net profit fall by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, which rivals Santander in size, and a net income increase of just 1.2 per cent by the smaller Banco Popular group which has the reputation of being the most profitable domestic banking group. In common with the rest of the banking sector, Santander was hit by decreased revenue from Treasury and capital markets activities where profits fell 80.2 per cent to Pta7.2bn. This was offset by a 74.7 per cent reduction in net provisions to Pta9.5bn. Santander took the lower provisioning in its stride because it believes the growth of its non-performing loans has been curbed and its coverage of doubtful and bad debts, thanks to the traditional conservatism of its loan policy, remains at a high 100.5 per cent and at 137 per cent if real estate collaterals held against certain loans are taken in to account. The group showed the strength of its core banking business with an 8 per cent rise to Pta125.5bn in net interest income and a 31 per cent increase in income from fees and commission that raised the operating margin by 13 per cent to Pta176bn. The group's operating profit (the operating margin less processing costs) grew 13.4 per cent to Pta81.6bn. Mr Botn said a one-for-three Pta89bn rights issue to help finance the Banesto acquisition had been successfully concluded. He forecast an improvement in the domestic business environment that would further strengthen Santander's balance sheet.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop report sparks fall in US grain futures A US Department of Agriculture crop report sent soyabean and wheat prices plunging yesterday morning at the Chicago Board of Trade. The report, released after the close of trading on Tuesday, said that farmers had planted far more soyabeans than the market expected and that wheat stocks were considerably higher than the industry had estimated. CBoT soyabean traders rushed to knock more than 10 cents a bushel off the July and August futures contracts. The July contract, the spot month, which closed on Tuesday at Dollars 6.00 3/4 a bushel, opened in the range of Dollars 5.87 to Dollars 5.88 a bushel. But the contract, like others in the more distant months, regained a few cents during morning trading. The USDA had reported that farmers planted 59m acres of soyabeans, about 1.2m acres more than the average industry estimate. Some of the extra acreage came from 'double cropping', as farmers replanted winter wheat fields with a summer crop of soyabeans. This followed a poor winter wheat crop in many parts of the midwest. Wheat traders also nipped 5 cents off prices at the opening of trading. The Tuesday close had been Dollars 3.49 1/2 a bushel and the opening range was Dollars 3.45 to Dollars 3.455. But, as in the case of soyabeans, prices rebounded a bit by mid-morning to level the price loss to about 3.25 cents for the July contract, which hovered at Dollars 3.46 a bushel. In contrast, maize futures gained a few cents on the USDA report, which said that maize planting and stocks were below analysts' estimates. Although some had thought maize might follow other grains lower, the July spot month rose 3 cents by mid-morning to Dollars 2.51 1/4 a bushel. There was some speculation that soyabean and wheat prices could reverse direction if the USDA announced significant export credit sales to the former Soviet republics yesterday. But no news emerged by mid-day from Washington and industry analysts said the credit announcements could be delayed by as much as several days. An allocation of Dollars 300m in credits is waiting to be used by the Russians and Ukrainians. However, Mr Daniel Basse, research director of AgResource in Chicago, said: 'The markets could not care less about the purchases by the former Soviet republics. It's totally a weather market'.</p>

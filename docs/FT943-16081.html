			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Observer: Sleep-walker The sight of a flak-jacketed Sir Patrick Mayhew, secretary of state for the province, roaming the Republican streets of west Belfast late on Monday night caused a bit of a stir among Ulster Unionists. The Northern Ireland Office described it as a routine patrol by its minister, who likes keeping 'in touch with the security forces'. But such is the suspicion of anything Sir Patrick says or does these days that some of the more paranoid unionists were speculating that he may have been en route to a clandestine midnight chat with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, in a bid to hurry along the peace process. Then again, he might have been having one last look at one of the tougher bits of his fiefdom - before being replaced in John Major's forthcoming reshuffle.</p>

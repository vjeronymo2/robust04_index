Public television Monday evening [28 February] announced  that  Alfieri, who is believed to hold the key to the hidden  connections between organized crime and politicians, had begun  to provide information to investigators three weeks ago.  Judicial sources at the Naples court later confirmed the report.    Alfieri, reputedly the richest of Camorra bosses, was  arrested in September 1992 following accusations made by another  boss turned informer, Pasquale Galasso, who accused Alfieri of  involvement in several gang murders.    Perhaps most importantly, investigators hope Alfieri may  shed  light on collusions between his own clan and prominent political  figures, public administrators and magistrates, connections  alleged by Galasso in previous testimony.    Alfieri is reportedly being questioned at an undisclosed  location. He is also suspected of involvement in money  laundering and extortion.    The sources stressed that there was no link between  Alfieri's  decision to talk and the announcement made last month by the  Bishop of Acerra, Antonio Riboldi, that hundreds of the clan's  members were ready to turn themselves in.    He was arrested by police in September 1992 after 10 years  in  hiding. He was found guilty but then acquitted by an appeals  court for the murder of eight people at Torre Annunziata, near  Naples, in 1984.</p>

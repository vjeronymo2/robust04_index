			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Wicks told NRC investigators that he had never provided an exposure estimate to the rediographer's assistant because he had none to give her, i.e., he did not have a report from Landuer. However, this is inconsistent with statements by: (1) The radiographer's assistant_that she persisted in trying to obtain from Mr. Wicks the exposure for the month of July and that Mr. Wicks eventually_about three weeks after the incident_told her she had received 350 millirem, (2) the radiographer involved in the incident that Mr. Wicks had informed him that ``everything was OK'' and that the radiographer's assistant had received 600 millirem for the quarter, and (3) the assistant's husband, also a WIX employee, that Mr. Wicks had called his wife two to three weeks after the incident and had given her a number ``which was lower and we were happy.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Wicks contended during the enforcement conference that he had been misled by the employees involved in the incident into believing that the incident was not serious. While both employees admit to providing Mr. Wicks false accounts of the incident in an attempt to cover up their own mistakes, the radiographer's assistant and her husband both told NRC investigators that Mr. Wicks was informed when the reports were turned in on July 31, 1993, that the reports were false and that Mr. Wicks was told that the radiographer involved in the incident had been asleep in the truck instead of supervising the radiographers assistant (as required by NRC regulations). Mr. Wicks denied having been told that the reports were false.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Wicks also told NRC personnel during the enforcement conference that he did not realize that Landauer had not provided him a July 1993 exposure record for the radiographer's assistant and had not called Landauer until the NRC began its investigation in January 1994. The only explanation Mr. Wicks has offered for not pursuing the question of the radiographer's assistant's July 1993 exposure is that he was very busy. However, the following events raise significant questions about Mr. Wicks' credibility:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In August 1993, Mr. Wicks received Landauer's report for the month of July 1993 which, as indicated earlier, contained no monthly exposure record for the radiographer's assistant. Despite, according to Mr. Wicks, having requested immediate processing of the assistant's badge from Landauer, Mr. Wicks told the NRC investigator that he didn't read the monthly report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Mr. Wicks stated at the enforcement conference that he placed the assistant on limited duty as soon as he was informed of the incident pending the receipt of a report from Landauer and that she was limited to working in the darkroom and ``completely away from any shooting area'' from July 31, 1993, until she left WIX toward the end of September 1993. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Mr. Wicks stated that having an employee in a restricted status for nearly two months did not remind him of the fact that he had never received a response to his request for immediate processing of her July 1993 TLD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC notes that the radiographer's assistant disputes Mr. Wicks' account, stating that she was permitted to resume work involving exposure to radiation about three weeks after the incident when Mr. Wicks called her and told her that her exposure was 350 millirems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. On October 1, 1993, Mr. Wicks provided a summary of the radiographer's assistant's radiation exposure history, including the period in question (July 1993), to her new employer, and NRC licensee. In doing so, Mr. Wicks relied not on Landauer records, even though records were available for all months but July and September 1993, but by adding up daily dosimeter records, which were blank for July 31, 1993. Despite making these calculations for the radiographer's assistant, Mr. Wicks stated at the enforcement conference that he was not reminded of the fact that he had never received a response to his request for immediate processing of her July 1993 TLD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Later in October 1993, Mr. Wicks responded to a request from the NRC for the radiation exposure reports of terminated employees, as required by 10 CFR 20.408(b) In responding to this request, Mr. Wicks did not provide a report for the radiographer's assistant despite having provided one for her husband, whose termination date occurred five days after hers. Mr. Wicks had not provided the NRC a termination report for the radiographer's assistant when the NRC began its investigation in January 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Mr. Wicks is an experienced radiographer and has been trained on the significance of overexposures. Considering that this appears to be the first time that his firm had the potential for an overexposure warranting immediate processing of the assistant's badge and assuming that the badge was sent as he states, them it is not credible that he would not have followed up on it. The NRC also does not consider credible Mr. Wicks' statement that he sent the TLD in for processing. According to Landauer, the incidence of TLDs being lost in delivery is very small. In this case, the loss of the radiographer's assistant's TLD in the mail is not an issue because Mr. Wicks has indicated on a number of occasions that he packaged all WIX TLDs together for shipment to Landauer and Landauer received the package. Landauer representatives have informed the NRC staff that all TLDs are electronically scanned upon receipt, and the Landauer employs the use of a data base to verify that TLDs which are scanned after processing match those which are scanned upon receipt. The process is designed to alert Landauer to situations in which a TLD is lost during processing. Landauer's automated reporting system includes controls to flag and TLD number which was canned upon receipt and was not scanned again after processing. Lost TLDs are noted on dosimetry reports provided to Landauer customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

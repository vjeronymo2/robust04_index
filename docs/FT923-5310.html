			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Premier of South Australia resigns THE growing problems of the Australian Labor party were underlined yesterday when Mr John Bannon, premier of South Australia, resigned in the wake of ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) losses incurred by a state-owned bank. Mr Bannon has been under pressure since it emerged last year that property lending by State Bank of South Australia would cost taxpayers ADollars 2.5bn, later increased to ADollars 3.15bn. Mr Bannon, Australia's most senior state leader, said he was taking political responsibility for the bank's losses to give Labor a chance of winning the next state election, due in 1994. However, his departure after 10 years as premier may also mark the beginning of the end of a decade in which Labor has enjoyed uninterrupted control of the federal government and dominated the six state governments. Mr Bannon was one of a group of Labor leaders who rescued the party from oblivion following the defeat of Mr Gough Whitlam's federal Labor government during a constitutional crisis in 1975. The group, which dominated Australian politics through the 1980s, included Mr Bob Hawke, prime minister from 1983 to 1991, and Mr Neville Wran, Mr John Cain and Mr Brian Burke, who were respectively premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. All have left office in the wake of declining popularity and, in some cases, financial problems. Mr Burke, who was later ambassador to Ireland, faces criminal charges in connection with alleged corrupt relationships between Labor politicians and Western Australian businessmen. Labor has lost control of New South Wales and Tasmania, and is widely expected to be defeated in Victoria in October, in Western Australia next year, and in South Australia in 1994. The federal government has been revitalised in the last nine months under the leadership of Mr Paul Keating, but trails the opposition conservative parties by about 10 percentage points. A federal election must be held by next June. The only bright spot for the party is in Queensland, where Labor took office in 1989 following a corruption inquiry which fatally damaged the former National party government. Queenslanders are expected to return Labor in an election later this month.</p>

It is necessary to make "across-the-board advances" [zheng ti  tui jin 2419 7555 2236 6651] in the three aspects of fostering  the market entities, perfecting the market system, and improving  the regulatory and control system, and to make breakthroughs in  the two key points of laying the microeconomic foundation and  building the macroeconomic structure for the new market economy.  The reform measures that have been adopted or will be put into  practice this year will extensively touch upon many difficult  points in people's concepts and ideas, institutional  innovations, the adjustment of interests, and concrete operation  at a profound level; so this will be a tough battle.    At present, we are facing the most favorable opportunity for  launching the tough battle in our reform. We should be  courageous and determined enough to overcome all the  difficulties in the structural reform; otherwise, we may lose  the rare historical opportunity and may fail to ensure the  sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang]  development of the national economy and to achieve the  second-step strategic objective of our national economic and  social development; moreover, our economy may even be bogged  down in a predicament with the coexistence of high inflation and  low-speed economic fluctuation over a fairly long time.    We should profoundly understand and consciously grasp the  new  characteristics of this year's tough battle in the reform. In  the objects of the reform, as the reform will change the current  dual-track system into the single-track system of the market  economy, the pattern of the vested interests formed under the  dual-track system will be profoundly shaken. Thus, we need  comrades who take an active part in the reform to be brave  enough to carry out self-revolution. In the structure of the  reform, the spontaneous advances from bottom to top and the  devolution of power from top to bottom will be changed from  unified coordination and organization from top to bottom. This  will be a major change, which requires new adaptability. In the  process of the reform, "single-item advances" and batch  operation will be replaced with "across-the-board advances" and  "making breakthroughs in key points." This will make it more  necessary to obey the guidance of the central authorities, to  safeguard the authority of the central leadership, and to  establish an overall point of view. In the guidance to the  reform, as reform will mainly be regularized and guaranteed by  the legal system rather than being promoted by various policies,  we are required to continuously enhance the sense of law and to  learn how to apply legal means to guide the reform and manage  the economy.    To successfully fight a tough battle in this year's reform,  we must be united as one from top to bottom and share weal and  woe, and this is the decisive factor. First, we should be  really of one heart and one mind from top to bottom in the  aspect of approaching and assessing the situation. We must not  think that "reform is a matter for the central authorities, and  development is my own business" and must not thus become  indifferent to reform. Second, we should be really of one heart  and one mind in making efforts to create a more benign and more  favorable economic environment for the reform, and should thus  be determined to resolutely control the level of investment in  fixed assets, to maintain a basic balance among the gross  economic quantities, and effectively to curb inflation. Third,  we should be really of one heart and one mind in using both  hands to grasp the work; that is, while carrying out economic  reform and economic development, we should also safeguard social  and political stability and strengthen socialist spiritual  civilization. Leaders at all levels should be good at finding  out and stabilizing the people's feelings and resolving  contradictions in good time so that a peaceful and stable  situation as well as a benign public conduct and opinion  environment can be maintained. We should really ensure the  supply of foodstuffs and other daily necessities for the masses,  and should do solid things closely linked with their daily  lives. We must not disregard the people's livelihood while only  being keen to raise the rate of economic growth. [end abstract]    What will this year be? The leading comrades of the party  Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed  that this year will be a crucial year for implementing the  "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and for launching a tough battle in the in-depth  reform across the board for the establishment of the new  socialist market economic system. On 1 January, Comrade Jiang  Zemin pointed out in his speech at the new year tea party held  by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference: "The year 1994 will be an extremely  important year for our country's reform, opening up, and  modernization." "In the new year, the key part of our in-depth  reform is to carefully and properly organize the adoption and  implementation of a series of major reform measures for the  establishment of the socialist market economic system."    On 28 January, in his speech to the national propaganda and  ideological work conference, Comrade Zhu Rongji stressed: "The  tasks of reform and development in 1994 will all be arduous, and  this is what the people are concerned about and what the world  is watching. Whether we can win in this tough battle in the  course of reform will be a stern test for us." Later, in his  speech at the Spring Festival gala, Comrade Li Peng summarized  this year's tough reform battle into three main points: "First,  properly organize the implementation of the major reform  measures in the fields of the financial and taxation system, the  banking system, and the investment system, and establish and  perfect the macroeconomic control system. Second, continue to  transform the management and operation mechanisms in the  state-owned enterprises, and explore an effective way to  establish a modern enterprise system suited to the requirements  of the socialist market economy. Third, properly advance the  price reform and develop and improve the market system on the  basis of giving full consideration to the endurance capability  of all quarters concerned."    All these important speeches conveyed two important messages  to us: First, the economic structural reform in our country has  entered a new stage of being advanced comprehensively and in a  well-coordinated manner in depth across the board. This year  will be a year in which most reform measures will be adopted  more intensively than in the past more than 10 years since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and the  size, scope, difficulty, and depth of the reform will all be  unprecedented. Second, this year's in-depth reform will "be  advanced across the board" in the three aspects of fostering the  market entities, perfecting the market system, and improving the  regulatory and control system. At the same time, breakthroughs  will be made in the two key points of laying the microeconomic  foundation and building the macroeconomic structure for the new  market economy. These reform measures will basically take shape  within this year, and will become well-known to the general  public next year. In 1996, China will begin to move onto the  path of the socialist market economy. With the coming of the  new year, the prelude to the tough reform battle was started,  and the central authorities announced a series of important  reform programs in the field of macroeconomic control and in  other fields. The pilot schemes for the establishment of the  modern enterprise system, which is the main point of the  microeconomic reform, will soon be started in about 100  enterprises selected by the State Council. We should be fully  aware of the necessity, arduousness, and complicated nature of  this year's tough reform battle, and should be of one heart and  one mind in ensuring the across-the-board implementation of all  the major reform measures adopted by the central authorities  according to the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee. Through our painstaking efforts to  organize and guide the operation in various fields, we shall  guarantee the smooth implementation of the reform measures, win  a victory in the tough reform battle, and further develop the  current good situation.  <H6>  I </H6>   Why do we call the implementation of the major measures for  the in-depth reform this year a tough reform battle [gaige  gongjian zhan 2395 7245 2396 1017 2069]? This mainly refers to  the depth and difficulty of the reform. On the whole, some of  the major reform programs to be put into practice this year will  extensively touch many deep-level ideas and concepts, as we have  often mentioned, as well as some difficult points in the  adjustment of interests and concrete operation. For example,  the reform program for establishing the modern enterprise system  will profoundly touch the issue of defining the property rights  in the public economy and the form of the public economy. Being  different from the policy adjustments in the eighties in the  enterprise reforms, which were mainly devolution of power that  enabled the enterprises to retain more profits in their hands,  the current in-depth reform will further create a brand-new  enterprise system. As another example, in the reform program  for the establishment of the market for production factors, the  "labor force market" will touch such a deep-level issue as the  status of workers in an enterprise under the socialist  condition. As for the concept of a "capital market," this is  also a major breakthrough from the traditional conception and is  a new development of socialist economic theory. As one more  example, the reform program for various macroeconomic control  mechanisms, especially the tax-sharing system, requires the  delimitation of the scope of macroeconomic regulation and  control and is related to the scientific demarcation between the  economic management jurisdictions of the central and local  governments. In economic management, the authority of the  central government must be strengthened, and the power of  macroeconomic control in various fields must be concentrated in  the hands of the central government. At the same time, it is  also necessary to bring the initiative of the central and local  authorities into play. This is an issue that has not been  properly resolved since the foundation of the PRC and has not  been thoroughly resolved although efforts were made to resolve  it since the beginning of the reform. Therefore, this will also  be a difficult point in the tough reform battle. It is also  rather difficult to break the departmental and regional  monopolies in some economic sectors and to adjust the existing  interest patterns. Because the emancipation of people's minds,  the renewal of concepts, the innovation of systems, and the  adjustment of interests will be carried out at a deeper level  and will encounter greater difficulties, we call this year's  in-depth reform program a tough reform battle, which means we  will have to overcome many difficulties.    Why are so many tasks of tackling difficult problems  scheduled for this year in a concentrated manner, since tackling  difficult problems in reform is so arduous and involves certain  risks? Here is the question of the judgment and choice of  timing concerning whether or not the tasks of tackling difficult  problems in reform, which we have been discussing undertaking  for so many years, but for which conditions have not been  available, can be postponed. As far as the judgment of timing  is concerned, we must tackle difficult problems in reform by  resolving contradictions at a deeper level despite various kinds  of existing problems in the macroeconomy of our country at  present. Also, it is the most opportune time at present for us  to tackle difficult problems in reform. First, the 14th CPC  National Congress set, in accordance with the spirit of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's remarks made during his trip to the south, the  goal of reform of establishing the socialist market economy.  This enabled us at one go to get rid of the perplexity caused  by concepts concerning whether the market economy is "socialist"  or "capitalist." We can now courageously promote various kinds  of market-oriented reforms in the same direction at a deep level  without any ideological misgivings or obstacles, and we are  duty-bound not to turn back. Second, in the course of reform in  the past 10 years and more, we have overcome one difficulty  after another, have accumulated valuable experience, and have  increased our ability to deal with complicated situations.  Moreover, all the plans for tackling difficult problems in  reform put forward this time have been worked out under the  leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as the core, following meticulous and careful investigation and  study over a long period, pooling the wisdom of the people of  the whole country, and using as reference the successful  experience of the developed countries. They conform with the  general laws of the market economy, adhere to the principle of  proceeding from the actual national conditions of China, and  give as much consideration as possible to the interests of  various quarters. Therefore, a consensus on tackling difficult  problems in reform can be reached and resistance from various  quarters can be reduced. In addition, what is more important is  that since the publication of the important remarks made by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his inspection tour of the south in  1992, a new situation has been opened up in work of all aspects  in our country, the national economy is developing vigorously,  market supply is abundant, the people's living standard has been  further improved, and some problems cropping up in the course of  advance have been, or are being, effectively solved. All this  has created favorable political conditions and a social  environment for comprehensively promoting the tackling of  difficult problems in reform. If we miss this rare historical  opportunity and do not have the courage and determination to  overcome various difficulties in the structural reform, or  cannot properly solve various problems cropping up in  development, we cannot maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan] of the national  economy, nor can we realize the second-step strategic objective  for the national economy and social development. We may even  land in a predicament of high inflation and low-speed economic  fluctuation over a considerably long period in the future.    Regarding the choice of timing for reform, could the  promulgation of various reformative measures promulgated this  year have been further postponed as some comrades suggested?  Perhaps these comrades are not aware that technically speaking,  financial and taxation reforms and foreign exchange reforms have  to start in a rigid and unified calendar year and accounting  year. A delay of 10 days or half a month will actually mean a  delay of another year. Besides, we should also be aware that at  present, the losses in finance and taxes of the central  authorities are very serious. The financial revenue of the  central authorities accounts for a decreasing percentage of the  financial revenue of the country, and the deficits are  increasing. If the reform of the financial and taxation  structure is not carried out right away, things will get harder  and harder. Again, imports are increasing, exports are  decreasing, the trade deficit is expanding, the state's foreign  exchange income is decreasing, and the outflow of capital is  also increasing. If the reform of the foreign exchange  structure is not carried out right away, things will be  difficult to cope with. Moreover, the long-standing problem of  "being overanxious to make investment" of the traditional  planned economy structure, the competition in speed, the rapid  expansion in scale, and the financial expansion have become the  cause of the macroeconomy being out of control. If reform in  the investment structure and the financial structure is not  carried out right away, serious inflation will lead to serious  political problems. Therefore, if, following the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we do not make a  prompt decision, do not quickly make use of the favorable  opportunity, or do not take relatively big steps in deepening  reform, our political losses will be very great.  <H6>  II </H6>   What, then, are the new characteristics of the moves to  tackle difficult problems in reform this year as compared with  various reforms carried out since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee? We think that deepening our  understanding of, and consciously grasping, these new  characteristics are of the utmost importance to doing a good job  in tackling difficult problems.    First, as viewed from the targets of reform, there is a  transitional period of the "coexistence of the two tracks" in  the change from the socialist planned economy to the socialist  market economy. This is unavoidable in the course of reform in  our country and practice has proved that this period is  conducive to reducing shocks and to avoiding the common setback  of landing reform itself in a predicament resulting from the  accumulation of various kinds of problems caused by radical  reform. The structure in which the two tracks coexist has many  negative effects which brook no negligence. It induces the  marriage of administrative power with activities of the  commodity economy, leading to chaos in functions, misplacement  of roles, lax binding force, and uncontrollable behavior of  various interest entities, and to numerous loopholes and a lack  of rules in management. In the course of tackling difficult  problems in reform, to gradually change the dual-track structure  into the single-track structure of the market economy will  inevitably change the pattern of set interests formed in the  structure in which the two tracks coexist. This pattern of  interests is also linked with some reformative measures of the  eighties. Change in the pattern will cause conflicts of  interests and will also cause perplexity in concepts and  resistance in ideology. Therefore, even comrades who were  active in the previous stage of reform also have to further  enhance their consciousness of deepening reform, be courageous  to make self-revolution, and actively promote on their own  initiative the remolding of the economic structure and the  functions of their respective departments. Otherwise, it is  possible that they will become "half-way reformers" and lag  behind the times.    Second, as viewed from the methods of reform, the reform of  the eighties mainly developed spontaneously from bottom to top,  and power and interests were delegated from top to bottom. In  that stage, the main propelling force attacking the old  structure came from the various localities and the grass-roots  level. Various localities, various departments, and various  units could, according to their own will, have "optional  exercises" in reform and "grope for stepping stones to cross the  river," giving play to their own ability. Leading departments  mainly delegated power and interests to lower levels. As a  result, localities and units which energetically carried out  reform were often the first to get the benefit, while leading  departments appeared to be "entrenching themselves at every step  and retreating in defeat again and again." Things are different  in the stage of tackling difficult problems in reform. Since  many aspects of work have to be done in the establishment of the  new structure and close coordination among them is needed, it is  necessary for certain authoritative organs to formulate basic  rules for coordination. At the same time, since tackling  difficult problems in reform will unavoidably change the pattern  of set interests, reform does not necessarily bring immediate  interests to each unit or individual to the satisfaction of all.  This will inevitably encounter various kinds of difficulty and  resistance. It is necessary to organize people to make efforts  to remove obstacles before reformative measures can be  implemented. Also, in tackling difficult problems in reform, the  definition of property rights, the fixing of methods for the  management of assets, and the establishment of the new finance  and taxation structure, the monetary structure, the foreign  trade structure, and the investment structure can never be  realized spontaneously from bottom to top. The entire reform  process must be coordinated in a unified manner, organized, and  carried out from top to bottom by firm and powerful high-level  authoritative state organs. If we do not act in this way, but  let things drift, each doing what he thinks is right, serious  imbalance will occur, the cost of reform will undoubtedly  increase, the formation of a unified domestic market will be  delayed, and the rapid growth of the entire national economy  will be hindered.    Third, as far as the reform process is concerned, in the  eighties, most of the reforms proceeded separately. Since  people did not change their concepts all at the same time and  had different degrees of feeling toward the old system, some  localities were very enthusiastic for reform, and they took the  initiative in implementing reform, even "at their own expense";  but some localities acted slowly without much enthusiasm. For  example, in the early days of rural reform, the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output was implemented and the people's commune system  was abolished. At first, only one out of three provinces  fulfilled the tasks; in the second year, the number increased to  two-thirds; and it was only in the third year that almost all  provinces followed suit. At that time, the principle of the  central authorities was that "people are allowed to act as  bystanders," there would "not be any coercion or campaign,"  "people could do it as long as they were willing," and they  could "do it as much as they liked," while those who were still  not convinced and who failed to catch up with others could wait.  On the other hand, at a stage in which reform is implemented at  full speed, we must achieve overall progress, take joint action,  and make breakthroughs in key areas. It is necessary to  coordinate the time of introducing reform measures which have a  bearing on the overall situation of macroeconomic regulation and  to integrate every action and step. For example, in  implementing the taxation reform and unifying exchange rates, it  is as if athletes must take heed of the sound of the judge's  starting gun before they can run at full speed. It is absolutely  out of the question for one to implement reform while another  does not follow suit. Similarly, people cannot do it when they  are ready but stop when they are no longer willing to do so.  There is even less room for any wait-and-see attitude. Hence,  at the stage of implementing reform at full speed, we must  establish a new system, be subordinate to the guidance of the  central authorities, maintain the authority of the party Central  Committee and of the State Council, bear the overall situation  in mind, reach a common understanding, and act in unison.    Fourth, as far as reform guidance is concerned, in the  eighties, the main form of reform guidance was delivered through  policy implementation. For example, in implementing rural  reform, the central authorities issued a No. 1 document every  year, and the peasants, who spoke of "policies making people  rich" and "policies taking the reign," were always concerned  about "whether there were policy changes," whereas cadres at the  grass-roots level were quite concerned about the "money content  of policies" and wished to constantly receive "preferential  policies" from decisionmaking bodies. But at the stage in which  reform is implemented at full speed, the form of reform guidance  has already shifted, and will be more frequently shifted, from  policy implementation to implementation of laws. This is  because a socialist economy is virtually a kind of legal  economy. To establish and perfect the socialist market economic  system, it is necessary to have a complete legal system to  standardize and protect it, and, as far as reform guidance is  concerned, reform policy decisions are required to closely link  up with legislative policy decisions so as to use laws to guide  and give an impetus to reform as well as ensure its smooth  implementation. For example, when the taxation reform program  was introduced on 1 January 1994, the "PRC Personal Income Tax  Law," which was amended by the National People's Congress," and  regulations promulgated by the State Council for interim  implementation, including those on value-added tax, consumption  tax, sales tax, and enterprise gains tax, were simultaneously  introduced (that is, "one law and six regulations"). Before the  full implementation of the reform of establishing an enterprise  mechanism for a modern enterprise system, the state has already  promulgated in advance the "Company Law," the "Stock Law," and  so on. In order to adjust to the law-propelled form of reform  guidance at the stage in which reform is implemented at full  speed, we must, on the one hand, urge legislative organs to pay  close attention to drawing up laws on standardizing the main  body of the market, maintaining the market order, enhancing  macroscopic regulation, perfecting social security, opening up  wider to the outside world, and so on, and we must revise and  annul laws and regulations inconsistent with the establishment  of the new system in a timely manner. On the other hand, we  must make efforts to constantly improve the legal awareness and  concepts of the whole society and to urge cadres at all levels  to learn how to apply legal means to guiding reform and managing  the economy.  <H6>  III </H6>   All of us will certainly reach a common understanding after  clearly identifying the difficulties, necessity, and  characteristics of the full implementation of reform this year.  That is, to achieve success in reform this year, the key lies  in making concerted efforts and helping each other. "Tai Shan  will move and the battle will be easy if people are of one  mind." The party Central Committee and the State Council have  repeatedly stressed that the "leadership and the rank and file  should be of one mind in order to score a victory" in reform.  As far as the current situation is concerned, the unity between  the "leadership and the rank and file" should be embodied in the  following three aspects:    First, we must make really concerted efforts to get a  clear understanding of the overall situation and to be  subordinate to and serve it. The party Central Committee has  repeatedly stressed that the overall situation of party work  this year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, promote development, and maintain stability [zhuazhu  jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifang, cujin fazhan, baochi  wending]. The essence of the overall situation is precisely to  uphold the principle of "using reform to promote development"  and to "treat reform as the theme." Leading cadres at all  levels must have a sense of urgency, of responsibility, of  crisis, and of worry when seizing the opportunity to deepen  reform and take the initiative to devote more energies to  reform, and must center on the major orientation and train of  thought set by the central authorities with rapt attention.  Never can we consider that "reform is a matter for the central  authorities, whereas development is our own business" and be  merely keen on development rather than on reform. In  implementing reform, we must throw away "our small abacus," "not  get up to any little tricks," and oppose all sorts of fraud.  These kinds of behavior run counter to the principle of  achieving unity between the leadership and the rank and file.  We must draw inferences about other cases from one instance and  check erroneous ideas at the outset. We must sternly criticize  and correct negative phenomena in the process of deepening  reform.    Second, we must make really concerted efforts to create a  relatively relaxed and more favorable economic environment for  reform. Since reform is gaining momentum and we have a heavy  task to implement it in 1994, the economic environment cannot,  under any circumstances, be controlled too tightly. There must  be some leeway in making plans and arrangements for the pace of  economic growth. In this connection, we must be determined to  control the scale of fixed-asset investment, insist on matching  the scale of construction with our national strength, and  prevent the "three breakthroughs" in setting higher targets for  growth rate, planned fixed-asset investment, and price rise rate  from triggering off overheated economic development and  aggravating inflation again. Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly  said: "One of our experiences is to see emerging problems when  development is smooth, and development should be moderate  because an overheated economy will easily cause trouble." This  is the wise remark of an experienced person as well as a note of  caution. Leading comrades at all levels must stay sober-minded,  be unconditionally subordinate to policy decisions of  macroscopic regulation made by the central authorities,  resolutely refrain from thinking negatively, make arduous  efforts to keep total supply and demand basically in balance,  take practical measures to check inflation, and guard against  economic fluctuation. As far as the pace of development is  concerned, various localities must proceed from their real  conditions and never vie with each other.    Third, we must make really concerted efforts to uphold the  principle of doing two types of work simultaneously, maintain  social and political stability, and strengthen the building of  socialist ethical progress. Upholding the principle of doing  two types of work simultaneously and maintaining social and  political stability is the political guarantee for our smooth  reform, opening up, and modernization, and for our endeavor to  accomplish economic development. It is also an important  component of the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Without a stable social and political  environment, we cannot succeed in reform and construction.  Likewise, only when we insist on reform and development can  stability be basically maintained. We are now promoting  economic restructuring amid the high-speed operation of our  national economy, and we must also maintain the growth of our  national economy in a fast and good manner in the process of  accelerating system transformation. In this connection, we are  required much more to pay attention to maintaining a stable  social and political environment. Leaders at all levels must  treat the work of maintaining social stability as their own  task, be good at taking heed of public feeling, lay stress on  redressing grievances, promptly settle conflicts, guarantee  safety and peace, and make sure that the general mood of society  and the atmosphere of the press is good. We must carry forward  our party's fine tradition of caring for the masses in every  respect, of relying on the masses under all circumstances, and  of always thinking of the interests of the masses. We must  attach high importance to every concrete matter which is closely  related to the wellbeing of the masses, such as the "shopping  basket" and the "rice bag [mi dai zi 4717 5915 1311]" projects,  and we should never blindly seek speed of growth at the expense  of the wellbeing of the masses.    Various key measures for the full implementation of reform  have been introduced for more than two months, the overall  situation is good without giving rise to any outstanding  problem. At present, the market, society, and popular feeling  are stable, which strengthens our resolve to fully implement  reform to the end. "We must deal with the most difficult things  if we want to pave the way to a bright future." We believe that  if we succeed in the difficult task of deepening reform at full  speed, it is certain that our country will enjoy perpetual  political stability and make great strides forward in economic  construction. Let us be of one mind and make concerted efforts  to march forward in the flush of victory!</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / 'Sloppy buying' at universities Sloppy purchasing procedures cost the 'old' universities in England at least Pounds 30m per year, the cross-party Commons public accounts committee says in a report issued yesterday. It recommends reforms to universities' financial management, and calls on the Higher Education Funding Council for England, an education department quango, to take the lead in ensuring the savings were made. The figure excludes 'new' universities, recently converted from polytechnics.</p>

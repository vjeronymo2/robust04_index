			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAI TARGET REPORTS $5-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS;  </P> <P> PRIME COMPUTER TIES RED INK TO TAKEOVER FIGHT  </P> <P> Prime Computer Inc. said Thursday that it lost $5 million in its latest quarter  and blamed the red ink on the cost of fighting a hostile takeover bid by MAI  Basic Four Inc. of Tustin.  </P> <P> The Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker said the loss for its fiscal 1990 first  quarter, which ended April 3, includes a $6.3-million charge for expenses  incurred in defending itself against MAI's $1.3-billion takeover offer.  </P> <P> Prime reported revenue of $387 million for the quarter, an increase of 6% over  the corresponding period a year earlier. The first-quarter loss compares with  earnings of $14.5 million a year ago.  </P> <P> MAI launched its $20-a-share tender offer for Prime's stock last November. If  the Orange County firm manages to take over Prime, the transaction would rank  as one of the computer industry's biggest acquisitions.  </P> <P> The offer has been on hold since December, when a federal judge in Boston  issued an injunction blocking the bid on the grounds that MAI and its  investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, had made inadequate financial  disclosures. The judge recently said he will lift the injunction if Drexel  provides certain financial information to Prime shareholders.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, MAI said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  that it will enter into a confidentiality agreement it has previously rejected  if another bidder tops its $20-a-share offer for Prime.  </P> <P> Prime, which has fiercely resisted MAI's bid and termed the $20-a-share  offering price inadequate, recently said it is seeking other offers for the  company.  </P> <P> In an April 27 letter from MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow to Prime Chairman  David J. Dunn, LeBow said it is unlikely a higher bidder will emerge without  access to confidential information provided by Prime, according to the SEC  filing.  </P> <P> "We are clearly the logical party to top (a rival bid), assuming you have  supplied us with the same information and good-faith cooperation," LeBow wrote  in the letter.  </P> <P> MAI previously had refused to sign a confidentiality agreement with Prime.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No 12, 14-20 Mar 94] </F>   [Text] On April 1, 1994 the Cabinet's resolution becomes  effective, which was approved on February 22 and specifies  procedures for bringing to Ukraine or transferring across its  territory wastes and secondary raw materials, as well as sets a  list of materials banned from importation into Ukraine as  hazardous or toxic.    The resolution also defines procedures for license issuance  to transfer such materials across Ukraine's territory.    The resolution specifies that both bringing to Ukraine and  transit of such materials without permits from the Ministry for  natural environment protection are forbidden.    Commenting on the resolution at Ukrinform's request  Ukraine's  Minister for natural environment protection Yuriy Kostenko noted  that the document was an element of a comprehensive package of  documents, which the Ministry and other relevant departments  were drafting in order to adjust Ukraine's legislation to  accepted international norms and standards.    The List of groups of substances and materials, which belong  to the category of hazardous wastes and are banned from  importation into Ukraine, was drafted based on lists, which are  contained in the documents of the Basel Convention of 1989 "On  Control over Transborder Transfer of Hazardous Wastes and Their  Disposal".    On March 21 through 25 Geneva is supposed to host a meeting  of the parties to the Basel Convention to discuss, in  particular, the Convention's ratification procedural issues and  their accedence to it. The Ukrainian Ministry's delegation is  also to attend the meeting.    Yevgeniy Motorin, chief of the Ministry's ecological safety  agency, singled out the following major legal safeguards, which  the resolution contains:    -- the amount of wastes should correspond to the designated  enterprise's reprocessing capacity;    -- the contract should specify that in case of importation  of  substandard raw materials and wastes to be reprocessed in  Ukraine, the importer is bound to take them out of Ukraine at  his expense;    -- the custom-house is responsible for exercising due  control  over transborder carriage of wastes, in accordance with the  active legislation.    Besides, the Law of Ukraine of February 25, 1994 complements  the Criminal Code of Ukraine with an article, which specifies  that importation of banned materials into Ukraine is actionable  and entails punishment up to three years of imprisonment.  Importation into or transit across Ukraine's territory of  wastes and secondary raw materials without due permits entails  fines in amounts of 150 minimal wages.    As Ye. Motorin thinks, the state's support for environmental  safety is inadequate. There are only three garbage incineration  facilities in Ukraine.    The state budget provides for 1.638 trillion karbovanets  allocated for natural environment protection. Factual  allocation, though, is barely enough to support the Ministry for  natural environment protection alone.  <H5>  The List of Substance and Material Groups, Which Belong to </H5> the Category of Hazardous Wastes and Which Are Banned From Being  Brought to Ukraine    1.

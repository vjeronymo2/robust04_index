			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> Nansay International Inc. of Tokyo and ITT Sheraton Corp. are launching a  $1-billion venture to buy and operate hotels in the United States, the Pacific  and in Asia.  </P> <P> Sheraton will manage three hotels that Nansay is developing at the Kohanaiki  resort on the island of Hawaii, Sheraton Chairman John Kapioltas said in  Honolulu.  </P> <P> Work is also under way on hotels in Los Angeles, Guam and Saipan.  </P> <P> Under the arrangement, Nansay will be responsible for financing and project  development, while Sheraton will manage the hotels and determine opportunities  for additional projects.  </P> <P> Later, the companies plan a second joint venture in which each will put up  capital to buy hotels and ownership will be shared equally, Kapioltas said. He  said the hotel industry on the mainland is depressed, and in many cases  investors are willing to sell, giving Sheraton opportunities to expand.  </P></p>

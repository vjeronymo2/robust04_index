			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / FT Law Report: No costs remission to arbitrators PRESIDENT OF INDIA v JADRANSKA SLOBODNA PLOVIDBA Queen's Bench Division: Mr Justice Hobhouse: March 26 1992 A PARTY to arbitration who seeks to challenge a costs award on the ground of error of law must do so by way of appeal and not by application for remission to the arbitrator, irrespective of whether the award was reasoned or unreasoned, and whether or not it was included in the substantive award. And as it would be almost impossible for an appeal from an unreasoned award to succeed in that any appeal must be made out on the reasons, parties should consider at the time of the hearing whether to ask for a reasoned award. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when refusing an application by the charterer, the president of India, against shipowners, Jadranska Slobodna Plovidba, for an order to remit a costs award to the arbitrators on the ground of misconduct. Section 1 of the Arbitration Act 1979 provides: '(1) . . . without prejudice to the right of appeal conferred by subsection (2) below, the High Court shall not have jurisdiction to set aside or remit an award on an arbitration agreement on the ground of errors of fact or law on the face of the award. (2) . . . an appeal shall lie to the High Court on any question of law arising out of an award . . .' HIS LORDSHIP said that disputes arising between charterers and shipowners, under a charterparty dated August 25 1986, were referred to arbitration in London. By an interim award dated January 28 1991 the arbitrators awarded that charterers should pay owners Dollars 3,142. On April 24 the arbitrators made a 'final award as to costs'. That award was substantially adverse to the charterers. They issued a notice of motion for an order that it be remitted to the arbitrators on the ground of misconduct. The application was made under section 22 of the Arbitration Act 1950 ('In all cases of reference to arbitration the High Court . . . may remit . . . to . . . the arbitrator'), in conjunction with section 18 ('costs . . . shall be in the discretion of the arbitrator'). The allegation was that the arbitrators had failed to exercise the judicial discretion required by section 18. The award was not a reasoned award, but the arbitrators separately furnished the parties with 'confidential' reasons explaining how they had arrived at their decision. In Blexen v G Percy Trenthan (1990) 42 EG 1331 the Court of Appeal considered the procedure to be adopted by a party aggrieved by an arbitrator's award on costs. It held that the governing statutory provision for the purposes of the application with which it was concerned was not section 22 of the 1950 Act, but section 1 of the Arbitration Act 1979. Section 1 provided that, subject to the right of appeal, the court had no jurisdiction to remit an award 'on the ground of errors of fact or law on the face of the award'. The Court of Appeal in Blexen held that in the case before it the court no longer had power to remit under section 22 of the 1950 Act, and that the application must fail because it was not brought under section 1 of the 1979 Act. That decision was binding on the present court. In the leading judgment, Lord Justice Lloyd said power to set aside or remit for misconduct survived, but not when the only misconduct alleged was an error of fact or law in a reasoned award. Blexen was similar to the present case in that the parties had requested the arbitrator to hold a separate hearing and publish a separate costs award. But it was different in that they had apparently asked that it should be a reasoned award. That was the express basis of the Court of Appeal decision. In King v Thomas McKenna (1991) 2 WLR 1234, 1246 Lord Donaldson MR said obiter that appeal with leave under section 1 would also be the only means of appeal in a case in which no reasons had been given. Where the costs award was a separate award, following Blexen, it was clear that the matter must be governed by the 1979 Act. If the award was reasoned the procedure to be followed must be that laid down in section 1. Notice of motion must be issued in time and leave to appeal asked for. The appeal must be made good on the reasons. The applicant would have to satisfy the court, on the reasons, that the arbitrator misdirected himself on what was involved in the judicial exercise of his discretion or that, though there was no express misdirection, it must be inferred because that was the only explanation of his award. Under section 1, the applicant must satisfy the stringent criteria for grant of leave to appeal laid down in The Nema (1982) AC 724. He would find that difficult to do except in the most obvious case of a failure to exercise a judicial discretion. If the parties had not asked for a reasoned award they would almost certainly be unable to appeal because they would not be able to satisfy the criteria in section 1(6) for an order requiring the arbitrator to provide reasons. They had each had an opportunity to ask for a reasoned award and it was exceedingly unlikely in those circumstances that there would be any 'special reason' for not having made a request. As pointed out by Lord Donaldson, the implication of Blexen was that the same principles must be followed whether or not the arbitrators had given reasons. Where, as here, there had been a separate award on costs, the parties must follow the procedures and requirements of section 1. The procedure and remedy under section 22 might only be invoked where there had been some excess of jurisdiction, some distinct element of misconduct or procedural mishap, not simply some alleged unjudicial exercise of the discretion. Examples of such distinct misconduct could be making an award which went outside the rival contentions of the parties, or making an award without giving both parties an opportunity to be heard. Where the costs award was included in a substantive award, if the award was reasoned, Blexen must apply. If it was not reasoned continued use of the different regime under section 22 would produce an unacceptable anomaly. Therefore again the opinion of Lord Donaldson must be followed, and section 1 applied. Where the complaint was some actual misconduct, such as breach of natural justice, procedural mishap, excess of jurisdiction or failure to complete the reference, for example by failing to deal with costs at all, a motion under section 22 and/or 23 would still be appropriate. Mr Simon for the charterers applied for leave to amend his proceedings to include the appropriate application under section 1. To avoid any question of whether the award was reasoned and whether the court could look at the confidential reasons, the parties agreed that the confidential reasons could be treated as the reasons in the final award. It was therefore equivalent to a reasoned award. The reasons disclosed no error of law. It followed that the charterers' application for leave to appeal could not succeed - nor would a motion under section 22 have succeeded. To succeed on an application for leave to appeal from a costs award a party would normally have to be prepared to satisfy the highest category of test in The Nema, which was almost tantamount to persuading the court that the appeal would almost certainly be successful. Practitioners needed to take into account that the result of Blexen was not only that a new procedure was to be followed in challenging a costs award, but also that at the time of the arbitration hearing they would have to consider whether they might want to challenge the costs decision, and whether they should ask for reasons (with or without a separate hearing and/or award on costs). In practice, it would probably be more difficult to persuade a court to interfere with a costs decision under section 1 than it was formerly under section 22. For the charterer: Peregrine Simon (Gagrat Gardi &amp; Co). For the shipowners: Dominic Kendrick (More Fisher Brown).</p>

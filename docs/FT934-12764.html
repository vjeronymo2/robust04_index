			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nedlloyd examines drilling unit spin-off NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, is to examine spinning off its profitable offshore drilling subsidiary. The move marks a new phase in the loss-making company's divestment programme. Among the possibilities are merging the drilling division with another company, putting it into a joint venture, or seeking a listing for it on an international stock exchange. The division, called Neddrill, rents out rigs used to drill for oil and gas at sea and on land. Although Nedlloyd does not publish specific turnover or profit figures for its drilling activities, its 1992 annual report said the drilling subsidiary posted a substantial increase in turnover and a clear improvement in operating results. In recent years, Nedlloyd has divested a range of businesses, including its energy and air freight activities, as part of efforts to concentrate on two core businesses. The pace and scale of these divestments was the main point of contention between Nedlloyd and Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor.</p>

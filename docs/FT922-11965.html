			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Political uncertainty fuels swings in some markets - Recent trading patterns across Europe European markets showed a slight overall increase in volume last month, but this rise was largely due to the UK and Switzerland, with Belgium and Germany the only two other market areas to advance in March. Italy had the steepest decline in turnover, a 33 per cent fall from February. As with the UK, the market was hampered by nerves ahead of the country's general election. Political commentators forecast, correctly, that the ruling four-party coalition would suffer defeat, creating more uncertainty as a new government was pieced together. However, Mr James Cornish of County NatWest notes that volume in Italian shares traded on Seaq International in London rose 36 per cent in March. Switzerland saw a rise in volume as foreign investors were attracted by the liberalisation of share ownership. The new code comes into force on July 1 but already a number of companies have announced that they will abolish participation certificates. Activity was also stimulated by good first-quarter results, particularly from the banks and Brown Boveri. The decision by the Conservative government in the UK to call a general election may not have taken the market by surprise, but early opinion polls indicating a possible victory by the Labour party had a marked effect on activity. Unlike Italy, where volume was depressed, the UK saw a 10 per cent rise as institutions switched stocks and bought into companies which they believed might benefit from a change in the governing party. Power utilities, which had been privatised during the 13 years of Tory government, came into focus as some investors feared that Labour would renationalise them. Property issues were also active on fears that a Labour victory would lead to higher interest rates. But with most opinion polls showing the two leading parties running virtually neck-and-neck and the prospect of a coalition government looming there was as much verve as nerve in the market. Politics also played a part in France, where volume picked up later in the month after President Francois Mitterrand forced the resignation of Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister. The market was pleased with the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former finance minister. A stronger performance on Wall Street, boosted by some good first-quarter results, helped calm the recent volatility in Japan and lifted markets worldwide. Only South Africa showed a small decline on the week, largely because of a fall in the gold price. Denmark rose but on small turnover, as an increase in shipping rates lifted that sector. Mexico's performance continued to improve as more foreign investors turn to the market. In Hong Kong the release of information on the inner reserves of the leading banks pushed the market up.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                  Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse             Dec       Jan       Feb       Mar       US                   1991      1992      1992      1992   Dollars bn Belgium          32.30     55.85     46.72     48.28      1.42 France          111.08    141.18    116.18    108.97     19.52 Germany          66.00    134.30    126.20    126.68     76.96 Italy         6,342.00  9,665.20  8,948.80  5,944.80      4.79 Netherlands       9.81     16.10     14.10     11.60      6.26 Spain           671.36    637.26    667.83    607.28      5.84 Switzerland       7.70     13.20     10.90     11.88      7.91 UK               26.44     36.40     29.61     32.59     56.57  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

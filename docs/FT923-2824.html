			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan set for go-ahead on Gatt membership BARRING unforeseen hitches, Taiwan's application to join Gatt will have the go-ahead when the organisation's governing council meets on September 29. Taiwan applied for membership of the 105-nation world trade body in January 1990 as an autonomous customs territory, the formula used by Hong Kong and Macao when they joined Gatt with China's agreement. But objections from China, which has been trying since 1987 to resume its Gatt place, have until now held up the decision for a working party to negotiate Taiwan's entry terms. Gatt's developing-country members have been reluctant to bless Taiwan's candidacy without China's endorsement. Beijing left Gatt in 1950, and Taiwan was expelled when China took its UN seat in 1971. Under the terms of an understanding reached last spring between China, the EC and US, China will rejoin Gatt before Taiwan is admitted, though perhaps only minutes ahead. Gatt members have agreed Taiwan will be known as Chinese Taipei; once a working party is set up, its entry terms could be drafted in 12 months, since Taipei has already moved to make its trade regime more compatible with Gatt rules.  But Taipei they have longer to wait since China's membership bid is being held up by trade frictions with the US.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Forte pays FFr1.82bn for Meridien hotels Forte has paid a total of FFr1.82bn (Pounds 217m) for the Meridien hotel chain. The final purchase price for Meridien is less than the FFr1.9bn envisaged when the deal was first announced in September. This is because some minority shareholders agreed to accept lower amounts in return for earlier payment. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, has been appointed chairman of Meridien. Meridien will have an eight-member board, of whom six will come from Forte. Mr Jean Didier Blanchet, Meridien chairman until the purchase, is to be vice chairman. Air France, which owned 57 per cent of Meridien until the Forte acquisition, is to retain a place on the board in the form of Mr Patrick Durant, an Air France director. Forte has signed a seven-year co-operation agreement with Air France, under which it will jointly market Meridien hotels, and possibly other Forte properties. Forte said Air France flights to Germany and the US might be useful in marketing its hotels in the two countries. The cost of purchasing Air France's stake is FFr1.09bn, of which FFr871m was paid yesterday. The balance is payable on March 8 1995, but is dependent on both detailed structural surveys and on how many hotel management contracts Meridien retains. Of the minority shareholders, those with 11.35 per cent of the shares agreed to sell to Forte on the same terms as Air France. This meant Forte was required to pay FFr173m yesterday. A further FFr43m is payable on March 8, again subject to the same conditions as Air France. Minority shareholders representing 31.33 per cent of the shares agreed to accept final payment yesterday at a 15 per cent discount to the payment received by the other shareholders. The cost was FFr508m. Forte said yesterday's payments were mainly met from the proceeds of last week's Pounds 175m placing of Forte shares. The balance was paid from existing borrowing facilities.</p>

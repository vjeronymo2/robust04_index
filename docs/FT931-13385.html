			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Oil market fails to react to air strikes against Iraq - At a Glance Oil prices shrugged off the air strikes against Iraq. Two years ago, the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait pushed oil prices to their highest in years but this time there was little effect on the market. North Sea Brent crude for March delivery increased by about 30 cents a barrel on January 13, the day of the air strikes but ended the day unchanged at Dollars 17.10 a barrel. The lack of activity underlines the weakness of the market. Prices have been depressed because of overproduction by Opec, with Brent crude falling by Dollars 1 a barrel since the beginning of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Irene So] </F>   [Text] China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs  last night evaded a mass protest set up for his first visit to  Hong Kong in two years. Lu Ping slipped by more than 100  protesters and journalists waiting for him in the lobby of the  Kowloon-Canton Railway station at Hunghom.    A coalition of about 120 groups charged Mr. Lu with being  insincere in his claims of wanting to listen to Hong Kong  people's views during his 10-day visit. They vowed to continue  their protest in the coming few days until they successfully  conveyed their discontent on the sentencing of Hong Kong  reporter Xi Yang to Mr. Lu.    Following the unsuccessful attempt to meet Mr. Lu, about 10  representatives from the Coalition for the Release of Xi Yang  marched to the Bank of China Building in Central, where Mr. Lu  is to attend the bank's note issuance ceremony today. They set  up tents outside the bank and pledged to stay there all night.  Pro-democracy activist Lau Shan-ching said Mr. Lu was acting  like a mouse, being too afraid to face his critics.    "Didn't he say that he was coming to Hong Kong to meet the  people of Hong Kong? What is the point of him escaping from us  like that?" he said. Mr. Lu took the 4:13 pm train from  Guangzhou yesterday afternoon, accompanied by officials from the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, of which he is director,  Chinese members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) and  about 200 members of China's National People's Congress, Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, local PWC members  and some of Beijing's Hong Kong Affairs Advisers.    They arrived at Hunghom at 6:50 pm and immediately walked  from the Carriage No. 6 to a Mercedes-Benz limousine which had  been driven into the cargo area near the platform. He and a  band of security men boarded the limousine and left the station  without seeing the protest in the arrival hall, one floor above.  There was no official greeting from the Hong Kong Government.    A short press briefing scheduled after his arrival was  cancelled because of the "large crowd" waiting at the station  lobby.    Mr. Lu's refusal to meet the protesters follows his earlier  rejection of talks with Governor Chris Patten, who had sought  discussions on a wide range of unsettled matters relating to the  handover in 1997. Before his arrival, Mr. Lu shrugged off an  invitation from Mr. Patten to discuss the transition of the  civil service and measures to curb the escalating property  prices.    While turning Mr. Patten down, Mr. Lu has included in his  tight schedule a meeting with at least five of the most  influential civil servants associations next Saturday.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Samsung wins permission to make cars: South Korea alters policy to let chaebol into new industries The South Korea government yesterday approved a plan by Samsung to expand into the passenger car industry, in a decision which will reduce administrative efforts to curb the growth of the country's big industrial groups, or chaebol. State approval of the Samsung project was part of a new policy to remove restrictions preventing the chaebol from entering new industries, said Mr Kim Chul-su, trade and industry minister. The new chaebol policy reflects the government's efforts to promote deregulation in an economy which has been heavily influenced by state intervention. The government abandoned its policy of allotting industries to designated companies in the late 1980s. But it has since used other measures to keep the chaebol from growing too large and increasing their dominance of the national economy. One favoured means of control has been the requirement that the government must grant approval for the import of foreign technology. The government has used this rule to keep the chaebol from establishing new industries, including initially the Samsung car project, which involves the import of automotive technology from Nissan of Japan. But Mr Kim said yesterday the state would no longer exploit the requirement for this purpose.  'There will be no more restrictions applied on new market entries by means of disapproving an enterprise's plans for introducing foreign technology.' Mr Kim's statement represents a victory for the chaebol, which have been campaigning for reduced state controls on their activity. They have criticised the government's attempts to limit their growth as short-sighted since it forced them to concentrate on established industries and prevented them from entering new sectors that would ensure their future competitiveness. The government's industrial policy would shift its focus to technology, environmental protection and promoting balanced regional development, while allowing the chaebol to make investment decisions based on market forces and free competition, Mr Kim said. Analysts believe that the government's current policy of forcing the chaebol to specialise in several core industries is likely to be abandoned. But doubts remain about the government's commitment to the new chaebol policy. The administration, for example, still wants to stop Hyundai from entering the steel sector by building a large integrated steel mill. The government objected to the Hyundai project because its proposed steel production technology was outdated and would contribute to pollution, Mr Kim explained. Hyundai believes that government opposition reflects worries that the new steel mill would reduce profits for state-controlled Pohang Iron and Steel, which dominates the domestic steel market. There are also suggestions that political favouritism is involved since Samsung is considered a corporate supporter of South Korean President Kim Young-sam, while Hyundai is regarded as an opponent after Mr Chung Ju-yung, its founder, stood against Mr Kim in the 1992 presidential election. But in an apparent attempt to mollify Hyundai, the government decided yesterday to allow it to import technology for the Chariot minivan from Mitsubishi of Japan. It had threatened earlier to block the technology transfer as part of an effort to promote technological independence for the Korean car industry. The chaebol have benefited from previous government intervention because it tended to reduce the number of competitors in specific industries. Korea's four carmakers have lobbied intensively the government to reject Samsung's car project because it could threaten the survival of existing companies. The carmakers fear that the Samsung project will lead to overcapacity and reduce their domestic market share. Trade unions associated with the Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo and Ssangyong car companies are threatening to go on strike today to protest against the decision on Samsung.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIDING HIGH  </P> <P> Thank you very much for showing that Winona Ryder "Acting as Fast as She Can,"  Dec. 9) is a meritorious young woman rather than a silly teen-ager.  </P> <P> Ryder is one of the best actresses out there today. It doesn't matter if she's  19 or 40, she knows what she wants and she's getting it.  </P> <P> VALENTINA SILVA  </P> <P> Norwalk  </P></p>

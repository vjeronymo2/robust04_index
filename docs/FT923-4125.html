			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Malawi dissident bailed A MALAWI magistrates court yesterday charged dissident Chakufwa Chihana with three counts of sedition and freed him on bail unconditionally, his lawyer said, Reuter reports from Lusaka. Mr Bazuka Mhango told Reuters that Mr Chihana, who attended the court in the northern town of Zomba, was in good health and heading towards Malawi's capital. 'He has been charged with three offences related to sedition but we applied for bail and the magistrate ordered that he be released. He is now on his way home,' Mr Mhango said. The charges stem from statements Mr Chihana, 52, made in a July interview with the BBC shortly after his release from detention on earlier sedition charges. He had said he would continue to mobilise popular support to end the one-party rule of Mr Kamuzu Banda, self-declared life president who has held power since 1964 independence from Britain. Banda, accused last week of continued human rights abuses by Amnesty International, says he still enjoys wide support. Chihana is expected to appear in court on September 21 in connection with the first sedition charges following his return to Malawi from meetings in Lusaka with exiles last April. He was re-arrested shortly after his release in July 10.</p>

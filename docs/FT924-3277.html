			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Germany's motor industry announces big production cuts THE German motor industry yesterday announced sweeping production cuts early next year in a bid to reduce stocks and avoid further job losses. Audi, the up-market Volkswagen subsidiary, said about 25,000 of its 37,500 workers would be put on short-time for three weeks during the first quarter of 1993. Mercedes-Benz announced 14 days' short-time working at its four German car assembly plants in January and February, and up to 40 days at three components factories. Most of the group's 95,000 car workers are likely to be affected. Meanwhile, Volkswagen said that up to 14,000 of the 18,000 workers employed at its Hanover works would be sent home for a week during January. All three companies have already announced plans for large-scale job cuts over the next two or three years as well as extended Christmas holidays in most of their factories. The latest announcements - short-time working in Germany effectively means stopping production - reflect the recent rapid deterioration in domestic markets and continuing recession abroad. However, there are suggestions that workforce reductions, both planned and executed, may not be enough to counter the effects of recession. Mercedes, for example, has already shed 12,500 workers in the past 12 months. Short-time working is commonly introduced as an interim measure to balance supply and demand, but in many manufacturing industries hit by the current downturn, it has become a prelude to job losses. Audi, which recently unveiled plans to reduce its workforce by 10 per cent, said the latest move was 'a reaction to the continuing order weakness in the domestic and important European export markets'. There were also unconfirmed reports yesterday that Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US vehicle maker, was headed for its first loss in six years and planned to shed up to 3,000 workers. According to some estimates new car registrations in Germany will fall by 500,000 next year. Industry analysts have forecast a 5 per cent fall in western European demand next year, although Ford and Mercedes both hope to regain some ground with important launches of new or revamped models. BMW, which till benefiting from the impact of its new 3-Series models, said that short-time was out of the question. The group recently announced proposals for the loss of 3,000 jobs next year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Gloria Salguero  Gross, a deputy for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance  (ultra right-wing ARENA) was elected by a split vote the new  president of El Salvador's Legislative Assembly today, Sunday.    Salguero received the support of 70 of the 84 deputies that  make up the assembly, including seven members of the former  guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Movement (FMLN).  The remaining 14 FMLN deputies abstained.    The presidential election took place during installation of  the Legislative Assembly ceremonies. The process was marked by  chants, jeers, and shouting by FMLN militants, who were  protesting because the previous legislature changed the  institution's bylaws, allowing the new president to vote twice.</p>

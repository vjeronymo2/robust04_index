			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Prudent banking or blind panic?: Second-guessing Metallgesellschaft's woes Were Metallgesellschaft's creditor banks, led by Deutsche, struck by blind panic when, at the turn of the year, they forced the liquidation of the group's US oil futures positions and effectively precipitated its near-collapse? Is it possible, as has been suggested by professors, that the banks did not properly understand the niceties of derivatives trading and caused far heavier losses than necessary? Was the affair a costly, avoidable blunder? Is it even possible that Deutsche deliberately turned paper or potential oil futures losses into a real deficit - regardless of cost - to seize control of Metallgesellschaft and supplant its adventurous management with its own team? The underlying questions in the debate over Metallgesellschaft's misfortunes reappeared this week in a flurry which sparked a crash in the group's stock price. However, by last night, after falling by almost a third to around DM100, the shares were back where they started the week at DM145. Deutsche has stood throughout by its claim that it adhered to the first principle of banking prudence and refused to throw good money after the bad it had dispatched into the New York oil futures market by MG Refining &amp; Marketing. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche director, and the power behind Mr Kajo Neukirchen, MG chairman, rejected criticisms from the US - most notably from Mr Merton Miller, Nobel prize winner - of misguided crisis management and over-reaction. Mr Miller's reconstruction of events was based on false assumptions about MG's oil futures business and factual errors. Mr Schmitz dismissed as 'groundless' complaints, reportedly filed with German state prosecutors by an anonymous 'committee' claiming to represent employees of MG and people 'damaged' by Deutsche's handling of the affair, that Deutsche Bank was responsible for driving the group to the brink of bankruptcy - to the benefit of his own employer - and broke the law in the process. Perhaps the most telling factor behind the share price rebound was a reminder from Mr Neukirchen of his promise that MG would show an operating profit of more than DM100m (Dollars 64.9m) in the new financial year, which starts tomorrow. Mr Neukirchen and his all-new board have been beavering away at polishing the group's balance sheet and profit-and-loss account for the launch into the new year. Among the trickier manoeuvres successfully negotiated this week, the board managed to off-load a handful of shares in MG's loss-ridden environmental services subsidiary, BUS Berzelius, into the hands of unnamed, but clearly sympathetic institutional investors. As a result, its stake in BUS has fallen below 50 per cent, and analysts expect that this year's losses will not have to be consolidated in the group result for the 1993-94 year. Meanwhile, urgent negotiations were continuing yesterday to sell off the last of the so-called 'family silver' - the group's headquarters building in the middle of Frankfurt. A private sale is possible, but failing that, creditor banks have agreed to buy the building. Although the scale of the asset disposals has far exceeded earlier expectations, and deprived MG of rock-solid profit earners such as the Buderus heating equipment group, it now appears that the bulk of the sell-off is over and restructuring of the remnants can proceed. But the questions and accusations which surfaced this week are likely to return. They are scheduled to be aired in a Baltimore court room on October 14. There Mr Arthur Benson, a former senior executive at MG Marketing &amp; Refining in New York, is due to claim Dollars 1bn compensation for the damage to his reputation caused by his highly publicised sacking in the wake of the oil futures debacle. The US legal authorities, investigating associated events, are understood to be especially interested in whether Deutsche Bank played any direct, active role in unwinding the oil futures business, and thereby infringing strict US regulations on banks' involvement in commodities contracts. At the same time, it is unlikely that the last has been heard of complaints from the anonymous 'committee'. This week's well-timed and well-publicised arrival of its accusations in the state prosecutor's hands has roused speculation that standing behind the shield of anonymity is a vengeful Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, MG's sacked and disgraced former chairman.</p>

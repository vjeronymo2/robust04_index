			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's nationalist Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) has expressed indignation over  Ukrainian troops' "attack on the building of the Interior  Ministry of (Ukrainian autonomous republic of) Crimea in order  to change it into a so-called Central Department for Crimea of  the Interior Ministry of Ukraine."    "Your government, Mr. Kravchuk, has already plundered  Ukraine  and run down what was a rich land," the LDPR says in a statement  received by Interfax on Friday. "Now it is stealing Russian and  Turkmen gas and oil transported through your territory."    Kravchuk "wishes to sell the Black Sea Fleet (disputed by  Russia and Ukraine) for scrap metal, to sell everything that can  be sold, in order to flee the devastated country when its people  rise and demand reunification with Russia," the party says.</p>

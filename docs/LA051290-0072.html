			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH OPEN TO TAX TALK AT SUMMIT;  </P> <P> BUDGET: THE PRESIDENT ADMITS HE'S UNCERTAIN IF INCREASES ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE  THE DEFICIT. HE INSISTS HE'S WILLING TO 'DISCUSS EVERYTHING.'  </P> <P> President Bush entered the increasingly anxious public debate over the federal  budget deficit Friday, conceding that he does not know whether it can be curbed  without increasing taxes.  </P> <P> But in his first public comments on the controversy since the White House and  Congress began highly visible maneuvering last Sunday over the deficit, Bush  insisted that he is imposing no conditions on budget negotiations that begin at  the White House next Tuesday.  </P> <P> The President's comments, made at the start of a two-day trip to Texas, South  Carolina and Virginia, followed by one day the publication of remarks by his  chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who insisted that the White House would reject  any effort to raise taxes.  </P> <P> The impact of Sununu's comments was to inflame uneasy congressional Democrats,  who had grown increasingly fearful that the budget negotiations would become a  political trap in which the White House would position itself as the opponent  of unpopular tax increases proposed by Democrats.  </P> <P> But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), who was traveling with Bush, said he believes  the so-called budget summit is "on track -- as long as we keep these fellows in  line who are trying to redefine it." Bentsen is chairman of the Senate Finance  Committee and will participate in the negotiations.  </P> <P> Bush and congressional leaders agreed last Sunday to begin the private talks on  the ballooning budget deficit in the wake of rising interest rates, a recent  increase in unemployment and predictions that government revenues in fiscal  1991 will be lower than anticipated. By seeking to work out a joint solution to  the untamed deficit, Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate and the  Republican White House hope they can avoid political pitfalls or at least share  the blame if unpopular choices must be made.  </P> <P> Without an agreement to boost government revenue, trim spending, or both,  Budget Director Richard G. Darman has warned, severe across-the-board spending  cuts will be imposed on the federal budget to bring the fiscal 1991 deficit to  $64 billion as required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.  </P> <P> Darman has estimated that, in the absence of reduced spending and greater  government income, that target could be missed by as much as $100 billion in a  $1.2-trillion budget.  </P> <P> Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the budget must be balanced by fiscal 1993, which  begins on Oct. 1, 1992. Specific, decreasing deficit targets must be met each  year along the way.  </P> <P> The announcement last Sunday that there would be no "preconditions" in the  budget talks was widely interpreted as a signal that Bush might be willing to  retreat from his 1988 campaign pledge of "no new taxes."  </P> <P> Senior White House officials sent out multiple signals -- some saying that "no  preconditions" meant Bush was open-minded on the subject, while others urged  caution in interpreting it to mean a tax hike is on the way. And conservative  Republicans urged Bush to stand firm in opposing higher taxes.  </P> <P> After remaining publicly silent on the matter all week, Bush at first sought to  duck any response Friday, telling reporters: "You can come at me all day long."  </P> <P> But, pressed about whether there was any way to balance the budget without  increasing revenues, he acknowledged that he is uncertain, and he made no  mention of his opposition to tax increases.  </P> <P> "See what happens. We just don't know. Go there; go there and discuss  everything," he replied.  </P> <P> With the controversy over the deficit and possible tax hikes showing no sign of  abating, Bush called for calm -- and adherence to the negotiation ground rules:  An open mind to all approaches to bring down the deficit but secrecy in the  conduct of the talks.  </P> <P> "I don't contribute to it if I start telling about my approach or what I think  is the right way to do it, try to dictate to anybody. But I'll be there with no  preconditions," he said, after approaching reporters even before Air Force One  was airborne at the start of the journey to Kingsville, where Bush spoke at  Texas A&amp;I University.  </P> <P> "You can't react to every charge and countercharge or some flamboyant  congressman up there blasting away at me," Bush said. "I don't think that's the  way a President should conduct himself.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your snorkel above the water  level and do what you think is right. That's exactly what my mom told me when I  was about 6. Do your best. Do your best. I'm trying hard. Stay calm."  </P> <P> But despite such advice, the President seemed peeved at repeated questions  about the likelihood of a tax increase -- a step that would place him in the  politically difficult position of making a public retreat from the centerpiece  of his 1988 campaign just before the 1990 congressional elections  </P> <P> Bush also appeared bothered by a suggestion that Sununu was in trouble as a  result of the comments the chief of staff made on the President's unwillingness  to recommend a tax increase.  </P> <P> "That's silly. So stupid," Bush said, adding that his congressional critics are  not "in trouble either."  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Merseyside companies increase turnover Research into the performance of privately-owned, medium-sized companies in the recession has uncovered unexpected resilience, with turnover and profits growing steadily and the number of employees increasing. The work has been done on Merseyside, one of Britain's most economically-distressed areas, which is getting more than Pounds 600m of EU special funding in the next six years to try to catch up with average European performance. The Liverpool office of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has analysed the filed results of 993 unquoted independent companies in Merseyside and the local contributions of 551 subsidiaries of national or international companies. A majority - 852 independents and 340 subsidiaries - are small, with sales of less than Pounds 5m a year each. Most sales were generated by the 141 independents and 211 subsidiaries turning over more than Pounds 5m each. Their combined sales figures totalled Pounds 10.85bn in 1992-93, compared with Pounds 9.17bn two years earlier. Among the 141 medium-sized and large independents aggregate turnover rose nearly 18 per cent over three years - from nearly Pounds 2.1bn in 1990-91 to nearly Pounds 2.5bn in 1992-93. Profits grew 57 per cent over the three years - from Pounds 54m in 1990-91 to Pounds 85m in 1992-93. Shareholders' funds rose 29 per cent to Pounds 488m, so corporate net worth improved. So did the number of jobs, with the 141 independent companies employing 21,997 in 1992-93 compared with 20,951 in 1990-91. Mr Tim Beer, who is setting up a north-west regional unit for KPMG dealing only with owner-managed businesses, said yesterday: 'Medium-sized companies based on Merseyside have been able to weather the storm of the recession, possibly better than other sectors or areas of the UK.</p>

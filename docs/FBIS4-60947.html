			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by S. Sokolova, </F> identified by caption]    [Text] [Sokolova over video of truck-mounted missile  travelling down a forest track] The Plesetsk test range is 30  years old. Since the disintegration of the Union it is the only  Russian test range from which satellites as well as missiles can  be launched. Incidentally, last year the world's first  communications satellite was launched into orbit from here  aboard an ICBM.    The latest missile systems have been tested here. Four of  them now form the main component of the Russian missile forces  and are used for alert duty.    Under START II, the Plesetsk computer and information center  is processing and analyzing telemetric information on both its  own and the U.S. launches. The United States, in turn, receives  all the requisite information about our missile systems.    According to specialists, Plesetsk is the most hardworking  test range in the world. Up to 70 percent of the launches of  various satellites and rockets [raketa] carried out in the world  take place here. True, as from this year the number of launches  has sharply decreased. The reasons for this are many, but the  main one is the shortage of funds. This is why commercial  satellites will also be launched from Plesetsk in the future.  Fortunately, applications from Russian and Western companies  have already been received.

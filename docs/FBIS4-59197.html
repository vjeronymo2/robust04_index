			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman--Representatives of the British organisation  Lloyds Register are expected to arrive in Jordan in two weeks to  start the process of land-based verifications of  al-'Aqabah-based shipping which will replace the sea-inspection  operations expected to end before the end of the month, Western  diplomats said Tuesday [10 May].    The diplomats said the imminent lifting of the siege on  al-'Aqabah would open the door for Jordan's resumption of its  "important" role in the peace process and would allow for its  participation in the next round of bilateral peace talks  expected to begin in Washington next month.    The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  Jordan has agreed to pay the estimated $2 to 3 million annual  fees for the non-profit Lloyds Register but the United States is  insisting that the payments be made through the United Nations  so that Jordan "will not be able to influence the organisation."    They said Washington was also insisting that Lloyds Register  establish a direct link with the U.N. Sanctions Committee in  order to supervise exports to Iraq that are permitted by the  trade embargo on Baghdad.    Among other "minor technicalities" still under negotiations  between Jordan and the U.S. and other members of the  multilateral interdiction forces enforcing the naval blockade on  al-'Aqabah is a mechanism through which member countries of the  force will be able to inspect Lloyds Register's operations, the  sources told the JORDAN TIMES.    Though no Security Council resolution is needed to change  the  mechanism through which al-'Aqabah-bound shipping is being  checked under Security Council Resolution 665, the diplomats  said consultations among member states of the council are  required, adding that these consultations are underway already  in New York.    The U.S. on Sunday reportedly communicated to Jordan its  formal acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace the  sea-inspection with land-based verifications through a letter  sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    The U.S. decision came few days after France decided to pull  out from the force enforcing the blockade on al-'Aqabah and  Canada reportedly rejected an American request that Canadians  replace the French in this task.    The Western diplomats said France saw no reason for the  continuation of the sea-inspection operations since the  Jordanian proposal provided a fitting alternative and found no  justification for Washington's procrastination in implementing  the proposal which was made by the Kingdom in January.    Jordan had earlier linked its participation in the peace  talks with the lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah which many  officials described as pressure on Jordan to force it into  entering a separate peace accord with Israel.    Informed sources say the U.S. Congress, which "has not yet  forgiven" the Kingdom for its opposition to the Gulf war  coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 and some U.S.  security agencies which "do not trust Jordan" have been behind  the delay in lifting the siege on al-'Aqabah.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani confirmed Tuesday that  the Jordanian government has received confirmation from the  concerned American authorities that Washington had approved the  Jordanian proposal.    He said the next steps were to reach a final agreement with  Lloyds Register to determined the methods of observing cargo  entering al-'Aqabah. This might be achieved within the coming  three weeks, he said.    Dr al-'Anani said that the representative of Lloyds Register  would not be inspecting ships, but will be monitoring incoming  cargo when they are opened at the port to make sure that they  conform to the cargo manifests.</p>

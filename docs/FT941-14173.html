			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Heady cocktail with lots of fizz / Unravelling the complex deal between Guinness and LVMH When yesterday's deal was an-nounced between the UK drinks giant Guinness and LVMH of France, the world's biggest luxury goods company, Guinness shares jumped 11 per cent and LVMH's fell 3.4 per cent. The deal, which involves sweeping changes in the cross-holdings between the two companies, is of authentically Gallic complexity. Peering through the fog, however, the markets evidently reckon Guinness has the best of it. It seems hard not to agree. For the past five years, the two companies have had matching holdings in each other, amounting latterly to 24 per cent apiece. At the outset, this was thought necessary to safeguard the network of joint ventures in wines and spirits the two were building around the globe. Latterly, the arrangement has become a distinct headache, for Guinness in particular. The trouble is that LVMH falls into two distinct halves: the Moet Hennessy drinks business, which owns a distinguished clutch of champagnes and cognacs, and the luxury goods side consisting of upmarket luggage and perfume. It never made sense for Guinness - a pure drinks company - to tie up cash as a passive shareholder in such a sprawling entity, save out of necessity. In addition, LVMH's boss, Mr Bernard Arnault, has shown signs lately of being more interested in luxury goods than drinks, and indeed of branching out into other areas such as newspapers. As a result, Guinness chairman Mr Tony Greener conceded yesterday, Guinness shareholders have been getting restive. 'It was clear that the existing arrangement did not make sense to Guinness shareholders,' he said. 'Guinness and LVMH are quite separate companies, with different strategic agendas. I'm not in any way denigrating perfume and luggage. They're wonderful businesses. They just don't happen to fit our long-term agenda.' Guinness is therefore swapping its 24 per cent stake in the whole of LVMH for 34 per cent of Moet Hennessy, plus Pounds 416m in cash. This has several distinct advantages. Under French law, any holding above 33.3 per cent carries certain blocking rights. Guinness will have the right of first refusal to buy LVMH's main drinks brands, such as Moet &amp; Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac. It will also have two directors on the Moet Hennessy board. The present arrangement is such an improvement that one wonders what was the point of the old one. Mr Greener - who took over as chairman at the start of last year - was at pains yesterday to justify the strategy of his predecessor, Sir Anthony Tennant. Five years ago, LVMH was the product of recent merger between Moet Hennessy and the Louis Vuitton luggage business. Mr Arnault had yet to appear on the scene, and the bosses of the two halves, Mr Alain Chevalier and Mr Henri Recamier, were at each other's throats. Guinness had already formed important joint ventures in drinks with LVMH, and the instability of the situation was plainly alarming. 'Anthony Tennant did the deal which was do-able and on the table,' Mr Greener said yesterday. 'In 1988-89, there was a real danger that LVMH would be broken up. There was a clear possibility that M Recamier would take the luggage side and sell off the wines and spirits. Who knows who might have ended up with them? It might very well have been one of our major competitors. That would have destroyed our joint ventures.' In addition, for Guinness to emerge suddenly as part-owner of brands as famous, as quintessentially French as Veuve Cliquot champagne or Hine cognac might have been a shock to Gallic sensibilities. One of the Guinness advisers said yesterday: 'I don't know if it's appreciated in London that the ability of a British company to get a direct holding in French brands of this quality is very rare.' Now, by contrast, Guinness has its money in precisely the bits of LVMH which suit it, and is locked into its all-important joint ventures still more tightly. At the same time, it collects Pounds 416m in cash, reducing its net debt from Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 1.4bn and its balance sheet gearing - the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds - from a slightly demanding 47 per cent to 37 per cent. Whatever Guinness proposes to do with the money, it will not raise its stake in Moet Hennessy further. Mr Greener said: 'We are not trying to achieve control of Moet Hennessy. It is a French company, with family origins and ongoing family ties, and better suited to being run by its existing management.' Given Moet Hennessy's recent recession-battered profits record, Guinness shareholders might be relieved to hear it. But Mr Greener was sanguine yesterday on that point as well. 'We are switching into Moet Hennessy at an interesting point in the economic cycle worldwide, with the potential of a recovery in cognac sales in Japan and the champagne cycle turning positive.' Across the Channel, the picture is much more complex and a good deal less cheerful. As the accompanying diagram shows, Mr Arnault's empire has a typically French 'cascade' structure. In essence, yesterday's deal proposes that LVMH itself will receive a cash injection of some Pounds 1.3bn, while the parts of the empire further up the cascade will foot the bill. This works as follows. Guinness owns not LVMH equity, but shares in companies further up: Jacques Rober (a holding company formed for the purpose of the original deal) and the publicly quoted Christian Dior. These shares will be sold by Guinness for Pounds 1.323bn to different parts of the Arnault empire, but not to LVMH itself. At the same time, Guinness pays LVMH Pounds 902m for its stake in Moet Hennessy. Also, at some time between now and next summer LVMH has undertaken to sell at least 4 per cent of its Guinness holding, which at yesterday's price would fetch about Pounds 400m more. Thus LVMH ends up with a massive reduction in net debt - from an estimated FFr15bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to FFr4bn, according to industry observers. The money will also come in handy for expanding LVMH's activities in luxury goods, which already include perfume brands such as Givenchy, Louis Vuitton luggage and the various champagne and cognac brands. 'There will be opportunities in areas like cosmetics, fashion, luxury goods outlets or leatherware,' Mr Arnault said. But Mr Arnault played down further expansion in the depressed newspaper industry. The acquisition last year of the business dailies La Tribune and L'Agefi had been made for 'a modest sum' and 'had brought good results', said Mr Arnault. A substantial acquisition in the sector, however, such as Le Figaro, owned by Mr Robert Hersant, did not appear likely. More certain is the boost that yesterday's deals give Mr Arnault in strengthening his grip on his complex web of companies. 'Guinness's departure from Jacques Rober means that it is removed as a significant counterweight at the holding company level,' said Mr Piers Butler at Smith New Court, the broker. Unsurprisingly, Mr Arnault's shareholders are unhappy. The LVMH share price initially fell some 7 per cent yesterday. It then recovered half that, doubtless because of Mr Arnault's assurances that he is not turning into a press baron, plus the fact that, after all, it is LVMH that gets the cash. The real loser is Christian Dior, which will pay out FFr8.65bn to buy the bulk of the Guinness stake in Jacques Rober. It seems quite likely that Dior will have to ask its shareholders for cash to finance this. Dior's share price fell 7.7 per cent yesterday. Au Bon Marche, which will buy the 16.8 per cent in Dior held by Guinness, will pay FFr1.7bn (Pounds 190m), to be financed by debt. Finally, SEPB, Mr Arnault's non-quoted family company, will buy the remaining 6.65 per cent in Jacques Rober held by Guinness for FFr1.5bn. This all adds up to a shifting of debt around the group, a filling of LVMH's war chest, possible share dilution and bad news for Dior shareholders. Or so it seems at present. But these are early days in a complex game of chess. As one London drinks analyst mused yesterday: 'Before today, you would have said LVMH held all the cards. So what are we missing?'</p>

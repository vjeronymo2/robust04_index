			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Latin America Two names linked in financial markets with the Latin American debt crisis are joining forces to invest in companies in the region. Mr Nicholas Brady, the former US Treasury Secretary whose debt initiative helped to ease the crisis, is to head the new Washington-based company, Darby Overseas Investments. Mr Daniel Marx, a former debt negotiator for Argentina and until recently undersecretary of finance in Buenos Aires, will be managing director. According to Mr Hollis McLoughlin, a former aide to Mr Brady at the Treasury and a senior official at the new company, Darby hopes to avoid paying sky-high prices for Latin investments by seeking to back companies before they make it to the stock market. The fund, expected to have up to Dollars 100m at its disposal, will be private. Its investors include Mr Brady himself and Bechtel Enterprises, the finance and development arm of the big engineering group. Bechtel is a former shareholder of the Dillon Read investment bank, which Mr Brady headed before going to the Treasury. Dillon Read's current chairman, Mr John Birkelund, and Mr George Wiegers, a former managing director, are also backing the fund. China The Shenzhen stock exchange is halting all new listings. The authorities said they would be resumed 'according to the market situation'. Beijing has given approval for a total of Yn5.5bn (Dollars 632m) worth of new shares to be issued this year, slightly higher than last year. However, there is still a backlog of issues from last year waiting to be listed. Bogota Colombia has approved the sale of the government's majority stake in Corpavi, the housing and savings corporation. A presidential statement noted that about 42m shares will be sold at 789.37 pesos (96 cents) each. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

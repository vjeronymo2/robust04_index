			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BMW begins creating new management links with Rover Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the BMW management board, has taken over as chairman of the board of Rover Group, following the completion last week of the German carmaker's Pounds 800m takeover of the UK vehicle producer. Mr John Towers, previously Rover group managing director, has been appointed chief executive. The company said the remaining Rover directors had all been confirmed in their positions. Mr Pischetsrieder said BMW was committed to maintaining Rover as a separately managed British company. Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW research and development director, said in an interview that BMW intended to set up joint committees between the two groups in the key areas of research and development, sales and purchasing. Initially the most intense discussions have taken place over Rover's long-term product plan with key decisions to be taken over a replacement strategy both for Rover's Mini and its 800 executive car. BMW is also preparing for its negotiations with Honda over changes the Japanese carmaker is seeking in the terms and conditions of its various licensing deals with Rover. Mr Reitzle said that BMW was still interested in long-term collaboration with Honda for key components for front-wheel drive cars. 'At BMW we do not have frontwheel drive components, and it would be very expensive for Rover to develop these on its own,' he said.</p>

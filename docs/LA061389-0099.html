			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A.'S ETHICS PANEL URGED TO COVER GAPS IN STATE'S SYSTEM  </P> <P> The architect of the state's Political Reform Act, saying that California's key  political watchdog agency conducts almost no investigations of city officials  unless it is tipped off by the press or receives a complaint, Monday  recommended that the city's Ethics Commission consider creating a local entity  to fill the void.  </P> <P> Robert M. Stern, general counsel for the California Commission on Campaign  Financing, also recommended that the Ethics Commission explore a law to allow  random audits of city officials' complete financial holdings, including their  checking and savings accounts.  </P> <P> Stern said that because the state Fair Political Practices Commission must  review thousands of economic disclosure forms submitted by state, county and  city officials, it does not have the staff to "look . . . for substantive  problems, for thin ice" except among state officials.  </P> <P> Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the FPPC, confirmed that because the agency  receives 15,000 disclosure forms from statewide officials and officials of 58  counties and more than 400 cities each year, it must rely in large part upon  complaints from individuals and upon news stories to ferret out wrongdoing  among local officials.  </P> <P> "It would be a monumental task to review everything that's filed with us," she  said. Although disclosure forms submitted by state officials are reviewed in  detail, reports from local officials are reviewed only to determine if they  were properly completed, she said.  </P> <P> Stern spoke Monday morning before the city Ethics Commission, which is  appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and is charged with writing a new political  ethics code for Los Angeles. Stern was joined by Melvin Cooper, director of  Alabama's Ethics Commission, who is considered an expert in political ethics  legislation.  </P> <P> Geoffrey Cowan, chairman of the seven-member city panel, said he expects the  group to complete a rough draft of the new code in October. Cowan said he and  other panel members, including Archbishop Roger Mahony, Rabbi Allen Freehling,  Los Angeles County Bar Assn. President Margaret Morrow and other civic leaders,  will continue their work independently of the City Council, which plans to  consider its own package of reforms in mid-summer.  </P> <P> Cowan said that among the questions being investigated by his commission are  how to relax a state law that severely restricts the ability of the city to  name a special prosecutor to investigate corruption and how to ensure that city  lobbyists are more closely monitored.  </P> <P> Both Stern and Cooper urged the Ethics Commission to consider a plan to require  more detailed reports on the personal investments of public officials.  </P> <P> Under state law, city officials currently are allowed to report stock and other  holdings in broad categories of $1,000 to $10,000, $10,001 to 100,000, and  $100,000 and up. The $100,000-and-up category, in particular, prevents the  public from understanding the true level of a politician's holdings. Stern said  he would like to see categories created "for over $500,000 and over $1 million"  in order to correct that problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Holdings  </P> <P> Stern also said, however, that too much effort is spent requiring politicians  to report small holdings in large corporations over which they hold little or  no sway.  </P> <P> He said he would like to see "less emphasis on reporting what you hold in large  corporations like IBM, and maybe the threshold there can be increased" to  require only the reporting of holdings worth at least $10,000.  </P> <P> Cooper told the Ethics Commission that its prime objective should be to ensure  that the laws it recommends have enough teeth to "increase the confidence of  the public in the integrity of government officials."  </P> <P> In Alabama, he noted, any public employee making $25,000 or more must file an  economic disclosure form. Moreover, all public officials are barred from  accepting gifts or honorariums. Neither of those regulations exists in  California.  </P></p>

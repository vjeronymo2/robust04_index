			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Double tax on back pay I WORK FOR a regional health board and recently won an appeal to have my pay grade raised from grade G to grade H. The appeal took five years to resolve. In consequence, I received back money for the whole time in a single lump sum. Because of this single payment, l have estimated that my total gross earnings for the tax year ending March 31 1994 will be well over the 40 per cent tax band. This is a ridiculous state of affairs which is going to cost me over Pounds 1,000 in extra tax. If the money had been paid in the year in which it was earned, I would never have approached the higher tax band. This seems to be unfair to me. Surprisingly, the tax office also thinks it is unfair but says its hands are tied and can do nothing about it. Is there any way I can avoid paying this extra tax? Under the penal provisions of section 38 of the Finance Act 1989, the back pay for the period up to April 5 1989 is taxable twice: both for the tax year (ended April 5) in which it was earned and for the tax year in which it was actually paid. So, the combined tax rate could be 65 per cent (25 per cent for 1988-89 plus 40 per cent for 1993-94) plus national insurance. We suggest you write to your MP, inviting him/her to ask the chancellor to amend section 38 of the 1989 act so as to give some relief from the full double taxation of back pay which his predecessor decided upon (with the approval of the House of Commons) 4 1/2 years ago. You should also write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, for SP1/92 (Directors' and employees' emoluments: extension of time limits for relief on transition to receipts basis of assessment), although we are sorry to say it might depress you. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

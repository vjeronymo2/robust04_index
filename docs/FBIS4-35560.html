			<p>BFN     [Text] [Iraqi] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf  met in Cairo yesterday with Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs  Mohamed Salah Dembri. The foreign minister briefed the Algerian  minister on the positive atmosphere and stands that have emerged  on the part of most of the members of the Security Council, thus  confirming Iraq's sound position and its call on the council to  fulfill its obligations in Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, after  Iraq has fulfilled all its international obligations toward it.    They also discussed issues related to joint Arab action and  Arab developments, in addition to relations between Iraq and  Algeria.    Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf also met with  Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Jasim Bin-Hamd Al Thani. He  briefed him on Iraqi ties with the United Nations and the UN  Special Commission, and the fact that there is now a large  circle calling for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq,  represented in some Security Council members and the  international community in general.    During the meeting, they discussed brotherly relations  between the two countries.    During the two meetings, the Algerian and Qatari foreign  ministers reiterated their countries' constant position calling  for lifting the blockade on the Iraqi people, especially since  Iraq has implemented its obligations per Security Council  Resolution 687 and cooperated fully with the Security Council  and the Special Commission.    Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf is currently  visiting Cairo to attend the meetings of the foreign ministers  of the Non-Aligned Movement.    The foreign minister also met in Cairo with the foreign  minister of Rwanda who reviewed the motives for foreign --  especially U.S. -- intervention in his country.    The Rwandan foreign minister said the United States seeks to  impose its hegemony on Rwanda and appoint its agents in the  region as part of a plan to strike at international liberation  movements and use force to impose a fait accompli in  contradiction to the aspirations of nations.    The foreign minister briefed his Rwandan counterpart on  Iraq's efforts at the Security Council to have the unjust  blockade lifted and on the positive indications that started to  emerge within the council.    The Rwandan foreign minister praised Iraq's principled stand  in the face of U.S. hegemony and its resistance to all kinds of  aggression, as well as its people's steadfastness in the face of  the unjust blockade.    The Republic of Rwanda is a member of the Security Council  in  its current session. It had called for lifting the Iraq  blockade at the council.</p>

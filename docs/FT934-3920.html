			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / People: Engineering Employers Federation Neil Johnson (right), who left the Engineering Employers Federation last month after a whirlwind 15 months as director-general, has wasted no time lining up a new career. He has been appointed general secretary of the Royal Automobile Club, the motoring organisation, from February 1, in succession to Michael Limb, who is to retire the day before after 26 years with the RAC. Johnson was expected to be in demand after leaving the EEF, but his move to the RAC comes as a surprise - many had thought he would return to the motor industry. Before joining the EEF in the summer of 1992, Johnson was a senior executive at Rover Group, and has spent his entire working career in the industry apart from military service. Jeffrey Rose, RAC chairman, says the organisation has been particularly fortunate in its general secretaries from the time of its first one, Claude Johnson, in 1897. Limb became general secretary in 1978, and steered the RAC through its subsequent restructuring.</p>

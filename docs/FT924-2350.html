			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Fashion: If you're still looking . . . WELL, here we are, with less than two weeks to Christmas and you still haven't found anything for she who is nearest and dearest. Do not despair. So dire has the retail scene been this year that several of the most seductive small shops have reduced prices enormously. So, for those still looking, try these suggestions. Oliver Sweeney's carpet slippers, strictly for lounge lizards, come in wonderful fabrics: dark black ottoman, black or cream background florals, or a brocade with an oval motif. Made-to-measure, they usually take four weeks; but at 4th Floor Hairdressers, 4 Northington Street, London WC1 (tel: 071-405-6011), there are several pairs at Pounds 125. Lucienne Phillips, a retailer of legendary chic, has declared an unprecedented sale at her shop at 89 Knightsbridge, London SW1. Almost everything is reduced by between 50-75 per cent including much of Jean Muir's Studio Collection, which is half-price. This means that a wool crepe short-sleeved dress and jacket in a gorgeous array of colours now sells for Pounds 220 instead of Pounds 550. There are lots of Arabella Pollen's snappy jackets and pieces by designers such as Victor Edelstein, Tomasz Starzewski and Amanda Wakely as well as Harriet Anstruthers' beautiful, big, square silk scarves; Suzanne Katkhuda's ceramic jewellery; and some very glitzy little bags by Stephanie Wood. Anything from Browns of 23-27 South Molton Street, London SW1, has cachet. At the cheaper end, there are Pierre Mantoux cotton tights in gorgeous colours at Pounds 15 a pair; Browns' own simple, crisp, white cotton shirts at Pounds 20; and jewellery from names such as Sonia Rykiel and Eric Beamon, which starts at Pounds 30. Higher up the price bracket is a Donna Karan pure cotton body at Pounds 50. For Pounds 90, there are Gigli ruffled shirts in white, soft sage green and deep plums, while for Pounds 225 you could get a pair of Browns' own leather jeans. Fenwick of Bond Street is always a wonderful source of inexpensive but bang up-to-the-minute accessories. Look out for leopard print scarves at Pounds 39.95; for hot pink, red or royal blue suede gloves at Pounds 14.95 a pair; or for a Moschino bag at Pounds 39.95.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Personal View: Better deal for personal pensions This year's budget is expected to introduce greater flexibility over when people with personal pensions in the UK must buy an annuity, probably by allowing them to postpone the purchase until the age of 75 rather than on retirement. It would be better to remove the obligation to buy an annuity altogether. This would transform personal pensions into a flexible savings vehicle for retirement, similar to the American individual retirement account, and would give people greater choice. Whether an annuity is an appropriate investment for an individual depends on factors that are impossible to forecast: how long a person will live, the rate of inflation, and the future performance of investment portfolios. The income from an annuity is initially greater than the income from a conventional portfolio. This reflects actuarial assumptions about mortality rates and the use of capital. In effect, early deaths finance higher initial benefits. Inflation, however, erodes the real value of an annuity. The cost of indexing an annuity is expensive. Even if prices are stable, economic growth and rising returns on equities mean that, over 10 to 15 years, the return on an investment portfolio will overtake the income from an annuity. The combination of inflation and economic growth has a lethal effect on the relative attraction of opting for an annuity. But under present pension rules, you do not have a choice - you have to buy an annuity. Also, you have no control over the capital and an annuity dies with you. There is nothing left for your heirs. If you live a long time, you benefit from the flow of annuity payments, but you will not be able to dispose of capital before or after your death. This does immense damage to the dignity and independence of very elderly people. The official rationale for the annuity rule is threefold. First, the Inland Revenue is anxious to tax the capital sum. This is reasonable, given that it is accumulated tax free. The principal reason for retaining the annuity rule at 75 appears to be the Revenue's tax concerns. The Revenue is familiar with taxing annuities; it has had virtually 200 years' experience of doing so. It is possible to find alternative arrangements to tax the accumulated sum without obliging people to buy an annuity. Excess pension contributions are already, for example, taxed at 35 per cent. The second reason for the annuity rule is the social security department's concern that people who have received tax relief should not be in a position to 'blow' the accumulated capital and end up on income support. Obliging people to take an annuity prevents that from happening. But this concern can be resolved by requiring people to retain sufficient capital in a segregated account to generate enough income to keep them off income support. The annuity rule is not necessary. The proposals in Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley's pensions white paper demonstrate that it is irrelevant. This is because people will be allowed to defer the annuity until they are 75, but will only be able to take out an annual income equivalent to that of an annuity. The third justification, however, is that an annuity is the only way of guaranteeing someone an income until death. This is based on the premise that, even where individuals make seemingly adequate provision to support themselves through an investment portfolio, the returns may prove erratic. This argument ignores problems such as credit risk, timing and the level of interest rates that attach to annuities. It also neglects the impact of inflation, which can result in a person who lives for a long time ending up needing income support anyway. Someone in their 90s, for example, who retired with an annuity equivalent to male average earnings - a remarkable achievement, given that pensions are only normally expected to provide around two-thirds of final salary - would now be living on the princely sum of Pounds 1,000 a year. The Revenue's instinct is that there is something wrong with people having the freedom to choose how to invest funds that have been accumulated in a tax-privileged form. Instead, they ought to do what the Revenue thinks best and finds most convenient. It is a profoundly collectivist reflex. Like all collectivist approaches, it has the effect of impoverishing the people it is intended to assist and, by depriving them of control over their capital, it contributes to a lack of dignity and independence in old age. The chancellor and the secretary of state for social security should go the whole hog and end this iniquitous actuaries' tontine.

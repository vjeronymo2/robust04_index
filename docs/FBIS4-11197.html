			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Armando Calderon Sol, ARENA, Nationalist </F> Republican Alliance, presidential candidate, and Enrique Borgo  Bustamante, vice presidential candidate, with unidentified  reporters at the Hotel Presidente in San Salvador -- live]    [Text] [Calderon] Thanks very much, gentlemen of the media.  First I want to thank [words indistinct] the huge challenge that  is the [word indistinct] challenge of my life. I want to thank  Salvadorans and tell them that we will not let them down in the  historic challenge of bringing the nation closer every day to  achieve the social peace that will help consolidate peace,  democracy, freedom, and justice in El Salvador. We [words  indistinct] of this clear and [word indistinct] Salvadorans have  bestowed upon us in these historic elections. We commit  ourselves to serve all Salvadorans. We want to thank ARENA's  rank and file, our supporters, all our collaborators, and the  thousands and thousands of volunteers nationwide who worked hard  for this civic event and made possible this great and  extraordinary victory, this victory for Salvadorans, this  victory for all.    I want to thank and congratulate our opponent, Dr. Ruben  Zamora, who has already publicly acknowledged our victory, thus  showing political stature and refinement. I want to thank him  for his acknowledgement and also to assure our political  adversaries that we will govern for all Salvadorans. I want our  adversaries to be confident from now on that we the  president-elect and vice president-elect will govern for all  Salvadorans. We believe our great task, our great mission is to  consolidate peace, ensure political stability, and make El  Salvador a better country for all Salvadorans. We will seek  better standards of living for thousands and thousands of  Salvadorans who need human progress and development. We must  face the problems of underdevelopment and poverty together. I  would like to thank you all for this news coverage and the way  you have followed the Salvadoran democratic process. I  reiterate: Long live El Salvador! This victory belongs to El  Salvador and its democratic system, which is growing stronger  every day. I would like to tell all Salvadorans that we are  going to work hand in hand with you for the next five years. I  thank you all very much.    [Borgo] First we would like to express our gratitude to all  those Salvadoran brothers who trusted us and placed an enormous  responsibility in our hands. Among those people, I would like  to give special thanks to the ARENA members [words indistinct]  and all those Salvadorans who voted for us. We must now ask God  for help to attain the goals we have set and for strength to  work for the Salvadoran people. I would like to thank the media  [words indistinct], which has given us coverage throughout the  presidential campaign. We hope you can project the true image  of what we Salvadorans are all about: A nation which loves  democracy and freedom and is convinced that the only road to  progress is through social peace.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] As you know, we do not have any official results  from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. Our computer center  shows a significant trend. We would rather not give any figures  at this time because the TSE has not approved them. We do know  that this is a stunning and undeniable victory with a difference  of more than two to one. I believe, however, that the TSE must  report the numbers, because ours are not official. It would be  better to wait for the TSE's official information. Our  democracy guarantees participation for Ruben Zamora and the  opposition forces. A specific and significant portion of the  Salvadoran population has trusted them and given them an  unquestionable political place in the Legislative Assembly  [words indistinct]. In our democratic life, we seek  participation for everyone. We seek the right degree of  consensus and acceptance. We seek agreement. Parliamentary  debate is precisely that. The government will respect and  encourage participation. It will listen to whatever proposals a  constructive opposition can offer. We are sure that this is the  way it will work, and we are sure all Salvadorans will have a  say in the country's future.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] We will deal with poverty as it has been dealt  with so far, with a series of social programs that we have  already defined in our government plan. I think it would take  too long to get into that matter during this news conference.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Borgo] Our government will be made up of Salvadorans who  love El Salvador and who have the capability and honesty to  occupy a public post efficiently to bring the country forward.  When we start putting our government team together, I am sure  we will seek out the most capable people so we can face the  country's problems together as a real team. There will be a  truly effective combination of specialists and politicians. I  believe we have the enormous responsibility to find the most  capable individuals in our society.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] We have a commitment and a mandate to form an  ARENA administration. That does not mean the administration  wants to exclude the opposition. They have a specific role in  the democratic system. [words indistinct]    My first step will be to ensure [words indistinct] of the  peace agreements, which constitute a national commitment, a  commitment by all organizations that guarantee peace and  security in the country. That is why as president-elect I will  go to New York to meet with the UN secretary general to ensure  that the future of the peace agreements and the country's  political stability [words indistinct]. I want to dedicate our  victory to Salvadorans, because it is a victory for El Salvador.  This victory commits us to God, and we ask him to give us  humility; humility in our triumph, strength, sovereignty, and  wisdom in this difficult struggle that awaits us in the coming  five years. Our mission will be to improve the standard of  living for Salvadorans. I offer this victory to Salvadorans  because it belongs to them. It is a victory for all  Salvadorans. We believe this election will serve as an historic  example in the life of a nation that perseveres.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] Political, labor, and social forces and  productive  small and intermediate business sectors joined in these run-off  elections. I would say that, on the contrary, these run-off  elections strengthened our party.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] Our commitment to the nation will be to keep  [word  indistinct] and to comply with the peace agreements.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] I believe [words indistinct] the acceptance of  governability. I am confident that with my untiring effort --  because I will not stop -- we will achieve better levels of  development, progress, and social stability for Salvadorans. We  will achieve the objectives you mentioned. That will be the  greatest satisfaction of my life; to have accomplished the  mission with which Salvadorans have entrusted me.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] [Words indistinct] won a political place in El  Salvador. This has been confirmed by the peace agreements  [words indistinct]. We Salvadorans have achieved peace [words  indistinct]. Now we must achieve social peace, the  reorganization and development of our motherland. This is a  huge and profound challenge that involves not just me but all  Salvadorans.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Calderon] It is a commitment, especially for all Central  Americans, to work and strive for regional integration. We  will use our work and willingness to seek greater levels of  integration, not only in economic aspects but also in political  and social aspects. Central America is one, and we will  translate our will as Salvadorans -- a unified people -- into  doing all we can to work toward true integration, especially in  Central America.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] We are willing to negotiate. We are willing to  seek the truth, regardless of who is affected. We will strictly  apply the law and seek to strengthen [words indistinct], whoever  it might be -- the joint commission or any other group -- in  search of any solution to implement the law. We will be there  because only then will we achieve justice and have the nation we  all want. This is the only way we can gradually consolidate the  state of law we all want in El Salvador.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] Look, there is no reason for anyone to point  fingers at me. I am sure of all of my actions and I know my  political career is a true example, which is why the Salvadoran  people have given me their support and their trust on this  wonderful day. Today the entire Salvadoran nation has seen,  spoken to, and trusted this humble servant of yours. I think  this is a reward for my continuing efforts on the political  scene.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] There is only one ARENA project. I also believe  there are valuable people in the government already, and I will  surely take some of the present government's people into  account. They will be the most capable people; those who can  contribute the most to the country and the project.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] I believe the political campaign is over now. We  must enforce the law and consolidate the state of law in El  Salvador. Separating the powers of state will help guarantee  that. We will have a judicial branch, which we already have. We  have a legislative branch, the first authority, and an executive  branch.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Calderon] We have an appointment in New York on 15 May  before the inauguration ceremonies, when we will meet with  [words indistinct].    [Announcer] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol and Vice  President-elect Enrique Borgo Bustamante have concluded their  news conference.</p>

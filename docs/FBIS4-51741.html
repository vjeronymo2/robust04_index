			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was  held in Pyongyang today in celebration of May Day, the  international holiday of the world workers.    Present at the meeting were Vice-president Yi Chong-ok and  Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, Politburo  members of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of  Korea [WPK], and other senior party and government officials.    Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, made the  report under the title "Let Us Powerfully Promote the  Revolutionary Cause of the Working Class, the Cause of  Socialism, Under the Banner of Independence Against Imperialism."    The more than a century long period since the working class  began celebrating the militant holiday demonstrating its  international solidarity and united strength has been a history  of a righteous struggle waged by the world working class  strenuously for the freedom and liberation of the maltreated  proletarian masses against the imperialist reactionary forces  under the banner of unity, and its brilliant victory, the  reporter said.    He quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying:    "Unity is the mightiest weapon of the working class. Since  its first days in the arena of history, the working class has  always regarded unity as its most precious weapon in the  struggle against international capital, and on the strength of  unity it has won formidable struggles."    The reporter continued:    In some countries in recent years socialism which had been  defended and developed for tens of years suffered a setback and  capitalism has been restored. Taking advantage of this abnormal  situation, the imperialists and reactionaries vilify the idea of  socialism, the idea of the working class, itself as wrong,  claiming that socialism has met its "end." But this is no more  than a reactionary sophism of the foes of socialism and its  renegades.    Drawing attention to the widespread movement for the revival  of socialism in the countries where it has suffered a setback,  the reporter said:    If the working class of all countries of the world is to  defend the cause of socialism and promote it, it must constantly  strengthen the driving force of the revolution with a correct  guiding idea and must resolutely uphold the principles of  socialism and strengthen solidarity based on independence.    The whole course of our revolution, the reporter declared,  has been a history of brilliant victory in which the independent  driving force of revolution has been reinforced under the  guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the  revolution has made a long drive in reliance upon its might.    In our country, today, the revolutionary cause of chuche  pioneered by the great leader is being successfully carried  forward and developed with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  possessed of the personality and traits as the leader of the  working class and the leader of the people, acclaimed at the  head of the party, the state and the Army, the reporter stressed.    The experience of our revolution in powerfully advancing the  cause of socialism under an extraordinarily difficult  international environment, he continued, proves that the  independence and sovereignty of each country can be defended,  imperialism can be defeated with united international  revolutionary forces and a peaceful and prosperous new world of  independence can certainly be built, when the working class of  all lands closely unite under the revolutionary banner of  independence against imperialism and wage a common struggle,  supporting and cooperating with each other.    Pointing out that the imperialists and the reactionary  forces  are becoming all the more feverish in their campaign to stifle  the revolutionary cause of the working class, the cause of  socialism, and they are directing the sharp edge of their attack  to the DPRK, the bastion of socialism, in particular, the  reporter continued:    The U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries  are  desperately trying to isolate and stifle our Republic and  destroy Korean-style socialism under the pretext of "nuclear  issue". But, if they think they can "subdue" us by pressure or  threat, it is an anachronistic dream.    Our dignified people will never beg for peace, however dear  it may be to them. They are fully prepared to answer war with  war, and dialogue with dialogue.    We have the wise guidance of the great leader and Comrade  Kim  Chong-il, the respected supreme commander, the harmonious whole  of the leader, the party and the masses and the  a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Armed Forces which can  defeat any formidable enemy at one stroke and a powerful  independent economy.    Our working class and the people will never tolerate our  national dignity and sovereignty being encroached upon.    If the enemy dare pounce upon us, the whole country will  become a bomb and give death to the enemy.    The working class and people of all countries must firmly  unite and join hands in their struggle under the revolutionary  banner of independence against imperialism when the imperialists  and the reactionaries are viciously working to violate the  independence of the popular masses and stifle the socialist  cause by an allied force. Only then can they frustrate the  interventionist and aggressive moves of the imperialists and  successfully accomplish the cause of global independence.    Our party and people will as ever constantly develop the  bonds of comradely unity and international solidarity with the  progressive people of the world on the basis of the idea of  independence, equality and socialism, remaining faithful to the  idea of independence, peace and friendship, thus making an  active contribution to the common cause of mankind to put an end  to imperialist domination and interference and defend and  advance the cause of socialism, declared Kim Chung-nin.    A letter to the workers all over the world was adopted at  the  meeting.    It called upon the workers all over the world to fight  vigorously to democratize the international community and  establish a new equitable international economic order against  the old politics of domination and subjugation on the part of  imperialists.    It appealed to the workers and trade unions worldwide to  form  a broader anti-imperialist joint action front and push ahead  forcefully with the cause of independence of mankind under the  slogan "Workers of the world advocating independence, unite!"    An appeal to the South Korean workers was adopted at the  meeting.    The appeal expressed the conviction that the South Korean  workers will more daringly fight to check and frustrate the new  war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges  through a valiant anti-war, anti-nuke struggle and accelerate  the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in  order to regain their democratic rights and vital rights.</p>

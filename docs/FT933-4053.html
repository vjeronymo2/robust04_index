			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television It would, I suppose, be too much to expect the broadcasters to tag half a dozen of tonight's programmes with a little logo saying 'Old Series' yet that would make at least as much sense as the logo saying 'New Series' which is applied to such vintage titles as Tomorrow's World which is in its 29th year. Tonight's subjects include the training of fire fighters in a mock-up of a burning airliner (7.30 BBC1). That is followed by the 'new' series Bruce Forsyth's Generation Game which is in its 23rd year. When Brucey says 'Nice to see you, to see you. . . .' millions of viewers will growl 'Nice', and most will declare 'Cuddly toy' before he does when the time comes to recall the prizes on the conveyor belt (8.00 BBC1). Other series returning tonight include the ITV game show Family Fortunes, (7.00) and Channel 4's series about education, Class Action (8.00). The oddest and perhaps most promising programme of the day is Feed (11.55 BBC2). It consists of unguarded moments recorded in television studios during the 1992 New Hampshire US presidential primary.</p>

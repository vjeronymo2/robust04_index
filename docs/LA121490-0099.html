			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FILM-FEST SHENANIGANS IN 'SCREENINGS'  </P> <P> Anyone who has ever attended or participated in a film festival should  experience smiles and chuckles of recognition upon seeing the sly, sharply  observant Italian comedy "Private Screenings," which opens today at the Monica  4-Plex with, aptly enough, a private screening sponsored by That's Sicily, a  tourism organization which is distributing the film. (Regular runs start  Saturday.)  </P> <P> "Private Screenings" is the work of three young filmmakers, Ninni Bruschetta,  Francesco Calogero and Donald Ranvaud, who really know the chaotic  film-festival territory. They don't miss a thing: temperamental stars, prints  that don't arrive, snooty discos that cash in on the festival, fatuous press  conferences, pretentious directors, pushy critics, self-important festival  officials, aggressive paparazzi, sexual shenanigans, and the constant babble of  many languages.  </P> <P> Apparently, the filmmakers (all of whom do double duty as actors) shot a good  deal of their footage while a recent edition of the Taormina Film Festival was  in progress. (There are cameos by Cyd Charisse, a gracious festival honoree,  director Bob Swaim and producer Chris Sievernich).  </P> <P> Amid a thicket of characters and subplots two young waiters, Carlo (Bruschetta)  and Ettore (Antonio Caldarella), emerge as the film's central figures when  they're seduced into signing on as festival gofers with promises of glamour and  excitement. The film opens, not at the beautiful, cliffhanging village of  Taormina, but on the Portuguese coast, where an arty new screen version of  Goethe's "Faust" is shooting. A starlet (Jessica Forde) appearing in it leaves  for Taormina where she has the promise of a job from a fat, sleazy producer  named Petronius (Peter Berling).  </P> <P> Fortunately, "Private Screenings" (Times-rated Mature for complex narrative,  adult themes) is sufficiently amusing to overcome a poor 16mm print with even  worse sound. The filmmakers shoot from the hip, pile on the complications and  keep things moving briskly. For all their satire, they nevertheless love and  revere the cinema, as an homage to Fassbinder, via some clips from "Veronika  Voss," suggests.  </P></p>

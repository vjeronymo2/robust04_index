			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLISH REPORTER ESCAPES DEATH IN WARSAW FIRE  </P> <P> A Polish investigative journalist who received death threats after writing  articles about the secret police narrowly escaped from a mysterious fire Sunday  that killed his wife, his newspaper said.  </P> <P> A spokesman at Gazeta Wyborcza, the Solidarity union daily, said Jerzy  Jachowicz's wife was killed and his 15-year-old daughter badly injured when all  three leaped from their second-floor apartment to escape the fire.  </P> <P> The spokesman said that Jachowicz, who was in shock, blames arsonists for the  fire at his home near Warsaw. But police authorities said they suspect the fire  was caused by an electrical fault.  </P> <P> Jachowicz, one of the few investigative journalists in Poland, has written  several articles about the Interior Ministry and the secret police. One of his  reports was considered instrumental in the disbanding earlier this year of a  paramilitary group consisting of former police officers.  </P></p>

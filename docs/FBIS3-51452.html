The head of the DAS [Administrative Department of Security],  Fernando Brito Ruiz, yesterday revealed the start of an  ambitious plan to incorporate those ex-rebels into rural DAS  units all over Colombia.    The official said yesterday that they have reached an  agreement with organizations of former rebels all over Colombia,  which clearly establishes the commitment that the ex-guerrillas  will now have to the state and this investigation organization.    Former combatants will be given highly specialized training  covering investigation, law, and democracy before being assigned  to rural DAS units all over Colombia.    The program is based on the knowledge of these areas that  the  former rebels acquired during their antigovernment activities.    DAS sources said the program is designed to boost  effectiveness in obtaining information, which should generate  better results in the fight against subversive groups.    "We are being very careful," said Brito, "about giving them  good training and maintaining good control. The status of their  activities and the responsibility of each of these men must be  very clear."    The official also said that leaders of the demobilized  groups  have made direct commitments to the DAS about supervising the  activities of these new rural detectives.    The DAS said the leaders will monitor the situation of each  of the former rebels, and said that "when a situation arises  that is not very clear, they will bring it to the attention of  the government or of the organization."    Brito also said that at the present time 150 former  guerrillas who have been demobilized are working to protect  their own leaders. These men were trained by the DAS for this  program.    The DAS director stated: "Now we are going to begin a rural  security program that we will implement through a reasonable  process of explanation, training, and evaluation of the  aptitudes of the ex-rebels."    These men will be subjected to intensive counterintelligence  scrutiny in order to minimize the risks of infiltration by  subversive organizations operating in Colombia.</p>

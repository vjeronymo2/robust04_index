			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Argentine privatisation by stealth - The flotation of YPF, the national oil group THE privatisation of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's national oil company, gets underway early next year. Bit by bit, the group will be floated on local and international equity markets with the aim of eliminating the federal government's shareholding. A start will be made in January with the sale of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in New York and London, together with straight equity in Buenos Aires. Eventually these tranches, amounting to 51 per cent of YPF, are expected to raise around Dollars 4bn. Rather than place the shares on the market at one go, the government plans to ration the flotation over a number of tranches. The rest of YPF will be held by employees with 10 per cent and provincial governments with 39 per cent. However, the government has yet to get parliamentary approval for the sale. The government submitted a bill in November, expecting it to sail through Congress. But senators want the state to retain a minority stake in YPF. Mr Jose Estenssoro, the YPF president who spent most of his career in the private-sector oil industry, says his ultimate aim is to slim down YPF into an integrated, well-balanced oil company with annual assets of Dollars 8bn. His reform plan was drawn up together with McKinsey and Arthur D. Little, the US management consultants. This calls for drastic reshaping of YPF. He says: 'I am downsizing the company by cutting away all the fat.' Eventually the workforce will be reduced to 12,000 from 52,000 in 1990. The group has already raised Dollars 1.53bn from asset sales, mainly the disposal of stakes in oilfields. Other assets earmarked for sale include pipeline networks and a tanker fleet. YPF's financial performance is beginning to improve. It estimates 1991 sales at Dollars 5bn, which would be an increase of around 20 per cent on 1990, and says profits for last year should emerge at more than Dollars 300m. In the four months to April, YPF's share of national oil output fell to 59 per cent, or 5.93m cubic metres. Two years ago, it produced 97 per cent of Argentina's oil. Mr Estenssoro says new management and control systems should be implemented and operational by January, 1993 and restructuring should be at least 70 to 80 per cent complete by 1993. This, he says, should leave the ground well preparted for the first international issue of shares in YPF.</p>

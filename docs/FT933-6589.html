			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie at peak as US buyers return LONDON stocks were quick to follow the lead from across the Atlantic yesterday and, encouraged also by optimism in Germany ahead of this morning's meeting at the Bundesbank, the FT-SE 100 Index rose nearly 30 points to a new closing peak of 3,079.2. US buyers appeared again in strength towards the London close, when Wall Street was extending its move into record territory and the US dollar was moving higher. They picked up shares in the leading oil and pharmaceutical companies, as well as, more selectively, across the broader range of the London market. Impressed by predictions from leading banking economists in Germany that the Bundesbank will cut its key discount rate today, UK analysts sounded more confident on the timing of rate cuts in Europe. The mood in London was summed up by one leading strategist who commented yesterday: 'If they (the Bundesbank) do not act today, they will sooner or later, so the timing is not so compellingly significant.' Dealers stressed that the chief impetus behind the renewed advance in equities had been the reappearance of the US buyers who helped drive the Footsie above the 3,000 mark two weeks ago. Heavy sales of mutual funds in the US, with particular success for funds aimed at investment in the UK and other European stock markets, have underpinned confidence that US investors are returning to equity investment in strength. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also rose to a new peak yesterday, gaining 21.4 to 3,495.6. The strong rise in the UK stock market's two most widely quoted measuring rods was also underlined by high trading volume in equities, with non-Footsie stocks making up around 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 731.8m shares. On Tuesday, Seaq volume of 539.4m shares represented Pounds 1.25bn in retail, or customer, business, a return to the average daily totals established over the past twelve months. Equities opened higher on the back of Wall Street's move overnight to an all-time peak and found additional encouragement from increased activity in the derivatives market. At the day's best, the Footsie reached 3,081.8, within 8 points of the intra day peak reached on Aug 19. Marketmakers again found themselves very short of stock because fund managers instantly cancelled any selling orders previously placed with stockbrokers. 'You dare not sell anything on a day like this because it will cost you dear to try and buy it back an hour later,' said one dealer. Pressures were particularly harsh in the oil share sector which bore the full weight of US buying and dollar pressures. Equity market market confidence brushed aside the widely-expected rights issue from MB-Caradon, which came in at Pounds 334m, and also a Pounds 500m Eurosterling bond from BT. Dealers ascribed the renewed advance in the market to a continuation of the same bullish arguments which have driven UK stocks ahead since the beginning of the month; a perception of low inflation, falling interest rates and a recovery, albeit slow, in the domestic economy. On this basis, London will pay close attention to Wall Street's performance overnight as well as to the outcome of today's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council.</p>

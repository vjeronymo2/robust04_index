			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- Architect of Russian reform  Yegor Gaydar and ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  have signalled the beginning of the presidential race over the  weekend thus marking two different poles in the campaign.    On Friday Gaydar announced the creation of a pro-Yeltsin  party -- the "Russia's Choice", while Zhirinovskiy was confirmed  as a presidential candidate by the congress of his Liberal  Democratic Party held on Saturday under the motto "LDPR to  Power".    Gaydar is representing the democratic-reformist movement,  while Zhirinovskiy -- the "neoimperial" one.    The space between them is occupied by all other politicians  -- moderate reformer Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, supporter of Russian  regions Sergey Shakhray, former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy  and communist Gennadiy Zyuganov.    However, Boris Yeltsin may himself join the race if he sees  no worthy successor. He said that in an interview to the  Spanish "EL PAIS" newspaper.    The outcome of the two-year long presidential race depends  mostly on the results of economic policy of the president and  the government. Gaydar clearly understands that and lists three  priorities of the economic programme -- tax reform, investments  into economy and legal guarantees of private property.    Zhirinovskiy's main ideas is to protect Russians in the CIS  and Slavs in the world at any cost, to restore Russian borders  of 1975 and create a one-party government. He complained that  Yeltsin is now dealing only with the Russia's Choice and ignores  the Liberal Democratic Party which came first in December  parliamentary elections.    It is not a secret that the president prefers the "Russia's  Choice" and this puts additional responsibility on the party.  It has to learn lessons from the last election campaign when it  lost to Zhirinovskiy despite all predictions of a landslide  victory.    Democrats then only limited themselves to general  discussions  on TV, but failed to create grass-root organisations across the  country and offer concrete economic measures to improve life.  It seems that Gaydar is well aware of the mistakes and realises  that hard everyday work is necessary to ensure success in 1996.</p>

This morning the government delegation held a  meeting, and the mediators met separately with the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] delegation in  yet another attempt to persuade them to change their stand,  which is distant from the mediators'proposal. The proposal,  which is called the master document, follows a study by the  observers on principles presented by each of the disputing sides.    In the afternoon the sides held a face-to-face meeting which  resulted in all doubts on general principles being dissipated.  The sides overcame the general principles and are getting ready  to attend the first debate on specific issues in the Mulungushi  Conference Center tomorrow. As we mentioned yesterday, the  master document contains about 12 points, five of which have  already been discussed. The remaining points concern the  police's judicial statute, that is, to whom the police are  answerable in future, to a civilian or a military court, as well  as the integration of UNITA elements in the police.    There are rumors that Chief Beye intends to hold a meeting  of  the military leadership of the two sides in Sao Tome and  Principe simultaneously with the Lusaka negotiating round, to  possibly set a date for the cease-fire. However, both the  government and UNITA reject the allegations on the supposed  meeting as it has already been agreed that the military  leadership's meeting will only be held 10 days after the signing  of a formal agreement by the current Lusaka negotiating round.

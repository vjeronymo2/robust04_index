			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila </F> Glazovskaya and Mikhail Kalmykov]    [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 28 April TASS -- Continuing his  state visit to Turkmenistan, French President Francois  Mitterrand said today that possessing huge oil and gas deposits,  Turkmnistan can maintain a strong position during talks with  French industrialists.    The topic concerning prospects of French-Turkmen business  cooperation in different spheres was raised during talks between  Francois Mitterrand and Turkmen leader Saparmurad Niyazov, as  well as at meetings of economists from both countries.    A large group of French industrialists, including  representatives from such internationally established firms and  banks as "Gas de France," "Thomson," and "Credit Commercial de  France" are also accompanying the French head of state. They  are not making a secret of their interest in joining large top  priority economic projects, which are being worked out by the  Turkmen Government, in their possibly early stage.    In turn, Turkmenistan, which strives to join world leaders  on  the international oil and gas market, sees in enhancing  cooperation with French enterprises an opportunity to modernize  the technical basis of this leading branch of its national  economy, and expedite the realization of the multi-billion gas  pipeline laying project which will supply Turkmen gas to Europe.    Such French industrial giants as "Elf Aquitaine,"  "Bouygues,"  and "Thomson" have already stuck firm roots in Turkmenistan.  Besides this, great hopes are being laid on French assistance  in the creation and development of modern infrastructure for  transport, modern communications and banking services.    Judging by all accounts, these hopes have a good base.  France, according to Francois Mitterrand, is already prepared  to earmark over 220 million francs as credits for these  purposes. A number of economic agreements, which, according to  Saparmurad Niyazov, must "provide a new impulse to the  Turkmen-French development," are planned to be signed at the end  of the talks today.</p>

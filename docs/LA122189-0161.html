The Drift River oil storage site, which handles crude oil production  from Cook Inlet and pumps oil onto tankers bound for the West Coast, was shut  down. Scientists said seismic monitors showed continued rumblings deep inside  the volcano, located 110 miles southwest of Anchorage. There was evidence that  molten material was boiling inside the mountain and could explode out of the  summit crater.  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities unable to maintain advance AN UNCERTAIN session in the UK stock market ended on a sour note yesterday when rumours of an impending political scandal checked London's response to the strong opening on Wall Street which had followed good news on US retail sales and producer prices. Earlier, the stock market rallied from a loss of 10.8 on the FT-SE Index, helped by a firm opening by stock index futures. Later, equities continued to steady as sterling responded favourably to satisfactory UK trade figures for the first quarter of the year, which showed a smaller than expected visible deficit on trade with the EC. But trading volume was moderate and London was still waiting with some caution for the important economic data on the US economy to be announced in Washington. The largely unchanged US producer price index, backed up by a comment from the US Commerce Secretary that increases in US interest rates were now not needed, sent Wall Street ahead by 11 Dow points in London hours. The Footsie tried to move upwards but failed to hold its best levels. At the close, the FT-SE Index was only 1.8 up at 2,861.8 and traders were asking themselves whether the market had enough strength to test the higher end of its trading range at around 2,880. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index eased by 4.8 to 3,202.9. Seaq volume fell to 528.8m shares from Thursday's 620.3m, which was worth Pounds 1.35bn in retail worth. Suggestions that a UK newspaper will next week publish a story of political corruption surfaced early in the stock market trading session and were greeted with some scepticism in a market not unaccustomed to Friday afternoon rumour-mongering. This week has seen a recovery of 31.9 points in the Footsie, largely on hopes that the new UK chancellor of the exchequer may sanction a cut in base rates, perhaps on Tuesday when he delivers his Mansion House speech to the City of London. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index has advanced to new peaks, closing last night nearly 1 per cent higher on the week. Government bonds moved narrowly yesterday, cautiously watching sterling's performance. At the close, longer dated bonds were a shade easier while Index-linked issues, the market's inflation hedge instruments, edged higher. The UK authorities announced the issue of a further Pounds 700m of its 8.75 per cent bond dated 2017.</p>

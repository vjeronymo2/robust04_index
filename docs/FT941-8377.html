			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Boulestin's last orders - Nicholas Lander says farewell to a restaurant It comes as a shock when you revisit the smart French restaurant where you first dated your wife 13 years ago and find it has turned into a pizza joint. That is why the imminent closure of the Boulestin restaurant in London's Covent Garden means so much to me. Queens Moat House, the troubled hotel chain which owns Boulestin, will hand the keys on March 11, to Pizza Hut. Marcel Boulestin came to London after the first world war and became the culinary media star of the inter-war years. He signed a book contract with Heinemann against an advance of Pounds 10 and in 1923 wrote Simple French Cooking for English Homes which sold for five shillings and was reprinted five times before 1933. He wrote other books and articles, gave cookery classes, lectured and became Britain's first television chef. This was partly to subsidise his restaurant, which opened in Leicester Square in 1925 and moved to its current site in Covent Garden in 1926. It was enormously popular thanks to its proximity to the Royal Opera House but rarely profitable, partly because Boulestin, London's first amateur restaurateur, wanted to offer a higher quality than London was prepared to buy. Boulestin died in 1942 but the spirit of his cooking is kept alive today by the jovial Kevin Kennedy, chef turned restaurateur, and his hard working wife, Maggie, who hope to take the Boulestin name to their next restaurant. What could be my final dinner there recently highlighted Boulestin's enduring attractions - oysters poached with a mousse of scallop corals and a gamey saddle of hare - and the hidden gems on its exceptional wine list. The Kennedys plan to hold gourmet evenings on March 9 and 10 (Pounds 47.50 per person). Boulestin, 1A, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London WC2E 8PS, tel: 071-836 7061.</p>

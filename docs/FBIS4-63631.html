			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SEGODNYA report: "Russian Military Give Priority to </F> Re-Armament"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry thinks that  "the program for a scientific-technical head start" in rearming  the Russian Army should be financed on a priority basis. Andrey  Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister, told SEGODNYA that  according to the Defense Ministry's military-technical policy  approved by the president and the Russian Federation Security  Council, a special program has been worked out for this purpose.  It is aimed first of all "at developing smart weapons and means  of protection from them and also at achieving a high level of  efficiency of a relatively small, but formidable army," Andrey  Kokoshin said. To this end, a working group at the Defense  Ministry's Military-Technical Policy Council has been set up.  However, according to the working group experts, "its  implementation is under threat because of the drastic  deterioration of the situation with defense spending."</p>

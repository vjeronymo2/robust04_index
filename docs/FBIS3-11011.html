He allowed us to see one of the huts  where he lives, and he told us part of his life story, talking  of his infancy, youth, and his adult life.    He became sullen when speaking of the love he left behind  and  when discussing his ideas on what this country could and should  be. Subcommander Marcos did all of this in a hamlet where we  could not return if we had to; we are still unsure how we got  there or precisely where it is located.    This allowed us to get to know a pleasant subcommander and  learn intimate details of his life. He told us part of his life  story and showed us his customs; he recalled he had lived in  Monterrey for a year while discussing with us the happy and the  sad. He talked about his unknown identity, his "having no  future," and, more than anything else, he showed a Marcos, who,  as he says, "can die at any moment."    Our eagerness to talk with the subcommander did not  diminish,  and it was only surpassed by our curiosity and desire to know  the real Marcos -- the man who hides behind this nom de guerre.    With this in mind, we -- reporters from EL NORTE and a  photographer -- went to this encounter, which was perhaps a  frustrated encounter.    Outfitted with a rented jeep, a can of gasoline, blankets,  and food, we departed for San Cristobal de las Casas en route to  Ocosingo. From there we went to the hamlet of San Miguel, where  we arrived at 0715 on Sunday, 6 March. A long line of  journalists and reporters grabbed our attention and perhaps even  dismayed us a bit. Eventually, patience gave way to impatience.  Some reporters gave up and left. Nevertheless, about 40  reporters remained behind, and we were among them.    At almost 1500, two Indians ran into the hamlet. They asked  for the reporters from EL NORTE and REFORMA. Only we were  included, and the others excluded. Not even the foreign  reporters were taken into account, including those from THE NEW  YORK TIMES, as well as those from the domestic press, as well as  reporters from Spain, France, and Canada. Only reporters from  EL NORTE and REFORMA would be taken to see Marcos.    The order was to wait until the rest of the reporters  departed. We had to wait until 2230 on Sunday. There were two  failed attempts to enter the jungle, but the third time was the  charm.    When we first came upon him, he was outlined in a  silhouette.  We noticed the smoke of his pipe and his height, for he stood  taller than the others who surrounded him. This was how we met  Marcos: He emerged from darkness.    "Well, get ready. No questions right now, but if you would  like, we can talk and wait for questions to come up... Come on  then; I am going to take you," said the subcommander, who  flirted with a female reporter from a magazine who had joined  the group.    He proceeded in a red pickup truck, remaining in the  constant  guard of heavily armed soldiers. Three of them were women,  while three others were men who carefully searched us and our  jeep.    We advanced in almost complete darkness. The jeep bounced  the entire way until we arrived at a small house. We were then  asked to leave the vehicle, and from here we were led by a  female soldier into a hut. The warning was clear: "Make no  reference to the names of any hamlets or the amount of time it  took you to travel here, and do not mention any specific  markings along the way. If you want to take photographs of  people, you must wait for them to cover their faces."    We slept there on Sunday. The following day, Monday, 7  March, we waited until 1500. At that time, the subcommander  arrived with his guards. He had come to pick us up.    The man who startled the Mexican political system and  surprised the world, decided right then to drive EL NORTE's jeep  and asked one of the reporters and a photographer to ride in the  truck. I was asked to accompany him. I now had a "chauffeur" and  a revolutionary. He found it difficult to shift gears and  accelerate the car in second gear and was very careful when he  drove. Despite this, the vehicle got stuck, and we were only  able to extricate it by pushing it out.    We had to go through three EZLN checkpoints, and at each one  we were examined more carefully than the previous occasion. We  were also warned about deactivated land mines along the side of  the road. During the drive, the subcommander said something  strange and out of place. He said: "I lived in Monterrey."  Somewhat confused, I asked him very respectfully: Sir, did you  really live in Monterrey? What part?    He grabbed his pipe filled with vanilla-smelling tobacco and  answered over the jeep's noise: "Yes, I lived in Monterrey for  almost a year. I lived near Felix U. Gomez. What I liked most  about the place was the mountainous region. I worked in the  outskirts of Monterrey, near Santa Catarina selling secondhand  clothes. I was a secondhand clothes dealer. I only sold native  clothes, nothing imported," he stipulated. "I also lived in the  public washrooms of the Truckers Union located in Avenida Colon.  Those were extremely filthy washrooms. I would also use the  washrooms of the cinemas located in the same avenue. I was  always around there."    He commented that the mountainous regions are quite special  because over there they do not like charlatans. "I am going to  give you a hint so that you can identify me. I played second  string for the Rayados [not further specified]. I was what you  could call a reserve player. I played right field. It was  beautiful to fly in the outfield," he commented. "Beer is very  popular there," he added, "from Monterrey I went to Veracruz  where I sold fish."    He recalled that in Maderos Avenue, there was a restaurant  that specialized in preparing goat meat with a very special  flavor. He interrupts his comments to say that a Nuevo Mexico  group had written him asking him to rescue that state. Later on,  he commented about the traditions of the inhabitants and all the  arrangements involved in getting married, like the gifts and the  first time the couple meet on the wedding day.    He finally parks the jeep and tells us to get out. We walk  for a short while until we reach the top of a hill where we  enter a shack where there were several other EZLN members. We  decided to rest, and the subcommander did likewise. A short time  later, we began the interview with another reporter. Sitting in  the hut surrounded by the other EZLN members, he commented that  so far there had been no accord, negotiation, or agreement  between the EZLN and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.  The subcommander promised another interview later. He ate by  himself and later departed but not before saying that he would  return in the morning to take us to a party commemorating  Women's Day.    On 8 Tuesday, he entered the hut very early in the morning  amid the sounds of crickets and birds. We had beans, rice, and  coffee for breakfast at 0700. There are no refreshments,  television, or any other entertainment, only poverty.    Silvestre and Arturo, two Zapatists, broke the early morning  stillness with two of their ballads: "I am an insurgent soldier,  seeking a revolution I move along. And they all want to fight  together as militia men... Without much to brag about, without  any rest, they left their homes, they left their loved ones. I  am an insurgent soldier, seeking a revolution I move along."    The subcommander returns at noon accompanied by several men  and women, a part of the revolution that did not reached  Chiapas. He drove our jeep again, and we reached a distant town  after driving for a long time, while an airplane overflew the  region. The sound of chickens, birds, and abundant vegetation  gave way to three other EZLN checkpoints. We finally reached the  town where arrangements for the party were still being made and  the subcommander was responsible for bringing flowers.    He softened his stance and proceeded to tell about his  entry into the Indian world and later the EZLN. "We arrived in  the jungle in 1983, nearly 11 years ago. It was a very small  group, only five."    The EZLN emerged with peasants tired of living like that.  The  original five arrived from the city, fed up with the legal forms  of struggle, failure, and limitations, let alone the failure of  the 1970's guerrillas. "This group set up camp in the jungle and  started to adapt themselves to the environment to survive. Those  were hardy days. It was necessary to extract food, dwellings,  medicines, everything, from the jungle. There was no other way,  and the villagers were not supporting us."    Seated on a school desk, he told about how they learned to  survive first and then spread their ideas without religious  interference.    His eyes are light and honey colored. His beard is gray and  his dark brown straight hair shows out from under his ski mask.  A tobacco smell surrounds him. He says: "The Indians had just  had an experience with a group from the north, the northerners,  I think they were called -- popular politics, Maoist proletarian  inclinations. They infiltrated the movement and tried to gain  access to the communities' structures but were thrown out. They  included Hugo Andres Araujo and Salinas' brother, Raul, but they  were taken out also."    Marcos joked openly and appeared to be sincere during his  interview with EL NORTE.    Lunchtime came, and we were served pork with rice and beans.  The subcommander ate in his hut. We approached the hut and saw  more than 50 heavily armed EZLN soldiers protecting the area. We  were allowed to take pictures of Zapatists preparing food. In  the background we saw Marcos' wooden hut, roofed with zinc and  straw, with ventilation portholes and a guarded door. His  bathroom has no massaging tub or any luxurious features. He only  has a latrine and a water tank with a hose attached to pour  water. Mud, smells, and barefoot children walking around make up  this scene.    On the subcommander's invitation we went to a river to  bathe.  The cold water flowed slowly in the shadows. We dived into the  stream, always guarded by a Zapatist. We returned and waited for  the party, for which loudspeakers had been installed. A gas tank  and a lamp were placed where the dance, to which all the people  had been invited, would take place. Later, more than 150 armed  Zapatists came down from the mountain led by the subcommander to  start the celebration. In the background there were four unarmed  women in civilian clothes but with their faces covered by shawls.    Capt. Benito announced the beginning of the cultural  program,  which featured songs, speeches, and military formations. The  Zapatist anthem opened the celebration: "Zapatist fighters, the  horizon is already in sight. The road will bring down those  coming from behind. Let's march forward so we can win the fight  because our homeland needs the efforts of the Zapatists. Men,  women, and children, we will always make our effort with  peasants, workers, and all the people. We must set the example  and stick to our slogan. We will defend the homeland and die for  freedom. Our history says that exploitation will come to an end.  Our people will fight for freedom."    The party concluded with Subcommander Marco's departure in  the darkness. He promised that he would be back on Wednesday 9  March for an exclusive interview with EL NORTE. He arrived after  breakfast. He was reminded that, for the time being, we did not  want to hear about the movement but about the man behind the ski  mask and the lives of some Indians who had fought. "No, not  that. I cannot say anything personal now. Maybe later. Let us  start somewhere else," said the subcommander seated under the  roof of a hut whose corners were guarded by three armed men and  three armed women.</p>

His widow, Priscilla Presley, is co-executive producer of the show.  </P> <P> With Michael St. Gerard in the title role, "Elvis" will premiere Feb. 6 at 9:30  p.m., after "Roseanne," then will move into its regular slot of 8:30 p.m.  Sundays on Feb. 11.  </P> <P> Set in Memphis during the 1950s, "Elvis" is described by ABC as a "music-filled  drama (that is) based on true incidents in Elvis' life." Millie Perkins will  portray Presley's mother, and Jordan Williams plays Sam Phillips, owner of Sun  Records.  </P> <P> "Free Spirit," a sitcom about a housekeeper who is a witch, has had ratings  problems since it debuted in September. It ranks 85th among the 91 prime-time  series that have been broadcast on the three major networks this season.  </P></p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (19): Survivors from the flood - Eastern chemicals are saved from extinction East Germany's chemical industry has already found a place in the history books and in novels. In April 1936, as part of his re-armament and industrial programme, Hitler created a giant synthetic rubber manufacturing complex in Buna, now in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. Production started a mere seven months later. By 1944, the Buna plant was producing 6,000 tonnes a month and meeting half the Reich's total needs. After 1945, Buna was placed under the Soviet administration, which soon re-started production. In 1953, the industry was placed under the east German communist state. By 1990, more than 83,600 people were working in the chemical sector. Until German unification in 1990, the chemical triangle, as it is known, encompassing the regions of Halle, Merseburg and Bitterfeld in Saxony-Anhalt, was considered one of the key sectors of the east German economy. But that sector also spewed out enormous levels of pollution, the effects of which are documented in a novel by Monika Maron called Flugasche (fly-ash). As a young journalist in the 1970s, Ms Maron was sent to the chemical triangle to write an ideologically glowing report about the industry. What she found instead was illness, waste and inefficiency. After deviating from her subject - she chose to write the truth - she was duly sacked. She is now a successful novelist living in western Germany. When the Treuhand privatisation agency took over Buna and the entire chemical industry in 1991, it was faced with a choice: to close down or keep Buna open. The decision was fundamental. West Germany had built up its own chemicals industry after the second world war, begging the question on unification as to whether a chemical industry was also needed in eastern Germany. After the Treuhand opted to keep the region's chemical sector alive, it embarked on a massive restructuring which will cost a total of DM14bn by the time it is complete. No sooner had the agency made this decision than it was faced with another question: could the sector become competitive? Mr Klaus Schucht, the Treuhand's board member responsible for modernising east Germany's chemical industry, has no doubts. 'From a social and political point of view, we need this industry. But I have no hesitation in saying that we will make it competitive,' he said recently. After reducing the work-force by 60,000, the agency planned the following shape for the chemicals sector: Bitterfeld, Buna, and Leuna (which has an oil-refinery complex), would produce basic chemicals; Buna and Leuna would also produce polymers, a chemical substance; the cracking, a process whereby inflammable oils are obtained by dry distillation of organic substances, especially coal and petroleum, would take place at Bohlen and Leuna; the refining would be carried out at Leuna, Lutzendorf and Zeitz; and the distribution would be carried out by Minol, the petrol distribution company. The aim is to secure 12,000 jobs and invest more than DM14bn in modernising east Germany's chemical industry. But it is the future of Buna, which will produce PVCs, or plastics, which will determine the success of the entire project. The Treuhand has earmarked over DM2.8bn of investments for modernising Buna and Bohlen, the location of the cracking facility, as part of its plan to create a fully integrated petrochemical complex. This year, Buna will have a turnover of DM800m on losses of about DM300m. But under one of the most ambitious schemes undertaken by the Treuhand, it hopes Buna will break even within five years, thanks to a partnership between Dow Chemical, the US-based chemical manufacturers, and Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas company and the Treuhand. Under the terms of the recent letters of intent, Dow Chemical will take a majority independent stake of Buna, and Gazprom will take a minority stake. (The Treuhand will retain 49 per cent, with the option of reducing it once the investment programme has been complete.) Buna will produce 1m-1.5m tonnes of polyethylene. The crucial issue for making Buna competitive is the price it will pay for its energy. At present, electricity produced at the nearby power plant at Schkopau is too expensive. Mr Schucht believes part of this energy problem can be solved through Gazprom, which is seeking a 26 per cent stake in Buna, and which will give one of Russia's largest and most lucrative state-run companies a foothold in the German chemicals industry. 'We said to Gazprom that we are offering you the possibility of producing plastics in east Germany. We want its liquid gas - the C2s, C3s and C4 gases. And in any case, Gazprom has to do something with these gases at its Yamal fields (in Siberia),' said Mr Schucht. To make the entire project cost-effective, Gazprom's gas, which Buna requires, will have to be shipped to eastern Germany at competitive prices. The Treuhand is considering two options on how to ship the 20bn cubic metres of gas needed annually for Buna. One way is via Tscherepoweck in Russia, where the C3 gases will be shipped up to the harbour at Vyborg, transported through Poland to the east German port of Rostock and then transported via a pipe line to the cracker at Bohlen. The other option is through the Ukraine, but Russia wants to reduce its dependence on the Ukraine. 'The key factor is that the transport costs cannot be higher than the prices of the feedstock in Bohlen', explained Mr Schucht. To realise this project, the Russians would have to build a pipeline at Yamal. Experts estimate the pipeline would cost between Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn. Yet even if the relationship with Gazprom works according to plan, the Treuhand may still have to convince the European Commission that the level of investments it is allocating to Buna will not amount to subsidies. 'The capacity is there. But we are trying to build new capacity with a lower cost structure of about 30 per cent,' said Mr Schucht. Despite the high risks, the Treuhand believes the east German chemical sector can become competitive and that its location will prove a considerable advantage once the economies of eastern Europe pick up. That is one of the reasons Dow Chemical has chosen to invest in Buna. If this ambitious, heavily-capitalised project is successful, east Germany's chemical sector will no longer carry the stigma of feeding Hitler's war and industrial machine, or being remembered by east Germans as one of the country's worst polluters.</p>

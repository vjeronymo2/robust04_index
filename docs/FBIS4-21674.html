			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA/SVENSKA DAGBLADET report: </F> "Chernobyl Reactors Highly Dangerous"]    [Text] New York/Moscow -- The International Atomic Energy  Agency, IAEA, views with great concern the risk of a new  catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine.    "The two reactors still in operation are highly dangerous,"  said IAEA head Hans Blix in an interview with TIDNINGARNAS  TELEGRAMBYRA.    The reactors should really have been shut down by now, but  last fall Ukraine reversed this decision. The reason given was  that the country could not afford to do without them.    A group of inspectors from the IAEA, a UN agency, visited  Chernobyl a few weeks ago, and on Thursday [30 March] IAEA  headquarters issued a statement highly critical of the power  station. The group found that there was much to be criticized  at the nuclear power station.    "During the inspection several several shortfalls in the  field of safety were discovered at the two units still in  operation at the power station," the announcement states.    "Trained personnel have left and there is no money for spare  parts," Blix said.    "I have recently informed Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk  that the Chernobyl reactors are completely unsatisfactory from  the safety viewpoint," he added.    Hans Blix has also offered to arrange a meeting in Vienna to  discuss with Ukraine how the safety crisis at Chernobyl can be  resolved. According to Thursday's statement form the IAEA in  Vienna President Kravchuk has responded positively to the offer.    A 70-page report on the visit to Chernobyl by the group of  inspectors is being put together, but an IAEA spokesman said  that it is still to early to be able to say whether the  inspectors' conclusion will be that Chernobyl should be shut  down completely.    The IAEA's negative criticism of safety at Chernobyl was  received with mixed feelings in Ukraine, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's  Moscow correspondent reports.    "If there were any real danger we would be ordered to shut  the installation down. I view this simply as a call that we  continue to improve our work in the field of safety," said  Mikhail Umanets, the man chiefly responsible for Ukraine's  nuclear power industry.    But there were other voices which agreed completely with the  IAEA's criticism. Valentin Kupnyy, who is responsible for the  safety zone around the installation, said that "the quicker the  installation is shut down, the better it will be for Ukraine and  the country's neighbors."    Valentin Kupnyy also said that those who today support the  continued exploitation of Chernobyl are more interested in the  enormous amounts of money which have already been invested than  in safety improvements.    "The IAEA did nothing more than note the facts and this is  something we have to accept, whether we like it or not," Kupnyy  said.    There are plans to reopen next year the third reactor, which  was damaged by fire in 1991. However, the authorities have  still not reached a decision on a new vault around the fourth  reactor which caused the 1986 catastrophe.    "I have received information that the protective covering  that exists today has already begun to crack. We are sitting on  a time bomb and a frightful catastrophe could occur," Yuriy  Bagrov, the president of the fund to help the victims of  Chernobyl, told SVENSKA DAGBLADET during a visit to Kiev a  little over a month ago.    It was the economic crisis in Ukraine which prompted the  authorities -- despite international protests -- to reopen  Chernobyl. Ukraine had suddenly been forced to pay world market  prices for gas and oil from Russia -- something for which there  was not the money. Nuclear power provides 40 percent of  Ukraine's electricity supplies and in order to reduce dependence  on Russia Ukraine is intending to bring another three new  reactors into service over the next 18 months.</p>

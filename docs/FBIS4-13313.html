			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Emile Khaz'al, in Muscat, </F> to Nawwaf al-Nabbari, in the studio, date not given; from the  "With the Events" program --recorded]    [Text] [Nabbari] Good evening Emile.    [Khaz'al] Good evening Nawwaf.    [Nabbari] Reports from Muscat say last-minute difficulties  prevented issuing a final joint statement on the negotiations  within the Water Affairs Committee.    [Khaz'al] Yes, there is a crisis in the Water Affairs  Committee meetings. A final statement was scheduled to be  issued at 1400 today, at 1300 Jerusalem time, but the  journalists were asked to gather again at 2000 Muscat time, 1900  Jerusalem time, that is one hour from now to hear the final  statement. At the same time, international telephone lines and  faxes have been busy for the past four hours between Muscat,  Amman, Washington, and Tunis in a bid to find an outlet for the  crisis caused by 'Ali al-Gazzawi, Jordan's representative to the  Water Affairs Committee, when he rejected the final statement of  the water committee's fifth round of talks to protest the  continuation of the inspection of ships heading to the Jordanian  Port of al-'Aqabah by the U.S-led allies.    Head of the U.S. delegation John Herbst who heads this  committee stemming from the multilateral talks, seeks to  unanimously approve the final statement, and rejects the  Jordanian reservations. The Americans want the Jordanians to  remain an active partner in the multilateral negotiations  because it is an important party to the peace process. A short  while ago, the Palestinian delegation cabled PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat in Tunis asking him to intervene with the Jordanian  Government to abandon its opposition to the final statement,  because this statement includes great gains to the Palestinians,  including welcoming the formation the national water authority,  and implementation of a number of projects in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip, proposed by the United States, Israel, Austria, and  Germany. These projects are able to overcome the water crisis  from which the West Bank and Gaza Strip still suffer.    The Omani delegation did not hide its dissatisfaction with  the Jordanian position, especially since the Sultanate of Oman  considers the convening of the Water Affairs Committee in Muscat  a first-class international gain. The evidence on this is the  broad international media coverage of the committee meetings in  Muscat. They expect here that the fraternal and warm relations  between King Husayn and Sultan Qabus would rescue the  multilateral negotiations--in other words the prestige of the  Omani sultan is being tested. Likewise the sea water  desalination center in Muscat is now in danger.    Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Amman, as we knew, is playing  a role in convincing the Jordanian Government to approve the  final statement, which includes several proposals on  implementation of the projects on which it was agreed.    A while ago, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations agreed  that even if Jordan continues to oppose the final statement, all  joint projects will be implemented, including replacing old  water networks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and organizing  courses on administering and rationalizing water, as Israel  proposed. The Palestinian and Israeli delegations will ask the  donor states to finance these projects in spite of Jordan's  reservations.    In other words, there is a crisis in the Water Affairs  Committee talks in Muscat, contacts are going on, and it is  expected to reach a solution to this crisis nearly one hour from  now, at 2000 Muscat time, 1900 Jerusalem time, and the final  statement is expected then to be announced on the joint projects  that will be implemented in the water field.</p>

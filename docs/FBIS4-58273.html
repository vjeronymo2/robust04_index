			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: During the talks held between President  Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  yesterday, the president reiterated Syria's true desire to  establish a just and comprehensive peace that guarantees the  rights of all parties. This Syrian desire to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace was not conceived on the spur of the moment,  but a strategy that has been adopted by Syria for many years.  The objective of peace has been, and still is, the heart of  Syria's policy. Syria has responded positively to every call or  initiative to establish peace based on the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the return of Arab rights to their  owners.    Since past initiatives have not achieved their objectives,  and the last two and a half years of talks have not achieved  peace thus far, we must lay the blame at the feet of the  Israelis. Israel has foiled each and every call or initiative  to achieve peace in the past, obstructed and hampered the  current peace process, and prevented the achievement of any  results worth mentioning.    Today, it seems there will be a new opportunity to push the  peace process forward if Israel abandons its previous stands and  deals positively with the substantive queries the U.S. secretary  of state carried with him from Damascus. The queries deal with  the basic issues and not with formalities and unimportant  issues. We do not believe the bases of a just and comprehensive  peace need further explanation or clarification, for the peace  process is based on specific and clear principles; namely, the  UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. When all the  parties declare their adherence to these principles, then peace  will be within reach. The more this or that party departs from  these principles, the more dim become the prospects to achieve  peace.    Syria has announced its stand toward peace. It is a stand  based on the UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.  This stand has not and will not change. By the same token,  Syria is concerned about establishing the peace of the brave in  the region, and is committed to the peace process until it  achieves its goals; it adheres to its right to restore every  inch of the Golan and the occupied territories.    Syria said it will not accept half solutions and partial  withdrawals. Moreover, it did not take part in the Madrid  conference and the Washington negotiations to bargain over its  territory and rights, but joined the peace process out of its  desire for a just and honorable peace and because the peace  initiative is based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and  338, which are in harmony with Syria's peace strategy.    Any peace that is not established on firm bases will be  threatened with collapse at any time. Any peace that does not  liberate all the occupied Arab territories and restore all the  usurped rights cannot be established. It is either  comprehensive peace or no peace. Withdrawal must also be full,  for it is impossible to achieve peace with the continuation of  occupation. Syria has sought and is still seeking a just and  comprehensive peace that can last and hold. This peace, which  is based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, is the  only means to end the whirlpool of wars and aggression, and  restore rights to their owners. If the other party is ready for  such peace, it will find reciprocation from Syria. Only then,  can the peace process proceed toward the objective aspired by  the region and the world. The ball is still in the Israeli  court. Israel must answer these substantive queries. And, in  light of their answers, we can then talk about the progress or  retreat of the peace process. The opportunity is still  available to achieve the aspired peace.</p>

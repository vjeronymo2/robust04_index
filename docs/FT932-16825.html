			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Warnford agrees to amend accounts WARNFORD INVESTMENTS, the property investment group, has agreed to amend the treatment of properties in its accounts following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the watchdog of accounting standards. The company had not complied with SSAP 19, the accounting standard which requires investment properties to be shown at open market value, in its accounts for 1991. This shows that the Review Panel is determined to take action against companies even when any divergence from accounting standards is clearly flagged in the accounts. Warnford had highlighted that its company balance sheet did not comply with SSAP 19 in its fixed assets note in the accounts. The fact was also noted in the auditor's report. But Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the Review Panel, said: 'It is not enough just to have a qualified audit report or to disclose in the notes. You have to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act.' Mr Frank Martyn, finance director of Warnford, said the company had not complied with SSAP 19 because to do so would have disclosed the open market value of a property which the company was in negotiations to sell. He said because the company only held one freehold property, its value would have been clearly identifiable if it had complied with SSAP 19. But he stressed that it was shown at market value in the consolidated group accounts, so non-compliance had no effect on the group's value or earnings. 'It made no difference whatsoever to the market's perception of the company.' Mr Treadgold said: 'Reasons of commercial confidentiality can never really be justification for departing from accounting standards.' Warnford's directors have agreed to follow SSAP 19 in the future. But they have managed to escape revealing the value of the property by re-allocating it to a subsidiary. Mr Martyn said the property had still not been sold.</p>

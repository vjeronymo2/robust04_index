			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> BUCKS FOR BEETHOVEN, NOT THE BIZARRE;  </P> <P> ARTISTS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO SCANDALIZE THE BOURGEOIS. BUT NOT TO MAKE THEM PAY  FOR IT.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has wisely postponed until the fall the  great kulturkampf over funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. The  fight badly needs its August recess. It is hard to think of a debate in recent  years that has generated more nonsense.  </P> <P> For example: The bill to extend the life of the NEA is encumbered with 26  amendments, including one that prohibits federally supported art from including  "any part of an actual human embryo." At first I thought that must mean any  artistic representation of the human embryo. But since no one could possibly be  for banning that, it occurred to me that the author, California Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), means that one may not include an actual fetus in a  piece of federally funded art (Why just federally funded? And why just art?).  This idea wins the award for most bizarre anti-abortion legislation of the  year.  </P> <P> But it is not just ax-grinding congressmen who have muddied the debate.  Self-serving artists have risen mightily to protest a Jesse Helms-inspired  provision in current law that bans the NEA from giving money to any work that  might be deemed obscene.  </P> <P> "Democracy is being threatened," cried Joseph Papp in a statement true to his  name. "I feel like I'm living under McCarthyism or Stalinism," cried Karen  Finley, the New York performance artist best known for smearing ("deftly" --  Newsweek) chocolate on her semi-nude body, a statement, it seems, against the  degradation of women. "Censorship!" cries the art world in unison. And, of  course, "First Amendment!"  </P> <P> The First Amendment says, "Congress shall make no law. . . ." It does not say,  "Congress shall subsidize." Restricting federal subsidies for art has as little  to do with censorship as it does with abortion. No one is censoring anything.  Artists have the right to unfettered expression. The only question is by what  right they demand unfettered subsidy for their unfettered expression.  </P> <P> Artists have every right to scandalize the bourgeois. However, when they demand  that the bourgeois pay (with taxes) for that which scandalizes him, they go too  far. The bourgeois has every right to say, through Congress, "I'll only  support, say, music that is tonal and art that is not obscene."  </P> <P> A free society allocates its resources through its democratic institutions in  order to achieve some freely chosen public purposes and social goods. The idea  that artists should have some special say in the allocation of goods that line  their own pockets has no more validity than the same claim by the sugar lobby.  The only difference is that the sugar lobby doesn't have the chutzpah to claim  that its subsidies are a constitutional right.  </P> <P> Artists have good reason, however, to insist that the NEA debate is about  censorship and the First Amendment. They don't want -- they don't know how --  to talk about the real issue, which is public purposes and social goods. If  they didn't talk about the First Amendment, they would have to explain why  chocolate-smearing is entitled to a federal subsidy. In other words, they would  have to defend the value of their art. Given what passes for art these days,  they had rather not.  </P> <P> It is because art has become so self-indulgently and vacuously defined that  legislators run around trying to contain it at the edges. Now some Republicans  are proposing to ban federal funding for art that "deliberately denigrate(s)  the cultural heritage of the United States, its religious traditions, or racial  or ethnic groups."  </P> <P> One's initial reaction is to say, forget the whole enterprise. Get government  completely out of the arts. No more absurd debates over how to restrict an  activity that no one can adequately define. Do what you want, go into the  marketplace and, if enough people think it is art and will support you, fine.  Otherwise, try bus-driving.  </P> <P> I'm sympathetic to this throw-up-your-hands approach. But I have a better idea.  It comes from historian Gertrude Himmelfarb. Since no one can define art, let  alone obscenity and racial insensitivity, and since no one really wants to cut  off the local symphony orchestra, let's make a new rule: The NEA will support  the reproduction and dissemination only of old, established art. Not a penny  for anything new.  </P> <P> Creativity? On your own time, at your own expense. But if you want to expose  the good citizens of Tempe and Tupelo to the wonders of the past --  Rachmaninoff and Beethoven, Raphael and Rubens -- the American taxpayer will  look sympathetically upon your request.  </P> <P> The Himmelfarb Amendment. A great idea with not a chance of passage.  </P></p>

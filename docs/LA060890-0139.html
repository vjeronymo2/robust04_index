			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> ANTI-OIL DRILLING CAMPAIGN TO BEGIN  </P> <P> A petition drive for a ballot measure that would effectively ban oil and gas  drilling in the central portion of the city will begin Monday, its chief  organizer said.  </P> <P> The Garden Grove GOO (Get Oil Out) group, headed by Woodrow Butterfield, is  seeking to ban oil and gas drilling within 800 feet of churches, schools or  homes.  </P> <P> While the ban would be citywide, its intent is to forestall any future plans by  Chevron USA to drill from its site at Pearl and Nelson streets near downtown. A  request by Chevron for a drilling permit was rejected last June on a 3-2 vote  of the City Council.  </P> <P> Councilmen J. Tilman Williams and Robert F. Dinsen and local businessman Bruce  Broadwater are listed as the official sponsors of the initiative.  </P> <P> "We have 2,500 blank petitions ready to go out," Butterfield said. "We don't  anticipate having any problems getting enough signatures."  </P> <P> The group has missed the May 31 deadline given by City Clerk Carolyn Morris for  submitting 5,700 signatures to ensure a spot on the November ballot. But  Butterfield, a local businessman and political activist, said he is still  confident.  </P> <P> "We haven't been knocked off track," he said. "There are many ways it can  happen. If we get 15% of the voters (compared to the 10% required for a  regularly scheduled election) we can have (a vote) any time we want," with a  special election.  </P> <P> Alternatively, the city could save the cost of an election if the council  adopted the ban after the initiative qualified for the ballot.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The paraquat listed, essentially the dichloride salt, is a solid in solution. There is available for paraquat an IDLH level of 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). This converts to an Index Value of .0015, which results in a threshold planning quantity of 10 pounds. While the November, 1986 notice for the interim final EHS listing rule applied this calculation to all solids, the April 22, 1987, notice (52 FR 13390&hyph;91) modified this by applying this calculation to solids only if they have a particle size less than 100 microns, if they are handled in solution or molten form, or if they have a high rating for reactivity. For particle sizes over 100 microns, the threshold planning quantity is 10,000 pounds. Paraquat dichloride, therefore, has two threshold planning quantities depending on its particle size and whether it is used in solution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner requests that the Agency base the level of concern for paraquat dichloride on the LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  tests rather than the IDLH. EPA disagrees. The IDLH, while it has flaws, is the best available measure for determining a level of concern because it is based on actual human data. When an IDLH is available, EPA declines to use conversion factors, as it does for those substances for which IDLH values are not available ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  51 FR 41576), because these factors are even rougher measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIOSH lists the two chemicals (paraquat and paraquat dichloride) as synonyms (NIOSH/RTECS 1983 Synonyms, Volume 1, p. 719); therefore, the Agency considers the ionic form of paraquat as the dichloride salt in a solution. Since the IDLH value applies to both the salt and the solution, EPA has decided not to remove the chemical from the EHS list or modify the TPQ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The paraquat ion is reportable as a solution (or mixture) of paraquat dichloride and a carrier (for example, water). For threshold purposes, the facility only needs to consider the weight percent of paraquat dichloride that was placed in the solution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Miles, Inc., has submitted a petition requesting that the 10,000-pound TPQ apply to azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos in the Miles products Guthion 2L and Nemacur 3. Both of these chemicals have TPQs of 10 pounds that apply when the chemicals are in finely powdered form, in molten form, or in solution, as calculated using the same methodology applied to paraquat dichloride. The 10,000-pound TPQ applies to the solid form with particle size greater than 100 microns. The petitioner submits that both of these compounds are ``waxy, amorphous solids with low melting points and their technical grade materials used for production are generally liquid at summer temperatures.'' The petitioner stated that the TPQ for the chemicals should be based upon their being liquids using the methodology described for IPDI, above, in unit II. This would raise the TPQ to 10,000 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disagrees. The Farm Chemicals Handbook (1984 p. C161) lists fenamiphos as a brown, waxy solid. The Hawley handbook (1981) lists azinphos-methyl as a brown waxy solid as well. Since these references, used as background to the listing, show these chemicals as solids, the EPA considers the chemicals as solids as well. They would be near the melting point but never quite reach it. Molten solids are not treated as liquids under the TPQ methodology, because the solids have to be raised above standard temperature in order to become molten. Since EPA has no way of knowing at what temperatures facilities have the molten solids (to determine volatilization), EPA chose to consider solids different from chemicals that are liquid at standard temperatures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, EPA accounts for solids that become liquids (molten form) with the two tiered threshold. When handled in molten form, the TPQ for these chemicals would be 10 pounds because of the possibility of volatilization. However, even in molten form, significant amounts of vapor are not likely to be generated. The Agency examined the fraction of volatilization expected for the solids on the list and found that it ranges from 0.3 to 0.008 pounds/minute per pound spilled (see Threshold Planning Quantities, Technical Support Document, April 7, 1987, page 27). Since data were not available for all solids and to be conservative, the Agency chose to incorporate the 0.3 fraction into the reporting requirements. If a facility is handling the solid in molten form, the amount molten should be multiplied by 0.3 to obtain the actual amount to be compared to the threshold planning quantity for reporting (see 40 CFR 355.30(e)(iv)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NYKANEN WINS SKI-JUMP LEG; THOMA FOURTH  </P> <P> Olympic triple gold medalist Matti Nykanen of Finland won the second leg of the  traditional Four-Hill ski jumping tour by soaring 109 and 102 meters in his two  jumps at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany.  </P> <P> West German Dieter Thoma, who won the first segment of the event in Oberstdorf  two days earlier, managed only a fourth-place finish in the second leg but held  on to his lead in both the Four-Hill tournament and the World Cup competition.  </P> <P> Thoma had jumps of 104.5 and 102.5 meters Sunday, trailing second-place  finisher Jens Weissflog of East Germany and Finland's Risto Laakonen, who came  in third.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old Thoma swept down the track after his first jump, visibly  angered that he had to land prematurely when a strong sidewind began pushing  him wide of the track.  </P> <P> Weissflog had jumps of 104 and 100 meters and Laakonen landed with 107.5 and  99.5 in his two attempts, both earning more style points from the judges than  did Thoma to finish ahead of the tournament leader.  </P></p>

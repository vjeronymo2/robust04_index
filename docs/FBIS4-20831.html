			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Lobacheva: "Chemical Weapons: Should They </F> Be Stored, Detonated, or Converted by Reprocessing? If We Have  to Think About These Questions for Long, We Shall No Longer Need  an Answer"]    [Text] Vladimir Uglev did not publish any great  secret about Russian binary chemical weapons, having decided  that this kind of revelation is within the capability of a  fifth-year student in any chemistry department and, therefore,  it was not worth making a fuss over it. According to rumors, the  President "reacted adequately to the unconstitutionality of the  prosecution" against the scientist Vil Mirzayanov. It appears  that his case will be closed.    No matter how you put it, it would be a blessing if  only the mass media would quiet down again and not cause public  opinion to pout over the news about how we are destroying  poisonous substances that we have accumulated for many years.  And how we are storing them, and how many are left. These  military poisonous substances will be burned up, detonated, and  sometimes simply and boldly dumped "on the ground" in  secrecy.    Well, this cannot be allowed in any case. In general, nearly  every disgraceful practice in connection with the production,  storage, and destruction of chemical weapons occurred and is  still occurring because we continue to live in an environment of  total secrecy. A minimum of eleven million citizens of Russia  carry this stigma of secrecy. Those who try to free themselves  of this stigma are threatened with unpleasant consequences  similar to those which befell Mirzayanov and Fedorov, and far  from everyone is willing to risk getting a prison cot.    This is how my conversation began with Professor Sergey  Novikov. Sergey Sergeyevich is director of a laboratory at the  Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences  and, in contrast to "chemical dissidents," never participated in  developing chemical weapons. His scientific and technical  experience consists of destroying highly toxic waste material  resulting from production. For a long time, Novokov could not go  abroad. Two years ago, however, it turned out that the secrets  that he kept for many years are not so terrible after all, and  the stamp of secrecy was removed. Now Novikov has not only a  passport to go abroad, but is conducting a Russo-Swedish project  called "The Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Russia: Problems  and Perspectives," at the International Institute for Problems  of Peace, located in Sweden.    You have to agree that it is somewhat strange that this kind  of project has a Swedish residence, if one can express himself  in this way. In our country, however, any serious and  unclassified work of this nature is still practically  impossible. All data are still being guarded by sharp-eyed  departments of our security service. It is simply astounding.  The USSR participated for nearly 20 years in preparing the  Convention on Prohibiting the Development, Production,  Accumulation, Use, and Abolishment of Chemical Weapons. We  presented the world community with the most diverse possible  data on their production and storage, and on possibilities of  destroying the chemical potential that had been turned out by  our country; also, the ecological impact of existing and future  production on the environment and on people who worked with  poisonous substances and who lived in polluted areas.... And  what happened? The 1992 publication of the book by Kraus and  Mellari, "Chemical Weapons in Soviet Military Doctrine,"  contains the same data that continue to be a great secret for  all citizens of Russia, whether they are specialists in narrow  fields, journalists, or residents of polluted areas. But a  Swede, an American, or a German can easily look at this great  secret of ours if he wants to buy the book in a store or request  it from a library. Nothing changed after Russia signed the  Convention in January 1993 either. Indeed, what is this legal  suit against Mirzayanov? Is it not simply an unwillingness on  the part of the "science security people" to forego their fairly  well-organized and apparently well-paying personal lives?    Experts are generally amused about the charges leveled at  Mirzayanov. And, really, one has only to analyze the list of  those who received awards for developing chemical weapons and  putting them into production -- a list published in the open  press by Lev Fedorov. One does not have to be a Stirlitz to be  able to match the names and positions of the heroes of the  invisible front with the names of the enterprises, the cities in  which they are located, the number of workers at these  enterprises, the elapsed time after the discoveries had been  made.... This is the intriguing picture that gradually  emerges.... Who cares about Mirzayanov's "discoveries"? This is  why all talk about exposing secrets is, at a minimum, naive: The  chemical dissidents are absolutely right when they focus the  attention of the world on the fact that the stores of chemical  weapons that we have presented for destruction do not reflect  the full picture. We are speaking about the disappearance of,  God knows whereto, 75,000 tonnes of mustard gas and 14,000  tonnes of Lewisite. Thus far there has been no mention, but with  time information will certainly surface about chemical weapons  -- ours and German -- that were buried in the Baltic Sea after  World War II. After having signed the Convention, hiding  something becomes problematical. After all, we have opened up  our borders so that the responsibilities that we have accepted  can be monitored.    And incidentally, this is not only for monitoring. We agreed  that if there is any violation of any point of the Convention,  severe sanctions can be applied against us. And this this  already a serious matter. Whether there is a court case against  Mirzayanov or not, an answer will still have to be given. Until  the Convention is ratified, some kind of justification can be  made, but that cannot go on forever. And here is where we come  to the important point.    In accordance with the Convention, Russia has to begin  destruction of its stores of chemical weapons in 1997 and finish  this difficult task by 2005. Thus far, however, a state plan for  the safe destruction of chemical weapons does not exist. There  is a Committee for Convention Problems on Chemical and  Biological Weapons. There is technology: One accepted and 35  alternative methods for destruction. But there are no factories  or plants. Not a single one! So how we are going to free  ourselves of this scourge, and in such a short time to boot, is  not entirely clear -- neither to you or us, nor to the experts.    A plant was being built in Chapayevsk especially for this  purpose. It was proposed that a two-stage technology for  destruction be applied here: First the poisonous substances  would be subjected to a "wet" chemical detoxification and then,  the resultant so-called reactive mass formed as a result of  alkaline hydrolysis would be subjected to a burning process.  Solid waste products were to be glazed and buried, and liquid  waste would be used partly for repeated processing of subsequent  poisonous substances, while fully detoxicated waste could  already be poured into reservoirs because they would be rendered  harmless.    Despite the fact that the description of this technology  looks frightening and not too convincing, the developers  maintain that the safety factor of this technology is very high,  but as usual, there is no published data, and so it would be  impossible to verify this assertion. Moreover, the Chapayevsk  plant is now something totally different. In fact, it is now a  training center and facility for training experts for the  chemical troops.    This change of function took place after international  experts had visited Chapayevsk and were to report to the world  community that something had finally stirred the Soviet  conscience, and they had devised a civilized method for  destroying chemical weapons. The experts were satisfied that  this was indeed the case and departed. Only at that moment did  the city dwellers realize what kind of vile thing had been built  next door to them. And they began picketing around the plant.  Every pre-election program of Deputy candidates was based on  promises to protect the residents of Chapayevsk who, for a  period of many years now, had been poisoned by chemical  products. It was already 1989 and it was impossible not to pay  heed to the people's anger. And so the plant's profile was  changed.    Anyway, plant capability was such that it would have taken  400(!) years to destroy all the accumulated chemical trash,  running at full capacity. So at first glance, it was not a great  loss. But only at first glance. It was planned that after the  plant had begun operating and after the necessary approvals, as  many similar plants as necessary would be built. These plans are  no longer valid, especially since in the past few years it has  become clear that not a single mode of transportation available  in our country could guarantee that chemical weapons could be  transported safely to areas where plants might have been built.  Now there is one way out: Similar enterprises can be built only  next to storage areas, of which -- as is well known -- we have  seven, and five of them are located in the greatly suffering  Volga basin. From a common sense point of view, this is akin to  madness. But in reality, there is no other way out. So we cannot  be horrified and we cannot close our eyes to the consequences of  militaristic philosophizing. We must immediately develop and  implement a program of action.    Yes, we shall need immeasurably more resources than was  proposed earlier. No one can force people to live and work in  dangerous areas. But natives of cities where "chemistry"  flourished, where they got used to drinking, eating, and  breathing from poisonous sources, not receiving anything in  return, should be offered a package of measures for their social  protection, as well as compensation. Perhaps people will accept  these provisions and will not leave. The ecological soundness of  various technologies used for different purposes must be proven  with absolute openness, with no omissions of any kind, and with  the assistance of independent experts. Apparently there is no  longer any talk about what was supposed to be operational in  Chapayevsk.    The Americans are offering their technology already tested  on  Johnston Atoll and also, loans for this purpose. Of course, in  this way they are resolving their own problems of distributing  contracts and providing employment, but since time has run out,  it is possible that this option will be selected. Monitoring and  control (real ones!) will come very quickly and, again, will not  be ours. America has already offered resources for the purchase  of an information-analytical laboratory network, whose sensing  elements will register "traces" of poisonous substances in  working areas where the chemical weapons will be destroyed. In  addition, it is essential for the public and the press to know  that there is legislation which establishes the right of control  over these sites. In other words, this problem can be resolved  only if the public is fully informed about it.    The cost of destroying Russian chemical weapons is estimated  at 10 billion dollars. Under our present economic conditions it  appears unrealistic that this amount could be appropriated. The  storage areas, however, are located in the most densely  populated parts of the country, and any accident or sabotage or  simply a worsening of storage conditions could lead to a  catastrophe that would make Chernobyl look like a minor incident  by comparison.    Is it possible that we are just going to wait until it all  blows up and only then find the money, technology, and the  people we need? Anyway, there may simply not be any people left:  Chemical weapons are also frightening because there would be no  one to save and no one to do the saving in polluted areas. I  think it is time for our country to be returned to us, otherwise  there will be no place left for us to live.</p>

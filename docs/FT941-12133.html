			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Observer: Dinner crumbs Seemed a bit odd for the Corporation of London to invite the Lord Mayor of Frankfurt to last night's Mansion House dinner to celebrate the 25th anniversary dinner of British Invisibles. After all, BI has tried its damnedest to promote London's corner in world financial markets, yet Frankfurt has carried off the trophy of hosting the European Monetary Institute. Not that Andreas Schoeler, the main foreign guest at the dinner, was bragging about Frankfurt's victory when Observer bumped into him. 'London was, and is, and will be for hundreds of years the main financial market in Europe,' he said modestly. Frankfurt was simply pitching for a 'small bit of it'. Much too modest.</p>

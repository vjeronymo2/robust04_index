			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0000 GMT on 22 May, in its "Sunday Discussion"  program, carries a live 75-minute roundtable discussion.  Present at the discussion are Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister;  Atsushi Kanda, Defense Agency director general; Taku Yamasaki,  deputy secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]; Kosuke Uehara, a member of the opposition Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]; Hajime Funada, standing  secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; Chikara Sakaguchi,  chairmen of Komeito's Policy Research Council; Shoichi Ide,  chairman of the Sakigake [Harbinger Party] General Council;  Hiroshi Kikunami, chairman of the Japan Communist Party [JCP]  Policy Committee. The discussion is moderated by NHK  commentator Takashi Yamamoto.    Yamamoto begins the discussion by raising the issue of the  DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons for discussion  and then asks Kakizawa to comment. Kakizawa states: "The  international community has been making efforts to clear up  suspicions about North Korea's development of nuclear arms. The  United States and other nations, including China, have continued  to urge North Korea through dialogue to work to allay  international concern. I believe the effort by the United  States and other nations are paying off little by little while  making North Korea understand." Kakizawa goes on to say: "The  international community has been concerned about North Korea's  unilateral replacement of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear  reactor. According to a news release issued this morning by the  IAEA, however, North Korea has notified the IAEA of its  intention to allow IAEA inspectors to check the replacement of  the fuel rods and the experimental nuclear reactor in the  future. I hope that North Korea will move that way in the  future." Asked by Yamamoto to comment about the prospect of the  United States and North Korea resuming the third round of their  high-level talks, Kakizawa cites remarks by U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Gallucci and says: "The third round of the  high-level talks will be held between the two countries." Asked  by Yamamoto to comment on the reports that North Korea intends  to buy time instead of seeking an early settlement to the  nuclear dispute, Kakizawa points to North Korea's past  capriciousness in dealing with the nuclear issue and notes that  "progress is being made little by little in the dialogue."    Turning to the Hata Cabinet's handling of Japan's security  policy and the nuclear issue, Yamamoto asks panelists to  comment. Yamazaki states: "The issue of North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear arms is a vital issue to Japan  and Japan needs to vigorously deal with the issue. I believe  that Japan needs to prepare itself to properly deal with  economic sanctions against North Korea once they are imposed.  In this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai has stated  the government has prepared for emergency legislation. However,  my understanding is that the government has not yet prepared for  the emergency legislation at all," adding that Japan should make  diplomatic effort to persuade the DPRK.    Uehara says: "The SDPJ takes the view that the Korean  peninsula should remain free of nuclear. The SDPJ also has been  concerned about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear  arms. Our party has long advocated settling the nuclear issue  through dialogue since it was in the Hosokawa government as a  coalition partner."    Noting the importance of dialogue, Funada states: "A set of  policy agreements reached among the coalition partners  stipulates that Japan should act within the framework of the  United Nations, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and the Japanese  Constitution if the dialogue does not go well as hoped."    Kikunami notes that "the JCP has harshly condemned North  Korea for waging international terrorism" and states: "What is  important for now is not to seek economic sanctions, but to seek  a political and peaceful settlement to the nuclear issue."    Discussing the government's handling of the issue of the  DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, Kakizawa  states: "Japan and North Korea have so far held eight rounds of  normalization talks; at these talks, Japan has urged North Korea  to allay the international community's concerns over its nuclear  program. Regrettably, the Japan-North Korea normalization talks  have remained stalled since the talks were broken off over the  Yi Un-hae issue [the DPRK's alleged abduction of a Japanese  woman] in November 1992. The government has told North Korea  that Japan is willing to resume the normalization talks. Japan  has notified North Korea of its requests through diplomatic  contacts in Beijing and the United Nations although I cannot go  into details about the requests. In this way, Japan, for its  part, has worked to settle the nuclear issue."    Yamamoto raises the question of reinterpreting the  Constitution to allow Japan to exercise the collective  self-defense right and then asks panelists to comment. Kakizawa  states: "The situation surrounding Japan's security has become  very grim and the international situation surrounding Japan's  security also has changed. Looking at the results of a recent  poll, many people are concerned about this situation and speak  of the need to debate how Japan should deal with it. I have  proposed that national debates be held on the relationship  between the Constitution and Japan's exercise of the collective  self-defense right." Kanda states: "The government is going so  far as to reinterpret the Constitution to allow Japan to  exercise the collective self-defense right." Uehara notes the  SDPJ's effort to alter its long-established security policy and  says: "The SDPJ has to honor the policy agreements reached  between the SDPJ and other coalition partners."    Turning to economic sanctions against the DPRK, Yamamoto  asks  Funada to comment on what Japan should do if the economic  sanctions are imposed. Funada states: "In principle, the issue  of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons should  be settled through dialogue. Various actions should be taken  against North Korea if the dialogue does not go as hoped. The  question can be raised about how Japan should act within the  framework of the United Nations. If the United Nations makes  various recommendations and adopts various resolutions, Japan  should of course deal with them within the framework of the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-South Korea Friendship  Treaty, and the Constitution. What I have advocated is that  Japan should deal properly with the economic sanctions within  constitutionally permitted limits."    Noting that "it remains uncertain whether China will vote  for  the economic sanctions or not," Sakaguchi states, "Komeito hopes  that the United Nations will decide to slap on the economic  sanctions if the nuclear issue is not satisfactorily resolved.  But the United Nations may fail to slap the economic sanctions  against North Korea and Japan will have to think of what it  should do if the United Nations fails to slap the economic  sanctions."    Discussing the possibility of a naval blockade against the  DPRK under the economic sanctions, Yamamoto asks panelists to  comment on how Japan should deal with the naval blockade. Kanda  says: "If the naval blockade is imposed, the Defense Agency  will deal with it in consultation with the Foreign Ministry,"  adding that he hopes such a naval blockade will not be imposed.    Kakizawa states: "Mr. Yamazaki said just a while ago that  the government is not prepared for the naval blockade. I think  that various ministries and agencies have been asked to study  how Japan should deal with the naval blockade. Now, the  international community is working to settle the nuclear issue  through dialogue. In view of moves taking place yesterday and  today, there is a possibility that the nuclear issue could move  in a good direction. Therefore, I would like to refrain from  openly discussing what Japan should do if the dialogue does not  go well."    Ide says: "The nuclear issue should be settled through  dialogue. With regard to economic sanctions, North Korea has  been isolated economically from the rest of the world and I  believe that economic sanctions will not yield the desired  results. Economic sanctions will not produce the desired effect  if China refuses to go along with them since it shares a border  with North Korea."    Kikunami reiterates the importance of dialogue and notes  that  the "set of policy agreements reached among the coalition  partners aims to let Japan join the economic sanctions." Citing  a congressional report in the United States, Kikunami says:  "The United States plans to use nuclear weapons, impose a naval  blockade against North Korea, and launch air strikes on North  Korea's nuclear facilities."    Kakizawa notes that the United States and European nations  are deeply concerned about the DPRK's suspected development of  nuclear weapons, adding that "according to a poll, a majority of  Japanese are greatly worried about North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear weapons." Kakizawa also stresses that  "the government has been working for a peaceful settlement to  the nuclear issue instead of whipping up a sense of crisis among  the people."    Continuing the discussion of how Japan should deal with  economic sanctions against the DPRK, Sakaguchi notes the  importance of defending the security and peace in Asia and the  Far East including Japan and states: "It is important and a  matter of course to seek a settlement to the nuclear issue  through dialogue."    Yamazaki states: "The diplomatic efforts have been left to  the United States and North Korea, and I believe that this is  not desirable. I think that Japanese politics should move to  settle the nuclear issue."    Kakizawa says: "Japan has continued diplomatic contacts with  North Korea in Beijing and the United Nations. North Korea's  basic policy is that it is not in a position to discuss the  nuclear issue with Japan. As you well know, North Korea has  been attaching great importance to dialogue with the United  States. North Korea has been moving to link the nuclear issue  to normalizing relations with the United States. Japan has  maintained close contacts with the United States and South  Korea. With regard to the question of whether Japan should  participate in the U.S.-North Korea talks, Japan has to make a  realistic judgment. As Mr. Yamazaki indicated a while ago,  Japan thinks that it has to do something. However, I believe  that it is proper for Japan to take a wait-and-see attitude."    Discussing the question of putting economic sanctions on the  DPRK, Kikunami states: "The JCP is opposed to North Korea  possessing any nuclear weapons. The JCP is opposed to it from  the standpoint of keeping the world free of nuclear weapons. To  speak of the U.S. and Japanese Government positions, the United  States presently possesses 10,000 nuclear warheads and it will  retain them forever. Therefore, the United States has asserted  that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] should be  extended indefinitely. The United States thinks that there is no  problem with its nuclear weapons, but it does not tolerate other  nations possessing them. The United States has asserted that if  one nation is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, then it  will face economic sanctions. This is illegal."    In response, Kakizawa notes that "India and other nations  have indicated problems with the NPT" and says: "In reality,  many other nations are greatly concerned about nuclear  proliferation. Therefore, Japan believes that the NPT should be  in place as written."    Asked by Yamamoto to comment on the NPT, Yamazaki says: "If  North Korea has nuclear weapons, I would oppose extending the  NPT indefinitely. At present, however, I favor extending the  NPT indefinitely. If one of Japan's neighboring nations becomes  a nuclear power, causing the fear of global nuclear  proliferation, Japan should not agree to extend the NPT  indefinitely."    Kakizawa responds: "If North Korea possesses nuclear  weapons, it would bring a major change to the current security  framework for Northeast Asia. I think that such a major change  will not be in the interest of Japan's security. Therefore,  Japan has worked hard for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.  Japan has announced to the world that it will honor the NPT.  The government has no intention of altering that policy."    Turning to the subject to Japan's bid for a permanent  membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC], Yamamoto says  Prime Minister Hata is vigorously pushing for Japan's bid and  then asks the panelists to comment. Kakizawa discusses the  reform of the United Nations including the UNSC and says: "The  mood is growing that Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a  permanent member will serve to strengthen the UN's functions.  With that mood in mind, Prime Minister Hata has said Japan  intends to contribute to the international community within the  constitutionally permitted framework as a permanent UNSC member."    Kanda states: "The Hata government intends to make Japan  join the UNSC as a permanent member and I personally support  this intention."    Funada says: "In principle, the ruling coalition parties  support Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member."    Yamazaki says: "In principle, the LDP supports Japan  becoming a permanent UNSC member," adding that it is necessary  to hold national and political debates on the question of  Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member.  Yamazaki also stresses: "Japan should have a decisive say in  the UNSC."    Sakaguchi says: "Domestic debates should be held before  Japan joins the UNSC as a permanent member. I think that Japan  should become a permanent UNSC member since it is the second  largest financial contributor to the United Nations, following  the United States."    Uehara says: "I do not oppose Japan joining the UNSC as a  permanent member if conditions are created whereby a way opens  for Japan to become a permanent UNSC member."    Ide states: "Japan should not openly seek to become a  permanent UNSC member because Japan has yet to decide what it  can do after joining it. Although the United States and Britain  support Japan becoming a permanent member, that does not mean  that they are asking Japan to take that status."    Kikunami states: "The JCP opposes Japan becoming a permanent  UNSC member from a constitutional standpoint." Explaining  reasons for the JCP's opposition, Kikunami cites the possibility  of Japan getting involved in UN-sanctioned military actions.    Commenting on Kikunami's statement, Kakizawa says: "Japan  will participate only in PKO [UN peacekeeping operations]. Even  if the United Nations creates a force in accordance with Article  42, the member nations cannot participate in the force unless  they conclude an agreement with the United Nations in accordance  with Article 43," adding that the United Nations does not intend  to create the force immediately.    Turning to the political situation, Yamamoto notes remarks  by  SDPJ Secretary General Kubo that if the Hata Cabinet resigns en  masse after the 1994 budget bill is passed in the Diet, the SDPJ  will aim to return to the ruling coalition and form a new  coalition government. Yamamoto asks panelists to comment on  Kubo's remarks. Yamazaki says: "Mr. Kubo has made important  remarks."    Uehara states: "Mr. Kubo's remarks are important. I  believe that the SDPJ will debate his remarks. If the ruling  coalition parties value the SDPJ, they should listen to what the  SDPJ has advocated."    At 0115 GMT, Yamamoto concludes the roundtable discussion  after thanking the panelists.</p>

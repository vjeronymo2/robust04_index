			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Eldar Nebolsin's encores redeem a lost hour - An impressive performance by the young Russian pianist and Grand Prizewinner of the Santander competition All unawares, I reached the Wigmore Hall on Friday evening just in time for the interval; my newly repaired watch had somehow mislaid an hour during the afternoon. It was frustrating to hear such excited reports of what young Nebolsin had been doing with Liszt's 'Dante' Sonata, and with Beethoven's op. 31 no. 3. Fortunately, there was enough meat in the second half of his programme to stretch him again: the excited reports proved to be entirely in order, and I was sorrier still to have missed his 'Dante'. Nebolsin was born in 1974, like the prodigious Siberian violinist Maxim Vengerov, and in a still more exotic corner of Russia ' Tashkent, where he pursued his studies until only a year and a half ago. He works now with the teacher Dimitri Bashkirov in Madrid, and last year he was Grand Prizewinner at the Santander competition. The continuing westward stream of precocious Russian artists, whose difficult times at home are driving them abroad, must be discouraging for their Western coevals. How do those 'provincial' Russian music-schools contrive at once to polish their budding solo performers to a dazzling virtuoso gloss, to instil in them a firm respect for period manners, and yet to leave their communicative energy and imagination untrammelled? European conservatoires hardly ever manage that: with their products, between lusty individual attack and revealing musicianship it's usually one or the other. Still a somewhat gangly adolescent, Nebolsin springs at the piano like an instinctive performing animal. His technique is brilliantly articulated, with a bias toward the feral pounce and sharp clang of Horowitz's style. Everything he does is alight with feeling. Here, in Chopin's B minor Sonata, the Scherzo and Finale glittered to urgent purpose; the languorous, visionary byways of the opening movement weren't indulged (Nebolsin's range doesn't run so far yet), but given crisp up-tempo treatment as moments within the overall form. All of it was bracing to hear, electric with conviction. In a couple of the Chopin Mazurkas, he captured just the second-beat-in-the-bar mazurka-lift that we missed last week in Marc Laforet's. (For want of it, as I wrote then, his came rather near to sounding like French valses.). In Sofia Gubaidulina's 1962 Chacon, forming her first bold 'serial' exercise, Nebolsin's address was forceful, lean and linear where two weeks ago Andreas Haefliger had conjured up warm, suggestive hazes from the residual hints of tonality. For encores it was no surprise that the young Russian should choose extrovert, heart-on-sleeve Rakhmaninov; nor that he should deliver it with such resounding fervour. Some scatterings of wrong notes were forgivable and forgettable; with Nebolsin they amounted to mere flecks upon a palpably vital current.

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTABLE CLASSROOMS SNAG PLAN FOR SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A LACK OF BUNGALOWS MAY ELIMINATE AN OPTION FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.  THAT MAY FORCE ADOPTION OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE TO CREATE  SPACE.  </P> <P> After months of protracted, often acrimonious debate, Los Angeles Unified  School District board members last month thought they had finally wrestled the  district's most intractable problem to the ground.  </P> <P> By a narrow margin, board members voted to contain the overcrowding that has  crippled the district by putting all 600 of its schools on a year-round  schedule next year, and requiring each of them to accommodate 23% more  students.  </P> <P> But the plan has been snagged by tactical problems that the board must try to  untangle today, when it decides how to implement its overcrowding relief plan  in the 109 elementary schools that will be the first to increase their  capacities this year.  </P> <P> Last month, those schools were told they could choose from among three options  to increase their seating capacity: They could put two more children in each  class, add bungalow classrooms or convert to multi-track, year-round operation,  which puts groups of students at a school on staggered attendance schedules  that run throughout the year.  </P> <P> But the board also has voted to restrict those options by not allowing a school  to use portable classrooms to push its enrollment beyond 1,000 students. That  means, in effect, that 63 of those 109 schools may have no choice but to go to  the multi-track, year-round plan, which many parents oppose as disruptive to  families.  </P> <P> In addition, 25 other schools that would likely have opted for portable  classrooms may be forced to go year-round instead because bungalows will not be  available this year.  </P> <P> The dilemma of how to provide schools with as much choice as possible while  fairly spreading the burden of relieving overcrowding has resurrected the deep  divisions among school board members and alarmed parents, who thought the issue  was settled with last month's vote.  </P> <P> "You think you have options, then the next thing you hear is you really don't  have a choice," said Cathy Fisher, a parent at Dixie Canyon Elementary School  in Sherman Oaks. "It's all kind of confusing. I think lots of parents are just  holding their breaths."  </P> <P> Dixie Canyon is on the list to increase its capacity this year, and parents and  teachers would very likely have chosen to increase class size and use bungalows  when the vote is held on the options next month.  </P> <P> But those bungalows would not arrive until July, 1991, and the school board is  now locked in debate over whether schools like Dixie Canyon should be allowed  to wait a year, until they get their bungalows, or be forced to use the only  remaining option to increase capacity -- a multi-track, year-round schedule.  </P> <P> To many parents who were counting on using bungalows to avoid going  multi-track, year-round this year, the news that the board may not allow them  the leeway to acquire the portable classrooms has been a disappointing blow.  </P> <P> "We're trying to be optimistic, but a lot of parents are looking at private  schools, just in case," Fisher said. "Our time is running out to make decisions  for next semester, and we still don't know where we stand."  </P> <P> District officials say it would cost between $7.5 million and $10 million to  supply 100 portable classrooms to the schools expected to request them this  year, and it would take up to 18 months to get the bungalows on campus because  of the time-consuming state review process and the building alterations that  would have to be made at some schools.  </P> <P> The money would come from the district's $80-million developer fee account,  which can only be used for portable classrooms or construction to relieve  school overcrowding.  </P> <P> More than half of that money is already committed to school building projects,  and some board members question whether it is wise to spend so much on portable  classrooms in a district that desperately needs new schools and find it  increasingly difficult to get the state to pick up the tab.  </P> <P> And, finances aside, board representatives from some of the district's most  crowded areas say they oppose allowing some schools to wait a year, calling  that unfair to the 63 campuses that have no choice but to adopt multi-track  year-round schedules because they are already too large or don't have enough  playground space for portable classrooms.  </P> <P> "I'm pained by this whole idea that 63 schools have no choice," East Los  Angeles board representative Leticia Quezada said at last week's board meeting.  "If we're going to give 63 schools no choice because they have no space . . .  that ought to apply to all 109 schools and not just to some."  </P> <P> Quezada accused the district of being "tremendously accommodating" to those  schools -- mostly on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley -- that want  portable classrooms, and "patently unfair" to the most-overcrowded schools.  </P> <P> And South-Central Los Angeles representative Rita Walters -- who voted against  the year-round plan -- blasted her colleagues for leaving a "huge loophole"  that could allow many schools to escape the capacity increase requirement this  year.  </P> <P> "Again, all the choices accrue to those people in those schools that are not  overcrowded," she said.  </P> <P> Walters has threatened to urge schools on the list in her district to refuse to  adopt multi-track, year-round schedules if other schools that want -- but  cannot get -- portable classrooms are not forced into multi-track operation  this year.  </P> <P> But district officials say allowing the schools that request portable  classrooms to wait a year would not hamper the overcrowding relief plan, and a  majority of the board seems inclined to agree to the delay when it votes at  today's meeting.  </P> <P> By waiting, the district would lose about 3,000 of the 21,000 seats the plan  was expected to create at elementary schools this year, according to Gordon  Wohlers, whose office devised the overcrowding relief plan. That would not pose  a problem unless far more than the expected 11,000 new elementary students show  up to enroll next fall, he said.  </P> <P> But some board members fear that letting certain schools on this year's list  wait a year to generate more seats is likely to compound the problem of adding  space next year, when another 100 schools must find ways to increase their  capacities.  </P> <P> Over the next three years, all the district's schools are mandated to increase  space for students by 23%. Many of those schools will want to rely on portable  classrooms to ease overcrowding rather than the more controversial multi-track,  year-round schedule.  </P> <P> The district generally spends between 10% and 15% of the more than $40 million  it collects each year in developer fees on portable classrooms. That is far  short of the $10 million or so it would take each year to keep up with the  expected demand for the bungalows.  </P> <P> Because money is so tight, the board is hard-pressed to find other ways to deal  with the district's overcrowding crisis, which results in more than 20,000  children being bused away from their neighborhood schools each day, at a cost  of $2.8 million a year.  </P> <P> Today, the board will examine another method of creating more seats when they  vote on whether to consider relaxing the district's integration guidelines at  126 schools that are more than one-third white, in order to find more space for  minority students from overcrowded schools.  </P> <P> Although the district's goal is to maintain integrated schools -- with no more  than 60% minority enrollment -- its growing proportion of minority students and  the need to find space for them outside their neighborhood schools have  combined to force changes in those integration guidelines at most of the  district's 600 schools.  </P> <P> The changes to be proposed today would allow district staff to study whether 72  magnet schools and 54 other schools that serve as receivers for children bused  from overcrowded areas could accommodate up to 70% minority students without  leading to segregation.  </P> <P> Those schools are the only remaining campuses in the district that still adhere  to the 60% minority limit. As the district has become more than 85% minority,  schools have been studied and switched to the 70/30 integration ratio to  accommodate growing minority enrollment.  </P> <P> The changes would allow more minority students to attend magnet schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District has been struggling for years to find  ways to accommodate its fast-growing enrollment. This month, public meetings  will be held at elementary schools that must increase student capacity this  year. In April, parents, teachers and staffs of those schools will vote on  individual school plans to reduce overcrowding. Over the next three years, all  district schools will follow this process to increase capacity.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special provisions for worksite facilities which are not employers of H&hyph;1A nurses and are not controlled by employers of H&hyph;1A nurses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A facility (other than a private household) which obtains the services of an H&hyph;1A nurse by contracting with a nursing contractor, but which is itself neither the employer of any H&hyph;1A nurse nor controlled by the employer of any H&hyph;1A nurse (see paragraph (k)(1) of this section), shall file an attestation with ETA pursuant to this subpart. Such a worksite facility may request from ETA a waiver of specific elements of the attestation to avoid duplicative attestations, in cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause. The attesting worksite facility shall be to ably demonstrate the existence of the circumstances or good cause which are asserted as the basis(es) for the request for a waiver of a particular element of the attestation, but need not submit such evidence with its request for waiver, except evidence with respect to a bona fide medical emergency (see paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Worksites employing, seeking to employ, or filing visa petitions on behalf of H&hyph;1A nurses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An attestation with respect to which waiver is requested or granted pursuant to this paragraph (k) is not valid ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is not ``on file and in effect'') for a worksite facility employing, seeking to employ, or filing a visa petition on behalf of H&hyph;1A nurses. Only an attestation meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section (and paragraph (j) of this section, in the case of a nursing contractor) can serve as the basis for a petition for an H&hyph;1A visa. A worksite facility which uses H&hyph;1A nurses only through a nursing contractor and, as part of its attestation, requests waiver of one or more attestation elements nevertheless shall file a complete attestation in order to be able to use such attestation as a basis for itself filing a visa petition for an H&hyph;1A nurse. Thus, a worksite facility should consider its future needs for H&hyph;1A nurses in filing attestations and requests for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inapplicability of third attestation element: facility/employer wage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a worksite facility uses H&hyph;1A nurses only through a nursing contractor, the third attestation element (facility/employer wage; see paragraph (f) of this section) is not applicable to that facility, since the worksite facility is not the employer of the H&hyph;1A nurse and does not guarantee the H&hyph;1A nurse's wage. The third attestation element is required only for the employer of the H&hyph;1A nurse(s),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the third attestation element shall be included in the attestation of and met by the H&hyph;1A nurse's employer ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the nursing contractor). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Waiver of attestation elements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ETA may consider, pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) requests for waiver of certain attestation elements by a worksite facility which uses or will use an H&hyph;1A nurse provided by a nursing contractor ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , an ``H&hyph;1A contract nurse''), but which worksite facility itself does not employ, seek to employ, or file a visa petition on behalf of an H&hyph;1A nurse. Paragraphs (k)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section set forth different conditions for waiver depending on the number of workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services the worksite facility will use. For the purposes of this paragraph (k)(3), a ``workday'' shall consist of one H&hyph;1A contract nurse working for one normal shift in a day. Thus, for example, three normal shifts worked by each of a group of five H&hyph;1A contract nurses totals 15 workdays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimal use of H&hyph;1A contract nurses by a worksite. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it will use no more than a total of 15 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's 1-year period of validity to meet emergency needs on a temporary basis, ETA may waive the first (substantial disruption), second (adverse effect), and fourth (timely and significant steps or State plan) elements of the attesting worksite facility's attestation. See paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section; see also paragraphs (f) and (k)(2) of this section, with respect to the inapplicability of third attestation element (facility/employer wage). ETA shall not waive pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(i) the fifth attestation element (strike, lockout, or intent or design to influence bargaining representative election) or the sixth attestation element (notice). See paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Short-term use of H&hyph;1A contract nurses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it will use no more than a total of 60 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's 1-year period of validity to meet temporary needs, ETA may waive the nursing shortage component of the first element (substantial disruption; see paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section) and may waive the fourth (timely and significant steps or State plan; see paragraph (g) of this section) element of the attesting worksite facility's attestation. See also paragraphs (f) and (k)(2) of this section, with respect to the inapplicability of third attestation element (facility/employer wage). ETA shall not waive pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) the no-layoff component of the first attestation element (substantial disruption; see paragraph (d)(1) of this section); the second attestation element (adverse effect); the fifth attestation element (strike, lockout, or intent to influence a bargaining representative election); or the sixth attestation element (notice). See paragraphs (d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Long-term use of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it will use more than 60 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's 1-year period of validity, ETA shall not waive any attestation element, except that, if the attestor documents a bona fide medical emergency warranting a waiver of the fourth attestation element (timely and significant steps or State plan) ETA may waive such element. See paragraph (g) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agents of worksite facilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A worksite facility (including a worksite facility which itself employs or seeks to employ an H&hyph;1A nurse) may authorize a nursing contractor to act as its agent in preparing and filing the worksite facility's attestation; however, a worksite facility using an agent for preparation and filing of the attestation is responsible for the contents of such attestation and remains liable for any violations which may be disclosed in any investigation under Subpart E of this Part, and the chief executive officer of the worksite facility shall sign the original attestation, as required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

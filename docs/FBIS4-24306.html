			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Constitutional Conference is to  reconvene today after yesterday's adjournment. Members will  spend the next few days analyzing the address by the head of  state, General Sani Abacha. The conference adjourned sitting  soon after members (?checked) into the conference. Inaugurating  the conference, Gen. Abacha said that the tenure of power for  the administration would be determined by the outcome of the  National Constitutional Conference. State House correspondent,  Ogie Ogbonnaya Ogie reports:    [Begin recording] [Ogie] Gen. Abacha said that the  clarification was necessary as a result of the debates and  arguments which the tenure of office of the administration had  generated in some quarters.    [Abacha] We are aware that it's neither in our personal  interest nor that of the nation to perpetuate ourselves in  power. [applause] Nothing could be further from our plans. It  ought to be clear, according to the laws guiding politics that  [words indistinct] political factors viewed from all quarters of  national life, the most logical process will be activities  leading to elections into the various tiers of government which  the Constitutional Conference will recommend. [applause]    How do we now begin searching for an exit date when it is  unclear what the Constitutional Conference would decide? The  amount of time required to establish the framework for realizing  the various decisions of the conference depends on the nature of  those decisions. An attempt to fix a date totally without  reference to the decisions of the conference will not only  appear to jump the gun but will surely be seized upon by a fresh  [word indistinct] of cynics to suggest the administration is  teleguiding the conference. We are also not unmindful of the  high price the last administration had to pay when it set dates  and had to change them because of one exigency or the other.  [applause] We wish to avoid that mistake and ask that our  actions and commitment to the democratic process should speak  for themselves.    [Ogie] In the 30-page inaugural address, the head of state  also listed areas which the conference must properly examine and  spell out its acceptable constitutional provisions to ensure  fairness, justice, and equity as well as allay the fears of some  ethnic groups who have been complaining of marginalization.    [Abacha] You have the mandate to deliberate upon the  structure of the Nigerian nation and state and to work out the  modalities for ensuring good governance, to provide for our  people a system of government guaranteeing equal opportunities,  the right to aspire to any public office irrespective of state  of origin, ethnicity, or creed and thus engender a sense of  belonging in all our citizenry. [applause]    Our 34 years of sovereign existence has been beset with a  history of continuous political uncertainties. We have had  crises of legitimacy, crises of succession, crises of authority,  and crises of nationally acceptable leadership. Our country is  today resolved to terminate this vicious circle of crises.    [Ogie] Gen. Abacha also advised the conference to critically  examine the advantages and disadvantages of both the  parliamentary and presidential systems of government and produce  any terms of democratic government or recommend a system that  will be consistent with the Nigerian culture, ethnic diversity,  and other peculiar social systems to developing countries. The  head of state also identified the judiciary, social services,  state freedom, security agencies, and the economy as areas which  the conference must give priority attention to in its  deliberations. Gen. Abacha said it was a challenge for the  conference to find solutions to military interventions in  politics.    [Abacha] This conference has the crucial responsibility to  examine why out of the nearly 34 years of our independence, 24  years have been spent under military rule. It is clearly a  manifest, not least among the Armed Forces themselves, that  there is a great wealth of opinion that the cycle of military  interventions be terminated. [applause] It has become imperative  that [words indistinct] permanent, irrevocable, and binding  arrangements will permanently end the coup culture in Nigerian  politics. We will do all to identify and rectify the systematic  [words indistinct] line rather than dwell on simplistic  behavioral explanations if we are to make any sensible progress  in this regard.    [Ogie] The inaugural ceremony attracted people in various  walks of life. Service chiefs, members of the Transitional  Ruling Council, ministers, state administrators, (?governors)  and their families also witnessed the occasion. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (4): Clouds gather as tide begins to turn - Investment banks / In the US, they have been forced to tighten their belts The impact of the steady rise in US interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve this year has been felt around the world in stock, bond and currency markets. The value of financial assets has not only suffered, but clouds have been cast over the outlook for industrialised economies. Yet, nowhere has the impact of the Fed's actions been more keenly felt than on Wall Street. After three years of unprecedented prosperity, the fortunes of US investment banks have deteriorated in the past two quarters, and many firms - both big and small - have begun to lay off staff in an attempt to rein in costs. The downturn in earnings among the leading investment banks this year has been dramatic. Every one of the big Wall Street firms posted lower earnings in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley's profits fell 46 per cent, Bear Stearns' profits tumbled 74 per cent, Lehman Brothers' revenues slid 22 per cent, J P Morgan's trading revenues were more than halved, and Salomon Brothers incurred a loss of Dollars 410m. Even Merrill Lynch, which as an 'integrated' securities firm is partially protected from a declining investment banking business by its hefty presence in broking and asset management, saw its profits fall 37 per cent. Although the declines are not as disturbing as they may seem at first glance  -earnings were falling from the record highs that were achieved during 1993  -there is little doubt that the investment banking cycle has turned a corner. From 1990 to the end of 1993, US interest rates tumbled to their lowest levels for more than 30 years, sparking a boom in securities trading and underwriting the like of which had never been seen before on Wall Street. However, since the Fed decided to slow down the pace of economic growth and stave off inflation by sanctioning an interest rate rise in early February, the tide has turned. By mid-August, there had been five monetary policy tightenings which pushed short-term interest rates up from 3 per cent to 4.75 per cent and long-term interest rates up from just over 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Investment banks have been hard hit by the rise in interest rates because rising rates have had a negative impact upon their business in three distinctly different ways. First, higher rates have depressed bond and stock prices in the US and overseas. Lower securities prices have shown up on investment banks' books in the form of lower trading profits as traders' short-term strategies - many of them based on an outlook of low and stable interest rates - unravelled. Some banks' problems have been exacerbated by their use of derivative instruments, which can exaggerate the negative impact on securities prices of rising interest rates. Equally as damaging, banks started to run up huge paper losses on their securities inventories, because they were buying stocks and bonds from distressed customers that they could not sell on again. It was a sharp drop in the value of its inventories that was the chief factor behind Salomon's huge loss in the second quarter. Also, the rise in rates has contributed to unsettled global foreign exchange markets, which has left big investment banks nursing large currency trading losses. Second, higher rates have led to a slowdown in securities underwriting, traditionally one of the most profitable businesses for investment banks. When rates are low, companies rush to borrow money on the capital markets, mostly by issuing debt. Banks reap the rewards as underwriters and traders of that debt. But since interest rates began to rise in February, demand for banks' debt underwriting services from corporations has steadily fallen. At first, underwriting volumes held up quite well, but as it became clear that rates were going higher, volumes plunged. In the second quarter this year, companies issued debt in the US worth Dollars 161bn, down 42 per cent from a year earlier. Underwriting activity in the equity market has also eased, mostly because the fall in share prices has created a climate unfavourable to new stock issues. Over the first half of the year, the issuance of new shares by companies in the US fell 21 per cent to Dollars 37.6bn. Third, higher interest rates have had a direct impact upon investment banks' finances. The industry's earnings between 1990-1993 were so strong because the slope of the yield curve - which tracks the relationship between the yield on a security and its maturity - was unusually steep. This allowed banks to take out short-term loans at around 2 per cent to 3 per cent, and invest the proceeds in longer-term securities paying out interest rates of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. Since the Fed began tightening monetary policy, short-term interest rates have risen faster than long-term interest rates, thus flattening the slope of the yield curve and reducing the banks' ability to reap large profits on their interest earnings. As investment banks' profits have fallen, so management across Wall Street has been forced to tighten their belts. For the first time since early 1990, a group of big firms have announced sizeable lay-offs. In August, Merrill Lynch, the industry leader, cut 90 people from its fixed-income department. That came a week after PaineWebber, another 'integrated' firm, trimmed its bond department payroll. More recently, Smith Barney dismissed 15 investment bankers, including several managing directors. The lay-offs, however, are a precautionary, rather than a panic, move. In spite of the difficulties of 1994, investment bankers are not unduly pessimistic about the longer-term outlook. However, the interest rate outlook is unclear. Analysts remain to be convinced that this year's tightening by the Fed is having the desired effect of slowing the economy and keeping inflation under control. Also, amid the gloom about falling bond prices, and declining trading profits and underwriting revenues, there is one bright spot in investment banking - the continued revival in the mergers and acquisitions business. This year, M&amp;A activity has been strong, with a series of huge deals in the telecommunications, entertainment, health care and defence industries keeping investment bankers busy.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Reform club's new member: Privatisation in Ukraine has begun at last As he brought down the hammer to open the first privatisation auctions in Ukraine, Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the parliamentary commission on economic reform, joked that his historic wooden mallet could eventually be worth more than any of the small businesses on sale. Yet last Saturday's modest auction of 17 restaurants and shops in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv - out of a total 4,000 small state businesses in the city - was the most concrete sign yet of the government's intentions. It showed it is serious about transforming one of the most conservative of the former Soviet republics into a market economy. If market reforms succeed, Ukraine could form a stable and prosperous buffer state between eastern Europe and Russia. But if they fail, the region could be destabilised as nationalist forces in Ukraine and Russia, both of which possess nuclear weapons, stoke up simmering territorial and military disputes to distract the public's attention from economic collapse. Ukraine's economy certainly needs radical change. The most populous republic after Russia, it has a budget deficit equal to 36 per cent of gross domestic product and an accelerating inflation rate of more than 50 per cent a month (13,000 per cent a year), which have undermined its fledgling new currency, the coupon. Last November, parliament granted Ukraine's new government the authority to rule the crumbling economy by decree. The cabinet has responded with a stream of reforms to liberalise prices and cut the budget deficit. Food prices tripled at the end of December as subsidies were cut, and the number of people entitled to social welfare payments has been reduced from 20m to 2m. These tough measures have convinced sceptics that the prime minister, Leonid Kuchma, believes in economic reform. But Ukraine's task is even more difficult than that of Russia, where reforms appear to have stalled, because Ukraine faces obstacles to economic change from outside as well as within the state. Ukraine remains heavily dependent on oil from Russia and trade with the other former Soviet republics, which together accounted for more than 80 per cent of Ukraine's trade and more than a third of total industrial production before the collapse of the former Soviet Union. But economic relations with Russia have deteriorated. The breakdown of rouble-financed trade, once Russia stopped accepting non-Russian roubles last summer, has left Ukrainian enterprises with Rbs426bn in unpaid bills from Russian concerns, and no convertible currency in which to conduct trade. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent last year. Meanwhile, the price of Russian oil has increased by 3,000 per cent over the past year, while consumer prices rose by 2,500 per cent. Even at these higher prices, Kuchma says that Ukraine will not be able to obtain enough oil this year. Last week the Russian prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, announced that Ukraine would get only 15m tonnes of oil in 1993, less than half last year's level. In addition, Russia has raised prices for natural gas and threatened to cut off supply if Ukraine does not pay up. The government also faces powerful domestic obstacles to progress. In recent years the economy has been hijacked by Ukraine's industrial elite. Factory managers have sold off company assets for personal profit. Last year, for example, they illegally re-exported 8m tonnes of state-supplied oil. They also managed to get Rbs1,325 billion of unbacked monetary credits in order to pay wages, a rise of 800 per cent in the stock of outstanding domestic bank credit compared with 1991, driving Ukraine into hyperinflation. 'Opposition to commercialisation comes from officials who have very specific economic interests which they are protecting,' says Viktor Pynzenyk, minister of the economy and architect of the reforms. Yet Ukraine hopes for one compensation from its sluggish embrace of the market. By beginning reforms a year later, it believes it can learn from Russia's failure to control inflation and stimulate output. The Ukrainian government argues that Russia put too much faith in stabilisation and the promise of western aid, without confronting the more reactionary ex-Communist forces in the state bureaucracy who still control the economy. Ukraine's reformers, working closely with World Bank officials in Kiev, believe that the key to success is liberalisation and small-scale privatisation in order to bypass the bureaucrats. Without these measures, the government says it will be unable to meet its target of bringing inflation down to between 3 and 4 per cent a month by the end of this year. Agriculture is to be privatised first: 13m Ukrainians are already landowners and produce 25 per cent of total food consumed in Ukraine. Reform-minded regions will be encouraged to pursue rapid privatisation of state property, following Lviv's example. To enforce reform outside Kiev, the government is preparing a package of decrees that will bypass the local councils dominated by ex-communists, by bringing regional governments directly under the control of the cabinet. The directors of Ukraine's 6,000 large state enterprises, at present answerable only to workers' collectives, will have to sign employment contracts with the state in the first quarter of this year. Yet even if Kuchma, himself a former factory director, can control conservative regional officials and industrialists, his reforms are unlikely to succeed if trade fails to revive and Ukraine cannot secure a reliable, affordable energy supply. Kuchma says restoring trade links with former Soviet republics is now a priority and supports moves to establish a new payments union for inter-republican trade. But Ukraine's leaders believe that Russia's motives in raising energy prices and restricting oil supplies reflect not only economic self-interest but also a political desire to bring Ukraine to heel. Ukraine's oil quota this year is 1m tonnes less than Russia has promised Belarus, which is one fifth Ukraine's size but has acceded to all of Russia's political and military demands. Russia's deputy prime minister Viktor Shokhin said last week that Russia will tie the continued supply of fuel to military and political conditions, including stationing Russian military bases in Ukraine. 'I cannot understand the Russian position,' Kuchma said last week. 'It can only be seen as pressure on Ukraine, motivated by something beyond economic considerations. This is a conflict in which there can be no victors.'</p>

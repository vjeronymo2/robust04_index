			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Talk returns to interest rate prospects BOURSES changed tack as talk turned to the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow and the chances of a German discount rate cut, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose 9.42 to 1,897.69, and the Ibis-indicated DAX index put on another 10 points in the post-bourse to close at 1,907.72. However, brokers said that the market was in a waiting phase as turnover eased up from DM5.7bn to a moderate DM6.2bn. Miss Heidemarie Hoppner at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that participants were looking ahead to the Bundesbank meeting, and German inflation figures on Friday. Meanwhile, Volkswagen fell another DM6 to DM368 on selling orders from abroad, and the adoption of short positions by domestic professionals. MAN, the truckmaker and engineer, lost DM2 to DM321.50 for a two-day drop of DM9.50 on Monday's profits slump and dividend cut. In retailing, Kaufhof stood out with a gain of DM11 to DM536.50 in anticipation, said analysts, of good half year results shortly. PARIS regained ground after a day's low of 2,114 for the CAC-40 index, to end 12.03 higher at 2,123.40. Turnover rose from FFr2.4bn to FFr3.2bn. Euro Disney, which fell sharply at the start of the week on negative media reports, picked up some of the losses on bargain hunting to see a day's high of FFr57 before closing unchanged at FFr56. LVMH, which announced that it was to take control of Desfosses International, the French newspaper group, added FFr32 to FFr4,175. In banks, BNP CI's were down FFr1 at FFr598. James Capel upgraded the stock to a long-term buy, noting that the forthcoming privatisation would coincide with an expected pick-up in the economy in 1994 which should see 'falling levels of provisions due to lower loan losses and write-downs'. Since the current rally in BNP began at the end of last month, the CI's have risen by 13.5 per cent. AMSTERDAM picked up momentum after a negative start to the week, the CBS Tendency general index adding 0.7 to 127.8 in brisker turnover. Wolters Kluwer featured after a solid advance in first half profits, the shares rising 70 cents to Fl 99.00, off the day's high of Fl 100.20. Elsewhere in the publishing sector, Elsevier eased 10 cents to Fl 143.80. Considerable activity was also noted ahead of today's results for Gist Brocades, the food group, which put on Fl 1.80 to Fl 47.60. ZURICH closed mixed, the SMI index rising 5.1 to 2,472.4. Brown Boveri fell yet again, this time by SFr12 to SFr884 after its Swiss/Swedish operating company, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, announced plans for 15 factory closures in its plans to streamline its structure. The watchmaker, SMH, added SFr40 to SFr1,165 on Monday's news that it had opened its first watch store in China, and that the store had been mobbed by some 5,000 people. Chemicals rose on plans by the Swiss investment company, Pharma Vision, to increase its capital. MADRID set another new high, the general index rising 2.74 to 293.84, pinning its hopes on the Bundesbank and seeming to ignore the Bank of Spain's decision to leave a key repo rate unchanged. STOCKHOLM fell back on disappointment with first half results from Svenska Handelsbanken which fell SKr16 to SKr130. The bank also announced plans to raise SKr2.7bn from shareholders. The Affarsvarlden general index slipped 21.80 or 1.7 per cent to 1,269.80 while the banking index was off nearly 8 per cent. Asea B fell SKr8 to SKr471 after Asea Brown Boveri's major reorganisation announcement. COPENHAGEN lost nearly 2 per cent on profit-taking, with shipping and bank shares reported weak as the KFX index fell 1.77 to 97.73. WARSAW continued its unprecedented ascent as the WIG index soared 9.6 per cent to a new record of 7,001.1, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The rise came mainly from private domestic investors crowding in to buy the 19 stocks quoted on the WSE as turnover reached 499.9bn zlotys (Dollars 27.5m). According to Mr Woldzimierz Magiera, deputy head of the exchange, the number of daily buy and sell orders has reached 25,000, compared with 3,000 a day two months ago. At the end of July the number of investors registered with broking offices had reached 102,000 and is growing by 5,000 a month. Foreign investors hold some 25 per cent of the value of the stocks on the exchange, which is capitalised at Dollars 1.5bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices August 24 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1294.71  1296.05   1295.45  1293.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1376.05  1376.28   1374.42  1374.00                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1294.67  1296.14   1297.14  1296.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1374.90  1375.79   1375.80  1375.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 23    Aug 20    Aug 19    Aug 18    Aug 17 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1291.83   1297.31   1304.07   1303.09   1284.89 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1374.00   1380.12   1385.51   1387.63   1368.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1297.80; 200 - 1377.89 Low/day: 100 - 1293.30 200 - 1373.06.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

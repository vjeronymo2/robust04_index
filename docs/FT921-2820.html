			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Brittan seeks to impose fines over French Eurocheque deal SIR LEON Brittan, the European Community's competition commissioner, is trying to win approval from his colleagues for the Commission's first fining of banks as punishment for an allegedly anti-competitive deal struck by French banks and Eurocheque International, the European cheque guarantee and cashcard organisation. However, any fine is unlikely to be heavy, since it would relate to a first-time offence in the banking sector and because the Eurocheque agreement expired last year. The issue was supposed to have been discussed by the Commission today but was postponed to its meeting next Wednesday, partly because of the potential sensitivity of such a ruling for French commissioners. Some of Sir Leon's colleagues also remain unconvinced about the seriousness of the infringement, arguing that the deal may have in fact helped Eurocheque expand in France. The Commission's competition authorities are worried that the 1983 agreement between Eurocheque, itself operated by a group of European banks, and the French banks may have discriminated against the use of Eurocheques in France. Commission officials believe this may have been part of a general policy on the part of the French banks to encourage the use of cards rather than cheques. The Commission does allow under competition rules for EC banks to levy a fee on Eurocheque customers' accounts each time they use a cheque, which can be written in any EC currency. But according to Commission officials, Eurocheque agreed separately with Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, which operates the Visa and Eurocard plastic card networks in France, that the banks could also earn a fee from traders who accepted Eurocheques in payment. Commission officials believe that the agreement might have led French traders to penalise all customers by marking up prices to cover the fees. At the same time, officials say that the relatively low penetration of Eurocheques indicated that French banks were making it difficult for French clients to use or acquire the cheques. Dunlop Slazenger International, the UK-based sports goods manufacturer, is almost certain to be fined by the European Commission today for trying to prevent its squash and tennis balls being sold cheaply outside Britain. Brussels says the group has been abusing EC competition rules since 1977. Newitt, a British sports equipment wholesaler, complained to the Commission that Dunlop Slazenger, a subsidiary of BTR, the UK holding company, was restricting continental European sales other than through its own distributors. According to the Commission, Dunlop Slazenger refused to sell tennis and squash balls to wholesalers, or tried to price other exporters out of the market. In the Netherlands, the Commission alleges that some Dunlop Slazenger distributors agreed with the British group that they would buy up cheap exports and sell them at the higher continental price. The Commission said yesterday it might start to fine 28 Dutch builders' associations up to Ecu28,000 (Pounds 20,000) a day if they do not wind up an alleged cartel immediately. The Commission last month imposed fines of Ecu22.5m on the cartel, which it said had dominated the Dutch construction industry for the last 12 years. It also began legal proceedings against the Dutch authorities, which Brussels believes condoned the restrictive practices.</p>

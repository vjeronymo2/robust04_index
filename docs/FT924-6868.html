			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Political Notebook: When innocence is not enough THE government was guilty. John Major is innocent. Such was the judgment offered by a former member of the Thatcher government on the Iraq arms trade saga. As the story unfolds, it looks as good an assessment as any of the state of play so far of what Mr Alan Clark refers to as the 'actualite'. The charge of government guilt was not meant to imply a great conspiracy to arm Saddam Hussein. For all the talk of a smoking gun, nothing has emerged so far to suggest that ministers and their officials conspired from their smoke-filled Whitehall offices to help build the Iraqi war machine. We now know, for example, that officials agonised before granting an export licence for four, yes four, shotguns destined for Baghdad. Many other borderline requests were turned down. But Downing Street has as much as admitted that the documents now in the hands of the media demonstrate that overall the government's behaviour in private was not consistent with its public stance. After the ceasefire which ended the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, the guidelines restricting defence-related sales were relaxed, in effect allowing the export of more 'dual-use' equipment. Clever civil servants drafted parliamentary replies which encompassed this shift but which effectively concealed it from MPs. The government insists now the rules were 're-interpreted' rather than changed. But nine months ago it admitted to the Commons trade and industry committee that one clause in the guidelines had been replaced. This all leaves enormous scope for semantic arguments when Lord Justice Scott's inquiry gets under way. We can expect all sides to consult their dictionaries to determine what constitutes a change of policy and what can be more reasonably described as a re-interpretation. The debate will be important because in the last resort the affair will damage the government only if it is proved that ministers consciously misled parliament over the guidelines. Ordinary people may judge that the most important issue is whether companies or politicians broke the law. Or whether ministers would have happily allowed three directors of Matrix Churchill to go to jail to avoid the release of some embarrassing papers. But such are the peculiar values of Westminster that more often than not politicians are punished not for the act of wrong-doing but for attempting to conceal it from the Commons. Some of his erstwhile colleagues hope that Mr Clark - at the centre of the web in his roles as a trade minister and then a defence minister - will be 'fall guy'. But there is also considerable anxiety in Whitehall about the police investigation into Mr Clark's apparently conflicting statements. If there are skeletons to be found - and it is clear that Matrix Churchill was far from alone in supplying controversial equipment - Mr Clark knows which cupboards to open. That leads to Mr Major's role. So far there is no evidence that during his brief sojourn as foreign secretary or during his longer spell as chancellor Mr Major had anything that could be called a significant role in the discussions over trade with Iraq. But both Mr John Smith and Mr Paddy Ashdown judge that his failure in subsequent exchanges to acknowledge that the guidelines were relaxed in 1988 leaves him vulnerable to charges of abetting a Whitehall 'cover-up'. The opposition leaders want to harry Mr Major into making mistakes. They want to implant also the notion that the only excuse he can offer for not knowing the full story is incompetence. If it not a question of guilt, the opposition argument runs, then it is one of competence. Mr Major is taking the row seriously. He spent much of the weekend in 10 Downing Street poring over the files to confirm his recollection that he was not implicated. Sir Robin Butler, his cabinet secretary, was relaxed enough to go off to watch the South African rugby team. The prime minister thought it more important to draft a detailed rebuttal of Labour charges. But he must be careful. His obvious irritation at what he regards as scurrilous accusations may provoke mistakes. Last week he blamed Mr Clark for misleading him. This week he issued a blanket assertion that past ministers had not misled parliament. It is difficult to square the two. Mr Major has to demonstrate that he is competent as well as innocent.</p>

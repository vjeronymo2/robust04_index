			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Penalties on life policies may be limited LIFE assurance companies could face limits on the charges they pass on to customers who terminate policies before maturity under measures proposed by a consultant to Lautro, the industry's self-regulating body. The proposals could require companies to make significant changes to the system of paying sales agents. The current system allows commissions to be paid 'up-front' as soon as the policy is signed. The proposals could also address one of the most persistent consumer complaints about the life assurance industry - the small percentage of premiums which are refunded to those who cancel policies early. Those who cancel within the first two years of the policy may lose up to 100 per cent of the premiums they have paid. A recent study by the Securities and Investments Board found that between a quarter and a third of all policies are cancelled within the first two years. The proposals are contained in a paper written by Mr Marshall Field, a consulting actuary for Bacon and Woodrow, who has been asked by Lautro to review the industry's commissions structure. Lautro will decide later this year whether new regulations on commissions are necessary. Mr Field argues that the industry practice of charging all the sales commission to the cancelling policyholder may be unfair and unwise. He says companies would have more incentive to prevent the sale of policies to those for whom they are inappropriate if they had to bear more of the costs themselves. The case against charging sales costs to those who end their policies early becomes even greater in the case of those who were sold in appropriate policies and are being charged for the mischance. He proposes that sales costs be passed on in the product design. Thus, the life fund might be charged with a fixed - and publicly disclosed - amount each month to cover the sales costs for policies which last until maturity and those which do not. If more policyholders maintained their contracts until maturity, the life fund would earn additional profits. Windsor Life, the Telford-based life assurance company, said yesterday that Lautro has lifted a 'voluntary suspension' of its sales force. The suspension was imposed on March 19 following a revision of train-ing and testing procedures. The company also said that its chief executive, Mr Brian Wood, has resigned and has been replaced by Mr William Yelverton, head of international operations at New York Life, Windsor's parent company.</p>

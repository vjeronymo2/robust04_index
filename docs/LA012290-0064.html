			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHIGAN STATE'S PERLES SAYS HE IS NEGOTIATING CONTRACT WITH JETS  </P> <P> Michigan State Coach George Perles apparently has been offered the Jets'  coaching job.  </P> <P> The 55-year-old Perles told a Pittsburgh television station Sunday that he's in  the process of negotiating a contract with the Jets.  </P> <P> "When you're talking to people and you're negotiating, you certainly try to  keep as much of it to yourself as you can," Perles told WPXI-TV, Pittsburgh's  NBC affiliate, in a brief interview at the airport. "I don't feel comfortable  negotiating in front of the cameras. I've got some work to do on this."  </P> <P> Perles, accompanied by an assistant coach, was in Pittsburgh to recruit players  in the area.  </P> <P> Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg, at the Senior Bowl Saturday, said he would  have an announcement "real soon."  </P> <P> One possible holdup is Perles' status at Michigan State. Perles is a strong  candidate to become the athletic director.  </P></p>

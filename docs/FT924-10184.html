			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Salinas signals electoral reform PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday signalled modest electoral reform and underlined his government's commitment to fiscal austerity in his annual state-the-union address. The president also announced that the Bank of Mexico's reserves had risen to Dollars 18.258bn (Pounds 11.1bn), allaying fears that there had been a large outflow of capital in early October. Reserves, announced just three times a year, were Dollars 18.023bn in August. Mr Salinas outlined a three-point plan for electoral reform, in an apparent effort to end the post-electoral demonstrations that have forced three state governors to resign in just over a year. The plan addresses criticisms that the electoral process is loaded in favour of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party. A new law, which would be negotiated between the political parties, would make the source of party finances transparent, set ceilings on electoral expenses, and attempt to ensure more impartial electoral processes and more equal access to newspapers and television. The president emphasised his government's fight against inflation, forecast to fall below 10 per cent next year. 'The stability of prices has proved to be the best way to achieve sustained real growth of salaries. Because of this, we will not relax fiscal discipline, and we will maintain the financial surplus in the public sector.' He said the fiscal surplus would not be reduced to boost demand, and strict fiscal discipline would be maintained 'even when we reach single-digit inflation'. Mr Salinas highlighted the need to raise the savings rate, to promote more investment, and to raise productivity. In an apparent response to concerns about Mexico's widening current account deficit, expected to come close to Dollars 20bn this year, Mr Salinas raised for the first time the issue of the dumping of foreign products in the Mexican markets. 'We will face greater pressure from imports of foreign products that cannot find buyers in their own markets, but we can counter this by mounting an effective guard against unfair trade practices.' He said: 'We must ensure that imports do not enter the country under terms of unfair competition. Consequently, we have strengthened mechanisms to defend ourselves against unfair trade practices.' On the domestic front, he said he planned a constitutional amendment to make secondary education compulsory. Economics Notebook, Page 19</p>

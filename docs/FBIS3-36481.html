			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Russian Vice Foreign Minister </F> Aleksandr Panov by HANGUK ILBO Moscow-based correspondent Yi  Chang-hun on 3 February]    [Text] [Yi] Reacting to a rumor about the deployment of  U.S. Patriot missiles to the ROK, North Korea threatened that it  will cancel the withholding of its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. As a result, the situation on  the Korean peninsula is becoming alarming. Do you think that the  U.S.-North Korea talks and talks between the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will be successful?    [Panov] Russia does not think that U.S.-North Korea talks  and IAEA-North Korea talks have been ruptured. Russia's  position is that the talks should continue. The North Korean  nuclear issue should be resolved under the IAEA's control for  peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. There were some  successes, although limited, in U.S.-North Korea talks in the  past. However, the talks were recently suspended and many  difficult problems are laid on the road toward a third round of  talks.    Russia is discussing the North Korean nuclear problem with  the United States and China, not to mention the ROK, and there  are no remarkable differences in the positions of each nation.    These nations share the view that North Korea should settle  nuclear negotiation with the IAEA at an early date and should  accept the nuclear inspection.    [Yi] What is your view on the possibility and prospects for  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as discussed during  U.S.-Russia summit and talks between Russian and Chinese foreign  ministers?    [Panov] The only way toward the resolution of  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at present is to bring  about concrete fruition in U.S.-North Korea talks and in  IAEA-North Korea talks. Although talks are very difficult and  may face a stumbling block, it is important to continue the  talks in a manner of dialogue.    [Yi] What is your opinion on the multilateral security  cooperation system proposed by the ROK for peace and stability  on the Korean peninsula?    [Panov] Russia basically supports this. This plan is a  method enabling one to resolve various problems pertaining to  security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean  nuclear issue. The relevant countries are making efforts to  achieve this plan.    The ROK established diplomatic relations with Russia and  China. What is left as a pending issue is North Korea's  normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. If  the North Korean nuclear problem is solved and normalization of  relations is achieved, an important progress will be registered  in efforts to promote security on the Korean peninsula and in  the Northeast Asia.    [Yi] Do you think the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary  system will proceed smoothly in North Korea?    [Panov] I debated on this issue with relevant American and  ROK figures when I served as Russian Ambassador in Seoul. We  have drawn a conclusion that it is difficult to predict how the  North Korean society will change in the future. Since North  Korea is an extremely closed society and flow of information is  restricted, analysis and assessment of the practical situation  on the progress of the hereditary system are very difficult.  However, international society shares the view that  stabilization in North Korea's political situation is important.    [Yi] When do you think President Kim Yong-sam will visit  Russia and what are the important agendas?    [Panov] Russia is hoping that President Kim will visit  within this year, and is preparing for this. We believe that  with President Kim's visit as an occasion, the two nations will  solve the pending issues including Russia's debt to the ROK, and  will further promote cooperation in various domains of relations  between the two countries including domains of politics,  economy, and culture.    [Yi] What is your opinion on the possibility of expanding  economic cooperation between the two countries and on proper  means for a solution to Russia's debt to the ROK?    [Panov] The amount of trade between the two countries last  year was $1.5 billion--a 40 percent increase from the previous  year--and the amount is expected to increase further. We are  well aware that because of uneasiness in the political situation  in Russia, ROK businessmen from small and medium-size  enterprises are reluctant to advance to Russia. However, Russia  will be stabilized in the future. For example in cooperative  relations between Russia and the ROK, a ROK firm advanced to  Russia's Far Eastern district through the introduction of the  Russian Embassy in the ROK, and established a joint-venture  textile plant there. This firm has earned a great amount of  interest by exporting its products to the United States. ROK  businessmen, who wish to advance to Russia, may inquire of  Russian Embassy in Seoul about method and procedure of advance.  Since reshuffle of Russian cabinet members was carried out  recently, I cannot tell you precisely at this moment about the  method as to how the Russian Government will resolve the issue  of its debt to the ROK and of its interest payment. At present,  relevant officials within the Russian Government are exchanging  their views on measures for solving the problem.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECALL PETITIONS BEGIN CIRCULATING IN BURBANK  </P> <P> Petitions seeking the recall of two Burbank city councilmen accused of favoring  developers were approved Monday. Circulators have 120 days to gather the  signatures of about 9,000 registered voters before the issue can be placed on  the November ballot.  </P> <P> The attempt to recall Michael Hastings and Thomas Flavin was begun in February  by three residents upset over what they called "uncontrolled development, greed  and political giveaways."  </P> <P> "We have found overwhelming support for the recall and dissatisfaction with the  way the city government is going in Burbank," said Ted McConkey, who along with  two others filed the petitions. "People are just fed up. They have seen their  community changed from primarily single-family residences . . . to multiple  apartment units."  </P> <P> The recall petitions must be signed by 20% -- or 8,720 -- of Burbank's 43,600  registered voters.  </P> <P> In response to the petitions filed with Burbank's city clerk, Flavin  characterized the recall as "an irresponsible action driven by political  motives." Hastings accused those seeking the recall of being "unprincipled  dissidents."  </P> <P> "I'm not scared. I'm concerned," Hastings said. "I'm not going to start blowing  the alarm until I see how serious these people are. This is a very bright  community, they'll see through this."  </P> <P> The city's only successful recall of a member of the City Council was in 1954.  </P></p>

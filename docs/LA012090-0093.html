			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIDS, CAMERAS: HE'S NO TENDERFOOT;  </P> <P> PRESIDENCY: BUSH SHOWS HIS SKILLS ON A FLORIDA NATURE WALK. HE ALSO PRAISES AN  OLD OPPONENT, JIMMY CARTER.  </P> <P> "I'm talking gigantic turtle. I mean large turtle," the President of the United  States said as he peered through a borrowed pair of binoculars at a  platter-sized terrapin basking in the south Florida sun.  </P> <P> With six sixth-graders from a local program for gifted children, President  Bush, accompanied by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., toured part of  the Everglades National Park Friday.  </P> <P> The day led to no new policy initiatives -- a government program to protect  endangered wetlands remains stalled by objections from the oil industry,  development advocates and Administration conservatives. But the tour did allow  Bush to demonstrate one of his greatest skills -- few politicians are more  comfortable working in front of television cameras with photogenic children.  </P> <P> "Look, there's a big alligator. That's a big boomer," Bush, dressed in an  open-collar shirt and tan pants exclaimed. "What do you know about alligators?"  he asked the kids.  </P> <P> "The male alligators eat the females' babies," one child responded. Bush  winced.  </P> <P> As ospreys, vultures and long-necked anhingas passed overhead, Bush and the  youngsters chatted and took lessons on south Florida ecology from park ranger  David Kronk, who said the park is endangered because of many conflicting  demands for the region's water.  </P> <P> "I guess you all can go away realizing you have to protect this resource," Bush  said. "You can't stop everything," he added, referring to the needs of the  region's growing cities and industry. "You need good management."  </P> <P> The group was precocious, talkative and carefully balanced to mirror the area's  ethnic diversity -- one black, three Latinos, an Asian, an Anglo. Bush  demonstrated his rudimentary Spanish with two of the children -- Que buena, he  said as he pointed out one bird. He asked them what they had learned about  protecting the fragile wetlands environment and answered typical school kid  questions.  </P> <P> "Is your car bulletproof?" asked one. "Yes," Bush replied.  </P> <P> "Can you open the windows?" asked another.  </P> <P> "They don't like that," Bush said, pointing to one of his Secret Service  bodyguards.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Bush traveled to Atlanta, where, at the site of last year's  Democratic convention, he offered unusual praise for a man he had blasted  during three national campaigns -- former President Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> In two campaigns for vice president and one for President, Bush had ridiculed  Carter, referring to him as the "master of malaise" and used him as a living  symbol of bad old days. Friday, however, his tenor had changed.  </P> <P> Referring to his thousand points of light volunteerism program, Bush said: "I  couldn't come to Atlanta without taking note of one such point of light, a  part-time carpenter and his wife who have provided shelter for so many in this  very city. And, of course, I'm talking about the former President Jimmy, and  Rosalyn Carter."  </P> <P> Since leaving Washington, Carter has worked with Habitat for Humanity, a group  that builds housing for the poor. His efforts have drawn widespread praise, and  the compliment by Bush was another in a series of signs that after years of  being a target of GOP attacks, Carter is making something of a comeback in  public opinion.  </P> <P> Bush's purpose in visiting Atlanta was a speech to the National Assn. of  Homebuilders. It was a highly sympathetic audience for his repetition of a  now-standard appeal for Congress to pass the Administration's capital gains tax  cut program.  </P> <P> Bush reiterated an Administration call for lower interest rates, the second day  in a row that the White House has applied pressure on the Federal Reserve Board  to ease credit.  </P> <P> "In the last few years, millions of families could afford a new home because  mortgage interest rates have dropped, from 18% in the early '80s to less than  10% today. But I want to see them come down even more. I am not satisfied at  10%."  </P> <P> Later, after the Everglades tour, Bush spoke here at a fund-raising event for  Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican who faces a difficult reelection  campaign despite the overwhelming margin by which Bush carried Florida last  year.  </P> <P> Martinez has been in trouble recently in part because of his strong backing of  restrictions on abortion.  </P></p>

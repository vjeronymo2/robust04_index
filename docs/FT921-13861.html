			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Brown - a dark horse AS CHANCE would have it, January 18 is the one day a year when I observe a ban on jokes about bookmakers. In my experience bookies are such a grasping, conniving group that it is fair to make jokes about them throughout the year, particularly if you understand the slick mechanics - the immensely profitable maths - of their parasitic business. But on January 18 I hold myself in check and tell myself: no bookie jokes. However, sticking to the ban is difficult. For example, this week I have been fossicking for value among the bookies' quoted odds on the UK general election. But my rummaging has been rebuffed. I rang one of the Big Three bookmakers. I won't say which one, except that its name includes an L, an a, a d, a b, an r, an o, a k and an e. The odds it quoted were as follows: Conservatives 5-6, Labour 5-6, hung parliament 1-2. You do not need a degree in cosmography to see that those odds are just a tiny bit cramped: an exemplum of the difficulty of locking horns with the bookies. What you should do when you see odds like those is walk away. So I did. I walked into Mayfair, to the home of my friend Jack Hillbrooke, Europe's richest bookmaker. You may not have heard of Jack. I am the only reporter he ever sees, which is why I am privy to most of the schemes cooked up by Jack and his North Korean-built computer, GREENGOD-VI. Jack was away. He is negotiating the formation of a chain of betting shops in Croatia and Slovenia. But Boris, Jack's minder, was there. Boris is ex-KGB. He invited me in and ushered me upstairs, into the perpetual video night-time (banks of computers, flashing TV screens) of Jack's private office. The only painting in the room is an incandescent nude by Piero Bellotti. I admired the painting, then passed through an unmarked door into a carnation-coloured room where GREENGOD-VI lives. (Of course he lives there. He has a mind. He passes all Turing tests with scandalous ease. In addition to a mind he also has a lisp, though it is a bit like mine: virtually undetectable except in showery periods). 'Hi, GREENGOD,' I said. 'Hi, Mike,' he said, flashing his coloured lights and greeting my arrival with an improvised version of the theme from ET. 'How is your luck?' 'Not good,' I said. 'The horses are killing me. I've been losing since Boxing Day. Flick-flick, snick-snick. I am bleeding, GREENGOD. I can't adjust to changes in the going.' (Among thousands of subjects, GREENGOD-VI is an expert on climatological change and the problems for horseracing, such as ruptured form lines, posed by global warming). 'I'll see what I can do,' said GREENGOD-VI. 'Otherwise,' I said, 'I've been trying to find value in the election odds, but they are horribly cramped: 5-6 the Tories, 5-6 Labour, a hung parliament at 1-2.' 'Flaky,' agreed GREENGOD-VI. 'Have no twuck' (I imagine he meant truck). 'What you must do is look for value in the odds quoted against the name of the prime minister at the end of the year. That ought to be fun. Also profitable. How much do you want to win?' 'Pounds 2m.' There was silence for a moment while the computer played with his lights, absent-mindedly composing a tone-poem of indigo, cobalt, coral and malachite. Then he started to hum ET again. I knew he was happy. 'The trouble is,' I said, 'that the bookies, again, are being ultra cautious with their prime minister odds. There may be two general elections. Possibly three. There could be fighting in the streets. Or else a riot of apathy. Either way, predicting who will be PM at the end of the year is not an easy task. But can I get satisfaction? I phoned L,a,d,b,r,o,k,e. They were charming but quivery, shook like jellies. They said that computing these odds was extremely difficult. Finally, they offered 5-6 John Major, 5-6 Neil Kinnock and 10-1 anyone else.' 'Flaky,' agreed GREENGOD-VI. 'Have no twuck. The man you should concentwate on is Gordon Bwown.' 'The shadow trade secretary?' I said. 'Labour's secret weapon? The man famous for his ability to cheer up a room just by leaving it?' 'You are out of date, Michael. They've been working on Gordon Bwown. As you know, I monitor every TV channel in Europe. I have been studying him closely. Gordon Bwown is now smiling. That is a singular development. The other night on Channel 4 he smiled at Michael Heseltine. Smiled, and then rubbished him. Absolutely singular. If you shop awound you'll get 20-1 against Gordon Bwown. Then you could move to Tawoudannt. In return, you'd take me with you. Just think what we could do.'</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Lie test seeks the truth on adverts A form of lie-detector test intended to help advertisers pinpoint what makes consumers buy products is being developed at the University of East London. Volunteers are being wired to a machine called a Grass Polygraph, which monitors changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and sweating. They are then given advertisements to watch, and peaks and troughs in the polygraph readings are measured. Professor Brian Clifford, head of the project, said yesterday that the research had potential to give advertisers 'the lowdown on how people process advertising'. The work is due to be completed within three months and several advertising agencies are already showing interest in the machine, Prof Clifford said. The intention is to 'look at the relationship between what people say they like about an advert and what the body or the brain is saying,' he said. It would be the first time there had been a scientific attempt to measure physical reaction to advertisements, rather than relying on what consumers say, he said. Prof Clifford dismissed fears that advertisers could rely too heavily on polygraph peaks and that all beer advertisements, for example, might consist entirely of naked women. 'It's much more complex and subtle than that, and the advertising agencies know that,' he said.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Trusts aim to tap zest for equities TWO NEW investment trusts are being launched as evidence continues to grow of private investor enthusiasm for equities. Johnson Fry is producing a second version of the utilities trust it floated earlier this year, while Abtrust is the latest group to offer an emerging markets fund. The Johson Fry Second Utilities trust will, like its predecessor, have a split capital structure and will invest in companies in the fields of gas, electricity, telecommunications and so on. It will have two classes of share; ordinary and zeros. The zeros will earn no income but will receive a fixed rate of capital growth; the gross redemption yield has yet to be decided but will be around 8.25 per cent. The ordinary shares will receive all the trust's income and the capital growth after the zeros have been repaid. The initial gross dividend yield will be 8 per cent, paid quarterly; and the shares will be available in personal equity plan form. The annual charge on the Pep will be Pounds 30 (including VAT); this reduces the gross yield to 7.5 per cent on a full Pounds 6,000 investment. If the assets and income of the trust fail to grow over its 10-year life, the ordinary shareholders will face a capital loss; that will reduce the gross yield to 1.8 per cent. But if assets and income grow by 5 per cent a year, the yield will be 10.7 per cent. Up to 102m ordinary shares and 48m zeros are available at 100p each. The initial expenses of the offer will be 4.2 per cent and the annual management fee 0.5 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 and there is a share exchange scheme for those with a portfolio of privatised shares. Abtrust is hoping to raise Pounds 50m to invest in emerging markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America; Pounds 27.5m of shares have already been placed with institutions. Shares are on offer at 100p each, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. The annual management fee is 1.2 per cent and the initial expenses 4 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.</p>

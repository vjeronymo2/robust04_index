			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAILING OUT FAILED SAVINGS AND LOANS  </P> <P> In just one week President Bush has managed to (1) exacerbate the conflict  between the pro-lifers and the pro-abortion groups, (2) propose a tax on  savings and loan depositors, and (3) endorse a 50% pay hike for Congress  despite opposition by a majority of Americans.  </P> <P> If this is his idea of a "kinder, gentler" America, then let me go back to the  harsh realities of the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> NICK NEWTON  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Solvay to buy Tenneco's Wyoming unit for Dollars 500m SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, is to strengthen its position as the world leader in soda ash production by buying Tenneco's Wyoming minerals operation for USDollars 500m. Solvay said yesterday that the deal, which should be completed by June, would increase its soda ash capacity from 4.3m to 6m tonnes a year. That represents nearly 20 per cent of the world market - greater than the combined share of its two biggest competitors. The deal will also further strengthen the balance sheet at Tenneco, which embarked on a wide-ranging restructuring programme in September. By June, the US conglomerate will have saved or raised Dollars 3bn, mostly through issues of equity, the sale of non-core assets, and cuts in costs and capital spending. The purchase marks Solvay's first move into 'natural' production in the US, which has by far the world's largest reserves of trona, the sodium-based mineral from which soda ash is extracted. Solvay pioneered the synthetic manufacture of soda ash, which is used for making glass and detergents, in the 19th century. Despite expanding its other activities in north America, it has not had a controlling interest in a US soda ash plant for decades. The Belgian group is buying Tenneco's 80 per cent share in a soda ash production joint venture at Green River, Wyoming, the rest of which belongs to Asahi Glass of Japan. The unit should produce 1.7m tonnes of soda ash annually after expansion, and has reserves of 170m tonnes. Baron Daniel Janssen, Solvay's chairman, confirmed that the plant was profitable and that natural soda ash production cost less than synthetic manufacture, but he would not reveal the profits or margins of the business. 'When you buy a mine you don't just buy sales or profits for the coming year, you buy the reserves in the mine for the coming hundreds of years,' he said. Solvay will pay Dollars 200m in cash, with the balance financed through Solvay's US subsidiary, which will take on Dollars 300m of long-term debt. That should increase the group's net debt to 35 per cent of shareholders' funds by the end of 1992, against 22 per cent at the end of last year, but Solvay said interest charges would be covered by cash flow generated by the new operation.</p>

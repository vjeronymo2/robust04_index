By 2020, China will have basically achieved it  mid-range goal of industrialization, and its socio-economic  development will basically have caught up to the level of  advanced nations. In the quarter century before this goal is  reached, it will be difficult to reverse the trend of a steadily  worsening environment, but the country and the society must  first lay down a specific policy before it can reduce the threat  and pressures of environmental degradation; After the first 20  years of the 21st century, China's ecological environment can be  genuinely improved, and economic development and the ecological  environment can begin to move forward on a coordinated course.    China Will Be Faced with Serious Environmental Pollution  Problems in the Next 25 Years    China must wage a protracted struggle to maintain suitably  rapid economic growth.    Between the 1950's and 1973, most of the world's developed  nations saw a sustained economic development, but they created  rather serious industrial pollution. In 1972 the U.N. Human  Environment Conference was held in Stockholm, and the "U.N.  Human Environment Report" was issued. It was recognized that  population growth and economic development were the basic causes  of the various pollution and ecological environment problems.  Western scholars, represented by the "Roman Club" felt that the  economic growth of various countries should be limited, and they  advocated the "low growth" and "no growth" ideas. The per-capita  GNP of the countries where those experts lived was between $U.S.  15,000 and 25,000, and even at that rate the proponents of those  ideas could not get any concurrence. China cannot accept "low  growth", much less "no growth". China's GNP averaged to the  population is only several hundred U.S. dollars, and China is  facing enormous pressures of rapid development, expanding  industries, rapidly rising incomes and standard of living. If it  were only a question of a rapid development, then the question  of the ecological environment could be gradually solved. With  the booming economic development and influx of foreign  investments following the reforms in China, a six to eight  percent economic growth rate probably can be maintained for some  time. After 2020, the per capita gross national output value  will be about $U.S. 3,000 to 5,000, after which economic growth  will gradually level out, and the post-industrial stage will  have been reached.    In the first and middle stages of industrialization, the  economy will grow rapidly, and industries that consume large  amounts of raw materials and discharge large amounts of wastes  will inevitably play a primary role in that growth.    The steel and petroleum industries and the chemical  industries, building materials, thermal power, and paper are all  big consumers of raw materials and discharge large volumes of  pollutants, they belong to the three big ministries and the six  big enterprises who are the "big polluters". Because China was a  late starter in industrialization, the internal demands and  pressures are great, and these industries are in a long  historical process and still must quickly increase in scale.    By the end of this century steel production will have  reached  about 90 million tons, but China wants it to continue its growth  up to 2015, and a series of large- and middle-sized steel mills  will be built and expanded to make that possible. There are  nearly 20 large-scale petroleum bases in China today, and the  ethylene production capacity, existing and under construction,  is nearly three million tons, not one-fifth that of the U.S.,  and well below China's needs. By 2020, in addition to the  large-scale bases mentioned, more than 10 new bases will be  needed. Because of the low level of electrification in China,  and 70 percent of that is coal-power, and that can't be changed  much, but while nuclear and hydropower are increasing, the  desired new increase in thermal power will be 130,000MW to  150,000MW, and over 60 2,400MW big thermal power plants will  have to be built. Cement, paper, and common non-ferrous metals  will likewise need to be increased on a large scale.    China's population has maintained strong growth over the  last  25 years, and between 2010 and 2020 it will peak out; The  massive urbanization of the population will change the  consumption structure considerably, adding to the consumption of  energy and water, and waste discharge will also be on the  increase.    The per-capita consumption of energy in cities is three to  five times the rural rate, and the consumption of fresh water is  also much greater. If the population migration is not  controlled, by 2010, about 500 million people will be living in  urban areas, of which probably 200 million will be in clustered  towns in large- and middle-sized cities. They will be crowded  for space, and basic facilities will be lacking, adding to the  industrial and urban pollution, which will intensify the  ecological and social problems in those areas. After 2020, the  total population and rate of urbanization will diminish, and the  pressures on the ecological environment will ease.    The people's average income is still very low, and large  amounts of money will not be available for environmental  controls and ecological construction for some time to come.    Only through rapid development, namely through raising the  economic strength and level of well being, can any good portion  of the redistributed people's income be put into the protection  of the ecological environment. The U.S. is now putting two to  three percent of the people's output value into controlling  pollution, and in China, it is about one percent, and that is  not being used to full advantage for a variety of reasons.  <H5>  Two Strategic Ecological Environment Policies Must Be </H5> Implemented Simultaneously    China faces two kinds of ecological environment issues:    1. those primarily due to natural forces and human  agricultural practices;    2. those primarily due to industrialization and  urbanization processes.    Because of drawbacks in China's natural geographical  structure, large population, and unwise use of wastelands, there  has been serious erosion, encroachment of sand and salt,  diminishing grassland, and desiccation, which fall under the  first category of environmental issues. The second category  includes water, air, and land pollution, acid rain, the  greenhouse effect caused by CO[.sub]2[/] emissions, the  rising sea level, surface subsidence, sea-water encroachment,  insufficient water in concentrated industrial and urban areas,  overcrowding, and lack of minimal supplies for capital  construction, all caused by the industrialization and social  urbanization processes. These two categories of environmental  issues differ in respect of their formation and harmful effects,  and in their means of control.    China must, therefore, implement two different strategic  policies for correcting these environmental problems.    In the 40 years since reconstruction, there has grown a  general recognition of the effects of natural forces and  agricultural practices on the ecological environment, and State  and local funds, manpower, and materials have been put into the  effort to control and prevent ecological damage, including  scientific research and experimentation, which have had varying  degrees of success in reducing the worsening trend in ecological  problems.    The problems of pollution and other ecological environmental  issues caused by industrialization and urbanization have gotten  much attention since the 1970's, but the public consciousness  has yet to be sharpened on these issues. It should be regarded  with alarm that these pollution problems are growing worse every  day in the process of the rapidly developing economy, and  although public opinion, local governments, and basic  enterprises keep saying they want to control pollution, that  fact is that for financial, organizational, technical,  facilities, and management reasons, corrective actions to deal  with these environmental phenomena have still not reached  widespread governmental and social application. Therefore,  during the course of 20 years of economic growth, environmental  pollution has spread, and the threat has worsened. The rate of  ecological degradation from the second category of causes grows  much faster than that of the first category.    To infuse a lasting health into the diversified areas of the  society and the economy, the measures for implementing the  strategic policy of operating simultaneously on the two  categories of environmental issues, namely; continuing to  improve comprehensive controls on erosion, desert encroachment,  floods and droughts, while striving at the same to control  environmental pollution, surface subsidence and sea-water  encroachment, eliminate acid rain, and apply measures to improve  the living conditions in secondary urbanization areas, should be  elevated to status of the consummate strategy for creating a  better world for the future generations. The sure course for  reaching this strategic goal is:    (1) Improve theoretical and applied research on human,  natural resource, and environmental interrelationships, learn  their interrelational operating mechanisms, and publicize it  widely among the populace.    (2) Allocate a higher proportion of the people's income for  environmental controls. As the economy develops rapidly, the  government and enterprises should put more money into improving  the environment and controlling industrial pollution. Try to get  the amount of the gross value of national production that is put  into the ecological environment up to two percent by turn of  century.    (3) Implement macro-adjustments and controls on the  distribution of national industries in long- and mid-term  measures fitted to the special natural environmental features of  the various large regions and the load-bearing capability of  their environments.    (4) Clarify the responsibilities for pollution control, and  reform the product cost-accounting process. Enterprises should  factor into the production costs of their products all of the  funds that were needed for pollution control, tailored by the  amount of threat posed to society by their discharged wastes,  and other losses incurred therein, and the government should  pick up a part of that cost for input into special environmental  foundations to be used for environmental protection projects.    (5) Be frugal in the use of resources, and set up a  resource-saving socio-economic system. That should include  creating industrial structures that have low-intensities of  resource consumption, developing industrial technologies that  conserve or re-use resources and reduce the amounts of  discharged wastes.</p>

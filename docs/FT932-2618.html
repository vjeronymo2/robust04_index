			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank to open branch in Shanghai DRESDNER BANK will be the first German bank to establish a branch in China when it opens for business in Shanghai later this year. Mr Rolf Kanning, Dresdner's chief representative in China, yesterday said that approval for a Shanghai branch had been given at the end of April after the bank had made an application late last year. Dresdner has also applied to open branches in Guangzhou and in Shenzen, the booming development zone next to Hong Kong, as part of its strategy to capture a share of growing business opportunities in Asia. Approval is expected within the next few months. Mr Kanning said Dresdner's move was part of a 'long-term' strategy to establish a presence in China. Its main target customers would initially be joint ventures, but it hoped to broaden its business once foreign banks were permitted to deal in local currency. Hutchison Whampoa's retailing arm, AS Watson, has announced the formation of China's biggest integrated food manufacturing concern, Reuter adds from Hong Kong. Shanghai AS Watson Yimin Food Co, in which AS Watson has a 51 per cent stake, will cost USDollars 29m. Mr Ian Wade, Watson's managing director, said that Watson was also negotiating with its partner, the Shanghai Yimin No. 1 Food Factory, on a joint venture to manufacture soft drinks, which would cost USDollars 20m.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Workers prepare their French revolution - Two English designers who are moving to France YOU WOULD need to be a fairly assiduous follower of fashion to be absolutely au fait with what it is that Workers for Freedom do. Among a small, select, and international circle, they have had a serious following ever since they launched their first collection in 1985 and winning the British Designer of the Year Award in 1989 did them no harm at all. They manage to produce a collection which does the almost impossible: it has English roots and international appeal. They manage to be English without being either eccentric or going down the slightly updated classic route. Many of the fabrics are hand-dyed, hand-painted or embroidered and this high class craft element imbues each garment with a quality that seems to be what the 90s consumer is looking for. If there is a word to describe their clothes, it has to be romantic, and if not romantic, then whimsical. They are most famous for their deliciously frilled or embroidered shirts and fans like the model Catherine Bailey collect them, buying each new design as it comes out. Frances Mossman, deputy course director in textile and fashion at the Royal College of Art, remembers when she first discovered them and how she bought their famous silk shirt with the embroidered roses in every colour they did it in. 'They have that magic thing of being romantic and classic at the same time. I keep all my Workers for Freedom clothes and when I bring them out again find that they never look out of date.' Paul McCartney used them to design the clothes for his world tour. Jonathan Price wears their suits when he is collecting awards. For fans of Workers for Freedom there is both good news and bad. The bad is that Graham Fraser and Richard Nott, the duo behind the label, have closed their shop in Soho ('we were offered the kind of sum for our lease that we would have been silly to refuse') and are moving their entire operation to France. 'We had watched other friends of ours running big ad campaigns and film production companies by telephone and fax from their house in France and we realised we no longer had to be in London to operate.' They are, they swear, not giving up designing, it is more a search for a better way of living and working, away from the city. It is also, as many British designer have realised, about the only way of cracking the magic Pounds 1m barrier. 'Somehow,' says Graham, 'we have many successful designers who achieve Pounds 1m turnover a year but it is almost impossible to expand in the UK as there is no manufacturing base for designers of our kind of size. In Japan companies will willingly produce 60 metres of a special fabric, here nobody is interested in anything but large runs. If we want to expand internationally - and we do - we have to be able to farm out the manufacturing, the distribution and the selling, which are not what we are best at in order to be able to concentrate on what we are best at which is the designing. It is why designers such as Rifat Ozbek, Jasper Conran, Katharine Hamnett, John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood have had to seek management skills and extra funds abroad.' The winter collection is in the shops, the spring/summer group going into the shops after Christmas will be the last collection from London. There will be a hiccup while they miss next winter's collection and 'reassess designer clothing, where it should be going and what it should be doing.' The good news is that for all those who find Workers for Freedom prices (from about Pounds 190 for a blouse to Pounds 400 for a jacket) beyond their means they have designed a spring/summer collection for Littlewoods mail order catalogue. It will not be available until January, but in late December you can order a catalogue by 'phoning 0800-616-61156. Based entirely on black and white the most expensive garment in the collection is Pounds 49.99. There will be handknits for Pounds 34.99.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Blair signals strategy shift Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday revealed a subtle but significant shift in his party's strategy by avoiding the traditional reflex condemnation of any rise in interest rates. His reaction to the rise in base rates - spelt out in an article in today's Financial Times - contrasted sharply with the more familiar attacks from union leaders Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said Mr Kenneth Clarke was exaggerating the inflationary pressures in the economy. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public-sector union, called the move disastrous. But in the latest of a series of policy switches designed to mark out a distinctive leadership style, Mr Blair avoided direct criticism of the judgment made by Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Eddie George that action was needed to head off a resurgence of inflation. Instead of the more traditional 'soundbite' attack on any rise in borrowing costs, the Labour leader focused his attack on the government's broader economic management by stressing the underlying weakness of the economy which had prompted the risk of higher inflation. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, took up the same theme, describing the move as the price Britain had to pay for consistent under-investment in the economy. Writing in the FT, Mr Blair says that businesses and households have good reason to feel worried by a rise in borrowing costs when the economy is barely out of recession. But he stresses that the real political debate should not be about whether a particular rise in interest rates was justified. What counts is what the increase reveals about the long-term weaknesses of the British economy. It was a matter of 'acute economic judgment' whether the rise in interest rates could have been postponed. Mr Blair's decision to focus on the long-term problems facing the economy rather than on more immediate point-scoring is designed to reinforce the approach flagged earlier this year by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. But it will further anger those on the left of the Labour party who believe that the new party leader has been too ready to embrace fiscal and monetary conservatism. Reaction to the rise on the Tory back benches was relatively subdued. Some said Mr Clarke had given in too easily to Bank pressures while others shared the judgment of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, that he had been wise to act now rather than be forced into a larger increase later in the year.

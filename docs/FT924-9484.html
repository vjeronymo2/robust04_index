			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Keating seeks new deal over pay TV AUSTRALIA'S Labor government was yesterday preparing fresh legislation for the introduction of subscription television after compromise proposals received approval from government MPs. The proposals are the latest attempt by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, to meet the demands of existing media groups, potential new entrants and the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). However, the opposition parties which control the Senate, the upper house of parliament, responded coolly to the proposals. The conservative Liberal/National Party coalition and left-wing Australian Democrats combined to reject an earlier bill because of concern that it would allow existing broadcasters to dominate subscription services at the expense of new entrants and the ABC. The latest proposals attempt to meet these criticisms by providing two separate four-channel commercial licences, one reserved for new entrants, plus a two-channel licence and ADollars 12.5m (Pounds 5.4m) start-up funds for the ABC. Mr Keating told Labor MPs that Optus, the private telecommunications carrier which owns the satellites to be used for subscription TV, would use newly developed digital compression technology rather than the widely used analogue broadcasting system. The bill will also provide protection for Australian equipment manufacturers, and limit foreign investment, probably to a maximum of 35 per cent of each commercial licence, with a 20 per cent limit on individual holdings.</p>

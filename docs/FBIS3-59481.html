			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Endre Babus: "Prime-Ministerial Election; A Man </F> From Afar"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Peter Boross was born in 1928  in Nagybajom in Somogy county. Between the ages of 10 and 17, he  was educated in the Koszeg military academy. The strict  discipline of the school left a deep impression on him, as he  said in a later interview. After his graduation from the  Budapest law school (1951) he wanted to become an attorney, but  because "in the 1950's I was not a good enough cadre to do so,"  he found a position at the finance department of the Budapest  city council. He was discharged from that position in 1957,  according to his curriculum vitae, because in 1956 he joined the  revolutionary council of the intelligentsia. While he was under  police surveillance between 1957 and 1959, he worked as a food  service inspector, restaurant manager, and finally as a  traveling picture salesman. In the next half decade, he was  assistant manager, and then from 1965, for a quarter of a  century, he was at the head of the South-Pest Food Service  Company (DVV) as deputy director, and later as director.  [passage omitted]    Once, to a journalist's question whether as director he was  able to remain "untouched," because internal counterintelligence  had a predilection for infiltrating the food service industry,  his reply was "yes," but he added: "As far as I was able to have  an insight into this activity, an interest of this sort was not  directed at the world of food service and the economy."    Before his retirement his company established two  foundations. DVV created the Unity Foundation with a capital of  1,000,000 forints [Ft], primarily in order that the company's  employees would "rescue" the firm's property, namely that they  would be able to buy inns, cafes, and restaurants through the  Gastorg company, which was later established by the foundation.  A portion of the stocks of the Budapest catering establishments  given to Gastorg (for instance, the Hid and Attila restaurants,  the Torony restaurant, and the cafe Medikus) became the property  of Unity. Another packet of the stocks was given to the Country  Builder Foundation, founded by DVV in 1988 (at one time, Jozsef  Antall and Arpad Goncz were also on its board of directors),  established to preserve the spiritual inheritance of Karoly Kos.  Up to this day, the president of the board of directors of the  Country Builder Foundation is still Peter Boross (HETI  VILAGGAZDASAG, 8 May 1993).    When in May 1990 Prime Minister Jozsef Antall summoned him  to  the parliament, Boross thought of playing a role for at most two  years as a retired counselor. However, he first became political  under secretary, and later minister without portfolio. His task  was to establish the loyalty of counterintelligence and  intelligence. His statements after the blockade by the taxi  drivers suggest that he belonged to the hardliners. "A legal  crime was committed.... Of course one had to take into account  the kind of reaction an attack by the police would have elicited  in a yet unformed democracy of only five months. Let us not  forget that this took place a few days before our admittance to  the European Council," he offered a glimpse into the  government's cards in December 1990 on the pages of PESTI HIRLAP.    After the discharge of Balazs Horvath, after 21 December  1990, he became interior minister, and as such, deputy prime  minister in the prime minister's absence. In the first year he  was less visible, but after 1992--in August of that year he  joined the Hungarian Democratic Forum--he increasingly became  the strong man in the cabinet. He does not have many ties to the  1989 negotiated revolution and its participants. If there is a  person in the cabinet who is in favor of order, he is the one.  Once he explained that it caused a lot of problems that the  majority principle could not prevail in cardinal issues, due to  the two-thirds laws. He also criticized the law on legislation,  because it accorded too much power to parliament and thereby  slowed decisions down and made them sluggish. "My favorite  predecessor, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, who was in power during  the time of Horthy, issued an executive order to solve several  problems for which today I need a two-thirds majority. He was  able to achieve his goal in two months, while I need  one-and-a-half or two years," he said to PESTI HIRLAP in  December 1992.    In August 1993, when Jozsef Antall's illness became more  serious, he announced that he considered a transitional period  of at least 10 years necessary, characterized by a much stronger  executive power than the present one. "I am not the one saying  this," he emphasized another time, "but according to many  people... it is sometimes a mistake to be so constitutional." At  the beginning of 1993 he greeted with approval the "message" of  the conference on public administration, namely that present-day  modern states are being dismantled from above by international  treaties, from below by local governments, and from the inside  by trade unions. With reference to the interest of citizens he  declared: The spread of crime, the prevention of an increase in  environmental pollution, and the implementation of social  policies presupposes a strong state.    Although Boross, just like Jozsef Antall, has been for years  among the leadership of the Hungarian League on Human Rights, he  has a serious aversion to absolutizing freedoms. "After  individual values came to the front, Europe is now realizing  that it has gone too far.... Personal freedom is valuable only  as long as it does not entail the risk that someone could knock  me on the head in the street any time," he explained to  NEPSZABADSAG in his typical pragmatic way in August.    For a long time, his political ideas were remarkably close  to  Istvan Csurka's right-wing radicalism. He made negative  statements about the opposition. The opposition had no ideals,  he explained once. He had ideals: Unlike his "boss," he went to  Kenderes to the funeral of Governor Miklos Horthy. In his  assessment, in earlier periods of Hungarian parliamentarism the  attacks were more open and direct, that is to say, they had a  more "Hungarian" character. In some respects Hungary was in a  more difficult situation than Germany was after the world war,  he said in September 1992, because in Hungary the transition  took place peacefully. In Hungary, the spirit of the preceding  dictatorship has not been totally eradicated, he lamented.    On 23 October 1992, Boross at last endeared himself to  right-wing radicals. He urged Nurnberg-style trials to avenge  unpunished crimes. Still unclear is his role in the incident on  Kossuth square on the same day, when President Arpad Goncz,  freedom fighter of 1956, was prevented from delivering his  official address in part by youngsters bearing fascist insignia.  Because of this incident, a few days later in parliament the  Smallholder Representative Sandor Olah urged the interior  minister to resign. Instead of doing so, the interior minister  indirectly blamed the president for failing to deliver his  speech amid jeers.    About Istvan Csurka, whom he called his friend in the fall  of  1992, Boross allowed himself a few critical remarks only six  months later. However, at the time when the prime minister's  condition deteriorated, the criticism was mixed with a certain  amount of glorification. "Istvan Csurka's role was perhaps the  most significant in the period of dismantling the old regime.  One must not forget that. Just as Garibaldi's role in the period  of Risorgimento [revival, in Italian]. Then followed  the period of governing, and Cavour, who knew that registrar's  offices had to be established, systems of taxation had to be  introduced, and then one did not know what to do with  Garibaldi.... There are individuals who are suitable to lead in  certain historical situations, but are just about useless in a  consolidated historical situation," he brooded again in PESTI  HIRLAP in September 1993.    In the meantime, newer elements of his world view became  known. He declared that sooner or later the church must achieve  a proportion of 20 percent in education instead of the current 1  percent, because this was the only way it could have an effect  on Hungarian public opinion. As early as April 1993 he took  steps against the direct broadcasting of parliamentary sessions  on television. Instead, he proposed launching an "objective  daily summary." Ever since then, he has been devoting special  attention to the public media. During Boross's temporary "prime  ministership" at the time of Jozsef Antall's medical treatment  in Koln, the radical right wing implemented a takeover of the  state-run radio and television. Subsequently at a forum in  Veszprem he announced that "healthy country kids" were needed on  radio and television who spoke a more beautiful Hungarian.    The countryside-Budapest opposition has appeared in his  speeches before. "I have been living in Budapest since 1947, but  I have never become a real resident of Budapest. There is a  certain Budapest trait I don't like; arguing in cafes is not a  pasttime I find attractive." [passage omitted]</p>

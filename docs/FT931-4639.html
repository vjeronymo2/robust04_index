			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Brussels aims to cut phone bills with wider competition proposal A FAR-REACHING plan to open all domestic and international telephone calls in the European Community to competition is being considered by the European Commission. The plan would aim to cut the cost of calls and improve the efficiency of Community telecommunications operators. Brussels originally favoured opening the market for only cross-border calls within the EC. But senior Commission officials now believe the next wave of EC telecoms legislation should go further. They are urging the EC to set itself a more ambitious and controversial target of full liberalisation of 'voice telephony'. This could include all domestic and cross-border calls within the EC, and calls to countries outside the Community. Person-to-person calls represent between 80 and 90 per cent of the EC market. Nearly six months of consultations are said to have demonstrated that most operators, and almost all consumers favour far-reaching liberalisation and harmonisation proposals, partly for practical reasons. Officials will not reveal their ideal timetable for liberalisation, but hope to achieve open competition within 10 years. Poorer EC member states, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland, could be given longer to modernise their telephone networks. Commission consultations will end with two meetings between the Commission, operators and regulators at the end of this month. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC telecoms commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition, should decide whether to press for full liberalisation soon after. Mr Bangemann's spokesman said yesterday the commissioner did not yet have a view on the matter. Officials hope to receive political support for their plan at the scheduled meeting of EC telecoms ministers on May 10. The first phase of draft legislation would follow before the end of this year. The main battles are likely to be over the timing of a phased legislation. Member states will also have to work out how to safeguard public monopolies' commitment to provide an equal service to all consumers. British Telecom, the UK's largest privatised operator, wants the Commission to use special legislative powers to break open the market immediately. Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned German group, favours introducing competition on all long-distance calls, domestic and international, but says a formal decision should not be taken until the end of 1998, by which time it would have completed a DM60bn (Pounds 25.4bn) programme of infrastructure investment in eastern Germany. The Commission has already pushed through directives increasing competition in specialised data and information services, which account for about 10 per cent of the EC market. But hardliners within the Commission have always criticised the inflated cost of international and intra-EC calls, which they say hampers the competitiveness of EC companies. If the Commission decides to push for open competition, it will be evidence that the EC's executive has begun to recover its dented self-confidence. Last summer, the Commission twice delayed approval of a document on the liberalisation options to avoid annoying France before the referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The first phase of a new approach would be to ensure that existing directives have been enforced. The second stage would build on existing legislation allowing 'closed user groups' to lease lines from telecoms companies - for example, for communication between company offices.</p>

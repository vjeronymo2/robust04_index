			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: TCI takes stake in Microsoft on-line venture Tele-Communications Inc, the leading US cable television service provider, has acquired a stake in The Microsoft Network, a computer on-line service that Microsoft, the world's largest software company, plans to launch next year. For Dollars 125m in TCI stock, the cable group has acquired a 20 per cent stake in the newly formed Microsoft Online Services Partnership, a general partnership formed to develop and market Microsoft's on-line services. Microsoft currently holds the remaining 80 per cent. The partnership between Microsoft and TCI reflects the convergence of computer, communications and entertainment technologies which is expected to result in broadband on-line services within the next few years. Such services, delivered via high-speed communications lines, will be capable of offering interactive multimedia information, including video and sophisticated graphics. This is in contrast to today's on-line services, which are largely limited to text and simple graphics. 'As we build our broadband networks, this partnership will give us the ability to offer the Microsoft Network as a high-speed, interactive on-line service,' said Mr Bruce Ravenel, senior vice-president of TCI Technology Ventures, a division of TCI. Microsoft said the development of 'cable modems' - devices that link a personal computer to a TV cable network - would lift demand for on-line services and enable information providers such as news organisations and other publishers to gradually migrate their on-line service offerings to more sophisticated broadband services.</p>

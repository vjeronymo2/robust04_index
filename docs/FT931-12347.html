			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Asda stocks up The stock market so loves a recovery story that it seems inclined to forgive past disappointments. Yesterday, Asda swept in to collect another Pounds 347m of cash thereby pre-empting a pipeline of rights issues it believed was developing. The move came earlier than Asda would have liked. It therefore had scanty trading evidence with which to back its bold assertions. But investors did not seem to care. They marked the shares up 8 per cent anyway. This enthusiasm is unnerving for the food retailing sector. In the last couple of years, investors have handed over more than Pounds 2bn to grocery chains to fund expansion. They have also bid the sector up to a five-year high. But many of the retailers' expansion plans were based on the premise that others would drop out. Instead, there are likely to be six well-financed grocers in the FT-SE 100 by the year-end. Of these, Asda will still look the most vulnerable. At one level, all it will achieve through its two rights issues is to refinance its near-ruinous acquisition of 60 Gateway superstores. Its mountain of expensive short-term debt will be replaced by Pounds 700m of cheaper equity finance. The critical question remains whether Asda can successfully re-ignite growth. So far, the new management has excelled at squeezing improved profits from its Pounds 4bn sales base. But this process will soon run its course. Asda's greater financial leeway will enable it to revamp stores and launch its unproved Dales discount chain. But the market is placing extraordinary faith in Asda's long-term future in what increasingly looks like a zero-sum industry game.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEEPING OUT THE SWEATSHOPS  </P> <P> Sweatshops may seem inevitable in a region where many immigrants need work and  a huge garment industry needs cheap labor. But places that rob workers of their  right to decent wages and working conditions should not be allowed to exist  without at least some effort being made to control the abuses that occur.  </P> <P> While there are many legitimate garment manufacturers and contractors, there is  an underside to the industry that preys on workers who are either ignorant of  their rights or afraid to speak up. If caught, some unscrupulous contractors  consider fines merely the cost of doing business. Others simply close up shop  and disappear, leaving workers with meaningless IOU's for back wages. And even  though commercial home sewing is prohibited by state and federal law, there  also are home sewers who work for a pittance.  </P> <P> Even under the best of circumstances, it would be difficult to police the  industry. A lack of money, which slows many labor investigations, won't be  cured with a new law. Still, added tools of enforcement may be needed. In the  wake of a series of raids on sweatshops in Los Angeles and Orange counties,  Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has proposed legislation that would  make manufacturers liable for sweatshop abuses. Not surprisingly, the  manufacturers say that would be unfair. They claim they're being dragged in  only as "deep pockets" to pay for a bad situation they can't control, taking  the rap for a few bad-apple contractors.  </P> <P> Maybe. But there is a lot of winking and nodding going on in the garment  industry. It is not uncommon for manufacturers to bid one contractor against  another, for example, ending up with a price that everyone knows can't cover  basic wages. Joint liability would at least put them on notice that they must  build into their own costs a fair wage for sewers.  </P> <P> If manufacturers and contractors think they have better solutions than  Hayden's, let them come to the table to present them. The proposed legislation  at least started the discussion about new ways to address an old problem that  will only grow worse with neglect.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Epilepsy probe into video games THE FIRST national study of the possible link between computer games and epileptic seizures will be conducted with Pounds 19,000 from the Department of Trade and Industry. The aim is to discover how many children with no previous history of epilepsy are having seizures triggered by computer games. 'We all hear anecdotal case reports of this happening, but we do not know how much of a problem it really is,' said Dr David Fish of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, the study's co-ordinator. About 30,000 cases of epilepsy are diagnosed annually in the UK. Four per cent - 1,200 new patients a year - have 'photosensitive epilepsy,' which could be triggered by flickering light or flashing patterns of the sort generated by computer and video games. It can be identified only by an EEG (electro-encephalogram) test. Specialists in charge of hospital EEG departments - there are about 120 in the UK - will analyse all new patients with photosensitive epilepsy this summer and again during the winter and report in detail on cases involving computer games. The findings will provide a basis for public guidelines and possible regulatory action by the DTI, which has given the National Society for Epilepsy a Pounds 19,000 grant to conduct the study. Dr Fish said computer and video games could not cause epilepsy in children who were not already photosensitive, but they could in theory trigger a seizure in someone who might otherwise go through life without realising he or she had a latent problem. Leading game manufacturers include epilepsy warnings with their products. Threat to Nintendo, Page 25</p>

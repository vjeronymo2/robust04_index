			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Capital tax break urged for industry A Tory-led industry pressure group yesterday urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to introduce 100 per cent capital allowances in the Budget next month as part of a clear strategy for economic growth, David Owen writes. The Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance - chaired by Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield - said the move was vital to the future prosperity of the UK. The alliance also urged Mr Clarke to avoid any further tax increases. Mr Winterton said the government should 'give a boost to the economy'. He added that this should be 'specifically through lower interest rates, the introduction of 100 per cent capital allowances in the first year to encourage industry to invest in the new facilities vital to our continued competitiveness, and further, carefully targeted investment in the transport infrastructure and the public-sector building stock'.</p>

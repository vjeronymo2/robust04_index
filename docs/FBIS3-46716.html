Minister Kim Chol-su said at a staff meeting the need has  arisen to revamp his ministry's function and organization in the  area of trade and resources.    "We must make our ministry offices better meet new  administrative needs and fully adapt oursevels to changes of  time characterized by the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  talks," Kim said.    Ideas of reorganization discussed at the meeting included  the  creation of an industry technology bureau, and the integration  of trade promotion and trade cooperation bureaus and the office  of international cooperation into two bureaus: Trade policy and  international cooperation.    A ministry source said that if and when three offices are  merged into two, the post of deputy directorate would be set up  at each of the two new bureaus.    In the resources area, a tentative plan calls for the merger  of the existing four bureaus into two.    Resources development bureau would be merged into petroleum  and gas bureau while half of the duty of energy policy bureau  would be turned over to industrial policy bureau and the other  half to power energy bureau, the source said.</p>

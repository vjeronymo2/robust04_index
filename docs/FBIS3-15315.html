More than  5,000 representatives of various parties and social-political  movements, as well as 134 foreign observers from the Council of  Europe, CSCE and other organizations have followed them. "Will  these elections approach us to a real democracy?" wonders the  author, estimating that the electorate had voiced for "memories  of the past." Speculative political declarations on the  independence of Moldova, national problems, the cynical game  with "Russian-speakers" and pensioners gave the expected results  -- the victory of agrarians and socialists, Afanasieva asserts.  Forecasting an eventual evolution of social-political events,  the quoted source states that the opposition does not haste to  "take part in a coalition government," and neither do agrarians  want to share the power with them. According to the author, the  new parliament will stick in political problems -- the  Constitution, Dniester, the south. Under economical aspect,  realizing that reforms cannot be avoided, the Agrarian  Democratic Party of Moldova (PDAM) and socialists have striven  for power in order to "direct the chaotic motion towards a free  market, which the premier and president proudly call reforms,  into their own pockets." The scandal between agrarians and the  Privatization Department did not mean at all that PDAM is  against privatization, it rather dislikes that this process does  not belong to it. Eventual quarrels can occur between agrarians,  socialists and social-democrats only concerning the destination  of preferential credits. From the opposition's point of view,  we should he happy: "The more definite is the victory, the  sooner the unsolvability of winners will manifest," the authors  concludes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The United  States-China Business Council strongly supports extending the  Most Favored Nation trading status to China without conditions,  its president Robert Kapp said here today.    Kapp said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs that the  U.S. business arguments for maintaining normal and expanded  economic relations with China are clear.    He said that the standard arguments in favor of MFN renewal  are familiar:    -- Exports to China support hundreds of thousands of U.S.  jobs and are rapidly expanding;    -- U.S. firms have large and growing investments in China  that are at risk if trade relations collapse;    -- Unilateral U.S. sanctions unsupported by other major  trading nations will not succeed but will turn over economic  opportunities to our international competitors.    "The U.S.-China Business Council strongly supports the  continuation of normal trade treatment for the People's Republic  of China, through the renewal of China's MFN status without  conditions," Kapp noted.    "We will commit a policy blunder of enormous magnitude if we  rupture the economic and commercial links that our two countries  have worked to build over the past fifteen years," he said.    "We must pursue full engagement for the long term with  China," Kapp stressed.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOON PASSES OILERS TO VICTORY, 24-10;  </P> <P> AFC: HOUSTON QUARTERBACK BECOMES CLUB'S ALL-TIME LEADING PASSER IN WIN OVER  COLTS, ECLIPSING HALL OF FAMER GEORGE BLANDA.  </P> <P> Quarterback Warren Moon produced a record-setting performance and finally got  the Houston Oilers' run-and-shoot offense operating efficiently Sunday against  the Indianapolis Colts.  </P> <P> After two games filled with mistakes, Moon threw for three touchdowns and  became the Oilers' all-time leading passer during a 24-10 victory.  </P> <P> Moon completed 29 of 39 passes for 308 yards and connected on touchdown pass  plays of 13 and seven yards to Lorenzo White and six yards to Ernest Givins. He  threw one interception.  </P> <P> "Really, we needed a win more than I needed to set any kind of records," said  Moon, a seven-year veteran who now has 19,289 career passing yards, erasing the  record of 19,149 set by former Oiler quarterback George Blanda. "All this means  is I've had good receivers and I've been here a long time."  </P> <P> After both teams spent the first quarter victimizing themselves with mistakes,  Moon went to White for his touchdowns and a 14-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "We got things going in the second quarter, and that's what we needed," Oiler  Coach Jack Pardee said.  </P> <P> The Oilers (1-2) took advantage of four first-half turnovers by the Colts  (0-3), including fumbles by Jack Trudeau and Clarence Verdin and interceptions  of passes thrown by Jeff George and Trudeau.  </P> <P> "We had our chances, and we constantly stopped ourselves," Colt Coach Ron Meyer  said.  </P> <P> Trudeau replaced George in the second quarter when George was bothered by a  stomach ailment.  </P> <P> But Meyer had to send George back into the game in the final minutes after  Trudeau and Mark Herrmann were injured.  </P> <P> The CBS-TV affiliate in Indianapolis reported Meyer and offensive coordinator  Larry Kennan might be fired, but Colt General Manager Jim Irsay called the  report erroneous.  </P></p>

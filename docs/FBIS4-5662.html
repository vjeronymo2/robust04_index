			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has emerged as the most likely  successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as the  ruling coalition reached a last-minute compromise late Tuesday  [12 April] to avert a collapse, coalition sources said.    Representatives of the coalition parties are scheduled to  meet Wednesday to confirm their unity and hammer out policies  for a new government.    The coalition may agree to nominate Wataru Kubo, secretary  general of its biggest group, the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  as new chief cabinet secretary, who serves as chief spokesman  and chief of staff for the prime minister, the sources said.    Both houses of the Diet are expected to vote on a new prime  minister early next week after Hata returns home from an  international trade meeting in Morocco, they said.    Hata, who is the head of Shinseito, widely regarded as the  coalition's driving force, is tentatively scheduled to leave  Tokyo on Wednesday and return home Sunday.    The heads of three of the seven parties in the  eight-month-old coalition -- the SDP, new party Sakigake and the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) -- met late Tuesday to discuss  the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, who announced his  resignation last Friday.    During the meeting, SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama told DSP  chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura that  a plan has emerged to pick Hata as prime minister and Kubo as  chief cabinet secretary, coalition sources said.    Hata told a news conference Tuesday night that he places  importance on maintaining the framework of the coalition.    "During the past eight months, each of us was in a hard  position but could settle difficult problems," Hata said.    The coalition's compromise followed several rounds of secret  talks between Murayama and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa, a key coalition strategist, political sources said.    Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has given up the idea of leaving  the main opposition party and running for the premiership, LDP  sources said.    His decision followed the coalition agreement to maintain  unity.    Watanabe has failed to garner a sufficient number of  supporters from among LDP members, the sources said.    After attending Tuesday's meeting of representatives of  coalition components, SDP Secretary General Kubo said, "I'm  pretty sure we can solve our problems to maintain and develop  our coalition government."    Shinseito's Ozawa told reporters, "everything is going in  the  right direction."    The coalition had been on the brink of collapse, as  divisions  among the parties deepened after Hosokawa abruptly announced his  resignation.</p>

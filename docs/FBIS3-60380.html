			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Paula Ceccaldi: "A New Generation of Water </F> Treatment Plants"]    [Text] Space-saving, 10 times more efficient, 10 times  faster and what's more, European -- that is the definition of  the rapid waste water treatment process developed by the  Corporation for the Treatment and Economic Development of Water  [OTV], a subsidiary of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE].  The process is the result of the joint work done by its  research center and two European partners, one Danish and the  other Swiss.    Grassed over at Antibes, buried in Monaco in the basement of  an apartment block, or integrated into a building like at Cergy  (near Paris), the water treatment plant for the year 2000 is  already operational. The Cergy plant, designed to purify the  effluent of a town of 200,000 inhabitants, daily treats some  40,000 cubic meters of wastewater.    The standards laid out in the European wastewater directive  of 1991 set new limits for nitrogen con10t (less than 10 mg/l)  and phosphorus con10t (less than 1.5 mg/l) of urban wastewater,  and the conformity of treatment results -- 95 percent must  comply at any given time.    Existing processes could only achieve these results with  great difficulty. Firstly, it would be necessary to multiply by  at least four the surface area of existing plants operating  using activated sludge, such as the one at Acheres which treats  the wastewater of Paris and its region. This is unimaginable in  its urban location. Secondly, the control method would have to  be changed to a process of continual analysis: until now  results have been expressed as a daily average.    In 1990, in order to meet these new pollution removal  thresholds, the CGE (OTV and Anjou Research) teamed up for three  years in a Eureka [European scientific research program] project  with the Danish company Danfoss, specializing in sensors, and  with Eawag, the Swiss water institute, expert in modeling  bioprocesses applied to water.    Chris10ed Simbiose (scientific improvements of biofilters  and  sensors), the aim of this project was to reply to the European  water treatment standards with new, high-speed treatment  processes. Taking up only small areas, they would simplify the  integration of treatment plants in urban areas. Moreover, the  use of continuous sensors would make it possible to control the  system automatically and would give a water quality permanently  in line with the above- mentioned European standards. The total  cost of the project was 70 million French francs [Fr], Fr30  million of which came from France -- Fr20 million from the CGE  and 10 million from the French government. Frank Rogalla,  deputy director of the CGE's research center, noted with  satisfaction that "the program was completed in June 1993, and  most of the aims were met."  <H5>  Useful Experience Gained </H5>   To meet the esthetic requirements where the environment is  concerned and to resolve the problem of more restricted space in  and around towns, OTV had already implemented new pollution  removal systems. In this way the company acquired experience  with a process using fixed bacteria beds that concentrated the  biomass and thus removed the need for clarification equipment.  As early as 1982, its Biocarbone process had coupled biology  and phase separation in the same reactor. Here the biological  purification of water is done by downward percolation through a  fixed submerged bed, with air injected in the lower section.  Already five times smaller than traditional, activated sludge  reactors, it does however require two units for complete  purification of wastewater in accordance with the new nitrogen  removal standards -- one for the anoxic stage and the other for  the aerobic stage. It is also necessary to clean the filters  from time to time.  <H5>  The New Generation of Biofilters </H5>   The process developed in the Simbiose project, chris10ed  Biostyr, made the disadvantages of Biocarbone appear negligible.    Expanded polystyrene balls are used instead of the mineral  support. Since they float, they are kept down by a board.  Frank Rogalla stressed: "The choice of a synthetic material  enables us to retain tight control over the physical parameters  (density, granulometry, etc.) and to alter the selected  characteristics to suit the required treatment performance."    The pollution flows through the filter from bottom to top.  The wastewater is pumped to a higher level and injected in by  gravity flow. The two zones, aerobic and anoxic, are thus  brought together in the same reactor. The air is injected into  the middle of the bed, meaning that the anoxic zone is in the  lower section and the aerobic zone is in the upper section.  Backwashing by gravity flow is a sufficient washing technique.    Ten times less space is needed for this type of installation  than for a conventional plant. Re10tion time has also been  divided by 10, reduced from 24 hours to just two to three hours.  <H5>  Miniaturization of Sensors and Automated Control </H5>   This new generation of high-performance biofilters, however,  was just one part of the Simbiose project. The other two parts  dealt with sensors and the automated control of this new  generation of water treatment plant.    The sensor part was the responsibility of the Danish company  Danfoss. It was charged with designing equipment to continually  measure nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Work was based on  existing sensors using colorimetric methods, which Danfoss then  improved and miniaturized. A prototype sensor is now being  tested. The installations currently being produced by OTV will  use conventional sensors until the miniaturized versions become  available. Bioreactor and automated process management modeling  is still at the experimental stage.    The Simbiose project time has been ex10ded to ensure the  achievement of all the aims set out in 1990. The European  directive requires all existing installations and processes to  be brought in line with the standards, with all towns of more  than 2,000 inhabitants complying by 2005.</p>

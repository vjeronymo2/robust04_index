			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Carsberg to investigate island bus war Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, is to investigate claims that a company with a fleet of only two buses is attempting to drive a much larger company off an island by running services at a loss. The Office of Fair Trading is to spend six months looking into bus services on the island of Arran, off the Ayrshire coast, after a complaint by Western Scottish, a company based on the mainland, that the two buses of Arran Transport were running services in an anti-competitive manner. The bus wars on Arran, which has fewer than 3,000 inhabitants, began in 1992 after Western Scottish tendered successfully to operate bus services on the island with a subsidy from Strathclyde regional council. It moved on to the island and supplanted Arran Transport, which had operated bus services there since 1910. Arran Transport, however, carried on providing its peak-time services, registering them as unsubsidised services with the regional council and thereby obliging it to withdraw its subsidy on those services from Western Scottish. 'We had such a good response from the public that we had to go on running the services,' said Mr Bob Haddow, Arran Transport's managing director. 'We are not losing money on these services and we welcome the investigation.' Mr Alan Wilson, managing director of Western Scottish, says Arran Transport's buses start five minutes earlier than his own on the two principal routes, which start at Brodick, the main town and ferry terminal. Western Scottish has had to abandon some services because of the competition. The issue was referred to the OFT by Western Scottish in October 1992. If the allegations against Arran Transport were sustained and Arran Transport did not accept recommendations by the OFT, the matter could be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'What is happening here is what is going on all over Britain but in microcosm,' said Mr Haddow. 'It's about the threat that big companies can roll up small ones so that the small firm goes out of business. Then the big ones put up their fares.' As for operating buses five minutes ahead of the Western Scottish services, he says: 'When the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry arrives at the pier in Brodick and everyone gets off there isn't any point hanging about.'</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business, Press Review: Long haul in the spice trade - Clive Fewins on the slow growth of Fox's and its strategy for showing its wares SPICES bring variety to the life of the Pester family. When Mike Pester, now 59, bought the loss-making Fox's spices for a Pounds 200 25 years ago he inherited a business that owned one ageing Renault 4 van, sold a small range of herbs and spices, and had a trading loss of Pounds 25,000. 'It was a marvellous time to buy,' said Pester. 'The tax credit kept the Inland Revenue off my back for the first few years, I was gradually able to buy stock from the former parent company, and the van stayed on the road for another three years.' At the time Pester was a salesman with the now defunct Cavenham Foods. Fox's spices, was part of the group's German operation. Nowadays 'Mr Fox' as Pester is known throughout the trade, controls a company with nearly 400 product lines, 1,000 retail outlets, a workforce of 35, a fleet of 17 vehicles, and a turnover of just under Pounds 1m. Fox's name is most in the public eye at large agricultural and other shows. Its wares can be sniffed out by foodies at some 50 shows, including The Royal Show and the Ideal Home Exhibition. Forty per cent of sales come from shows. The rest come from mail order, the trade, and retail sales. Pester decided on the show policy in 1971. 'It was simple really,' he said. 'We found the sales of spices and herbs slumped in the summer because people refrained from eating heavier cooked meals and ate salads instead. At the time we had no product answer. 'But by selling at low prices direct to the public at shows we found the supplies they bought from us lasted a whole year and our loyal customers returned, rather than buying at inflated prices from their local supermarket in the interim period.' The move into shows was the start of a period of expansion that has continued in spite of the recession. 'If anything the recession has done us good. More people are eating at home and using herbs and spices to make cheaper cuts of meat more interesting,' Pester said. He also thinks that entry into the European Community in 1973 aided business. 'Food prices went up and the English housewife was forced to do what her continental equivalent had been doing for years - making cheaper meats more tasty by the use of herbs and spices.' At the same time there was the large increase in the popularity of ethnic foods - both in restaurants and at home. Pester supplies herbs and spices to many of the shops and restaurants opened by Asian immigrants in Britain in the last 20 years. The expansion of the company, which is jointly controlled by Pester, his wife Fay and son Andrew, 31, has been steady but unspectacular. All this will change in May, when Fox's moves from the former village garage at Wilmcote, Warwickshire that has been home for the past 17 years, to a new headquarters in nearby Stratford-on- Avon. The 12,000 sq ft former printworks will give Fox's four times the space it has in Wilmcote. Nearly all the extra space will be used because Pester plans to expand into 'wet mixes' or pastes. This will create at least half a dozen jobs. Wet mixes will mean more raw materials arriving in huge sacks from the spice merchants which supply Fox's, but they will also mean a big saving on the 30 or so lines that the company buys ready mixed from a Dutch supplier. These lines consist of bumbus, for cooking Indonesian dishes, and sambals, an Indonesian chili relish. An old Indonesian friend of Pester's, John Stekkinger, who works in the Netherlands, will be on loan for a few weeks to help commission equipment and to work on the new mixes. The cost of importing heavy, ready-mixed spices is high. It is also expensive to mail the wet mixes in glass jars and these can break. Fox's post the sambals and sauces in glass jars but Pester and his team are looking at other methods, such as the plastic vacuum packs for mailing the mixtures. 'The gains from the expansion will rapidly pay off the cost of the bridging loan we took out at the end of last year to cover the period between the purchase of the new building and the eventual sale of the Wilmcote premises,' he said. 'Making everything we sell is the obvious way to go. In addition it gives us better quality control and more chance to develop new lines and means of presentation, notably converting some of the dry mixes, for which we have a excellent reputation, into wet mixes.' Novel methods of exploiting the mail order market will be the other top priority in the new building. 'We have three representatives more or less permanently on the road in vans and estate cars,' Pester said. 'Delivering a small order to a far-flung place can be uneconomic, so we plan to make more use of professional carriers and to use our sales force more to develop accounts with large caterers and public bodies. 'Combined with the greater space available to expand our mail order section this is the way we see the business going for the next few years.'

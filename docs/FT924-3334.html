			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Treasury calls in a clutch of flamboyant forecasters SOME of the best-known and most controversial economists in the country join the panel which will advise Mr John Major and his ministers about economic forecasting. One of them, Professor Patrick Minford is on the record as saying that the Treasury has 'lost its grasp' of economic principles. The creation of the panel of seven is part of an attempt to improve the accuracy of the Treasury's forecasts and to open up its forecasting activities to the scrutiny of outsiders. Panel members will not just give views on how they think the economy will perform. They will also be invited to comment on detailed policy matters. Peter Marsh profiles the panel's members. Prof Wynne Godley, Professor of Applied Economics at Cambridge University Has since the 1970s predicted long-term problems for the UK economy arising from weakness in manufacturing and tendency for UK to suffer large current-account deficits. Nicknamed 'Gloomy Boots' by students, his lectures can sometimes be hard to understand. His forecast in May 1991 that the UK economy would contract by 2.7 per cent last year and by a further 0.9 per cent this year has turned out more accurate that any other projection by a mainstream British economist. Andrew Sentance, economics director, Confederation of British Industry At 34, the youngest member of the forecasting panel. Has worked for six years in CBI's economics department; noted for his ruminative style but not the most scintillating public speaker. Did his doctorate at London School of Economics on 'government as an employer'. Before that was management trainee at National Coal Board, and a manager at a petrol station. Has led CBI research in past two years on putting the case for more government action to help manufacturing. Also an expert on government statistics. Prof Patrick Minford, Professor of Applied Economics at Liverpool University Former Treasury economist and another member of the monetarist Liverpool Six. Like Congdon, scornful of Treasury performance in analysing the economy but disagrees with him about the correct way to measure the money supply. Ardent free-market thinker who says he would have liked to have been Gladstone, the tariff-cutting 19th-century UK chancellor. More accurate than most economists in recognising early on the extent of the recession, was not particularly prescient in warning of the late 1980s boom. Andrew Britton, director, National Institute of Economic and Social Research Thoughtful though dour economist who for past 10 years has headed what is probably Britain's best-known economic forecasting organisation outside the Treasury. Interested in important though not always fashionable areas such as factory training. Worked for Treasury for 16 years until taking up job at institute. Not afraid to criticise Treasury; thinks it should be split into two to separate public spending and economic policy roles. Patchy forecasting record. He is now among the relative optimists about UK economic growth next year. Prof Tim Congdon, managing director, Lombard Street Research Former journalist on The Times who has shot to prominence in recent years for espousing monetarist theories and fierce criticism of Treasury's economic analysis. Started forecasting in mid 1980s with London stockbroker L. Messel, and warned correctly of high inflation in late 1980s as a result of housing boom. Over past three years has turned out trenchant comments about economic scene under the banner of his own independent economic research body. Member of Liverpool Six, monetarists who campaigned for UK to leave the EMS. Prof David Currie, head of economic forecasting, London Business School. Well-connected economist who in mid 1980s informally advised Mr Roy Hattersley, then Labour shadow chancellor. Has advised the Treasury, Bank of England and International Monetary Fund and is now in fifth year of running LBS's economic forecasting unit. In recent years LBS's forecasting record has been poor, although it is thought the inclusion of Currie in the panel and its exposure to competitive forces in the forecasting business might sharpen performance. On good terms with Sir Terry Burns and Professor Alan Budd of the Treasury. Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist, Goldman Sachs The thinking person's economist; former Downing Street adviser in 1970s Labour government; has since made his fortune in the City with one of the world's top-rated investment banks. Rarely at a loss for a cogent phrase on the economy, Davies is one of the slickest performers in the forecasting community and is highly rated in the Treasury. Was too quick to forecast an imminent recovery at the end of last year; now reckons demand picking up but likely recovery next year will probably be patchy. Sees opportunities for further cuts in interest rates.</p>

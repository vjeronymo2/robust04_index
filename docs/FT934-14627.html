			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BSM comes to market with Pounds 47m valuation BSM GROUP, owner of the British School of Motoring, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 170p, which will give the company a market capitalisation of just over Pounds 47m. Half the total of 19.83m ordinary 10p shares on offer will be placed with institutions, with the remainder offered through intermediaries. The flotation will raise a net Pounds 32.1m for the company. Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said the flotation would clear debts incurred in the management buy-out of 1990 and leave the company ungeared. It would then be able to take advantage of good growth prospects and expand. The group, currently in the middle of its first television advertising programme for 10 years, believes there is pent up demand for driving lessons after three years of recession. It also expects further growth to follow legislative changes and a rising population of 17-year-olds. It also expects to expand its health and safety division, which provides training for company car drivers, and MCR, its vehicle repair business. These two divisions account for about 10 per cent of total turnover. A pro forma balance sheet at July 2 shows the group with net assets of Pounds 2.19m after taking the flotation into account, compared with net liabilities of Pounds 30.3m before the flotation. British School of Motoring is one of the largest franchisers in the UK and claims 15 per cent of the driving school market. It operates through 134 branches from Aberdeen to Plymouth, and has 2,000 self-employed instructors whose cars cover 1m miles a week. It is forecasting operating profits of Pounds 4.55m for the 1993 year, up from Pounds 4.11m, on turnover of Pounds 21m. The notional net dividend is 5.78p, giving a notional gross yield at the issue price of 4.25 per cent. The prospectus also shows that the group expects a 75 per cent tax charge for 1993. This is a one-off charge arising mainly from planning measures being taken in relation to capital allowances on the tuition vehicle fleet. Next year tax should drop to 25 per cent. After the flotation the directors, including non-executives, will have 1.7 per cent of the company, Deutsche Bank (Morgan Grenfell Group) 7.6 per cent and Sir Anthony Jacobs, the previous owner, 4.5 per cent. A further 3.6 per cent of the shares will be available under priority arrangements to employees and instructors. The placing and intermediaries offer was arranged by Morgan Grenfell. Dealings in the shares begin on October 27. COMMENT priced, reflecting the management's need to get rid of the debt before it can take the business forward. The prize asset is the brand name, which gives it a national profile. There is probably a good deal of potential demand for driving lessons following the recession, but while BSM's prices tend to be a benchmark for the rest of the industry, they are at the top of the range in a market which is very easy to enter, and people with little money to spend may well go for smaller, local operators. In the longer term the AA, which operates 500 driving school cars, will keep up the competitive pressure. The 1993 notional yield of 4.25 per cent is only just above the market average and the p/e, disallowing the big tax charge, is about 15. Not a lot to get excited about, but more than 70 per cent of the shares will be in the market, giving good liquidity.</p>

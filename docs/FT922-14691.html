			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Disclosures stir Gooda controversy: Richard Lapper on the troubles of a former syndicate at Lloyd's LLOYD'S of London has again found itself at the centre of controversy this week with the disclosure of possible irregularities at some of the market's worst affected insurance syndicates. Evidence gathered by Mr Kenneth Randall, a former head of regulatory services at Lloyd's, indicates that between 1981 and 1988 the Gooda Walker agency may have overstated the profits of its syndicates and, in 1991, failed to disclose reinsurance transactions to its auditors. Until its liquidation Gooda Walker managed eight Lloyd's syndicates. The syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance business and in 1989 and 1990 delivered some of the worst losses in Lloyd's recent history. In 1989 losses exceeded Pounds 200m. Some of the syndicates' Names are among more than 800 who are seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on their deposits in order to fund the losses. The case, in which the Names are represented by Michael Freeman &amp; Co, began on Tuesday but was adjourned by Mr Justice Saville after receipt of the affidavit containing details of Mr Randall's findings. Mr Randall's investigation is being conducted on behalf of GW Run-Off, the agency set up to administer Gooda affairs last October. The investigation centres on the use of time and distance (T&amp;D) insurance - an insurance policy resembling a banking arrangement used by many Lloyd's syndicates to fund known future losses. The 38-page affidavit details a number of concerns. Between 1981 and 1988 the profits of syndicate 290, the biggest of the eight syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, may have been overstated as a result of the use of T&amp;D policies. Mr Randall's preliminary analysis of audited accounts for the period showed that gains from T&amp;D policies contributed Pounds 23.8m of the syndicate's total profits of Pounds 32.16m (after personal expenses). He calculated that the profit commission charged to Names 'which could be regarded as attributable to profits generated from the use of time and distance policies' amounted to more than Pounds 3.6m. The profits arise because the difference between the premium paid to the reinsurer and the limits of indemnity - the amount the reinsurer agrees to pay in claims at an agreed future date - must be regarded as a gain at the time of purchase. The amounts gained are offset by the cost of T&amp;D premiums themselves as well as additional investment income that would otherwise have accrued. Mr Randall said that his analysis had raised a number of questions that warranted further investigation. They include the issue of whether the dates selected for recoveries under the policies inflated the profits of the syndicate. In addition, Mr Randall is concerned to examine the impact of the deals on the syndicate's liquidity. Mr Randall's investigation also shows that information about the commutation  -or early cashing in of T&amp;Ds - may not have reached the syndicates' auditors, Littlejohn Frazer. The years 1988, 1989 and 1990 were bad for Gooda Walker as losses mounted from catastrophes such as hurricane Hugo in September 1989 and the European storms of January 1990. By April last year, cashflow difficulties were particularly serious. Mr Randall said the agency's management asked its reinsurers, the Bermuda-based Pinnacle, to commute six T&amp;D policies. Commuting the policies, which protected the exposures of syndicate 290, realised about Pounds 27m. Mr Randall said that syndicate auditors confirmed that they were unaware that the four policies had been cancelled. 'The syndicate auditors . . . inspected a number of time and distance policy documents prior to the completion of their audit. They state that they were shown the original policy documents of the four policies which had in fact been commuted on 2 April 1991.' Subsequently in June 1991 syndicate 298 also found itself in cashflow difficulties. Four further T&amp;D polices - benefiting three other Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 90 and 295 - were commuted in order to put syndicate 298 in funds.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- IMPACT OF TIME AND DISTANCE POLICIES ON RESULTS OF SYNDICATE 290  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year of       Syndicate   Profit after        T&amp;D        Profit per account        capacity       personal    benefit      pounds10,000                               expenses      taken            traded               (poundsm)      (poundsm)  (poundsm)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1981              5.135          1.994       3.21             3,800 1982               6.15          1.379         -              2,243 1983              8.135          0.988      1.351             1,214 1984             13.485          1.277         -                947 1985             25.295          3.066      7.891             1,212 1986             37.725          8.118      4.585             2,178 1987             48.165          4.412      5.766               916 1988             69.746         10.929      0.997             1,567  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Randall affidavit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SCRIPT FOR AN ADVANCE BY U.S.  </P> <P> To have a chance to become one of four third-place teams advancing to the  second round of the World Cup, the United States must beat Austria by at least  three goals tonight in a Group A game in Florence.  </P> <P> But that is not all.  </P> <P> Entering Monday night, the United States needed any two of the following five  developments in the final week of first-round games:  </P> <P> Group B, Monday -- At least a 3-0 victory by Argentina over Romania in Naples  and a two-goal loss by Cameroon to the Soviet Union in Bari. Cameroon lost,  4-0, but Argentina and Romania tied, 1-1.  </P> <P> Group C, Wednesday -- At least 2-0 victories by Brazil over Scotland in Turin  and Sweden over Costa Rica in Genoa.  </P> <P> Group D, Tuesday -- At least a 3-0 victory by West Germany over Colombia in  Milan.  </P> <P> Group E, Thursday -- A South Korea-Uruguay tie in Udine.  </P> <P> Group F, Thursday -- At least 2-0 victories by England over Egypt in Cagliari  and the Netherlands over Ireland in Palermo.  </P> <P> Shutouts are important in games indicated because goals scored is the second  tiebreaker. The first tiebreaker is goal differential. All 12 first- and  second-place teams in the six groups advance. RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

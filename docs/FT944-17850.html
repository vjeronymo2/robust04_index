			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / People: Le May returns to London and joins UBS Malcolm Le May, 36, co-head of BZW's US merchant banking business, is returning to London and joining UBS to head its European corporate finance team. Le May, an accountant who has worked for Drexel Burnham Lambert Securities and Morgan Grenfell, joined BZW four years ago and moved to New York early last year as co-head of merchant banking in New York. His departure comes only a few months after BZW appointed Ian Peacock, 46, who had been 19 years with Kleinwort Benson, as the other co-head of merchant banking in NY. UBS, which claims to rank in the top five for all Euro-equity related issues, has around 140 people involved in corporate finance in London and another 40 in Zurich. David Robins, chief executive of UBS in London, says Le May has been recruited for his 'transatlantic capability'. Le May, who will be a vice-chairman of UBS in London, replaces Stephen Brisby, 43, an ex-Schroders merchant banker, who was appointed head of business development for UBS in Europe.</p>

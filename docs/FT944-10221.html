			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cookson makes Pounds 10m German acquisition Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, yesterday aimed to strengthen electronics operations in continental Europe by taking full control of Alpha Grillo, its German joint venture. Cookson paid Pounds 10.4m to buy the remaining 50 per cent of Alpha Grillo, which is the leading German producer of solders and fluxes, from the Metallgesellschaft subsidiary Grillo Werke. Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said: 'By gaining full operational control of Alpha Grillo, we are able to capitalise more effectively on the potential that exists within the German and eastern European markets.' Alpha Grillo would provide Alpha Fry with an important springboard for expansion into developing markets such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Russia, he added. Alpha Fry forms part of the group's electronics materials side, which contributed 33 per cent of Cookson's Pounds 111m operating profit last year. It is now expected to help improve product development and distribution at the German company. The acquisition, which is to be funded from existing facilities, follows a joint venture with Thyssen of Germany to manufacture and supply central and eastern Europe with special refractories and systems used in the steel continuous casting process. It also forms part of a strategy of withdrawing from non-core businesses, which led to the disposal of 25 engineering subsidiaries in March.</p>

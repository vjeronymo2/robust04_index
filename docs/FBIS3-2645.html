			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], March 11 (XINHUA) -- The Myanmar  [Burma] government is opposed to the U.S. Senate's decision on  establishment of "Radio Free Asia," saying that it is just to  try to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries  including Myanmar, an official report said here today.    it is the first time that the Myanmar government expresses  its concern over the U.S. Senate decision on February 2 to  establish "Radio Free Asia," a broadcasting service covering  China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cambodia,  Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.    Director-general of the political department of the Myanmar  Ministry of Foreign Affairs has of late invited the charge  d'affaires of the United States Embassy to Myanmar to the  ministry and conveyed Myanmar's "deep regret" that such a  decision had been taken.    The director-general said that if "Radio Free Asia" should  become operational and Myanmar is targeted, "it could in no way  be considered constructive or promoting the development of good  relations between Myanmar and the U.S."</p>

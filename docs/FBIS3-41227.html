			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Quito--Police Lieutenant Alfredo Jativa Sotomayor,  arrested for his direct connection with the "Azteca" money  laundering group, was paid $400 for each suitcase containing  hundreds of thousands of drug dollars coming from Mexico and  Colombia. This money entered Ecuador without any control,  according to the Interpol report on the activities in Ecuador of  the Colombian Montenegro Freire gang, which has been broken up  by the police.    According to investigations into the participation of two  police officers in the money launderers' illicit activities,  Jativa Sotomayor not only received the "fee" listed above, which  was arranged in advance, but every so often he also received  special bonus payments from the leader of the criminal  organization, Humberto Montenegro Freire, who often came to  Ecuador to monitor his illegal business ventures, in which his  siblings, Fernando Javier, Juan Carlos, Liana Elizabeth, and  Maria Cecilia Montenegro Freire, were also involved.    To carry out his task, this officer had the services of  Quito  customs appraiser Victor Hugo Valdiviezo, best known by his  nickname of "Tocayo," who was also paid large amounts of money  in dollars to avoid customs inspections. This man is now a  fugitive.  <H5>  Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars </H5>   It is estimated that in the last two years the Colombian  drug  dealers paid the lieutenant more than $50,000 to allow this  dirty money to enter freely, which "was coming in growing  amounts with great frequency. It was hundreds of thousands of  dollars," says the police report.    Two months ago Jativa was paid $7,000, which he used to buy  a  Hyundai Pony from the "Autos y Carros" dealership owned by the  now arrested Montenegro Freire family.    On an earlier occasion, drug dealer Humberto Montenegro gave  a pistol and a collection of dollars to Jessica Menendez, the  officer's wife.    Finally, Jativa somehow learned of "Operation Azteca" and  decided to extort $10,000 from the drug dealers, supposedly to  halt the investigation.  <H5>  Protection </H5>   According to the investigations, it is possible that the  police officers who have been arrested may also have provided  protection to the money launderers' business activities by  passing on material intended solely for police use, for which it  is assumed that they were paid.    At the "Autos y Carros" dealership the police found three  teargas canisters of the 515 CS type, two Stun grenades, a  Truflite carbine teargas canister, and a handgrenade simulator.  At the house at 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto, where 11 of the  persons implicated in the "Azteca" group were arrested, another  teargas canister was found. All these items are intended solely  for police use.  <H5>  Accomplices </H5>   The other officer, Second Lieutenant Wilson Marcelo Salgado  Guzman, was apprehended during the night of Tuesday, 28 December  at the Montenegros' residence. The report states that he was a  close friend of the family and knew of their illegal activities.  He was the person responsible for the removal of the suitcases  containing dirty money. He also accompanied the local head of  the group, Fernando Montenegro, on two trips to Colombia to  bring in contraband merchandise.    When he was on guard duty, he even allowed Fernando  Montenegro access to the San Antonio Hacienda near Santo Domingo  de los Colorados, confiscated from Jorge Hugo Reyes Torres.    He also kept in his possession a 9-mm pistol that Fernando  Montenegro gave him.    Captain Fernando Navarro, as a loan, received a  chrome-plated  9-mm Baretta from the local head of the "Azteca" group. He kept  this weapon for nine months, and only returned it in response to  pressure from a superior officer, whose name was not released.    Concerning this officer, the report says: "Navarro knew that  Fernando Montenegro had this weapon in his possession and did  nothing about it, thus failing to fulfill his legal obligation."</p>
